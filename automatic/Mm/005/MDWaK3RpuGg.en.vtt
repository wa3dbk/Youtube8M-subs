how strong speaking much bigs I mean

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.130 
how strong speaking much bigs I mean
he's<00:00:37.620> coming<00:00:38.040> he's<00:00:38.160> probably<00:00:38.309> being<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:39.140> can't

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
think of a left path he's probably

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.950 
think of a left path he's probably
performed<00:00:41.399> better<00:00:41.520> than<00:00:41.640> I'm<00:00:41.850> just<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.899> know

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.260 
performed better than I'm just you know
this<00:00:43.200> stage<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.620> season<00:00:43.770> really<00:00:44.239> so<00:00:45.239> just

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
this stage of the season really so just

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.209 
this stage of the season really so just
you<00:00:46.050> know<00:00:46.140> go<00:00:46.289> watch<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.860> game<00:00:46.890> somebody

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
you know go watch the game somebody

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.560 
you know go watch the game somebody
wondering<00:00:47.700> what<00:00:47.789> they've<00:00:47.940> got<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.180> left<00:00:48.360> back

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
wondering what they've got it left back

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.209 
wondering what they've got it left back
then<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:49.110> know<00:00:49.200> if<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.649> can't<00:00:49.920> get<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.160> the

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
then you know if you can't get in the

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.979 
then you know if you can't get in the
squad<00:00:50.520> boy<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.969> think<00:00:51.420> he<00:00:51.480> keeps<00:00:51.690> performing

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
squad boy I think he keeps performing

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.450 
squad boy I think he keeps performing
the<00:00:52.230> way<00:00:52.320> he<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.530> I'm<00:00:52.920> sure<00:00:52.980> he'll<00:00:53.340> have<00:00:53.370> a

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
the way he is I'm sure he'll have a

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.459 
the way he is I'm sure he'll have a
chance<00:00:53.520> for<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.030> girls<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.780> summer<00:00:54.960> you

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
chance for the girls in the summer you

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.990 
chance for the girls in the summer you
surprised<00:00:55.860> babies<00:00:56.250> not<00:00:56.370> got<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.640> call<00:00:56.820> here

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
surprised babies not got the call here

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.639 
surprised babies not got the call here
well<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.480> think<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.840> just<00:00:57.870> look<00:00:58.140> at<00:00:58.289> Spain<00:00:58.530> over

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
well I think you just look at Spain over

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.410 
well I think you just look at Spain over
the<00:00:58.770> last<00:00:58.859> couple<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.129> years<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.489> mean<00:00:59.609> very

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
the last couple of years I mean very

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.760 
the last couple of years I mean very
difficult<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.899> break<00:01:01.020> into<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.320> group<00:01:01.620> isn't

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
difficult to break into that group isn't

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.410 
difficult to break into that group isn't
it<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.609> suppose<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:03.059> everybody's

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
it and and I suppose of everybody's

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.570 
it and and I suppose of everybody's
you've<00:01:03.989> been<00:01:04.170> with<00:01:04.320> Newcastle<00:01:04.680> which<00:01:05.070> wasn't

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
you've been with Newcastle which wasn't

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.179 
you've been with Newcastle which wasn't
probably<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.180> most<00:01:06.770> high-profile<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.920> clubs

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
probably the most high-profile of clubs

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.890 
probably the most high-profile of clubs
which<00:01:08.490> wouldn't<00:01:08.939> have<00:01:09.060> done<00:01:09.210> him<00:01:09.299> any<00:01:09.360> favors

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
which wouldn't have done him any favors

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.870 
which wouldn't have done him any favors
I<00:01:10.020> think<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.979> fact<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.159> he's<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:11.340> Liverpool

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
I think the fact that he's in Liverpool

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.640 
I think the fact that he's in Liverpool
now<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.360> obviously<00:01:12.990> he<00:01:13.260> gets<00:01:13.439> more

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
now that obviously he gets more

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.560 
now that obviously he gets more
attention<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.060> he<00:01:15.119> comes<00:01:15.299> into<00:01:15.450> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
attention and it and he comes into the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.399 
attention and it and he comes into the
spotlight

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
spotlight

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.410 
spotlight
a<00:01:16.439> lot<00:01:16.890> more<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.460> he<00:01:17.820> has<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.090> better<00:01:18.299> chance

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
a lot more so he has a better chance

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.929 
a lot more so he has a better chance
being<00:01:18.900> at<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.080> at<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.740> huge<00:01:20.159> club<00:01:20.400> like<00:01:20.549> Liverpool

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
being at a at a huge club like Liverpool

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.800 
being at a at a huge club like Liverpool
but<00:01:21.409> Spain<00:01:22.409> have<00:01:22.500> been<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:22.860> strong<00:01:23.220> it's<00:01:23.810> yeah

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
but Spain have been so strong it's yeah

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.710 
but Spain have been so strong it's yeah
I<00:01:24.990> did<00:01:25.350> but<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.560> think<00:01:26.159> that's<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.030> you

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
I did but I think that's that is you

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.880 
I did but I think that's that is you
know<00:01:27.810> Spain<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> great<00:01:28.320> team<00:01:28.500> but<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.740> weak

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
know Spain a great team but the weak

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.370 
know Spain a great team but the weak

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
position is left mark yeah the same as

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.710 
position is left mark yeah the same as
the<00:01:34.470> rest<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.740> them<00:01:34.860> for<00:01:35.040> me<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.549> think<00:01:36.210> he<00:01:36.360> I

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
the rest of them for me and I think he I

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.030 
the rest of them for me and I think he I
think<00:01:36.869> that's<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.170> position<00:01:37.500> that's<00:01:37.619> that's

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
think that's a position that's that's

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.340 
think that's a position that's that's
you<00:01:38.700> know<00:01:38.820> not<00:01:39.420> for<00:01:39.630> gravity<00:01:39.990> yeah<00:01:40.140> yeah

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
you know not for gravity yeah yeah

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.600 
you know not for gravity yeah yeah
basically<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.860> think<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.159> way<00:01:41.250> he's<00:01:41.369> playing

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
basically I think the way he's playing

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.960 
basically I think the way he's playing
at<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.850> top<00:01:42.060> club<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.509> think<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.899> think<00:01:43.680> he's

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
at a top club and I think I think he's

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.100 
at a top club and I think I think he's
yeah<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.149> kept<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.420> group<00:01:45.630> together<00:01:45.780> though

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
yeah you kept that group together though

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.440 
yeah you kept that group together though
I<00:01:46.140> mean<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.369> group<00:01:47.549> has<00:01:47.700> not<00:01:47.850> changed<00:01:48.299> at

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
I mean that the group has not changed at

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.499 
I mean that the group has not changed at
all<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.869> mean<00:01:49.040> so<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.030> hard<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.329> break<00:01:51.450> into

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
all I mean so it is hard to break into

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.480 
all I mean so it is hard to break into
something<00:01:52.110> one<00:01:52.229> that's<00:01:52.470> going<00:01:52.619> really<00:01:52.860> well

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
something one that's going really well

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.549 
something one that's going really well
