00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.460
 walk in pdf 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:19.250
 this format opens almost 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.929
 any modern computers even 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:26.119
 so let's say I do not know such computers 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:31.149
 who don't read this format now I 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:36.379
 I will reduce the page so that you can 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:41.720
 from afar look at them immediately this one 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:44.290
 project this directory is 67 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.290
 of projects 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.989
 project divided inside this directory 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.230
 On small under the catalog for convenience 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.780
 orienteering for example here is a resting place 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:09.330
 and then went projects related to 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:14.909
 place of rest in this way you can or 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:17.759
 watch the project from the computer to study well 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.330
 in fact it is also convenient as in 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:27.560
 no restrictions 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:27.560
 You can take any file to increase it 5 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:38.610
 to the size we need here please 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.090
 visualization landing plan all sizes 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.190
 nina 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.850
 the explication says what and how much 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:51.090
 need to plant 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.729
 area balance and this section 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.149
 more suitable for designers here 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.579
 you can already enter cost estimates 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.979
 how much will planting material cost 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.380
 worth the landing itself extra 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.750
 materials 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:13.230
 extra work now when 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:15.420
 chewing we can print at least the whole 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.130
 project on this case he will now 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.120
 print 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.120
 here is the current project 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:14.360
 Now I want to show you here we are ours 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.280
 catalogs printed and collected in such 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.600
 daddy 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:25.130
 But with such a folder, our designers ride 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:30.410
 and customer show explain very 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:33.440
 convenient client to see visually what where 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:39.160
