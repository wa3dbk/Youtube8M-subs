32<00:02:33.090> gigabytes<00:02:33.750> now<00:02:34.590> not<00:02:34.830> all<00:02:34.860> memory<00:02:35.340> cards

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
32 gigabytes now not all memory cards

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.970 
32 gigabytes now not all memory cards
are<00:02:35.850> created<00:02:36.330> equal<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:37.560> get<00:02:37.740> different

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
are created equal you get different

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.190 
are created equal you get different
memory<00:02:38.490> cards<00:02:38.820> to<00:02:38.880> different<00:02:39.270> specifications

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
memory cards to different specifications

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.320 
memory cards to different specifications
so<00:02:41.040> you're<00:02:41.190> probably<00:02:41.340> best<00:02:41.850> going<00:02:42.090> for<00:02:42.270> the

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
so you're probably best going for the

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.240 
so you're probably best going for the
highest<00:02:42.750> spec<00:02:43.020> cards<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:43.710> are<00:02:43.830> made<00:02:43.980> by<00:02:44.190> the

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
highest spec cards that are made by the

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.610 
highest spec cards that are made by the
manufacturers<00:02:45.090> out<00:02:45.270> there<00:02:45.330> read<00:02:46.290> what<00:02:46.500> the

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
manufacturers out there read what the

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.160 
manufacturers out there read what the
specs<00:02:46.920> are<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:47.550> know<00:02:47.760> for<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.360> fact<00:02:48.600> that<00:02:48.750> some<00:02:49.050> of

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
specs are I know for a fact that some of

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.590 
specs are I know for a fact that some of
the<00:02:49.290> cards<00:02:49.590> are<00:02:49.740> much<00:02:49.920> faster<00:02:50.160> than<00:02:50.520> others<00:02:50.880> so

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
the cards are much faster than others so

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.270 
the cards are much faster than others so
really<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.230> faster<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.740> card<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.100> better

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
really the faster the card the better

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:24.200 
really the faster the card the better
the<00:02:53.460> performance

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.270
