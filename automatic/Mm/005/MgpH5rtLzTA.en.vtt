all right so today we're going to be
talking<00:00:01.800> about<00:00:01.979> deciduous<00:00:02.909> conifers<00:00:03.950> now

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
talking about deciduous conifers now

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.430 
talking about deciduous conifers now
first<00:00:05.640> question<00:00:05.790> you<00:00:06.240> might<00:00:06.270> ask<00:00:06.420> is<00:00:06.899> what<00:00:07.259> is

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
first question you might ask is what is

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.950 
first question you might ask is what is
a<00:00:07.470> deciduous<00:00:07.950> conifer<00:00:08.760> well<00:00:09.450> it's<00:00:09.750> a

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
a deciduous conifer well it's a

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.620 
a deciduous conifer well it's a
coniferous<00:00:10.889> tree<00:00:11.309> that's<00:00:11.639> also<00:00:11.969> deciduous

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
coniferous tree that's also deciduous

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.890 
coniferous tree that's also deciduous
now<00:00:13.380> what<00:00:13.559> does<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:13.710> mean<00:00:14.130> well<00:00:14.940> it's<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.509> tree

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
now what does that mean well it's a tree

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.040 
now what does that mean well it's a tree
that<00:00:16.350> looks<00:00:16.710> sort<00:00:17.010> of<00:00:17.100> like<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.279> pine<00:00:17.609> tree<00:00:18.050> an

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
that looks sort of like a pine tree an

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.509 
that looks sort of like a pine tree an
evergreen<00:00:19.590> tree<00:00:20.240> it<00:00:21.240> produces<00:00:21.840> cones<00:00:22.519> like

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
evergreen tree it produces cones like

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.640 
evergreen tree it produces cones like
pine<00:00:23.850> cones<00:00:24.269> but<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.689> course<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.439> wouldn't<00:00:25.590> be

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
pine cones but of course it wouldn't be

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.839 
pine cones but of course it wouldn't be
pine<00:00:25.949> cones<00:00:26.449> it<00:00:27.449> either<00:00:27.599> be<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:28.260> large<00:00:29.070> cone<00:00:29.550> or

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
pine cones it either be a large cone or

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.759 
pine cones it either be a large cone or
dawn<00:00:30.090> redwood<00:00:30.359> cone

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
dawn redwood cone

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.040 
dawn redwood cone
so<00:00:32.669> they<00:00:32.790> produce<00:00:33.000> cones<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.809> they're<00:00:33.899> also

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
so they produce cones and they're also

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.560 
so they produce cones and they're also
deciduous<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:35.309> even<00:00:35.880> though<00:00:35.969> they<00:00:36.120> look<00:00:36.360> like

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
deciduous so even though they look like

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.830 
deciduous so even though they look like
an<00:00:36.809> evergreen<00:00:37.170> tree<00:00:37.640> all<00:00:38.640> these<00:00:38.940> needles<00:00:39.600> they

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
an evergreen tree all these needles they

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.889 
an evergreen tree all these needles they
actually<00:00:40.260> turn<00:00:40.559> yellow<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.610> orange<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.540> they

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
actually turn yellow and orange and they

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.990 
actually turn yellow and orange and they
fall<00:00:43.200> off<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.680> tree<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.160> wintertime<00:00:44.489> so

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
fall off the tree in the wintertime so

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.650 
fall off the tree in the wintertime so
it's<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.809> very<00:00:46.340> rare<00:00:47.340> unique<00:00:47.940> tree<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.480> work

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
it's a very rare unique tree to work

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.520 
it's a very rare unique tree to work
with<00:00:48.950> there's<00:00:49.950> some<00:00:50.160> fantastic<00:00:51.079> shape<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.410> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
with there's some fantastic shape to the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.150 
with there's some fantastic shape to the
needles<00:00:54.350> whenever<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.440> think<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:55.920> dawn

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
needles whenever I think of this dawn

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.180 
needles whenever I think of this dawn
redwood<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.789> kind<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.120> always<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.960> know<00:00:58.190> look

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
redwood it kind of always you know look

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.700 
redwood it kind of always you know look
at<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.430> foliage<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.719> kind<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.289> think<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.649> a

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
at the foliage I kind of think of a

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.020 
at the foliage I kind of think of a
mixture<00:01:02.100> between<00:01:02.449> a<00:01:03.449> pine<00:01:04.290> tree<00:01:04.460> palm<00:01:05.460> tree<00:01:05.970> in

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
mixture between a pine tree palm tree in

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.929 
mixture between a pine tree palm tree in
the<00:01:06.150> deciduous<00:01:06.720> tree<00:01:07.049> it's<00:01:07.950> got<00:01:08.159> very<00:01:08.490> kind<00:01:08.820> of

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
the deciduous tree it's got very kind of

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.990 
the deciduous tree it's got very kind of
a<00:01:09.020> palm<00:01:10.020> tree<00:01:10.049> like<00:01:10.799> foliage<00:01:11.159> when<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.820> look

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
a palm tree like foliage when you look

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.090 
a palm tree like foliage when you look
up<00:01:12.180> close<00:01:12.210> kind<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.930> like<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.110> palm<00:01:13.380> tree<00:01:13.409> leaf

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
up close kind of like a palm tree leaf

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.560 
up close kind of like a palm tree leaf
but<00:01:14.729> then<00:01:14.850> when<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.060> look<00:01:15.180> at<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.390> whole

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
but then when you look at the whole

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.840 
but then when you look at the whole
thing<00:01:15.600> it's<00:01:16.049> kind<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.290> like<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.530> pine<00:01:16.799> tree<00:01:16.850> so

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
thing it's kind of like a pine tree so

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.679 
thing it's kind of like a pine tree so
very<00:01:18.119> interesting<00:01:19.729> these<00:01:20.729> larches<00:01:21.360> they<00:01:21.570> also

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
very interesting these larches they also

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.999 
very interesting these larches they also
have<00:01:21.960> sort<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.320> these<00:01:22.500> more<00:01:24.350> pom-pom<00:01:25.350> kind<00:01:25.860> of

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
have sort of these more pom-pom kind of

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.670 
have sort of these more pom-pom kind of
growth<00:01:26.810> foliage<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.110> that's<00:01:28.320> also

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
growth foliage so that's also

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.480 
growth foliage so that's also
interesting<00:01:29.780> it<00:01:30.780> changes<00:01:31.439> colors<00:01:31.890> from<00:01:32.189> lime

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
interesting it changes colors from lime

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.480 
interesting it changes colors from lime
green<00:01:32.939> in<00:01:33.420> springtime<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.619> dark<00:01:34.920> green<00:01:35.280> in

summer to yellow and orange and just the
bare<00:01:39.750> branches<00:01:40.049> in<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.590> wintertime<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.430> it's

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
bare branches in the wintertime so it's

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.389 
bare branches in the wintertime so it's
a<00:01:41.939> very<00:01:42.229> interesting<00:01:43.229> tree<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.890> work<00:01:44.040> with<00:01:44.250> in

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
a very interesting tree to work with in

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.300 
a very interesting tree to work with in
bonsai<00:01:45.320> and<00:01:46.320> I'm<00:01:46.649> actually<00:01:46.829> going<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.220> be

you<00:02:11.030> can<00:02:11.180> see<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.569> dawn<00:02:11.780> redwood<00:02:12.080> and<00:02:12.709> the

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
you can see the dawn redwood and the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.750 
you can see the dawn redwood and the
larch<00:02:13.540> they're<00:02:14.540> in<00:02:14.720> their<00:02:14.900> fall<00:02:15.319> colors<00:02:15.890> a

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
larch they're in their fall colors a

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.479 
larch they're in their fall colors a
couple<00:02:17.300> of<00:02:17.480> weeks<00:02:17.690> here<00:02:17.959> we'll<00:02:18.050> be<00:02:18.200> losing<00:02:19.130> all

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
couple of weeks here we'll be losing all

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.250 
couple of weeks here we'll be losing all
the<00:02:19.670> needles<00:02:20.050> so<00:02:22.420> if<00:02:23.420> someone<00:02:23.810> didn't<00:02:24.110> know

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
the needles so if someone didn't know

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.290 
the needles so if someone didn't know
that<00:02:24.530> this<00:02:24.650> was<00:02:24.860> a<00:02:24.890> deciduous<00:02:25.370> conifer<00:02:26.120> they

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
that this was a deciduous conifer they

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.630 
that this was a deciduous conifer they
might<00:02:26.480> start<00:02:26.780> freaking<00:02:27.319> out<00:02:27.440> that<00:02:27.860> uh<00:02:27.890> it's

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
might start freaking out that uh it's

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.300 
might start freaking out that uh it's
dying<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:30.410> same<00:02:30.650> thing<00:02:30.830> happens<00:02:31.160> with<00:02:31.250> the

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
dying the same thing happens with the

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.500 
dying the same thing happens with the
Bald<00:02:31.610> Cypress<00:02:32.000> all<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.319> leaves<00:02:33.560> fall<00:02:34.010> off<00:02:34.510> and

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
Bald Cypress all the leaves fall off and

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.229 
Bald Cypress all the leaves fall off and
this<00:02:35.660> is<00:02:35.810> completely<00:02:36.260> normal<00:02:36.830> just<00:02:37.550> another

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
this is completely normal just another

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.860 
this is completely normal just another
interesting<00:02:38.989> aspect<00:02:39.140> of<00:02:39.650> these<00:02:39.830> trees<00:02:40.540> um<00:02:41.540> so

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
interesting aspect of these trees um so

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.860 
interesting aspect of these trees um so
some<00:02:42.080> of<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.350> sort<00:02:43.040> of<00:02:43.130> benefits<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:43.880> having

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
some of the sort of benefits to having

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.539 
some of the sort of benefits to having
these<00:02:45.350> tree<00:02:45.769> species<00:02:46.340> as<00:02:46.790> bonsais<00:02:47.420> that<00:02:47.810> they

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
these tree species as bonsais that they

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.440 
these tree species as bonsais that they
very<00:02:49.549> easy<00:02:49.940> to<00:02:50.239> style<00:02:51.040> they<00:02:52.040> produce<00:02:52.250> a<00:02:52.730> number

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
very easy to style they produce a number

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.210 
very easy to style they produce a number
of<00:02:53.560> ramification<00:02:54.560> from<00:02:55.340> or<00:02:56.209> they've<00:02:56.540> got<00:02:56.780> this

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
of ramification from or they've got this

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.140 
of ramification from or they've got this
sort<00:02:58.220> of<00:02:58.310> evergreen<00:02:58.970> look<00:02:59.269> to<00:02:59.450> them<00:02:59.630> but<00:03:01.150> they

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
sort of evergreen look to them but they

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.090 
sort of evergreen look to them but they
have<00:03:02.330> little<00:03:02.780> to<00:03:03.110> no<00:03:03.140> care<00:03:03.590> in<00:03:03.709> the<00:03:03.799> winter

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
have little to no care in the winter

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.820 
have little to no care in the winter
time<00:03:04.340> since<00:03:04.819> all<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.330> needles<00:03:05.600> fall<00:03:05.900> off<00:03:06.140> you

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
time since all the needles fall off you

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.460 
time since all the needles fall off you
don't<00:03:06.980> need<00:03:07.130> to<00:03:07.220> keep<00:03:08.049> maintaining<00:03:09.049> it<00:03:09.200> in<00:03:09.230> the

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
don't need to keep maintaining it in the

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.979 
don't need to keep maintaining it in the
winter<00:03:09.970> all<00:03:10.970> right<00:03:11.209> so<00:03:11.390> let's<00:03:11.540> take<00:03:11.750> a<00:03:11.780> minute

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
winter all right so let's take a minute

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.569 
winter all right so let's take a minute
to<00:03:12.260> talk<00:03:12.470> about<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.980> trunk<00:03:13.310> thickness<00:03:15.579> Bald

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
to talk about the trunk thickness Bald

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.870 
to talk about the trunk thickness Bald
Cypress<00:03:16.910> and<00:03:17.480> upon<00:03:17.810> Cypress<00:03:18.560> I<00:03:18.769> would<00:03:19.010> think

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
Cypress and upon Cypress I would think

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.479 
Cypress and upon Cypress I would think
that<00:03:20.030> they<00:03:20.269> have<00:03:20.420> an<00:03:20.570> average<00:03:21.010> rate<00:03:22.010> of<00:03:22.190> growth

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
that they have an average rate of growth

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.060 
that they have an average rate of growth
just<00:03:23.359> because<00:03:23.690> I<00:03:23.720> haven't<00:03:24.260> worked<00:03:24.500> with<00:03:24.709> them

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
just because I haven't worked with them

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.090 
just because I haven't worked with them
so<00:03:25.850> I'm<00:03:25.940> just<00:03:26.120> taking<00:03:26.510> a<00:03:26.600> wild<00:03:26.810> guess<00:03:27.109> based<00:03:27.799> on

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
so I'm just taking a wild guess based on

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.449 
so I'm just taking a wild guess based on
what<00:03:28.310> I<00:03:28.340> know<00:03:28.489> about<00:03:28.730> plants<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:31.250> down

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
what I know about plants the down

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:32.170 
what I know about plants the down
redwood

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
redwood

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.449 
redwood
it's<00:03:32.299> a<00:03:32.359> very<00:03:32.570> fast<00:03:32.900> growing<00:03:33.290> tree<00:03:33.739> so<00:03:34.370> if

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
it's a very fast growing tree so if

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.640 
it's a very fast growing tree so if
you're<00:03:34.640> looking<00:03:34.940> to<00:03:35.030> go<00:03:35.180> from<00:03:35.390> a<00:03:35.480> seedling<00:03:36.200> to

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
you're looking to go from a seedling to

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.530 
you're looking to go from a seedling to
a<00:03:36.680> bonsai<00:03:37.280> tree

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
a bonsai tree

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.840 
a bonsai tree
Don<00:03:39.320> redwood<00:03:39.739> is<00:03:39.859> a<00:03:39.890> good<00:03:40.130> way<00:03:40.280> to<00:03:40.340> go<00:03:40.609> because

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
Don redwood is a good way to go because

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.730 
Don redwood is a good way to go because
it's<00:03:41.150> gonna<00:03:41.239> produce<00:03:41.510> a<00:03:41.780> lot<00:03:41.930> of<00:03:41.959> fast<00:03:42.320> growth

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
it's gonna produce a lot of fast growth

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.910 
it's gonna produce a lot of fast growth
you<00:03:44.220> can<00:03:44.400> grow<00:03:44.610> a<00:03:44.640> really<00:03:45.060> big<00:03:45.300> trunk<00:03:45.960> chop<00:03:46.380> the

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
you can grow a really big trunk chop the

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.770 
you can grow a really big trunk chop the
tree<00:03:47.490> and<00:03:47.910> work<00:03:48.600> on<00:03:48.780> styling<00:03:49.410> it's<00:03:49.590> very<00:03:49.800> fast

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
tree and work on styling it's very fast

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.720 
tree and work on styling it's very fast
larches<00:03:51.780> they<00:03:52.640> they<00:03:53.640> tend<00:03:53.970> to<00:03:54.090> be<00:03:54.300> very<00:03:55.730> they

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
larches they they tend to be very they

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.640 
larches they they tend to be very they
have<00:03:56.910> very<00:03:57.120> thick<00:03:57.680> thin<00:03:58.680> trunks<00:04:00.410> it's<00:04:01.410> very

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
have very thick thin trunks it's very

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.760 
have very thick thin trunks it's very
hard<00:04:01.890> to<00:04:01.950> thicken<00:04:02.250> a<00:04:02.460> trunk<00:04:02.790> on<00:04:02.910> a<00:04:02.940> large<00:04:03.270> so

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
hard to thicken a trunk on a large so

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.360 
hard to thicken a trunk on a large so
you<00:04:05.360> get<00:04:06.360> a<00:04:06.390> large<00:04:06.690> kind<00:04:07.350> of<00:04:07.500> half<00:04:07.620> of<00:04:07.800> style<00:04:08.160> it

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
you get a large kind of half of style it

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.070 
you get a large kind of half of style it
and<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:08.520> natural<00:04:09.000> growing<00:04:10.700> method<00:04:12.080> won't

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
and the natural growing method won't

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.460 
and the natural growing method won't
really<00:04:13.590> thicken<00:04:13.980> that<00:04:14.130> much<00:04:14.370> you<00:04:14.610> have<00:04:14.730> to

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
really thicken that much you have to

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.390 
really thicken that much you have to
take<00:04:16.470> in<00:04:16.680> that<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.670> consideration<00:04:19.220> so<00:04:20.220> that's

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
take in that the consideration so that's

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.060 
take in that the consideration so that's
a<00:04:20.549> deal<00:04:20.730> with<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:21.030> trunk<00:04:21.330> thicknesses<00:04:22.070> for

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
a deal with the trunk thicknesses for

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.430 
a deal with the trunk thicknesses for
the<00:04:23.160> most<00:04:23.400> part<00:04:23.820> if<00:04:24.180> you<00:04:24.360> are<00:04:24.570> you<00:04:25.380> know

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
the most part if you are you know

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.940 
the most part if you are you know
general<00:04:26.010> care<00:04:26.340> for<00:04:27.210> deciduous<00:04:27.990> conifer<00:04:28.530> is<00:04:28.590> to

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
general care for deciduous conifer is to

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.540 
general care for deciduous conifer is to
keep<00:04:29.160> the<00:04:29.370> soil<00:04:29.640> moist<00:04:31.130> none<00:04:32.130> of<00:04:32.280> them<00:04:32.370> really

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
keep the soil moist none of them really

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.250 
keep the soil moist none of them really
like<00:04:32.820> it<00:04:32.970> to<00:04:33.180> dry<00:04:35.090> the<00:04:36.090> larch<00:04:36.360> it's<00:04:36.930> sort<00:04:37.230> of

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
like it to dry the larch it's sort of
