00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
my club this month I don't think I've

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.960 
my club this month I don't think I've
had<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.549> dedenne<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:19.159> the<00:01:20.159> game<00:01:20.340> was<00:01:20.460> Martin's

this month I think Martin's may have
been<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:22.890> month<00:01:23.840> obviously<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.930> more

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
been this month obviously the more

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.929 
been this month obviously the more
before<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.439> can't<00:01:25.650> think<00:01:25.920> but<00:01:26.520> yeah<00:01:26.729> basically

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
before I can't think but yeah basically

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.789
