 Put on a flower bud that learning is meaningless, but the lack of time to study Dodgers 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.699
 It means a lot bigger. 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:29.310

 Follow Ridge from now on. 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:52.289
 After last time, I'll take another look at the movie. 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:56.690
 Depending on the stage of English kids need to understand that this is also going to promote zero different 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:00.239
 Now that everyone knows , let 's review what we've described in this edition. 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:05.700
 First to see you first 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:10.260
 If you're still friends, strangers English to use the English words Stavanger vacation

 Fun to try the various jumyeo Exposure to continue practicing and friendly English 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.540
 I did it. 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:21.360
 On the other hand, if you are already familiar with the deterioration, 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:24.420
 Use a vacation than they can certainly help improve the accuracy of this out 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.530
 I needed a systematic practice yard. 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:35.240
 I decided to study moss writing practice today . 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:39.079
 I 'll explain the sail as two-day relationship and il step. 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:44.479
 First , let's look at a method of learning that has an interest. 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:45.890
 The first step is to enjoy the key points , 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:52.039
 It's important. 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:57.289
 I 'm looking at this for the sake of pleasure. 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:02:02.960
 Just like listening, I'm not going to find a fish or a garner. 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:07.159
 At this stage, I will use the picking storybook to read and imagine happily. 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:10.250
 p7 storybook Yes, I usually tell stories through pictures 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:13.340
 I told him about a book that plays a green auxiliary role. 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:17.959
 It's a book that you can guess. 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:20.690
 Friends of a two- day relationship are more likely than someone to let you see with your eyes. 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:24.950
 When you open it, you get more concentration. 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:28.250
 The story of a pick-me-up As you look at your eyes and hear the sound 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:32.599
 Do not forget that it's effective. 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:36.560
 Now that you checked in step 1 to be due'd better try to talk 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:41.959
 The key points are also a lot of fun again 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:47.450
 Step 1 children not yet able to make a statement so themselves 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:50.680
 At the stage, you can enjoy and copy the contents you read along with the picture. 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.680
 Try to connect to write 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:57.810
 It 's not good to copy it from the beginning into your account. 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:02.310
 It was the first time I read it easily 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.720
 I write copied to pick one word to me about my've also drawn illustration 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.700
 Please let me see. 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.920
 This reluctance disappears in a letter copied activities do love this time made the pick Fiji 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.510
 It is good to see the activity. 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:20.459
 Please select one of the best scenes and paint it. 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.420
 Then , I asked you to write a copy of the expression that you came out of the best scenes . 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.680
 It is. 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:29.760
 Not only do children become accustomed to using the alphabet , 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:33.769
 Transcribed to try to organize thinking about the content of ripe, not only the letter 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.769
 It's a good opportunity to make 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:45.629
 Let's take a look at the moss writing method in Step 1 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:50.700
 You certainly did not forget the key point of your child's steps. 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:52.200
 Fair tapsa pick him share what Exodus story is far far more than the aid packages killed 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.819
 I'm starting. 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.829
 When you get to the chapter book , try to get the most out of your core . 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:04.650
 It touches me. 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:08.250
 Especially children who are just entering the relationship with a child are often one way too. 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:13.280
 It 's focused on materials and Janney books. 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:18.720
 Also , because the story is lengthened, if you make it unconditionally, 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:21.109
 Since the advent of the situation there in the middle you see broken, be sure to read as follows: 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.109
 good 

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:32.680
 1 First of all , to get the accuracy, please put the main words before the full toxicity. 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:36.520
 If you have confidence in the words, you can confidently write the key story with the children . 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:41.860
 2 Now let's confidently challenge the story 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:47.469
 Looking alone, without the help of others, I look to the interpretation or infer information 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:50.139
 3 Finally, I look at the sentence one by one with interpretation, 

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:52.840
 Let's check it out. 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:57.280
 How does this compare with Step 1 ? 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:59.669
 Knowing that the addition of a meticulous relationship of analogy is different 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.669
 You can. 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:08.229
 I have looked at the moss of the Ai relationship and will find 1 app. 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.879
 Nevertheless, the key point is to make sure you are exactly right 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:18.129
 The children in the first stage of the Ida Gadana il stage reduce the amount of vector sling 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:20.650
 Even if the grammar or spelling errors step by step From practice to write the idea at all 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:25.360
 I'm starting. 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:29.289
 This is the recommended way to make a reading note for the boy. 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:32.979
 If you started reading a chapter book with a variety of materials or genres 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:37.539
 It's more effective practice writing laws Pop 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:42.639
 First , write the date you read the book and the title of the book. 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:48.460
 Before I read the tour chapter book, I had to sort out the main words. 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:54.729
 Write these words and find the sentences that contain this word in your book 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:06:01.770
 Oh, think of the main characters and events, and came after the Five Ws 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:06:01.770
 Why do you write a sentence line by line according to 1y How ? 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:13.350
 Finally, I'll try to sort out the moss- spelling lesson with 5 Lizzy. 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:15.660
 If the entry level of English friends using the e pleasantly varied rooms sons 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:20.640
 It makes contact with the English language learning 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:22.920
 First , choose a special story book that gives you joy and sleeps your imagination 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:28.260
 Imagine reading 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:31.320
 Copy your favorite garner sentences from the book you read with pictures 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:36.480
 If you are friends with some familiar English 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:41.280
 Upgrade to Aielo with this vacation 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:43.920
 Now that you have fun and you do not end up with what you know , 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:50.070
 I have to read and write clearly. 

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:53.190
 A variety of materials are available in different genres . 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:57.510
 Please read it carefully as an argument. 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:07:03.240
 You should make your own book by yourself. 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:08.550
 Date read Epilogue Writing a sentence containing a word 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:11.440
 I write my thoughts precisely in the order of writing one sentence according to the two- way and five- 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:15.310
 Practice writing
