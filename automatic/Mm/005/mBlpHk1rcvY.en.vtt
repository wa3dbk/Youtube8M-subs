00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
quite see that but I think that's a

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.449 
quite see that but I think that's a
factory<00:02:42.740> car<00:02:43.270> so<00:02:45.250> well

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
factory car so well

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.860

this is not something you see every day
this<00:02:51.480> is<00:02:51.629> not<00:02:51.780> something<00:02:52.080> you<00:02:52.170> see<00:02:52.349> even<00:02:52.739> once

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950
