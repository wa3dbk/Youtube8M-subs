wide receiver but as a quarterback that
is<00:01:14.159> huge<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.909> obviously<00:01:15.689> Willie's<00:01:16.229> it

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
running backs it's not a big deal but

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.850 
running backs it's not a big deal but
sometimes<00:01:18.900> if<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.200> just<00:01:19.350> want<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.619> get<00:01:19.710> your

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
that option out a few you what was it it

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.300 
that option out a few you what was it it
wasn't<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:10.020> last<00:02:10.229> year's<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.709> don't<00:02:10.860> believe<00:02:11.099> it

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
wasn't in last year's I don't believe it

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.850 
wasn't in last year's I don't believe it
was

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
was

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.940 
was
believe<00:02:12.220> it<00:02:12.400> was<00:02:12.520> in<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:12.700> years<00:02:12.880> before<00:02:13.090> that

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
believe it was in the years before that

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.580 
believe it was in the years before that
so<00:02:14.950> I<00:02:14.980> think<00:02:15.070> it<00:02:15.340> was<00:02:15.400> in<00:02:15.580> Madden<00:02:16.060> 12<00:02:16.560> madden<00:02:17.560> 13

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
so I think it was in Madden 12 madden 13

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.560 
so I think it was in Madden 12 madden 13
for<00:02:18.250> whatever<00:02:18.430> reason<00:02:18.790> they<00:02:18.880> decided<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.360> take

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
for whatever reason they decided to take

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.220

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
series I did a little bit of that and

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:12.719 
series I did a little bit of that and
NHL<00:05:09.699> 13<00:05:10.530> NHL<00:05:11.530> 13<00:05:11.919> was<00:05:12.130> really<00:05:12.400> our<00:05:12.520> first

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
NHL 13 NHL 13 was really our first

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.600 
NHL 13 NHL 13 was really our first
experience<00:05:13.300> at<00:05:13.660> doing<00:05:13.900> EAS<00:05:14.500> HL<00:05:14.919> and<00:05:15.130> we<00:05:15.250> really

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
experience at doing EAS HL and we really

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.850 
experience at doing EAS HL and we really
started<00:05:16.180> very<00:05:16.599> very<00:05:16.870> very<00:05:17.080> late<00:05:17.470> in<00:05:17.800> the

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
started very very very late in the

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.270 
started very very very late in the
season<00:05:18.400> so<00:05:18.900> it<00:05:19.900> took<00:05:20.050> us<00:05:20.110> a<00:05:20.260> while<00:05:20.530> to<00:05:20.590> get<00:05:21.070> used

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
season so it took us a while to get used

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.920 
season so it took us a while to get used
to<00:05:21.430> the<00:05:21.520> game<00:05:21.729> mode<00:05:22.000> took<00:05:22.240> us<00:05:22.360> a<00:05:22.449> while<00:05:22.570> to<00:05:22.630> get

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
to the game mode took us a while to get

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.710 
to the game mode took us a while to get
decent<00:05:23.500> in<00:05:23.590> it<00:05:23.800> obviously<00:05:24.099> we're<00:05:24.639> no<00:05:24.789> top<00:05:25.419> tech

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
decent in it obviously we're no top tech

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.570 
decent in it obviously we're no top tech
top<00:05:26.110> caliber<00:05:26.410> team<00:05:26.889> or<00:05:27.099> anything<00:05:27.280> like<00:05:27.520> that

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
top caliber team or anything like that

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.480 
top caliber team or anything like that
