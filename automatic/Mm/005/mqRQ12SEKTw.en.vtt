00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
eventually it was it didn't show any

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.510 
eventually it was it didn't show any
craft<00:01:13.090> if<00:01:13.479> you<00:01:14.140> just<00:01:14.439> threw<00:01:14.890> in<00:01:15.009> more<00:01:15.250> hops

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
craft if you just threw in more hops

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.270 
craft if you just threw in more hops
then<00:01:15.850> suddenly<00:01:16.240> you<00:01:16.600> know<00:01:16.750> that<00:01:17.590> was<00:01:17.829> that<00:01:18.159> was

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
then suddenly you know that was that was

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.679 
then suddenly you know that was that was
the<00:01:18.340> answer<00:01:18.729> and<00:01:18.759> that<00:01:19.060> that<00:01:19.450> was<00:01:19.600> the

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
the answer and that that was the

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.919 
the answer and that that was the
criteria<00:01:20.259> of<00:01:20.350> a<00:01:20.409> good<00:01:20.590> beer<00:01:20.859> and<00:01:21.069> I<00:01:21.929> don't

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:22.929 
criteria of a good beer and I don't

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:25.380 
criteria of a good beer and I don't
believe<00:01:23.200> that<00:01:23.259> and<00:01:23.890> so<00:01:24.520> we<00:01:24.700> were<00:01:24.850> looking<00:01:24.999> for

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
believe that and so we were looking for

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.109 
believe that and so we were looking for
something<00:01:25.630> that<00:01:25.979> offered<00:01:26.979> as<00:01:27.249> an<00:01:27.640> intense

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
something that offered as an intense

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.559 
something that offered as an intense
sensory<00:01:28.840> experience<00:01:29.530> as<00:01:29.890> a<00:01:29.999> very<00:01:30.999> hoppy<00:01:31.210> beer

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:31.569 
sensory experience as a very hoppy beer

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:33.929 
sensory experience as a very hoppy beer
but<00:01:32.079> other<00:01:32.289> than<00:01:32.499> hops<00:01:32.799> and<00:01:33.189> for<00:01:33.399> us<00:01:33.490> then<00:01:33.729> that

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
but other than hops and for us then that

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.050 
but other than hops and for us then that
was<00:01:34.119> salad<00:01:34.899> what's<00:01:35.079> the<00:01:35.170> winemaker<00:01:35.560> a<00:01:35.939> lot<00:01:36.939> of

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
was salad what's the winemaker a lot of

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.039 
was salad what's the winemaker a lot of
it<00:01:37.179> has<00:01:37.420> to<00:01:37.450> do<00:01:37.749> with<00:01:38.009> working<00:01:39.009> with<00:01:39.039> barrels

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
it has to do with working with barrels

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.139 
it has to do with working with barrels
working<00:01:41.049> with<00:01:41.200> fruits<00:01:41.499> you<00:01:42.130> know<00:01:42.249> fruits<00:01:42.579> are

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
working with fruits you know fruits are

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.679 
working with fruits you know fruits are
different<00:01:43.719> from<00:01:43.869> from<00:01:44.380> beers<00:01:44.799> you<00:01:45.249> know<00:01:45.280> and

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
different from from beers you know and

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.629 
different from from beers you know and
they<00:01:46.689> ferment<00:01:47.020> different<00:01:47.579> there's<00:01:48.579> different

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:48.639 
they ferment different there's different

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:51.330 
they ferment different there's different
criteria<00:01:49.479> for<00:01:49.659> that<00:01:49.780> so<00:01:50.020> this<00:01:50.679> is<00:01:50.889> kind<00:01:51.100> of<00:01:51.219> a

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
criteria for that so this is kind of a

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.569 
criteria for that so this is kind of a
blend<00:01:51.609> of<00:01:51.850> of<00:01:52.119> that<00:01:53.109> experience<00:01:53.560> in<00:01:53.889> in<00:01:54.249> both

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
blend of of that experience in in both

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:57.990 
blend of of that experience in in both
brewing<00:01:55.209> and<00:01:55.359> winemaking
