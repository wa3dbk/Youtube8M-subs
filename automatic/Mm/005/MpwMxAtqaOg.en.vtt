00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.109
 hi friends on youtube i am car order and 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.690
 I'm going to show you now in a video 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.970
 very practical tutorial really that is 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:15.780
 to delete the clipboard ok 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:18.300
 this is very effective for those 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.590
 people who want to see us so that 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.350
 you do not want other people 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.779
 that we are copying etcetera with a 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.340
 simple command that the command wrote 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.340
 here on the notebook in this 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.420
 and if many times you do not want that 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.770
 example someone will realize what 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.740
 you have what you had copied 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:42.130
 etcetera and good and apart what 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.840
 that we can use this function this 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.640
 command to free memory remember 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.740
 that when we copy a text an image 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.840
 or whatever we're copying is 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.490
 same directly in clipboard and that 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.960
 it's memory consumption for our 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.990
 team 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.690
 then yes I hope it's useful to have it 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:02.329
 riddled and for that we have this code 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.879
 how are we going to execute it very easily if we 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.549
 what we want is to do it directly with 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.759
 direct access or a combination of 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.700
 very simple keys let's go to the 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.110
 desktop and I'm using windows 8.1 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.159
 pro so it should work in 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.720
 any of the new versions 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.340
 previous 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.070
 we are right clicking on the 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.460
 new desk 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.060
 direct access here will ask us 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.399
 write the location of the item 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.399
 as we give him the right to paste 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.020
 and with this this command we will see in 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.400
 that next one writes a name for this 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.130
 shortcut in this case I'm going to 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.159
 let him walk 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.210
 short 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.659
 in papers 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.469
 they warn you 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.299
 list now let's continue right click fast 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:55.369
 already eliminated the port for tennis 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.049
 but if we want to execute it 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.759
 directly with a combination of 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.120
 We put the keys right on 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:05.540
 properties 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.540
 and tec I do abbreviated here 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:12.849
 how to write control m 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:16.239
 we give him to accept now I'm going to press 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:18.640
 control alt m and has already passed the 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.200
 clipboard is very simple actually 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.230
 very easy to use this is 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:27.569
 precisely to alleviate the expense of 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.569
 memory and so on and for less 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.400
 and they improved although it's a bit a 0.1 the 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.959
 performance of our computer that 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.569
 it is a duty of something very interesting that 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.610
 we can use everything you can be in 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.200
 windows xp so I guess a lot xp 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.819
 windows vista windows 7 windows 8 en 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.340
 all these operating systems can be 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.170
 use is to say this video tutorial 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.180
 I hope you liked it remember
