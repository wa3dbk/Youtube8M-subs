going to do is just delete this bit of

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.549 
going to do is just delete this bit of
geometry<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.559> I'll<00:00:55.559> rheem<00:00:55.860> air<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.190> later<00:00:56.370> and

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
geometry and I'll rheem air it later and

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.380

you can you map any way you want this
isn't<00:01:00.780> once<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.170> understand<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.710> the

technique and the concept behind it can
do<00:01:07.380> whatever<00:01:07.650> you'd<00:01:07.799> like<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.100> UV<00:01:08.310> map<00:01:08.490> i'm

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
do whatever you'd like to UV map i'm

just going to delete those and i am
going<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:16.100> do<00:01:17.100> another<00:01:17.369> trick<00:01:17.790> which<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.540> i'm

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
going to do another trick which is i'm

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.440 
going to do another trick which is i'm
going<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.380> select<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.340> face<00:01:21.299> mode<00:01:23.030> this<00:01:24.030> arm<00:01:24.299> on

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
going to select in face mode this arm on

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.149 
going to select in face mode this arm on
this<00:01:24.659> side<00:01:24.869> which<00:01:25.110> has<00:01:25.290> already<00:01:25.439> has<00:01:25.740> already

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
this side which has already has already

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.649 
this side which has already has already
has<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.520> UV<00:01:26.790> island<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:28.070> i<00:01:29.070> am<00:01:29.220> just<00:01:29.250> going<00:01:29.790> to

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.780 

extract<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:33.930> or<00:01:34.170> separate<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.829> from<00:01:35.009> my<00:01:35.490> pig

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
extract this or separate it from my pig

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.420 
extract this or separate it from my pig
and<00:01:36.030> reconnect<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.570> later<00:01:37.040> so<00:01:38.040> I'm<00:01:38.100> just<00:01:38.250> going

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
and reconnect it later so I'm just going

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.260 
and reconnect it later so I'm just going
to<00:01:38.549> go<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.759> mesh<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.570> extract<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:41.150> becomes<00:01:42.150> a

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
to go to mesh and extract it becomes a

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.830 
to go to mesh and extract it becomes a
separate<00:01:42.630> object<00:01:43.399> and<00:01:44.399> I'm<00:01:45.360> going<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.630> go<00:01:45.780> to

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
separate object and I'm going to go to

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.440 
separate object and I'm going to go to
face<00:01:46.290> mode<00:01:46.530> here<00:01:47.840> select<00:01:48.840> this<00:01:49.290> leg<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:50.450> again

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
face mode here select this leg and again

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.819 
face mode here select this leg and again
hit<00:01:51.659> G<00:01:52.340> to<00:01:53.340> extract<00:01:53.939> again<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:55.229> don't<00:01:55.409> have<00:01:55.619> to

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
hit G to extract again you don't have to

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.499 
hit G to extract again you don't have to
do<00:01:55.950> this<00:01:56.130> I'm<00:01:56.430> just<00:01:56.790> showing<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.119> different

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
do this I'm just showing you different

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.560 
do this I'm just showing you different
methods<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:59.340> reason<00:01:59.640> why<00:01:59.759> I<00:01:59.820> think<00:02:00.000> it's<00:02:00.210> not

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
methods the reason why I think it's not

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.690 
methods the reason why I think it's not
a<00:02:00.600> bad<00:02:00.840> idea<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.140> extract<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:02.009> because<00:02:02.369> then

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
a bad idea to extract it is because then

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.910 
a bad idea to extract it is because then
it<00:02:03.270> keeps<00:02:03.540> these<00:02:03.810> pieces<00:02:04.110> separate<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.860> I

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
it keeps these pieces separate and I

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.449 
it keeps these pieces separate and I
don't<00:02:05.100> have<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.369> worry<00:02:05.579> about<00:02:06.140> I<00:02:07.140> can<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.190> just

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
don't have to worry about I can it just

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.650 
don't have to worry about I can it just
makes<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.759> little<00:02:08.789> bit<00:02:09.000> easier<00:02:09.119> for<00:02:09.330> me<00:02:09.629> to

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
makes it a little bit easier for me to

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.710 
makes it a little bit easier for me to
select<00:02:10.170> these<00:02:10.379> UVs<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.099> and

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
select these UVs and and

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.470 
select these UVs and and
change<00:02:11.870> them<00:02:12.080> so<00:02:12.580> I<00:02:13.580> can<00:02:13.880> continue<00:02:14.060> this

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
change them so I can continue this

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.810 
change them so I can continue this
process<00:02:14.780> in<00:02:15.200> object<00:02:15.590> mode<00:02:15.650> excuse<00:02:16.340> me<00:02:16.460> in<00:02:16.550> face

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
process in object mode excuse me in face

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.010 
process in object mode excuse me in face
mode<00:02:17.090> and<00:02:17.710> I<00:02:18.710> can<00:02:18.950> select<00:02:19.130> this<00:02:19.820> entire<00:02:20.240> ear<00:02:20.570> on

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
mode and I can select this entire ear on

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.780 
mode and I can select this entire ear on
this<00:02:21.410> side<00:02:21.620> you<00:02:21.830> know<00:02:22.010> when<00:02:22.160> I<00:02:22.190> just<00:02:22.490> do<00:02:22.580> both

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
this side you know when I just do both

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.460 
this side you know when I just do both
at<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.030> same<00:02:23.090> time<00:02:23.440> i'll<00:02:24.440> select<00:02:24.590> both<00:02:24.860> ears

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
at the same time i'll select both ears

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.400 
at the same time i'll select both ears

and make sure i have them all selected

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:37.450 
and make sure i have them all selected
and<00:02:30.590> just<00:02:30.770> extract<00:02:31.430> them<00:02:35.500> then<00:02:36.500> I<00:02:36.650> going<00:02:36.920> to

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
and just extract them then I going to

and just extract them then I going to
I'm<00:02:37.670> going<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:39.430> extract<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.580> nose

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.550 

and<00:02:52.959> then<00:02:53.959> I'm<00:02:54.110> going<00:02:54.349> to<00:02:54.470> extract<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.159> head

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
and then I'm going to extract the head

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:05.050 
and then I'm going to extract the head
and<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.650> rest<00:02:57.830> of<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.069> body<00:03:03.879> try<00:03:04.879> that

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
and the rest of the body try that

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.390 
and the rest of the body try that
selection<00:03:05.390> again<00:03:05.810> select<00:03:06.769> on<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:06.980> body<00:03:07.190> this

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
selection again select on the body this

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.920 
selection again select on the body this
time<00:03:08.319> and<00:03:09.319> I'll<00:03:09.500> extract

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:21.940 

the<00:03:15.590> body<00:03:15.859> here<00:03:16.959> from<00:03:17.959> the<00:03:18.079> head<00:03:20.500> so<00:03:21.500> just<00:03:21.769> one

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
the body here from the head so just one

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.849 
the body here from the head so just one
method<00:03:22.159> one<00:03:22.879> alternative<00:03:23.060> method<00:03:23.810> so<00:03:24.650> now<00:03:24.799> you

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
method one alternative method so now you

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.089 
method one alternative method so now you
can<00:03:25.010> go<00:03:25.159> to<00:03:26.049> work<00:03:27.049> on<00:03:27.260> this<00:03:27.379> pig<00:03:27.709> and<00:03:27.950> i'm<00:03:28.010> going

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
can go to work on this pig and i'm going

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.970 
can go to work on this pig and i'm going
to<00:03:28.219> work<00:03:28.310> a<00:03:28.400> little<00:03:28.430> bit<00:03:28.670> faster<00:03:28.969> and<00:03:29.980> i'm

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
to work a little bit faster and i'm

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.699 
to work a little bit faster and i'm
going<00:03:31.400> to<00:03:31.519> go<00:03:31.849> to<00:03:31.909> face<00:03:32.299> mode<00:03:32.569> just<00:03:33.230> select<00:03:33.349> all

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
going to go to face mode just select all

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.569 
going to go to face mode just select all
the<00:03:33.950> faces<00:03:34.719> here<00:03:35.719> on<00:03:35.900> the<00:03:35.989> body<00:03:36.400> except<00:03:37.400> for

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
the faces here on the body except for

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:42.129 
the faces here on the body except for
one<00:03:37.760> row<00:03:39.939> in<00:03:40.939> fact<00:03:41.120> here's<00:03:41.359> another<00:03:41.540> trick<00:03:41.930> i

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
one row in fact here's another trick i

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.080 
one row in fact here's another trick i
can<00:03:42.620> actually<00:03:43.040> just<00:03:43.159> double<00:03:43.459> click<00:03:43.639> this<00:03:43.819> row

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
can actually just double click this row

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.030 
can actually just double click this row
and<00:03:44.359> i<00:03:45.079> can<00:03:45.260> say<00:03:45.439> this<00:03:45.650> this<00:03:46.040> is<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:46.459> excuse<00:03:47.060> me

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
and i can say this this is the excuse me

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.089 
and i can say this this is the excuse me
the<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:50.480> loop<00:03:50.689> here<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:51.079> ring<00:03:51.319> unless<00:03:51.680> like

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
the the loop here the ring unless like

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.369 
the the loop here the ring unless like
this<00:03:52.310> ring<00:03:52.609> and<00:03:52.879> then<00:03:53.329> i<00:03:53.389> can<00:03:53.569> go<00:03:53.599> just<00:03:54.049> go<00:03:54.319> to

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
this ring and then i can go just go to

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:57.580 
this ring and then i can go just go to
edit<00:03:54.980> and<00:03:55.129> invert<00:03:55.790> selection<00:03:55.970> and<00:03:56.810> you<00:03:57.439> can

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
edit and invert selection and you can

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.839 
edit and invert selection and you can
see<00:03:57.709> I<00:03:57.739> don't<00:03:57.769> have<00:03:57.980> to<00:03:58.220> spend<00:03:58.459> so<00:03:58.669> much<00:03:58.790> time

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 
see I don't have to spend so much time

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.619 
see I don't have to spend so much time
selecting<00:03:59.629> that<00:04:00.849> well<00:04:01.849> I<00:04:02.090> went<00:04:02.389> all<00:04:02.510> the<00:04:02.599> way

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:02.629 
selecting that well I went all the way

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:03.940 
selecting that well I went all the way
through<00:04:02.719> so<00:04:03.169> maybe<00:04:03.349> we<00:04:03.409> have<00:04:03.530> to<00:04:03.650> select<00:04:03.799> this

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
through so maybe we have to select this

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.649 
through so maybe we have to select this
one<00:04:04.010> side<00:04:05.859> there's<00:04:06.859> always<00:04:07.340> a<00:04:07.370> there's<00:04:08.299> always

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:08.659 
one side there's always a there's always

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:13.690 
one side there's always a there's always
a<00:04:08.689> little<00:04:09.230> bit<00:04:09.469> of<00:04:09.560> complication<00:04:11.680> and<00:04:12.700> i'll

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
a little bit of complication and i'll

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.129 
a little bit of complication and i'll
just<00:04:14.150> do<00:04:14.629> select<00:04:14.959> a<00:04:15.109> ring<00:04:15.319> here<00:04:15.739> and<00:04:17.079> this<00:04:18.079> is

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
just do select a ring here and this is

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.219 
just do select a ring here and this is
going<00:04:18.349> to<00:04:18.470> be<00:04:18.530> a<00:04:18.560> seam<00:04:18.829> here<00:04:18.859> and<00:04:19.340> a<00:04:19.400> seam<00:04:19.669> here

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
going to be a seam here and a seam here

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:25.689 
going to be a seam here and a seam here
so<00:04:21.229> i'm<00:04:21.530> going<00:04:21.979> to<00:04:22.099> planner<00:04:22.760> map<00:04:23.030> it<00:04:24.580> then<00:04:25.580> I'm

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:25.699 
so i'm going to planner map it then I'm

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.379 
so i'm going to planner map it then I'm
going<00:04:26.000> to<00:04:26.060> planar<00:04:26.599> map<00:04:26.870> this<00:04:27.050> one<00:04:27.289> right<00:04:27.440> here

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
going to planar map this one right here

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.129 
going to planar map this one right here
and<00:04:30.610> lastly<00:04:31.610> I'm<00:04:31.820> going<00:04:31.849> to<00:04:32.240> planar<00:04:32.630> map<00:04:32.900> this

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
and lastly I'm going to planar map this

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:40.990 
and lastly I'm going to planar map this
section

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.879 

so<00:04:42.000> I<00:04:42.030> have<00:04:42.360> my<00:04:42.480> main<00:04:42.720> trunk<00:04:43.050> and<00:04:43.350> then<00:04:43.770> the

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
so I have my main trunk and then the

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.930 
so I have my main trunk and then the
rest<00:04:44.070> of<00:04:44.190> my<00:04:44.340> selection<00:04:44.850> cell<00:04:45.470> going<00:04:46.470> to<00:04:46.620> go<00:04:46.800> to

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
rest of my selection cell going to go to

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.890 
rest of my selection cell going to go to
UV<00:04:47.940> mode<00:04:48.180> select<00:04:49.080> these<00:04:49.230> islands<00:04:50.840> going<00:04:51.840> to

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
UV mode select these islands going to

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:58.520 
UV mode select these islands going to
move<00:04:52.080> this<00:04:52.610> here's<00:04:53.610> the<00:04:53.820> main<00:04:53.970> body<00:04:57.320> move<00:04:58.320> this

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
move this here's the main body move this

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.150 
move this here's the main body move this
off<00:05:00.020> it<00:05:01.020> seems<00:05:01.320> like<00:05:01.470> there<00:05:01.650> should<00:05:01.680> be<00:05:01.860> one

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
off it seems like there should be one

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:09.650 
off it seems like there should be one
more<00:05:02.340> selection<00:05:02.910> here<00:05:04.910> and<00:05:06.110> i'll<00:05:07.110> i<00:05:08.389> will<00:05:09.389> go

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
more selection here and i'll i will go

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:16.450 
more selection here and i'll i will go
through<00:05:10.020> on

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.460 

why<00:05:16.970> did<00:05:17.180> planar<00:05:17.449> map<00:05:17.690> that<00:05:17.900> I<00:05:17.930> just<00:05:18.169> didn't

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
why did planar map that I just didn't

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:25.570 
why did planar map that I just didn't
see<00:05:18.500> it<00:05:19.060> so<00:05:20.060> take<00:05:20.509> this<00:05:20.630> one<00:05:20.870> to<00:05:20.990> UV<00:05:21.259> mode<00:05:24.580> and

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
see it so take this one to UV mode and

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.659 
see it so take this one to UV mode and
here's<00:05:26.270> this<00:05:26.449> other<00:05:26.660> Island<00:05:27.340> so<00:05:28.340> I'm<00:05:28.460> going<00:05:28.520> to

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
here's this other Island so I'm going to

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.040 
here's this other Island so I'm going to
select<00:05:28.759> each<00:05:29.030> one<00:05:29.210> of<00:05:29.240> these<00:05:29.389> islands<00:05:29.870> and<00:05:29.960> I'm

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
select each one of these islands and I'm

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.400 
select each one of these islands and I'm
going<00:05:30.380> to<00:05:30.410> unfold<00:05:30.889> them<00:05:31.849> this<00:05:32.780> one<00:05:32.960> probably

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
going to unfold them this one probably

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:38.320 
going to unfold them this one probably
need<00:05:33.710> to<00:05:33.740> relax<00:05:34.099> first<00:05:34.460> then<00:05:34.759> unfold<00:05:37.120> going<00:05:38.120> to

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
need to relax first then unfold going to

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.180 
need to relax first then unfold going to
select<00:05:38.810> this<00:05:39.169> bottom<00:05:39.740> section<00:05:39.770> unfold<00:05:40.669> it<00:05:40.880> and

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
select this bottom section unfold it and

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.570 
select this bottom section unfold it and
scale<00:05:43.190> it<00:05:43.220> down<00:05:44.800> so<00:05:45.800> that<00:05:45.830> it<00:05:46.160> matches<00:05:46.310> the

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
scale it down so that it matches the

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.129 
scale it down so that it matches the
same<00:05:46.880> sizes<00:05:47.360> these<00:05:47.539> or<00:05:47.870> at<00:05:47.960> least

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:48.139 
same sizes these or at least

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.749 
same sizes these or at least
approximately<00:05:49.150> and<00:05:50.150> here's<00:05:50.360> the<00:05:50.509> main<00:05:50.720> body

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:51.759 
approximately and here's the main body

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:56.260 
approximately and here's the main body
and<00:05:52.759> I'm<00:05:52.880> going<00:05:53.210> to<00:05:53.270> rotate<00:05:53.630> this<00:05:54.849> bout<00:05:55.849> to

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
and I'm going to rotate this bout to

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:02.980 
and I'm going to rotate this bout to
here<00:05:56.599> and<00:05:57.940> relax<00:05:58.940> it<00:05:59.270> and<00:05:59.449> unfold<00:06:00.199> it<00:06:01.990> they

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
here and relax it and unfold it they

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:10.080 
here and relax it and unfold it they
need<00:06:03.169> to<00:06:03.320> relax<00:06:03.620> it<00:06:03.830> again<00:06:06.430> there<00:06:07.430> we<00:06:07.580> go

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:16.649 

rotate<00:06:11.090> it<00:06:11.300> and<00:06:13.449> go<00:06:14.449> back<00:06:14.690> to<00:06:14.900> my<00:06:15.050> smooth<00:06:15.440> tool

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:16.659 
rotate it and go back to my smooth tool

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:20.740 
rotate it and go back to my smooth tool
unfold<00:06:17.659> it<00:06:17.870> one<00:06:18.530> more<00:06:18.710> time<00:06:19.360> now<00:06:20.360> it<00:06:20.479> looks<00:06:20.599> a

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:20.750 
unfold it one more time now it looks a

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.420 
unfold it one more time now it looks a
lot<00:06:20.870> better<00:06:21.050> okay<00:06:21.909> so<00:06:23.349> get<00:06:24.349> these<00:06:24.530> UVs<00:06:24.979> around

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 
lot better okay so get these UVs around

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.189 
lot better okay so get these UVs around
the<00:06:25.520> same<00:06:25.729> size<00:06:25.759> so<00:06:26.389> that<00:06:26.449> all<00:06:26.840> of<00:06:26.900> these<00:06:27.139> a

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:27.199 
the same size so that all of these a

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:30.129 
the same size so that all of these a
match<00:06:27.620> in<00:06:28.009> a<00:06:28.220> similar<00:06:28.490> way<00:06:28.580> and<00:06:28.970> I'm<00:06:29.900> going<00:06:30.080> to

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:30.139 
match in a similar way and I'm going to

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:31.600 
match in a similar way and I'm going to
check<00:06:30.409> and<00:06:30.620> I<00:06:30.650> believe<00:06:30.919> that<00:06:30.949> this<00:06:31.250> is<00:06:31.460> the

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610 
check and I believe that this is the

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.520 
check and I believe that this is the
side<00:06:33.009> right<00:06:34.009> here<00:06:34.930> yes<00:06:35.930> this<00:06:36.139> is<00:06:36.289> where<00:06:36.440> I'm

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:36.530 
side right here yes this is where I'm

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.709 
side right here yes this is where I'm
going<00:06:36.830> to<00:06:36.949> make<00:06:37.400> my<00:06:37.610> attachment<00:06:38.210> so<00:06:38.419> I'm<00:06:38.509> going

00:06:38.709 --> 00:06:38.719 
going to make my attachment so I'm going

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:43.350 
going to make my attachment so I'm going
to<00:06:38.750> go<00:06:38.870> to<00:06:38.930> EV<00:06:39.229> mode<00:06:39.409> and<00:06:40.030> just<00:06:41.030> click<00:06:41.419> on<00:06:42.340> these

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 
to go to EV mode and just click on these

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:51.010 
to go to EV mode and just click on these
UVs<00:06:44.360> here<00:06:48.909> keep<00:06:49.909> in<00:06:50.000> mind<00:06:50.030> i'm<00:06:50.270> going<00:06:50.300> to<00:06:50.419> leave

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.020 
UVs here keep in mind i'm going to leave

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.020 
UVs here keep in mind i'm going to leave
this<00:06:51.289> one<00:06:51.530> open<00:06:52.099> and<00:06:52.370> leave<00:06:52.699> this<00:06:52.849> one

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:14.960 
then I'm going to take this and unfold

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:25.339 
then I'm going to take this and unfold
it<00:07:15.110> one<00:07:15.380> more<00:07:15.560> time

00:07:25.339 --> 00:07:25.349 

00:07:25.349 --> 00:07:33.320 

and<00:07:26.349> there<00:07:27.190> you<00:07:27.280> have<00:07:27.310> it<00:07:28.680> another<00:07:29.680> UV<00:07:30.069> island

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:33.330 

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.850 

and<00:07:34.330> I'll<00:07:34.750> just<00:07:34.960> move<00:07:35.139> it<00:07:35.289> off<00:07:35.410> to<00:07:35.440> the<00:07:35.650> side

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:35.860 
and I'll just move it off to the side

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.880 
and I'll just move it off to the side
like<00:07:35.889> this<00:07:36.099> and<00:07:36.340> leave<00:07:36.729> it<00:07:36.849> there
