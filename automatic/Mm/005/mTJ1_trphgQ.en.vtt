bringing a little tutorial how to set up

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.470 
bringing a little tutorial how to set up
your<00:00:14.280> speed<00:00:14.910> on<00:00:15.299> it<00:00:16.080> on<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.260> pc<00:00:17.240> the<00:00:18.240> first

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
your speed on it on the pc the first

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.240 
your speed on it on the pc the first
thing<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:18.779> have<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.930> do<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.350> go<00:00:19.680> here<00:00:19.949> sweet

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
thing you have to do is go here sweet

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.590 
thing you have to do is go here sweet
controls<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:21.240> then<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:21.960> think<00:00:22.260> it's<00:00:23.510> let<00:00:24.510> me

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
controls and then I think it's let me

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.800 
controls and then I think it's let me
see<00:00:24.810> here<00:00:24.930> its<00:00:25.439> movements<00:00:26.039> yeah<00:00:26.510> they<00:00:27.510> have<00:00:27.689> to

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
see here its movements yeah they have to

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.320 
see here its movements yeah they have to
bind<00:00:28.019> turn<00:00:28.380> left<00:00:28.619> or<00:00:28.949> turn<00:00:29.010> right<00:00:29.910> or<00:00:30.179> bottom

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
bind turn left or turn right or bottom

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
bind turn left or turn right or bottom
like<00:00:30.779> iron<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:32.300> specific<00:00:33.300> key<00:00:33.480> this<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.260> the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
like iron and specific key this is the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.389 
like iron and specific key this is the
kitty<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:35.219> use<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.700> turn<00:00:36.980> I'm<00:00:37.980> going<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.280> show

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
kitty you use the turn I'm going to show

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.080 
kitty you use the turn I'm going to show
you<00:00:38.460> how<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.760> looks<00:00:38.790> without<00:00:39.180> USB<00:00:39.690> first<00:00:41.090> okay

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
you how it looks without USB first okay

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.619 
you how it looks without USB first okay
so<00:00:42.530> this<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.710> how<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:44.010> looks<00:00:44.390> without<00:00:45.390> your

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
so this is how this looks without your

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.830 
so this is how this looks without your
speed<00:00:46.700> so<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.760> can<00:00:47.879> see<00:00:48.030> it's<00:00:48.180> really<00:00:48.539> really

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
speed so you can see it's really really

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.049 
speed so you can see it's really really
slow<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.289> basically<00:00:49.920> what<00:00:50.100> yall<00:00:50.520> speed<00:00:50.789> ads

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
slow and basically what yall speed ads

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.299 
slow and basically what yall speed ads
it's<00:00:52.160> making<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.430> turn<00:00:53.789> faster<00:00:54.980> yes<00:00:55.980> yeah

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
it's making this turn faster yes yeah

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.310 
it's making this turn faster yes yeah
you<00:00:56.640> can't<00:00:56.850> really<00:00:57.120> do<00:00:57.239> 360s<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:57.960> stuff<00:00:58.140> with

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
you can't really do 360s and stuff with

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.220 
you can't really do 360s and stuff with
this<00:00:59.030> ok<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.090> now<00:01:00.570> I'm<00:01:00.660> going<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.930> show<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.109> how

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.950 
this ok so now I'm going to show you how
to<00:01:01.379> set<00:01:01.890> up<00:01:01.949> your<00:01:02.100> speed<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.570> go<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.780> your

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
to set up your speed and you go to your

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.010 
to set up your speed and you go to your
computer<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:05.030> basically<00:01:06.030> go<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.360> your<00:01:06.570> steam

a<00:01:25.770> bird<00:01:26.040> program<00:01:26.400> i<00:01:26.759> use<00:01:26.909> wordpad<00:01:27.710> anything<00:01:28.710> we

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
a bird program i use wordpad anything we

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.190 
a bird program i use wordpad anything we
look<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.520> then<00:01:30.000> click<00:01:30.240> very<00:01:30.840> basically

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
look and then click very basically

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.640 
look and then click very basically
search<00:01:31.530> for<00:01:31.890> your<00:01:32.880> speed<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:34.610> think<00:01:35.610> the

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
search for your speed I think the

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.450 
search for your speed I think the
default<00:01:37.650> setting<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.070> 140<00:01:39.890> it's<00:01:40.890> changed<00:01:41.280> it

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
default setting is 140 it's changed it

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.630 
default setting is 140 it's changed it
this<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.210> whatever<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.750> want<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.200> use<00:01:43.560> 720<00:01:44.490> X

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
this to whatever you want I use 720 X

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.969 
this to whatever you want I use 720 X
yeah<00:01:45.240> I'm<00:01:45.479> used<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.229> think<00:01:46.979> it's<00:01:47.810> decent

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
yeah I'm used to it I think it's decent

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.760 
yeah I'm used to it I think it's decent
speed<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:51.049> I'm<00:01:52.049> going<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.259> show<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.500> how<00:01:52.530> this

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
speed so I'm going to show you how this

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.450 
speed so I'm going to show you how this
looks<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.340> game<00:01:53.579> now

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
looks in game now

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.440 
looks in game now
so<00:01:56.120> basically<00:01:56.600> this<00:01:57.110> how<00:01:57.820> y'all<00:01:58.820> been<00:01:59.000> looking

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
so basically this how y'all been looking

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.469 
so basically this how y'all been looking
game<00:01:59.659> you<00:02:00.110> have<00:02:00.260> 7<00:02:00.590> 20<00:02:00.890> on<00:02:01.010> and<00:02:01.190> thou<00:02:02.119> shalt<00:02:02.390> to

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
game you have 7 20 on and thou shalt to

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.810 
game you have 7 20 on and thou shalt to
point<00:02:02.720> out<00:02:02.869> that<00:02:03.229> this<00:02:03.890> works<00:02:04.159> for<00:02:04.340> any<00:02:04.520> color

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
point out that this works for any color

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.559 
point out that this works for any color
theory<00:02:05.090> at<00:02:05.990> least<00:02:06.490> four<00:02:07.490> or<00:02:07.729> black<00:02:08.030> ops<00:02:08.270> that<00:02:08.539> I

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
theory at least four or black ops that I

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.230 
theory at least four or black ops that I
play<00:02:08.840> and<00:02:09.310> but<00:02:10.310> you<00:02:10.459> start<00:02:10.819> to<00:02:10.880> change<00:02:11.060> your

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
play and but you start to change your

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.750 
play and but you start to change your
y'all<00:02:11.780> speed<00:02:12.110> in<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.739> config<00:02:15.520> you<00:02:16.520> just<00:02:16.640> do

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
y'all speed in the config you just do

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.420 
y'all speed in the config you just do
that<00:02:16.790> by<00:02:17.090> writing<00:02:17.330> I<00:02:17.510> think<00:02:18.140> it's<00:02:18.290> CL<00:02:18.860> on<00:02:19.220> the

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
that by writing I think it's CL on the

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.030 
that by writing I think it's CL on the
score<00:02:19.730> yah<00:02:20.540> speed<00:02:20.840> just<00:02:21.350> change<00:02:21.739> the<00:02:21.890> amount

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
score yah speed just change the amount

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.479 
score yah speed just change the amount
and<00:02:22.600> yet<00:02:23.600> this<00:02:23.810> out<00:02:24.050> sprint<00:02:24.380> slicks<00:02:27.430> so<00:02:28.430> you

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
and yet this out sprint slicks so you

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.060 
and yet this out sprint slicks so you
can<00:02:28.580> see<00:02:28.730> it's<00:02:28.880> solved<00:02:29.180> easier<00:02:29.570> or<00:02:29.840> +<00:02:30.560> faster

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
can see it's solved easier or + faster

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:38.320 
can see it's solved easier or + faster
and<00:02:32.800> basically<00:02:35.019> it<00:02:36.019> makes<00:02:36.290> you<00:02:36.970> you<00:02:37.970> make<00:02:38.150> sure

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
and basically it makes you you make sure
