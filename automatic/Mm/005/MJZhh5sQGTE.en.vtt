00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm a guitar player,
a flamenco guitar player

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:17.901
It makes us perplexed to see a guitar player
like Miguel in this situation and with three strings

00:00:17.902 --> 00:00:23.002
and nobody realizes that the guitar only has three strings!

00:00:31.003 --> 00:00:33.903
My grand-father tought him and look what it came out!

00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:36.804
How he was playing when he was 20!

00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:47.005
I think it's difficult that a guitar player
 comes and surpasses 

00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:52.006
the way Miguel was playing at 
that time with that energy

00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:56.007
Paco de Lucia is the only one who had that strengh

00:00:57.008 --> 00:01:05.008
We spent entire nights playing guitar 
and that guy was impressive

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.309
He released something that only a few musicians 
were bold enough to do it: the Vals Flamenco

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.010
It was a jewel. 
All of the guitar players marvelled at him!

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:22.011
He gets famous in the Who's Who 
of the madrid scene in fifteen days!

00:01:23.012 --> 00:01:26.012
He is a myth in Huelva and elsewhere.

00:01:37.013 --> 00:01:40.013
The singer needed to have a good knowledge 
of what he was doing

00:01:40.014 --> 00:01:44.014
because Miguel was seeing 
chords where nobody sees it

00:01:51.015 --> 00:01:54.015
People do not have a memory!

00:01:54.016 --> 00:01:57.016
Nor to know who is NiÃ±o Miguel!

00:02:00.017 --> 00:02:03.617
If I had to say something 
about the last time I saw him

00:02:03.618 --> 00:02:08.018
It was like an inside scream 
wanting to go out of his body

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:18.019
Diseases exist and they can attack any artist 
or active person and render them workless

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.020
We have to be there: Gypsies and non-gypsies!

00:02:23.021 --> 00:02:27.021
To make sure he won't get lost.

00:02:30.022 --> 00:02:34.022
The shadow of the strings
