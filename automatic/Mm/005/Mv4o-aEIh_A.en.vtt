there<00:01:36.030> likely<00:01:36.299> i'm<00:01:36.810> not<00:01:36.960> going<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.170> be<00:01:37.320> swayed

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
there likely i'm not going to be swayed

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.170 
there likely i'm not going to be swayed
by<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.770> fact<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.189> they<00:01:38.400> have<00:01:38.579> down<00:01:39.150> syndrome

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
by the fact that they have down syndrome

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.600 
by the fact that they have down syndrome
i<00:01:39.630> believe<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.400> honestly<00:01:41.400> i<00:01:41.490> think

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
i believe it is and honestly i think

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.340 
i believe it is and honestly i think
we're<00:01:41.939> more<00:01:42.060> insulting<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.750> them<00:01:42.840> if<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.140> treat

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
we're more insulting to them if I treat

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.539 
we're more insulting to them if I treat
you<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.530> micro<00:01:43.770> special<00:01:44.070> k<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.220> I'm<00:01:44.369> going<00:01:44.520> to

two minutes thirty and what three

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.800 
two minutes thirty and what three

00:04:47.989 --> 00:04:47.999 
kind of got lost in in the performance

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:49.790 
kind of got lost in in the performance
after<00:04:48.389> theirs<00:04:48.569> in<00:04:48.810> um<00:04:49.139> k<00:04:49.319> anyway<00:04:49.620> because

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
after theirs in um k anyway because

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.580 
after theirs in um k anyway because
Angelo<00:04:50.580> denial<00:04:50.909> that<00:04:50.999> was<00:04:51.120> a<00:04:51.150> weird<00:04:51.360> song<00:04:51.629> but

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
Angelo denial that was a weird song but

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.159 
Angelo denial that was a weird song but
I<00:04:53.360> kind<00:04:54.360> of<00:04:54.389> stopped<00:04:54.599> paying<00:04:54.749> attention<00:04:54.810> at

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
I kind of stopped paying attention at

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.010 
I kind of stopped paying attention at
that<00:04:55.259> point<00:04:55.469> so<00:04:55.740> I<00:04:56.069> don't<00:04:56.490> know<00:04:56.699> but<00:04:57.389> anyway

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
that point so I don't know but anyway

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.800 
that point so I don't know but anyway
performances<00:04:58.590> at<00:04:58.680> Eurovision<00:04:59.069> tend<00:04:59.400> to<00:04:59.810> more

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
performances at Eurovision tend to more

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.600 
performances at Eurovision tend to more
closely<00:05:00.990> resemble<00:05:01.379> the<00:05:01.889> studio<00:05:02.219> versions<00:05:02.550> of

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
closely resemble the studio versions of

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.100 
closely resemble the studio versions of
songs<00:05:02.819> anyway<00:05:03.240> so<00:05:03.300> I<00:05:03.539> don't<00:05:03.779> think<00:05:03.900> that<00:05:04.020> would

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
songs anyway so I don't think that would

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.350 
songs anyway so I don't think that would
be<00:05:04.169> doing<00:05:04.319> much<00:05:04.379> of<00:05:04.439> an<00:05:04.590> issue<00:05:04.680> over<00:05:05.360> waiting

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
be doing much of an issue over waiting

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.219 
be doing much of an issue over waiting

just want I just want to point out this
is<00:05:21.479> my<00:05:21.750> opinion<00:05:21.990> I'm<00:05:22.229> not<00:05:22.379> saying<00:05:22.620> it's<00:05:22.650> a<00:05:22.800> bad

00:05:27.829 --> 00:05:27.839 
forming an opinion of it really no pun

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:30.320 
forming an opinion of it really no pun
intended<00:05:27.960> because<00:05:28.379> you<00:05:28.589> know<00:05:28.710> finish<00:05:29.430> anyway

compared<00:05:30.930> to<00:05:31.020> last<00:05:31.169> year<00:05:31.669> something<00:05:32.669> better

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
compared to last year something better

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.689 
compared to last year something better
was<00:05:33.389> quite<00:05:33.689> literally<00:05:34.139> something<00:05:34.589> better<00:05:35.009> I

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 
was quite literally something better I

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:38.029 
was quite literally something better I
won't<00:05:36.150> say<00:05:36.389> this<00:05:36.599> song<00:05:36.839> is<00:05:37.169> a<00:05:37.229> bit<00:05:37.560> of<00:05:37.680> a<00:05:37.770> mess

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
won't say this song is a bit of a mess

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.439 
won't say this song is a bit of a mess
but<00:05:38.069> like<00:05:38.400> I<00:05:38.490> said<00:05:38.550> it<00:05:38.759> kind<00:05:39.000> of<00:05:39.240> feels

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:39.449 
but like I said it kind of feels

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:41.360 
but like I said it kind of feels
unfinished<00:05:40.050> but<00:05:40.860> that's<00:05:41.039> just<00:05:41.189> my<00:05:41.339> opinion

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
unfinished but that's just my opinion

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.610 
unfinished but that's just my opinion
now<00:05:42.120> some<00:05:42.599> people<00:05:42.629> try<00:05:43.020> to<00:05:43.050> explain<00:05:43.409> it<00:05:43.560> away

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
now some people try to explain it away

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.010 
now some people try to explain it away
by<00:05:43.949> telling<00:05:44.669> me<00:05:44.789> either<00:05:44.969> no<00:05:45.360> it's<00:05:45.599> just<00:05:45.750> punk

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
by telling me either no it's just punk

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.659 
by telling me either no it's just punk
music<00:05:46.229> you<00:05:46.439> understand<00:05:46.949> punk<00:05:47.219> music<00:05:47.430> or

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669 
music you understand punk music or

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:49.189 
music you understand punk music or
you're<00:05:48.149> just<00:05:48.180> discriminating<00:05:48.899> against<00:05:49.050> them

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 
you're just discriminating against them

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:50.420 
you're just discriminating against them
because<00:05:49.259> they<00:05:49.469> have<00:05:49.589> down<00:05:49.830> syndrome<00:05:49.860> and

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
because they have down syndrome and

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.490 
because they have down syndrome and
neither<00:05:50.759> of<00:05:50.939> those<00:05:51.060> things<00:05:51.120> is<00:05:51.479> true<00:05:51.750> I<00:05:51.960> quite

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
neither of those things is true I quite

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.260 
neither of those things is true I quite
like<00:05:52.710> punk<00:05:52.979> music<00:05:53.189> this<00:05:53.520> just<00:05:53.789> feels<00:05:54.000> too<00:05:54.149> much

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
like punk music this just feels too much

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.360 
like punk music this just feels too much
like<00:05:54.389> a<00:05:54.569> demo<00:05:54.839> for<00:05:55.080> me<00:05:55.199> to<00:05:55.319> really<00:05:55.500> think<00:05:56.129> of<00:05:56.279> it

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
like a demo for me to really think of it

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.700 
like a demo for me to really think of it
as<00:05:56.460> a<00:05:56.490> punk<00:05:56.759> song<00:05:57.149> as<00:05:57.419> much<00:05:57.629> as<00:05:57.779> a<00:05:57.810> punk<00:05:58.379> demo

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
as a punk song as much as a punk demo

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.249 
as a punk song as much as a punk demo
like<00:05:59.460> I<00:05:59.550> feel<00:05:59.789> like<00:05:59.819> this<00:06:00.750> is<00:06:00.870> a<00:06:00.899> proof<00:06:01.169> of

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:01.259 
like I feel like this is a proof of

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:03.200 
like I feel like this is a proof of
concept<00:06:01.439> and<00:06:01.770> then<00:06:01.860> they'll<00:06:02.039> produce<00:06:02.219> a<00:06:02.610> more

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
concept and then they'll produce a more

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.820 
concept and then they'll produce a more
complete<00:06:03.449> song<00:06:03.779> but<00:06:03.990> I<00:06:04.169> don't<00:06:04.500> know<00:06:04.560> i<00:06:04.740> don't

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
complete song but I don't know i don't

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.399 
complete song but I don't know i don't
think<00:06:05.159> that's<00:06:05.339> what<00:06:05.460> they<00:06:05.580> intend<00:06:05.789> to<00:06:05.879> do<00:06:05.969> and

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:06.409 
think that's what they intend to do and

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:08.689 
think that's what they intend to do and
secondly<00:06:07.409> i'm<00:06:07.680> not<00:06:08.009> discriminating<00:06:08.490> against

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:08.699 
secondly i'm not discriminating against

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:10.429 
secondly i'm not discriminating against
them<00:06:08.849> at<00:06:08.939> all<00:06:09.089> if<00:06:09.479> i<00:06:09.719> don't<00:06:09.899> like<00:06:10.020> the<00:06:10.169> song<00:06:10.289> i

00:06:10.429 --> 00:06:10.439 
them at all if i don't like the song i

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:12.079 
them at all if i don't like the song i
don't<00:06:10.620> like<00:06:10.770> the<00:06:10.919> song<00:06:11.039> the<00:06:11.580> situation<00:06:12.000> that

00:06:12.079 --> 00:06:12.089 
don't like the song the situation that

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:13.579 
don't like the song the situation that
the<00:06:12.180> performers<00:06:12.539> rin<00:06:12.719> has<00:06:12.930> no<00:06:13.199> bearing<00:06:13.379> on

00:06:13.579 --> 00:06:13.589 
the performers rin has no bearing on

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:16.040 
the performers rin has no bearing on
that<00:06:13.649> and<00:06:14.089> like<00:06:15.089> I<00:06:15.120> said<00:06:15.270> when<00:06:15.449> I<00:06:15.479> first<00:06:15.719> formed

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
that and like I said when I first formed

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.300 
that and like I said when I first formed
my<00:06:16.139> opinions<00:06:16.469> of<00:06:16.529> the<00:06:16.649> song<00:06:16.800> I<00:06:16.919> didn't<00:06:17.189> even

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
my opinions of the song I didn't even

00:06:56.959 --> 00:06:56.969 
like that anyway will it qualify well at

00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:59.209 
like that anyway will it qualify well at
the<00:06:57.330> time<00:06:57.360> of<00:06:57.719> recording<00:06:58.199> its<00:06:58.409> third<00:06:58.769> favorite

00:06:59.209 --> 00:06:59.219 
the time of recording its third favorite

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:01.219 
the time of recording its third favorite
to<00:06:59.339> win<00:06:59.519> in<00:06:59.669> the<00:06:59.759> betting<00:06:59.909> odds<00:07:00.149> and<00:07:00.300> I<00:07:00.959> think

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:01.229 
to win in the betting odds and I think

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:03.469 
to win in the betting odds and I think
it<00:07:01.379> will<00:07:01.589> either<00:07:01.860> do<00:07:02.159> very<00:07:02.580> well<00:07:02.699> out<00:07:03.300> of<00:07:03.360> the

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 
it will either do very well out of the

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:04.820 
it will either do very well out of the
same<00:07:03.659> kind<00:07:03.809> of<00:07:03.959> mentality<00:07:04.169> that<00:07:04.379> brought<00:07:04.709> the

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:04.830 
same kind of mentality that brought the

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.350 
same kind of mentality that brought the
burden<00:07:05.039> off<00:07:05.099> ski<00:07:05.279> babushki<00:07:05.759> to<00:07:05.909> second<00:07:06.209> place

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360 
burden off ski babushki to second place

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.329

rather<00:07:08.580> than<00:07:08.729> the<00:07:08.909> song<00:07:09.119> or<00:07:09.599> they'll<00:07:10.439> flop<00:07:10.739> to

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:10.889 
rather than the song or they'll flop to

rather than the song or they'll flop to
last<00:07:11.099> place<00:07:11.369> I<00:07:11.489> don't<00:07:11.639> think<00:07:11.789> there'll<00:07:11.939> be<00:07:11.969> an

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:12.179 
last place I don't think there'll be an

00:07:12.179 --> 00:07:14.179 
last place I don't think there'll be an
in-between<00:07:12.330> but<00:07:13.169> i<00:07:13.199> will<00:07:13.379> say<00:07:13.499> i<00:07:13.529> don't<00:07:13.889> think

00:07:14.179 --> 00:07:14.189 
in-between but i will say i don't think

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:15.769 
in-between but i will say i don't think
the<00:07:14.309> jury<00:07:14.550> votes<00:07:14.789> will<00:07:14.969> be<00:07:15.089> very<00:07:15.269> kind<00:07:15.539> to<00:07:15.629> them

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:15.779 
the jury votes will be very kind to them

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:17.569 
the jury votes will be very kind to them
