 have it adjusted by maharaja in a 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.530
 final phase since the horse was 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.940
 unfortunate in the price of France where the 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.480
 late to find the opening in the 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.969
 final phase 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.500

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.620
 will ask him number 6 at the ball 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.410
 also ran well in america 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.579
 finishing pleasantly and having 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.860
 repeated recently in the price of France 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.199
 it is also part of the choices 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.890
 priority of this competition on 15 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.760
 it's roxane griff one of the stars of 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.160
 this winter meeting 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.660

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.189
 France Group 1 to his credit constitutes 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.510
 an iron lady she repeats all her 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.770
 races she also made the finish 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.570
 from the grand prix of america to win 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.310
 this race this big prepare in 2012 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.330
 once again she should 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.340
 finish on arrival of this 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.439
 competition so three horses that 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.509
 seem to come off the 11 respond 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.240
 quit the seesus the year duval and the 15 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.619
 roxane griff but the opponents do not 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.450
 do not miss to start with the number 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.310
 12 second pond tiego of this 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.689
 race last also has a 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.909
 nice final speed spike if he can 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.189
 preserve it it will be formidable on the 13th 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.110
 yarrah boko irreproachable this winter 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.329
 must the only Swedish from this 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.729
 competition will try and so to 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.259
 confirm the success of swedish people this 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.240
 winter in vincennes after maharaja and or 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.070
 has been sacred of ink and France so 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.409
 attention number 13 yarrah boko he has 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.079
 also of quality and is fit 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.119
 I will then keep number 13 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.530
 sun of the ditch that will have for him his 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.770
 holding a horse hard to the effort 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.000
 in my opinion 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.460
 can come spice up the reports of 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.170
 this race the 14th royal dream it does not 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.000
 must not condemn it hastily 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.799
 do not forget that this is a prize winner 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.929
 of america and as such he deserves the 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.490
 greatest attention and number of 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:06.969
 taormina dishes go to a side 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.229
 outsider 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:09.819
 it is barred for the first 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.950
 places but I guess we'll run 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.140
 hidden in ambush and she knows how to finish 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.849
 quickly the brave and puts his heart 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.769
 on the track and at this little game there she 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.670
 can come scoop up a 4th 5th place at 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.110
 nice odds 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.930
 mistrust is needed for amateurs 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.769
 of quinté abstract figures and 11 6 and 15 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.440
 and 12 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.599
 then the 13 the 5th the 14th and the 2nd 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.340
 concerning the continuation of the program before 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.049
 scene in the 3rd I really like the 311 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.340
 or not the rib that represents 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.290
 very fit training of people the 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.720
 claude dersoir she has already won three 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.760
 wins this winter on the ash 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.019
 Parisian is once again a 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.299
 first chance theoretical I will ask myself 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.829
 310 in your life which will be sold out 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.450
 four for this beautiful commitment reserved 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:49.420
 only to the mares attention she 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.610
 she can worry a horrible 309 310 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.250
 in the sixth time trust too 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.780
 without this intense vision that has already 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.250
 won three semi classic wins 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.380
 this winter she was disqualified 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.700
 lately the price of the centaurs he 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.170
 must be bought back as much as she 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.880
 has in one 14 the best 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.560
 mileage reduction on this route 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.510
 it's a first chance in this price 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.299
 paul datar a group test 2 on 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.920
 will oppose him the 605 val dd 2 March which 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.420
 has just been sacred in the price of 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.819
 centaurs a group event i a 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.290
 confirmation here is expected 606 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.910
 also his castellet waltzes which 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.410
 repeat all his races at this level 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.769
 irreproachable and regular in the same way 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.930
 society 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:26.230
 his place is on the podium if they are 7 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.599
 605 and 606 whose 8th I like a lot 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.889

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:33.370
 ambitions she is always presented to 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.239
 well in the discipline she will be 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.630
 barefoot for the occasion 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.910
 she is a winner in the 813 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.490
 to know hellish sun that I you 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.470

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.270
 two previous cities 806 813 812 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.950

 saddle we just prepared it for trot 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.220
 hitched up so it goes back to the mounted trot 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.040

 it is a horse that is manageable 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.950
 had done all his races and run 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.420
 previously in September are 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.030
 excusable galloping twice 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.500

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.700
 well he had been disturbed by a 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.620
 race who was who had been 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.330
 rescued so this one are sixteen 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.850
 thunder margins and a credit merit

 centrality high-charente man who to 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.920
 my opinion deserves to prevail 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.140
 he who comes to be noticed at 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.720
 vincennes by finishing very quickly who is 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.270
 very well when walking a break-in 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.980

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.840
 lot know also that in meeting iii 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.890
