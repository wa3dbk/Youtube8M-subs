00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.710
 the structuring of space 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:11.249
 this know-how 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:13.829
 he is difficult 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:18.550
 a sculpture garden mini rally bulimie security prompting the 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.550
 contemplation he is the enemy of the textile 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:33.630
 all the facts that made me an evening every day 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.390
 especially the garden 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.360
 you can discover% 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.650
 the rest of the garden had to create envied 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.920
 it was necessary to create a desire it was necessary 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.850
 virgin meaningless in this garden and I want it to be racist but as well 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:46.580
 party 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.580
 q my living room 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.630
 she had a slippage in terms of ready to put 50 two players from 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.690
 height difference 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.040
 and then he came in the end to work the way step 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.200
 we decided to look for a material 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.710
 able 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.500
 ability to meet our expectations 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.450
 as well in the risk elevation design on stairs 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.460
 first the choice turned to the walls the floors because it is a product 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.460
 which is relatively easy we will say to work as well in the rights 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.710
 than in streams 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.200
 and on the other hand, there was a homogeneity at the level of 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.020
 the architectured and seen the general silhouette of the garden with a single and 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.020
 same product 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.520
 it's a garden on the other hand 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.240
 the playful but all in minimal is at the same time creative ect especially 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.590
 that contemplative 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.280
 we actually wanted 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.540
 to win the bet of telling ourselves our customers are happy when they are 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.540
 in the garden at the limit a little better than when they are in their living room 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.020
 created for this English garden 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.930
