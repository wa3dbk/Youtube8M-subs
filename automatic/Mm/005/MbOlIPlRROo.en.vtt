00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
I think I was 305 dollars because the

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.960 
I think I was 305 dollars because the
prices<00:03:12.379> went<00:03:12.769> up<00:03:12.829> it<00:03:13.040> used<00:03:13.220> to<00:03:13.310> be<00:03:13.720> 295<00:03:14.720> but<00:03:15.170> um

the<00:03:16.970> price<00:03:17.180> is<00:03:17.389> right<00:03:17.420> so<00:03:18.319> the<00:03:18.470> second<00:03:18.889> item<00:03:19.010> I

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250

sites<00:07:13.189> slice<00:07:14.189> I<00:07:14.579> said<00:07:14.939> so<00:07:15.119> haha<00:07:15.509> but<00:07:16.349> here<00:07:16.589> we

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:16.709 
sites slice I said so haha but here we

00:07:16.709 --> 00:07:20.359 
sites slice I said so haha but here we
go<00:07:16.829> that's<00:07:17.489> the<00:07:17.699> comparison<00:07:18.529> if<00:07:19.529> I<00:07:19.889> try<00:07:20.339> to

00:07:20.359 --> 00:07:20.369 
go that's the comparison if I try to

00:07:20.369 --> 00:07:24.319 
go that's the comparison if I try to
like<00:07:21.179> put<00:07:21.419> it<00:07:21.509> up<00:07:21.719> words<00:07:22.079> like<00:07:22.139> that<00:07:22.669> it's<00:07:23.669> not

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:24.329 
like put it up words like that it's not
