and then you need this piece about four

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:21.810 
and then you need this piece about four
of<00:01:08.880> them

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.700 

that's<00:01:23.170> legal<00:01:24.170> of<00:01:24.320> these<00:01:26.080> fit<00:01:27.080> just<00:01:27.380> on<00:01:27.620> the

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
that's legal of these fit just on the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.470 
that's legal of these fit just on the
very<00:01:27.890> in<00:01:28.070> that<00:01:30.700> and<00:01:31.700> then<00:01:31.880> you<00:01:31.970> fill<00:01:32.150> the<00:01:32.270> side

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
very in that and then you fill the side

00:01:32.480 --> 00:02:01.650 
very in that and then you fill the side
again

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:08.889 

shut<00:02:02.660> up<00:02:02.750> that<00:02:02.960> back<00:02:05.260> and<00:02:06.260> then<00:02:06.440> you<00:02:06.560> take<00:02:07.899> two

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
shut up that back and then you take two

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.910 
shut up that back and then you take two
of<00:02:08.929> these<00:02:09.940> cut<00:02:10.940> some<00:02:11.090> up<00:02:13.600> one<00:02:14.600> of<00:02:14.690> these<00:02:14.920> bit

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
of these cut some up one of these bit

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.460 
of these cut some up one of these bit
just<00:02:16.130> in

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.009

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
so you sure about like a rectangle just

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:27.170 
so you sure about like a rectangle just
a<00:02:22.530> little<00:02:22.799> squirt<00:02:23.659> this<00:02:24.659> answer<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:27.030> need

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
a little squirt this answer and you need

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:35.470 
a little squirt this answer and you need
to<00:02:27.329> take<00:02:28.310> each<00:02:29.310> step<00:02:30.470> from<00:02:31.470> at<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.680> bottom

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.759 

take<00:02:36.500> lots<00:02:37.500> of<00:02:37.650> these<00:02:38.569> fill<00:02:39.569> it<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:40.349> see<00:02:40.530> what

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
take lots of these fill it and see what

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.539 
take lots of these fill it and see what
like<00:02:41.459> three<00:02:42.260> three<00:02:43.260> rectangles<00:02:44.040> face<00:02:44.250> left

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
like three three rectangles face left

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:54.800 
like three three rectangles face left
like<00:02:44.819> that<00:02:45.530> so<00:02:46.530> now<00:02:46.709> you've<00:02:47.310> got<00:02:47.340> your<00:02:47.790> own<00:02:53.810> you

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
instead of just trying hard to find all

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.960 
instead of just trying hard to find all
that<00:03:29.080> messy<00:03:30.080> hard<00:03:30.350> bits<00:03:30.680> but<00:03:31.250> really<00:03:31.580> hard<00:03:31.790> to
