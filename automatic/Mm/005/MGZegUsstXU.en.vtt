00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.190
 hi my name is denis today i am ready 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.350
 tell you about the car Kiryu 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.690
 Carry's Car Bubble Data 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.220
 manufactured since 2011 and at this 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.260
 moment he looked like mine and so 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.560
 This car belongs to the soup 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:40.250
 compact class cars 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:43.400
 which roughly corresponds to the European 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.020
 b class but since its length 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.450
 is just over 4 meters of it 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.450
 even class b plus is counted 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.800
 This model is equipped with an engine 16 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:04.030
 123 horsepower 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.910
 also the car comes in picking 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.520
 with engine 14 engines in general 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.570
 dining room is the most classic 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.860
 4-cylinder 16-valve with 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.630
 distributed injection people 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.620
 called dohc trim happens 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.510
 only in dark colors 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.690
 only differs in more simple 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.520
 picking a simpler finish on 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.340
 higher reputation goes special 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.720
 customer stain resistant fabric 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.310
 this suite suite is 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.920
 manual transmission also 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.200
 There is also an automatic audio system and 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.710
 all the necessary functions that are needed by anyone 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.310
 driver this heated seats heated 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.960
 steering wheel 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.150
 heated windshield in the parking zone 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.729
 windshield wipers 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.960
 mirrors and rear window 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.229
 if we look at the back row 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.880
 there is enough space here for 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.340
 comfortable seating two principles can 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.630
 will even put 3 people but all in 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.399
 body dependency 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.679
 also the rear seat backs can 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.569
 fold in the range of 60 by 40 what 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:03.429
 will let put some lengthy 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:07.600
 cargo ski snowboard 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:09.789
 for example for the winter card is not here 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.069
 we are represented in the back of a mobile hatchback 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.069
 luggage capacity of 360 liters 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.800
 also they are sedan with volume 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.360
 luggage compartment in 500 species in general 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.550
 enough space for some domestic needs 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.819
 but again 3 stroller here not 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.819
 fit 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.330
 below us is a full-sized 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.849
 spare wheel driver's seat 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.890
 equipped to the maximum all you need 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.810
 again there is nothing superfluous 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.209
 this is the front electric windows 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.910
 rear seats central locking and also 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.950
 and rivers electric side mirrors 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.780
 Also in this configuration is all 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.510
 heated front and rear heated 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.459
 Seat and side windshield booster 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.010
 mirrors and rear window + 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.930
 go audio control buttons on 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.930
 steering wheel well and air conditioning respectively 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:08.260
 here we are at maximum 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.940
 bundling our most premium 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.569
 maximum current day to this 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.660
 kia rio 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.549
 actually this car is equipped 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.549
 only two engines is 14 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.190
 by 107 and shawls and 16 by 123 horses 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:23.200
 strength 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:26.230
 here it is exactly 123 horsepower 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.980
 and, in principle, it is enough for him 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.870
 even if the compare cars 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.290
 cars of other brands 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.219
 classmates 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:40.450
 such as Renault Logan volkswagen polo 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:43.569
 let all solaris dynamics they will have 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.599
 principle is identical to the engine here everything 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:49.060
 atmospheric that 14 what 16 respectively 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.920
 the movie never really chased 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.920
 big speaker and they're always bigger 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.799
 focused on engine life but 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:00.310
 hence by the way the warranty on these machines she 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:02.409
 is 5 years old or 150 thousand run 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.470
 My view is a lot of gearbox here 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:06.730
 the most classic are they 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.109
 four -step or five-step 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.030
 4-speed automatic 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.200
 either five-step mechanics on 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.209
 engine 14 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.959
 either a six-speed automatic and mechanics 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:19.209
 on the 16th engine shorter despite being 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.360
 what is the classic suspension here 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:26.720
 front mcpherson rear semi-dependent 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.979
 torsion beam machine enters perfectly 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.400
 There are of course many opinions on this subject. 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:34.650
 but in general for city mode 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.380
 Yes, and even with a dynamic driving on the track 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:41.360
 and and more than enough 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:43.550
 In general, the interior is not throws all 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.349
 made in classic style 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.599
 i always loved red 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:50.580
 the lights are all socially red 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:52.410
 pretty computer board colors 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:58.289
 contrast and everything is perfectly visible on it 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:05:01.319
 even in sunny weather but the radio 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:03.840
 already harder sunny weather and starts 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:05.280
 Glare in this configuration with us 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.169
 its represented climate control 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.389
 simpler versions respectively 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:11.190
 it will be possible to find air conditioning in essence 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.409
 even in the most basic configuration here 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.599
 you can find and heated steering wheel and 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:17.370
 heated seats for yes and heated 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:18.750
 side mirrors even 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.720
 windshield is heated in the zone 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.090
 wiper stations 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.159
 so the principle for the Russian climate 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.919
 even the basic configuration there on 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:30.810
 mechanics voiced 14 of them enough dashing 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.539
 all other little things that should 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.330
 attend mobile here too 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:39.289
 starting with electric mirrors 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:41.639
 I finish there electro with lifts 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:43.710
 classic power steering by the way here 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:46.880
 therefore installed also in operation 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:50.510
 does not require any special 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.340
 terms of service despite the fact that 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.860
 as far as the budget higher face 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.930
 tation in the cabin and leather 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.820
 trim visor and leather on the steering wheel 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:03.970
 and leather-trimmed shift lever 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:06.380
 Gear coupled with glossy black 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.780
 finish 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:12.700
 audio system and on-board computers 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.700
 look pretty spectacular bathroom
