00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.340 
other thing was while I was craving this
I<00:01:00.180> thought<00:01:00.359> well<00:01:00.539> maybe<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:01.109> need<00:01:01.320> to

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
I thought well maybe I just need to

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.680 
I thought well maybe I just need to
refresh<00:01:01.770> my<00:01:02.039> color<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.670> let<00:01:02.820> me<00:01:02.910> do<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> silicone

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
refresh my color so let me do a silicone

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.969 
refresh my color so let me do a silicone
treatment<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.439> it's<00:01:05.159> really<00:01:05.549> interesting<00:01:06.979> to

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
treatment and it's really interesting to

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.719 
treatment and it's really interesting to
see<00:01:08.150> the<00:01:09.150> difference<00:01:09.799> when<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:10.830> color<00:01:11.520> your

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
see the difference when you color your

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.570 
see the difference when you color your
hair<00:01:11.790> with<00:01:12.119> LOX<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.930> when<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:14.010> color<00:01:14.280> your

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
hair with LOX and when you color your

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.219 
hair with LOX and when you color your
hair<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.909> lose<00:01:15.210> one<00:01:15.600> thing<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:16.020> have

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
hair and lose one thing I have

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.920 
hair and lose one thing I have
definitely<00:01:16.740> noticed<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.700> loose<00:01:18.630> hair

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
definitely noticed is that loose hair

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.109 
definitely noticed is that loose hair
takes<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.500> color<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.950> lot<00:01:20.250> more<00:01:20.580> than<00:01:20.850> locked

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
takes the color a lot more than locked

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.820 
takes the color a lot more than locked
hair<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:22.590> cellophane<00:01:23.250> treatment<00:01:23.759> is

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
hair and that cellophane treatment is

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.149 
hair and that cellophane treatment is
red<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.100> it's<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.869> I<00:01:27.869> guess<00:01:28.200> like<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.439> blue<00:01:28.829> based

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
red and it's a I guess like a blue based

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.140 
red and it's a I guess like a blue based
red<00:01:29.520> or<00:01:30.299> violet<00:01:30.960> red<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:32.310> really<00:01:32.700> took<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
red or violet red and it really took the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.069 
red or violet red and it really took the
color<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.659> while<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.020> color<00:01:34.350> was<00:01:34.740> beautiful

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
color and while the color was beautiful

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.410 
color and while the color was beautiful
it<00:01:37.079> didn't<00:01:37.470> suit<00:01:37.590> my<00:01:37.799> skin<00:01:37.860> tone<00:01:38.420> whatsoever

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
it didn't suit my skin tone whatsoever

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.410 
it didn't suit my skin tone whatsoever
and<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.650> way<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:40.829> can<00:01:41.310> tell<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:42.000> when<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.270> do

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
and the way I can tell that is when I do

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.440 
and the way I can tell that is when I do
a<00:01:42.570> color<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.439> feel<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:44.159> need<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.520> wear<00:01:44.939> makeup

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
demi-permanent meaning it's last longer

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.999 
demi-permanent meaning it's last longer
than<00:04:43.419> a<00:04:43.479> semi-permanent<00:04:44.050> but<00:04:44.740> it's<00:04:45.069> not<00:04:45.520> is

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
like the results from it because you

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.200 
like the results from it because you

can't tell here what I like about it is

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.499 
can't tell here what I like about it is
just<00:05:37.240> the<00:05:37.569> condition<00:05:38.349> that<00:05:38.699> it<00:05:39.699> left<00:05:39.969> my<00:05:40.240> hair

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:40.509 
just the condition that it left my hair

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:42.570 
just the condition that it left my hair
and<00:05:40.719> it<00:05:40.870> gives<00:05:41.080> it<00:05:41.229> a<00:05:41.319> really<00:05:41.500> nice<00:05:41.770> Sheen<00:05:42.279> and

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
and it gives it a really nice Sheen and

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.969 
and it gives it a really nice Sheen and
as<00:05:43.210> dark<00:05:43.630> as<00:05:43.810> it<00:05:43.960> is<00:05:44.199> it<00:05:44.469> is<00:05:44.500> pretty

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
as dark as it is it is pretty

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:46.230 
as dark as it is it is pretty
multifaceted

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
multifaceted

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:52.159 
multifaceted
faceted<00:05:46.960> for<00:05:47.710> a<00:05:48.009> single<00:05:49.229> deposit<00:05:50.229> color<00:05:50.440> and

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
faceted for a single deposit color and

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:56.159 
faceted for a single deposit color and
yeah<00:05:53.169> so<00:05:53.680> I<00:05:53.949> imagine<00:05:54.370> that<00:05:54.699> the<00:05:55.539> other<00:05:55.719> colors

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:56.169 
yeah so I imagine that the other colors

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:58.769 
yeah so I imagine that the other colors
would<00:05:56.590> have<00:05:56.770> been<00:05:57.099> you<00:05:58.060> know<00:05:58.180> if<00:05:58.330> I<00:05:58.479> had<00:05:58.599> gone

00:05:58.769 --> 00:05:58.779 
would have been you know if I had gone

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:01.050 
would have been you know if I had gone
for<00:05:59.289> the<00:05:59.380> shade<00:05:59.590> I<00:05:59.620> want<00:05:59.949> would<00:06:00.159> have<00:06:00.279> come<00:06:00.639> you

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
for the shade I want would have come you

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.839 
for the shade I want would have come you
know<00:06:01.449> just<00:06:01.810> as<00:06:02.020> well<00:06:02.229> and<00:06:02.560> from<00:06:03.460> what<00:06:03.699> I've

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:03.849 
know just as well and from what I've

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:11.070 
know just as well and from what I've
read<00:06:05.009> it's<00:06:06.090> their<00:06:07.090> Browns<00:06:07.860> don't<00:06:08.909> you<00:06:10.080> turn

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
read it's their Browns don't you turn

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.010 
read it's their Browns don't you turn
brassy<00:06:12.009> which<00:06:12.400> is<00:06:12.610> the<00:06:12.759> reason<00:06:13.240> that<00:06:13.539> I<00:06:13.779> also

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
brassy which is the reason that I also

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.839 
brassy which is the reason that I also
wanted<00:06:14.469> to<00:06:14.529> choose<00:06:14.889> this<00:06:15.099> line<00:06:15.370> because<00:06:15.580> a<00:06:15.610> lot

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:15.849 
wanted to choose this line because a lot

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:17.879 
wanted to choose this line because a lot
of<00:06:15.880> times<00:06:16.240> when<00:06:16.449> I've<00:06:16.569> dyed<00:06:16.960> my<00:06:17.199> hair<00:06:17.229> back<00:06:17.590> to

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:17.889 
of times when I've dyed my hair back to

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:20.640 
of times when I've dyed my hair back to
its<00:06:18.069> color<00:06:18.370> before<00:06:18.669> the<00:06:19.539> Browns<00:06:19.840> eventually

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
its color before the Browns eventually

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.950 
its color before the Browns eventually
would<00:06:20.800> start<00:06:21.069> turning<00:06:21.550> brassy<00:06:21.880> and<00:06:22.479> that's

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
would start turning brassy and that's

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.439 
would start turning brassy and that's
just<00:06:23.259> annoying<00:06:23.529> but<00:06:23.949> I've<00:06:24.219> from<00:06:24.880> the<00:06:25.000> reviews
