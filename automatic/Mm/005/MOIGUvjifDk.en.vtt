00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.040
 hello to all the idevice tutorial so 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.549
 today a new video so we 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.540
 asked me to make a video 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.099
 finally several videos on again 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.869
 produce fighters so betas 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.790
 this phenomenon so today we are going 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.960
 so start the first part so 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.140
 the first part will be the preparation 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.240
 of the aquarium for repression so 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.340
 to make this reproduction we will have 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.650
 need them a little pot so of 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:35.210
 jam or any 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:38.000
 then we will need a 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.760
 heating so here I have one and half 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.070
 to the nÃ®mes thibaut monnet wati monopuce 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:49.010
 then also speak a little bit of 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.360
 polystyrene so as posted to the door 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:56.510
 for the contributions and we will need 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.989
 of an aquarium as well as necessarily a 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.930
 evil fighter is a rebel fighter 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:05.900
 so not 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:11.030
 start the aquarium first we go already 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.560
 go get some water prepare 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.870
 so that I explain to you how he has 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.090
 prepared from the kata leaf not so 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.590
 not immediately then so for 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.580
 prepare these rates we will need a 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:25.340
 basin with water and we will need 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.750
 also khat leaves brings so 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.020
 a kata leaf passes between hamas to 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.930
 gaza 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.060
 he does like that so the blues the safety 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.100
 as a sheet for 15 to 20 beds including 2.6 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.800
 a bowl of 15 so I put a 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.149
 leaf we see loulo and brown and 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.880
 we only after you take any 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:48.770
 bottle of water and you fill 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.390
 fill the drop and up to fold 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.899
 in watercolor or against jean 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.280
 after the full I'm back here so I 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.270
 will fill the com explains forget 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.670
 unfortunately because the bottle 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:05.210
 is possible to fill with beauty 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:08.269
 so we fill with about 10 to 20 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:12.260
 centimeters of tall water why 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:14.480
 because when the hurt when the flex 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.360
 because the evil recovered will be more 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.160
 easy for him and if the graves hurt 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.890
 to go recover more easily and 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.890
 instead of addressing the flaws so there 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.890
 although it may open up it's worth 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.390
 So really not much later then 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:41.450
 it's good sign there because we serve 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:44.700
 in anything so once you 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.470
 that you have prepared that so you 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.080
 fill in the little bit of 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.290
 confusion and bring emptiness to the 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.290
 to prepare 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:59.790
 that's it and you put it in the water because 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.230
 that in fact it will serve it well for 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.660
 put the femmelle for easter where for 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.940
 the first presentation 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.170
 then a small piece of polystyrene 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.060
 so it matters the thickness means big 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.700
 thickness what I found that you 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.959
 put it in a corner like that evil 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.040
 when he will make bubbles every 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:20.420
 bubbles will go into a corner the 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.700
 heating you place it anywhere 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:27.170
 anywhere from the moment that's there it's 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.170
 at the level of your tax that is needed 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.980
 like that 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.819
 here and so here I will leave 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.349
 the water finally acclimatize the heated water 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.849
 and early to be able to welcome my 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.620
 fighters so there after the connection 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:50.300
 water 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.239
 all joined me for the second 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.319
 part so it will be the presentation the 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.150
 presentation of the two fighters 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.410
 so thank you for winning this first 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.360
 video on the art pollution of 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:04.209
 fighters I hope you liked it 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.209
 and so next is the most
