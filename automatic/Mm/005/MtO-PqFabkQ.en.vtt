00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:11.349
 are missing here in sporty rhythm today 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.719
 We wanted to dominate our fear for 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:16.119
 heights learning to fly helicopters 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.490

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:27.390
 learn in a single day the basics and 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.390
 to be able to fly this sophisticated machinery 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:40.019
 because you no no no no it seems very 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.730
 well it says that we are going here just to fly 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.860

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.870
 I'm going to have others and then we're going to 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.089
 be around here for the area now that 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.190
 goes diving up until we learn 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.220
 how high are we going to walk with the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.120
 premier 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.120
 500 500 feet 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.470
 Even if we fall, it was worth only here 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.210

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.440

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.950
 I do not think once you have seen that no 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.630

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.280

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.880
 helicopter 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.040
 that is, there is everything and for all 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.050
 likes there are people who want to dedicate themselves to 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.280
 piloting helicopters professionally and 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.530
 there are people who have but more like 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.570

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.410
 see what happens and without testament or anything 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.410

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.880
 of course more he explained everything to us about 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.100
 the safety and the process during and 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.450
 before starting our class already 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.550
 we are about to take the flight 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.020
 but before that, he will give us some classes 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.680
 illas of what we can expect 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.210
 in here so let's get on 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.210
 now you cantit me god keep us 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.200
 today at the door I am the one who goes to 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.330
 turn the helicopter thanks for 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.460
 that responsibility I loved it ok 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.410
 everything is very sensitive this is sensitive 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.990
 the pedals and accessible movements 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:11.380
 They have to be delicate as I am so 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.620
 delicate is going to be perfect and good 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.250
 we come here so let's go slow 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.590
 but sure 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.930
 we ascended to more than 500 feet in height 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.650
 where we could appreciate many panoramas 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.350
 beautiful of lebanon ohio but that yes no 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.870
 could lack the displeasure that was not done 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.750
 wait when more put me in charge to me 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.550
 of the ship and we honestly told each other 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.030
 tell friends that a woman at the wheel 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:40.739
 walking danger I assure you that it is much 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.739
 harder than you imagine 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.290
 the feeling of grief in these 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.640
 helicopters is ideal for all 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.160
 those who want to have their license 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.250
 professional flight or simply 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.350
 look for something risky or different good 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.780
 we did it we landed safe and sound 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.820
 the truth I learned enough things is a 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.650
 experience that is worth it because you 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.840
 grab one the wave to the monitors to 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.410
 the pedals to the lever so they are the 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.410
 I recommend a lot 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.760
 thanks to you if you want to upload your 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.310

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.140

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.880
