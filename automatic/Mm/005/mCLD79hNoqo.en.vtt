I've done this a while back I'm than

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:18.189 
I've done this a while back I'm than
that<00:00:16.309> probably<00:00:16.550> about<00:00:16.789> a<00:00:16.850> year<00:00:16.939> ago<00:00:17.210> what<00:00:17.990> or

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:18.199 
that probably about a year ago what or

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:19.840 
that probably about a year ago what or
why<00:00:18.320> did<00:00:18.500> I<00:00:18.590> was<00:00:18.740> brought<00:00:18.890> it<00:00:19.070> into<00:00:19.189> a<00:00:19.310> new<00:00:19.609> map

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
why did I was brought it into a new map

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.420 
why did I was brought it into a new map
and<00:00:20.119> I<00:00:20.359> have<00:00:20.600> added<00:00:20.750> a<00:00:20.900> few<00:00:21.109> trucks<00:00:21.439> into<00:00:22.340> the

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
and I have added a few trucks into the

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.220 
and I have added a few trucks into the
selection<00:00:22.910> here<00:00:23.060> like<00:00:23.359> different<00:00:23.900> colors<00:00:24.109> and

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
selection here like different colors and

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.660 
selection here like different colors and
stuff<00:00:24.349> like<00:00:24.529> that<00:00:24.590> so<00:00:24.920> I<00:00:25.160> thought<00:00:25.519> would<00:00:25.609> be

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
stuff like that so I thought would be

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.429 
stuff like that so I thought would be
nice<00:00:25.910> instead<00:00:26.119> of<00:00:26.420> sand<00:00:26.750> where<00:00:27.019> which<00:00:27.260> they

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
nice instead of sand where which they

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.080 
nice instead of sand where which they
were<00:00:27.590> carrying<00:00:28.070> us<00:00:28.340> what<00:00:28.550> would<00:00:28.640> be<00:00:28.699> nice<00:00:28.789> kind

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
were carrying us what would be nice kind

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.839 
were carrying us what would be nice kind
of<00:00:29.150> replacing<00:00:29.480> with<00:00:29.750> TNT's<00:00:30.500> and<00:00:30.859> yes<00:00:31.460> we<00:00:31.640> don't

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849 
of replacing with TNT's and yes we don't

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:33.520 
of replacing with TNT's and yes we don't
actually<00:00:32.029> lit<00:00:32.360> the<00:00:32.480> whole<00:00:32.630> things<00:00:32.870> go<00:00:33.110> off<00:00:33.290> in

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
actually lit the whole things go off in

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.290 
actually lit the whole things go off in
a<00:00:33.710> second<00:00:34.130> and<00:00:34.310> we're<00:00:34.490> gonna<00:00:34.580> see<00:00:34.790> a<00:00:34.820> nice

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
a second and we're gonna see a nice

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.990 
a second and we're gonna see a nice
collaboration<00:00:36.170> trucks<00:00:37.100> going<00:00:37.370> off<00:00:37.610> at<00:00:37.820> the

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
collaboration trucks going off at the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.180 
collaboration trucks going off at the
same<00:00:38.240> time<00:00:38.540> hopefully<00:00:38.840> so<00:00:39.560> I<00:00:39.590> think<00:00:39.860> I'll

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
same time hopefully so I think I'll

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.350 
same time hopefully so I think I'll
probably<00:00:40.340> one<00:00:40.580> after<00:00:40.880> another<00:00:40.910> thing<00:00:41.270> is

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
probably one after another thing is

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.480 
probably one after another thing is
gonna<00:00:41.480> be<00:00:41.660> a<00:00:41.690> really<00:00:41.900> epic<00:00:42.680> and<00:00:43.070> really<00:00:43.310> cool

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:43.490

and I love all of these different colors
and<00:00:45.860> yeah<00:00:46.730> I<00:00:46.760> think<00:00:46.940> I'm<00:00:47.150> gonna<00:00:47.270> actually<00:00:47.480> spot

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
and yeah I think I'm gonna actually spot

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.570 
and yeah I think I'm gonna actually spot
this<00:00:47.960> street<00:00:48.260> way<00:00:48.410> because<00:00:48.740> it's<00:00:48.770> quite<00:00:49.310> of<00:00:49.490> a

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.580 
this street way because it's quite of a

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.420 
this street way because it's quite of a
long<00:00:49.760> line<00:00:49.970> we<00:00:50.180> have<00:00:50.330> about<00:00:50.600> oh<00:00:51.190> I've<00:00:52.190> gotta

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
long line we have about oh I've gotta

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.160 
long line we have about oh I've gotta
count<00:00:52.700> I<00:00:52.820> think<00:00:53.030> we<00:00:53.090> have<00:00:53.120> a<00:00:53.240> round<00:00:53.480> at<00:00:53.600> 10<00:00:53.990> to

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
count I think we have a round at 10 to
