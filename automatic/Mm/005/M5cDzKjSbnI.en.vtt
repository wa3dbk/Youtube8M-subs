aspects of Android most notably if you

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.400 
aspects of Android most notably if you
modify<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.489> recovery<00:00:36.150> kernel<00:00:36.750> or<00:00:36.900> bootloader

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
modify the recovery kernel or bootloader

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.619 
modify the recovery kernel or bootloader
on<00:00:37.530> your<00:00:37.800> device<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.370> hardware<00:00:38.879> fuses<00:00:39.330> tripped

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
on your device a hardware fuses tripped

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.049 
on your device a hardware fuses tripped
and<00:00:39.840> since<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.559> views<00:00:40.949> cannot<00:00:41.370> be<00:00:41.550> reset

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.670 
and since this views cannot be reset
there's<00:00:42.510> no<00:00:42.750> way<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.080> covering<00:00:43.410> up<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.559> fact

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
there's no way of covering up the fact

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.680 
there's no way of covering up the fact
that<00:00:43.980> you've<00:00:44.160> modified<00:00:44.520> your<00:00:44.879> device<00:00:45.210> which

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
that you've modified your device which

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.899 
that you've modified your device which
means<00:00:45.960> your<00:00:46.110> warranty<00:00:46.589> is<00:00:46.769> permanently<00:00:47.580> void

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:47.909 
means your warranty is permanently void

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:50.060 
means your warranty is permanently void
so<00:00:48.600> basically<00:00:49.050> if<00:00:49.260> you're<00:00:49.409> modifying<00:00:49.739> your

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
so basically if you're modifying your

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.500 
so basically if you're modifying your
Samsung<00:00:50.519> device<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:51.120> have<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.269> choice<00:00:51.449> between

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
Samsung device you have a choice between

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.689 
Samsung device you have a choice between
ditching<00:00:52.290> your<00:00:52.379> warranty<00:00:52.860> or<00:00:53.070> being<00:00:53.370> very

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
ditching your warranty or being very

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.700 
ditching your warranty or being very

careful not to trip Knox while you're

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.890 
careful not to trip Knox while you're
making<00:00:55.979> system<00:00:56.370> level<00:00:56.640> changes<00:00:57.239> well
