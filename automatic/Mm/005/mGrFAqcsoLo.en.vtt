00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
in the wall as i go into first person

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:00.430 
in the wall as i go into first person
breaks<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.110> wall<00:00:55.289> up<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.710> down<00:00:57.109> and

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.280 

that's<00:01:01.440> pretty<00:01:02.219> weird<00:01:02.480> but<00:01:03.480> what's<00:01:04.080> more

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
that's pretty weird but what's more

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.969 
that's pretty weird but what's more
weird<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:05.540> the<00:01:06.540> fact<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:07.020> if<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.470> walk<00:01:07.680> into

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
weird is the fact that if you walk into

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.330 
weird is the fact that if you walk into
it<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:09.090> drop<00:01:09.390> down<00:01:09.600> then<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.409> come<00:01:10.619> up<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:10.950> top

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
it you drop down then you come up on top

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.860 
it you drop down then you come up on top
of<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.790> roof<00:01:13.610> once<00:01:14.610> I

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.720 

so<00:01:18.500> now<00:01:18.860> you're<00:01:19.190> on<00:01:19.370> top<00:01:19.610> of<00:01:19.760> the<00:01:19.850> roof<00:01:20.060> of<00:01:21.730> well

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
so now you're on top of the roof of well

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.970 
so now you're on top of the roof of well
I<00:01:22.940> am<00:01:23.150> because<00:01:23.720> is<00:01:23.810> in<00:01:23.930> for<00:01:24.110> in<00:01:24.260> reproducible

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 
I am because is in for in reproducible

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.380 
I am because is in for in reproducible
it's<00:01:25.430> not<00:01:25.640> reproducible<00:01:27.580> so<00:01:28.580> and<00:01:28.880> you<00:01:29.210> can

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
it's not reproducible so and you can

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.970 
it's not reproducible so and you can
walk<00:01:29.660> all<00:01:29.960> the<00:01:30.140> way<00:01:30.170> down<00:01:30.590> to<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:30.980> bottom<00:01:32.980> all

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
walk all the way down to the bottom all

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.740 
walk all the way down to the bottom all
the<00:01:34.250> way<00:01:34.280> down<00:01:34.520> up<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:34.970> the<00:01:35.060> top<00:01:35.270> and<00:01:37.660> if<00:01:38.660> you

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
the way down up to the top and if you

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.990 
the way down up to the top and if you
try<00:01:38.930> to<00:01:38.960> walk<00:01:39.200> off<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.410> edge<00:01:39.640> you<00:01:40.640> go<00:01:40.820> into

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
try to walk off the edge you go into

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.270 
try to walk off the edge you go into
this<00:01:41.210> void<00:01:41.980> but<00:01:42.980> you<00:01:43.100> can<00:01:43.220> easily<00:01:43.460> get<00:01:43.880> back<00:01:44.060> on

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.430 

so<00:01:49.280> you<00:01:49.340> go<00:01:49.640> back<00:01:49.880> down<00:01:50.230> to<00:01:51.230> the<00:01:51.260> UM<00:01:53.440> floor

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
so you go back down to the UM floor

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:02.530 
so you go back down to the UM floor
level<00:01:54.770> and<00:01:55.840> you<00:01:56.840> can<00:01:57.020> continue<00:01:59.110> but<00:02:01.210> if<00:02:02.210> you<00:02:02.330> go

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
level and you can continue but if you go

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.560 
level and you can continue but if you go
up<00:02:02.720> like<00:02:03.470> that<00:02:03.680> and<00:02:04.630> just<00:02:05.630> a<00:02:05.900> second<00:02:06.140> let<00:02:06.260> me

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
up like that and just a second let me

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:14.100 
up like that and just a second let me
get<00:02:08.570> this<00:02:10.750> get<00:02:11.750> her

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.350 

see<00:02:14.890> here
