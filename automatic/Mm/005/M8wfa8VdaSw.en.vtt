00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
horizontal incision okay so we're first

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.010 
horizontal incision okay so we're first
gonna<00:00:13.219> identify<00:00:13.490> a<00:00:13.940> staight<00:00:14.629> justice<00:00:15.289> system

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.020 
gonna identify a staight justice system

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:25.689 
gonna identify a staight justice system
yeah<00:00:19.119> okay<00:00:20.119> so<00:00:21.099> number<00:00:23.349> these<00:00:24.349> are<00:00:25.279> the<00:00:25.490> liver

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
yeah okay so number these are the liver

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:33.340 
yeah okay so number these are the liver
where<00:00:26.150> it<00:00:26.839> produces<00:00:26.960> bile<00:00:30.339> six<00:00:32.200> these<00:00:33.200> are

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
where it produces bile six these are

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.170 
where it produces bile six these are
just<00:00:33.380> small<00:00:33.770> and<00:00:34.100> testing<00:00:35.350> where<00:00:36.730> where's<00:00:37.730> the

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180

just small and testing where where's the
final<00:00:38.570> digestion<00:00:39.320> occurs<00:00:40.180> and<00:00:41.180> that's

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
final digestion occurs and that's

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.170 
final digestion occurs and that's
gallbladder<00:00:42.320> right<00:00:42.620> that's<00:00:43.580> the<00:00:43.730> gallbladder

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
we can see the urogenital system heard

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.339 
we can see the urogenital system heard
the<00:02:16.360> urogenital<00:02:17.050> assistant<00:02:17.920> okay<00:02:18.220> kidneys

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
the urogenital assistant okay kidneys

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:25.020 
the urogenital assistant okay kidneys
and<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:22.540> very<00:02:23.020> odd<00:02:23.349> where<00:02:23.860> all<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.160> hearing<00:02:24.580> ya

the UFO where connects to the urinary

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:14.070 
the UFO where connects to the urinary
bladder<00:05:03.750> so<00:05:04.750> down<00:05:05.740> here<00:05:12.300> this<00:05:13.300> does<00:05:13.539> cook<00:05:13.870> the

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
bladder so down here this does cook the

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.019 
bladder so down here this does cook the
others<00:05:14.319> backbone<00:05:16.889> that's<00:05:17.889> about<00:05:18.159> it<00:05:18.219> for<00:05:18.430> the

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:19.029 
others backbone that's about it for the

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:22.469 
others backbone that's about it for the
urogenital<00:05:19.710> system<00:05:20.939> law<00:05:21.939> are<00:05:22.090> going<00:05:22.270> to<00:05:22.330> go<00:05:22.419> to

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 
urogenital system law are going to go to

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:28.920 
urogenital system law are going to go to
the<00:05:22.629> respiratory<00:05:23.229> system<00:05:27.659> ok<00:05:28.659> now<00:05:28.870> we're

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
the respiratory system ok now we're

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.409 
the respiratory system ok now we're
going<00:05:29.169> to<00:05:29.349> go<00:05:29.529> to<00:05:29.560> cats<00:05:30.159> respiratory<00:05:30.699> system

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
going to go to cats respiratory system

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.360 
going to go to cats respiratory system
first<00:05:32.289> we're<00:05:32.560> going<00:05:32.650> to<00:05:32.740> take<00:05:32.889> a<00:05:32.949> look<00:05:33.159> at<00:05:33.250> the

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
first we're going to take a look at the

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.269 
first we're going to take a look at the
heart<00:05:33.639> and<00:05:33.849> the<00:05:34.029> lungs<00:05:34.449> that<00:05:34.750> we<00:05:34.930> can<00:05:35.110> see<00:05:35.319> the

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:36.279 
heart and the lungs that we can see the

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:39.029 
heart and the lungs that we can see the
blue<00:05:36.490> stuff<00:05:36.699> is<00:05:36.969> the<00:05:37.689> lungs<00:05:37.900> it<00:05:38.409> transports

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 
blue stuff is the lungs it transports

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:44.850 
blue stuff is the lungs it transports
oxygen<00:05:39.960> to<00:05:40.960> the<00:05:41.409> blood<00:05:42.120> yeah<00:05:43.120> and<00:05:43.330> and<00:05:44.169> then

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
oxygen to the blood yeah and and then

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.189 
oxygen to the blood yeah and and then
it's<00:05:45.129> controlled<00:05:45.520> by<00:05:45.580> the<00:05:45.699> diaphragm<00:05:46.270> next

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:47.199 
it's controlled by the diaphragm next

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:49.019 
it's controlled by the diaphragm next
the<00:05:47.349> yellow<00:05:47.560> stuff<00:05:47.860> next<00:05:48.069> to<00:05:48.219> a<00:05:48.310> blue<00:05:48.520> is<00:05:48.789> the

00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:49.029 
the yellow stuff next to a blue is the

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:53.279 
the yellow stuff next to a blue is the
heart<00:05:49.509> yeah<00:05:51.569> now<00:05:52.569> we're<00:05:52.750> going<00:05:52.870> to<00:05:52.930> reboot

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.289 
heart yeah now we're going to reboot

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:57.240 
heart yeah now we're going to reboot
remove<00:05:53.889> these<00:05:54.370> two<00:05:54.699> to<00:05:55.029> see<00:05:55.529> underneath<00:05:56.529> for

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
remove these two to see underneath for

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:03.869 
remove these two to see underneath for
the<00:05:57.370> trachea<00:05:57.789> and<00:05:57.879> bronchial<00:05:58.389> tubes<00:06:00.990> so<00:06:02.879> this

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:03.879 
the trachea and bronchial tubes so this

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:08.939 
the trachea and bronchial tubes so this
right<00:06:04.150> here<00:06:04.210> is<00:06:05.759> the<00:06:06.960> branch<00:06:07.960> bronchial<00:06:08.680> tubes

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:08.949 
right here is the branch bronchial tubes

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:12.360 
right here is the branch bronchial tubes
it<00:06:09.759> connects<00:06:10.150> track<00:06:10.389> yet<00:06:10.599> soja<00:06:10.779> to<00:06:11.020> 20<00:06:11.319> to<00:06:12.159> 22

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
it connects track yet soja to 20 to 22

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.050 
it connects track yet soja to 20 to 22
what

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.110 

trachea<00:06:17.060> and<00:06:17.090> there<00:06:17.630> are<00:06:17.810> the<00:06:18.910> there<00:06:19.910> should

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
trachea and there are the there should

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.940 
trachea and there are the there should
be<00:06:20.240> the<00:06:20.360> bronchiole<00:06:21.020> ease<00:06:21.200> which<00:06:21.470> exchange

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:21.950 
be the bronchiole ease which exchange

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:26.050 
be the bronchiole ease which exchange
oxygen<00:06:22.190> and<00:06:22.580> carbon<00:06:22.850> dioxide<00:06:24.190> and<00:06:25.190> around

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
oxygen and carbon dioxide and around

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.250 
oxygen and carbon dioxide and around
here<00:06:26.540> is<00:06:27.380> a<00:06:27.440> trump<00:06:27.740> Kia<00:06:27.950> it's<00:06:28.790> all<00:06:28.940> over<00:06:29.260> yeah
