00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.640
 hello everyone welcome to lethal 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.850
 crisis' today I'm going to teach you how to make a 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.390
 parchment parchment is the first 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.240
 paper types 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.699
 where they started writing the good 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.279
 a kind of paper can do the 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.439
 comparison with some of today in 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:37.530
 where the Egyptians started writing 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:39.410
 among other cultures we are going to need 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.360
 a sheet 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.360
 cocoa powder 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.950
 after either cao nesquik tail what 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.500
 have 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.640
 ah 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.610
 and water and a brush first here I've already 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.840
 joined cola cao with water you see that 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:06.320
 there is a kind of brown water 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:09.620
 it has to be quite thick and what 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:14.070
 first thing to do is going to be 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:16.990
 and cut the folio by the two sides 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.000
 by the margins 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.509
 because the shape of the folio is too 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.950
 straight for a parchment has to be 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.950
 more broken so as I said 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.120
 with the shape you want 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.750
 we already have the shape of the parchment 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:53.420
 and the first thing to do is go 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:57.170
 reviewing the margins of 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.159
 of the piece of folio with the water with cola 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.460
 cao 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.869
 You see that it is taking the brown color that 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.869
 is the ready entity of the scrolls 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.820
 and good once you have facts all 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.820
 on Tuesdays you have to go to the middle 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.680
 trying to make the margins remain more 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.930
 dark that the middle part and so with 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.150
 the two faces first with one after 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.640
 paris to dry and then with the other 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.640
 so now we go back 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.090
 well we have here as I would be leaving a 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.519
 parchment for one side only you see that 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.050
 the other is still undone but so 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.750
 since 'not for a face 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.970
 it is still not completely dry and it is the 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.000
 first layer after having already this 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.600
 dry what we could do would be like 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.220
 I said before 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.750
 I'm going to put some of this so that 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.750
 see the edge how it looks 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.050
 there you can put a little more 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.050
 darkness 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.710
 just putting a little more tail 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.710
 cao with water 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.319
 and letting it dry 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.459
 and now he's going to show you some 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.139
 parchments already made now simply 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.409
 of this as I have done would only be 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:20.299
 let it dry and paint on the other side and 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:22.310
 now let's move on to the scrolls and 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.200
 good facts well here you have a 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.540
 predominance done this fact stopped him 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.299
 from quite some time ago I made here a 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.420
 English reaction I have 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:35.329
 hanging on the wall that's why he has these 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.549
 jealous pieces of masking tape 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:40.459
 but you see that it is very similar to a 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:42.330
 parchment here I made you many broken for 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.210
 to bend 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.150
 and as you can see, it's very much like a 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.890
 parchment 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.720
 and this is another one that I've done more 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.760
 Recently 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.380
 It is also very much like a 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.770
 parchment here I'm making a 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.620
 kind of inscription 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.569
 Egyptian 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.280
 these are Egyptian letters and good as 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.530
 you see this I'm also going to hang it on 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.410
 wall so I have a zeal and you see that 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:11.560
 it is very much like a parchment 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:14.020
 well everything else near you see all the 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.989
 remains of the tail cao here you see how I have 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.500
 said it darkens the areas by putting more 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.720
 tail cao by all margins 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.420
 and the center is a little clearer than 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.760
 that's how the scrolls were 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.920
 and well I hope you liked it 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.710
 it seems interesting and nice to do 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:35.870
 and to see how good you already know how 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.870
 make a scroll and until another goodbye
