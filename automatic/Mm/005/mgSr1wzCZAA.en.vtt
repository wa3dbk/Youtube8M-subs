the<00:03:19.739> chance<00:03:19.950> to<00:03:20.160> come<00:03:20.310> back<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:20.670> possibly<00:03:21.030> go

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
the chance to come back and possibly go

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.430 
the chance to come back and possibly go
to<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.360> winner's<00:03:21.630> bracket<00:03:21.780> but<00:03:22.170> they<00:03:22.290> ended

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
to the winner's bracket but they ended

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.970 
to the winner's bracket but they ended
up<00:03:22.560> going<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:22.860> losers<00:03:23.160> bracket<00:03:23.190> um

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
up going to the losers bracket um

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.920 
up going to the losers bracket um
against<00:03:25.980> leverage<00:03:26.880> i<00:03:27.090> believe<00:03:27.360> so<00:03:27.540> they<00:03:27.780> ended

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
against leverage i believe so they ended

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.360 
against leverage i believe so they ended
up<00:03:28.049> going<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:28.440> loser's<00:03:28.769> bracket<00:03:28.799> against

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
up going to the loser's bracket against

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.830 
up going to the loser's bracket against
leverage<00:03:29.640> and<00:03:29.760> whoever<00:03:30.000> wouldn't<00:03:30.390> that<00:03:30.510> would

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
leverage and whoever wouldn't that would

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.300 
leverage and whoever wouldn't that would
be<00:03:30.959> in<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.170> finals<00:03:31.500> right<00:03:31.650> now<00:03:31.680> against<00:03:32.070> team

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
be in the finals right now against team

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.490 
be in the finals right now against team
fear<00:03:32.580> but<00:03:33.150> of<00:03:33.209> course<00:03:33.600> leverage<00:03:34.140> ended<00:03:34.410> up

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
fear but of course leverage ended up

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.160 
fear but of course leverage ended up
being<00:03:34.769> optic<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:35.549> not<00:03:36.120> of<00:03:36.239> course<00:03:36.510> but<00:03:36.810> I<00:03:36.870> mean

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
being optic and not of course but I mean

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.190 
being optic and not of course but I mean
leverage<00:03:37.890> ended<00:03:38.220> up<00:03:38.340> being<00:03:38.670> meeting<00:03:39.600> optics

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
leverage ended up being meeting optics

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.920 
leverage ended up being meeting optics
so<00:03:40.440> they<00:03:40.709> are<00:03:40.769> now<00:03:40.950> facing<00:03:41.250> fear<00:03:42.209> as<00:03:42.450> fear<00:03:42.690> does

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
so they are now facing fear as fear does

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.350 
so they are now facing fear as fear does
have<00:03:43.140> a<00:03:43.170> 4-1<00:03:43.799> lead<00:03:44.070> wolf<00:03:44.519> when<00:03:44.850> I<00:03:44.880> had<00:03:45.090> just

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
left about 15 minutes or so they do have

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.520 
left about 15 minutes or so they do have
a<00:03:47.549> 4-1<00:03:48.120> lead<00:03:48.390> throughout<00:03:48.600> the<00:03:48.780> series<00:03:49.019> and<00:03:49.410> it

is<00:03:49.650> best<00:03:49.920> of<00:03:50.100> 11<00:03:50.430> so<00:03:50.519> basically<00:03:50.910> whoever<00:03:51.090> wins

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
is best of 11 so basically whoever wins

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.960 
is best of 11 so basically whoever wins
6<00:03:51.870> when<00:03:52.530> it's<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.799> whole<00:03:52.980> entire<00:03:53.400> match<00:03:53.670> and

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
6 when it's the whole entire match and

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.759 
6 when it's the whole entire match and
basically<00:03:54.329> every<00:03:54.570> single<00:03:54.840> game<00:03:55.019> has<00:03:55.350> two

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
basically every single game has two

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.190 
basically every single game has two
