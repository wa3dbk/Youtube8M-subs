 In fact, this tablet I have long been 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.439

 one box as you can see 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.930
 that 's really a tablet i 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.020
 very very satisfied he allows me 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.260
 draw good drawings and if you 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.480
 have any drawing skills then 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.480
 good sampling here and still can say 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.670
 immediately that the tablet is worth the money and 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.399
 in fact it is the cheapest and with all 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.879

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.420
 quite enough if you are just starting 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.860
 drawing is a great option if 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.510
 for example, if it takes a lot 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.119
 time i will buy my husband myself 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.610

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.439
 you probably sentique or well that 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.450
 this plan and so we get inside 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.200
 boxes here we have of course our 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.030
 tablet and in 1 the so-called stylus well 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.990

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.280
 usually really 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.369
 and if you are a pen in that what else 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.860
 there will be a thing to erase with me 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.780
 just ordinary on the handle there are two 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.149
 buttons to click and they can be customized under 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.729
 ourselves and so we got a pen here's how 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.170
 midges here need to stand in the tablet and the very 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.820
 I have this packing myself 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.210

 see we get our wonderful 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.909
 a tablet that looks simple 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.770
 divinely 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:10.000
 design is a bit like design and apple 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:12.250
 and which they do not make products very 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.160
 easy to show you about 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.940
 size and i will take any notebook 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.970
 need a notebook and this is our tablet as 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.129
 you see it almost exactly if i 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.140
 turn it literally a little bit he 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.360
 will crawl out on he actually 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.310
 ask here the same way so that all these 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.680
 fractions can polar size or 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.620
 moreover work area 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.750
 it is incomplete there are some points 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.540
 dots as you see it and they are 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.120
 the entire surface of the tablet and here it is 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.950
 Workspace 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.959
 in fact it is not very big but in 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.319
 principle is quite enough and even more so it 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.750
 very convenient to take with you somewhere we go 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.220
 further this tablet like this 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.040
 if you order it then you will have everything 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.170
 you can play here to go deep 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.420
 further well connectors you can do everything 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.160
 buy a bunch of different accessories so 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.200
 further but this is only 6 years on the site 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.950
 here or see a more detailed review 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.079
 which i may do too next 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.569
 see we have here such cable not here 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:15.280
 really like what's really here 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.620
 removing children still with your wires not 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.160
 will happen then we have this 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.780
 wrapping you which lies itself 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.209
 actually the disk is like this 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.720
 packaging if open inside us 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.700
 and renew user manual 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.280
 user all is clear on several 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.919
 languages ​​as usual Russian too 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.519
 then there is a shorter round shorter 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:44.319
 the thing you wear the property 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:46.630
 and black. which is what call it 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.780
 Included here was such a family she once 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.970
 same dressed if the same black at the very 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.859
 To do business probably any of 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.319
 they can be very simple and replaced too 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:58.720
 it will be quite simple well in general like this 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.639
 here then looks inside of course 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.379
 there will be another drive that i did i just 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:04.080
 copied what is on her on 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:06.430
 computer as always do not even get 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.130
 Well, because I often virtual 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.780
 windows me not sochi laptop and constantly 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.000
 a worn disc is not very convenient 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:17.980
 the more expensive home knocking on the site 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.980
 well, and also there is a thing that I just 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:24.160
 this is all that was in the box well, 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.889
 of course if you are not a thing here is empty here 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.260
 in fact the box of course still 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.650
 I really like the packaging and how I have 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.540
 lies 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.300
 when I don't have a tablet when a tablet 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.340
 lying on the table and everything else 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.270
 also in principle there will be boxes like this 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.880
 I'm all packed up and so here 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.229
 saved the tablet itself lives and for 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.370
 what is used to push 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:51.040
 the stylus so here is all bravissimo pokamis 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.720
 him but in general if you want more 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.850
 learn more how it works at all 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.490
 learn something about similar products 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.290
 because essentially all models are the same 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.630
 they differ only in size and what 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.280
 they still have accurate this type is not very 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.950
 big differences really all this 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.620
 there was a small unboxing unpacking that 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.600
 there are boxes here if you like it 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.169
 Magadan information to write something 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.789
 exactly the steering wheel 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.830
 alterg but even subscribe to the channel 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:15.190
 to their further boxing or mine 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.970
 vlogi 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:21.150
 it benefits you wonder while actually 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.150
 she doesn't
