00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 but today also a day full of 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.700
 news items of current events 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.109
 the third day in fact of protests in 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.679
 all of Italy of the pitchforks movement 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.540
 there is a very composite movement 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.559
 there are also ultras in the stadium 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.250
 elements that have declared 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.020
 clearly there are the fascists 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.550
 social centers there are a short one 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.500
 apolitical movement but in fact 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.539
 becomes political because he asked 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.340
 even the resignation of the government 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.170
 they all have to go home and anyway 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.849
 put around other cities like Turin 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.369
 where there were clashes but it is 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.860
 rising tension also in southern Italy 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.899
 rome today is an armored city some 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.930
 representatives of this movement have 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.879
 met meet silvio berlusconi 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.770
 let us then connect horns to the piazza dei 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.629
 partisans where there is for us flavia 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.879
 marimpietri lia squares struggling in the course 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.570
 one of the many events planned 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.570
 for today flavia 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.379
 good morning we are all here, piazza dei 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.420
 partisans in Rome this behind me 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.199
 the only fixed and organized unit 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.820
 of national coordination 9 December 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.100
 Italian citizens who have here 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.330
 rumbled when Frank eliminated the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.880
 word pitchforks because you don't 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.670
 identify only in this movement but 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.100
 the souls are different and third day of 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.540
 protest as you said here for three days 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.909
 and for three nights 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.860
 the protesters exposed their own 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.670
 ideas sleeping in a tent waving the 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.130
 tricolor 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.650
 This morning there was a parade and it 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.810
 we will talk so far the manifestation itself is 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.329
 carried out peacefully and keep us 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.369
 protesters to stand out from those 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.610
 which we greatly appreciate 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.380
 a procession and that peacefully this 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.229
 morning in an authorized manner has 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.229
 then the center was paraded from 12 to 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.750
 14 at the head of the procession was danilo and them 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.000
 we immediately see the reason for this 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.979
 your knife thinks in the morning while the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.210
 why we fight and 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.189
 we fight for a better Italy and 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.180
 just the paralysis of those brains for 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.460
 which journalist 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.200
 he called this initiative fascist 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.020
 when it has nothing to do this for 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.570
 this is that there are rules that are equal 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.070
 now this is the word i 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.119
 terrorists 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.979
 terrorists the media terrorists 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.830
 you have to stop being a journalist 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.040
 he sees himself ashamed of what he is ashamed of 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.100
 she was good the words are serene 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.280
 entrusted study there are also some 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.320
 but the most extreme fringes investigated are 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.770
 also arrive to imagine if not 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:32.100
 Foroni and we say it then but 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.630
 the rind then better and us 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.110
 here we are to say things as they are 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.540
 so then you are right then now 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.000
 the journalist in the studio said that there 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.060
 they were also fringes that 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.530
 Questura has marked then you are not these 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.090
 extreme fringe goods alone in a manner 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.540
 peaceful and polite as you want 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.950
 be fair recall because you have 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.330
 wanted to do this it carried in a manner 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.220
 peaceful just wait I don't love everyone 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.890
 joined by the banner that reads 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.660
 precisely neither red nor black against the 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.060
 paralysis of thoughts that often comes 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.860
 made by state televisions that 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.230
 instead of giving a free voice 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.760
 she's talking and we're really 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.440
 then he left the boat in the den 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.400
 he is doing it used to minimize 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.290
 not only this time the attack 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.870
 who says I have not high school talking 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.000
 no one prevents him 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.650
 here in fact that they are talents there though 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.660
 the label you tried to put ce 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:34.600
 no one prevents us from singing 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.230
 his time seems to me too to those who are 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.690
 listening 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.510
 he wants to tell us why you were square 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.030
 we are ready to listen to the 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.610
 we ask him there has never been a 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.030
 procession to prove that those principals 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.640
 that someone is debasing them 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.650
 only static aids are actually a 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.810
 group of people who made history 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.960
 these days because it is far from the 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.590
 party politics in which you have paralyzed 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.900
 the brains 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.550
 we joined by Italians under the one 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.580
 flag that represents us and that to the 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.860
 tricolor and 15 we begin to move for 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.870
 let us see why those who want us 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.180
 obscure must be set against one 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.070
 great strength that the strength of the heart of 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.260
 honest citizens who have worked and 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.239
 who have always been muddied by the 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.580
 mud that this fake state has us 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:25.780
 thrown in the face through taxes 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:28.450
 ok ok then the slogan of this I don't know 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.400
 if you want to hear something again or 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.260
 childhood we do not charge the state 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.919
 we do n't want to go through those that 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.520
 I'm 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:37.840
 This is what it says but I have it 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.690
 only I wanted to say that we are all here 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.520
 Italian citizens are the people of 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.020
 every color and useless that is tried to 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.210
 put us straight because the label 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.790
 unique and that we are under the one thing 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.080
 are the mega daniele Italian is useless 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.740
 nobody believes me anymore 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.080
 you have to finish it 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:59.139
 we want freedom here but freedom of 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:02.389
 thought work the dignity of 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:05.000
 constitutional then we are not a 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:08.330
 Italian is fine if they have returned to 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.349
 march that I don't understand but I do n't know 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:14.300
 ok, however, a good event 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:17.539
 wants to talk more about it 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.069
 late with you flavia perfect is meanwhile 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:23.470
 the embrace of the people continues 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:23.470
