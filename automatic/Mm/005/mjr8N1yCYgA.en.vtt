it keep notation just remember i just
read<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.760> you'll<00:00:54.090> know<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.360> new<00:00:54.510> cube

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
read that and you'll know the new cube

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.470 
read that and you'll know the new cube
notation<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:56.250> most<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.940> probably<00:00:57.210> know<00:00:57.329> that

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
notation so most you probably know that

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.880 
notation so most you probably know that
that's<00:00:57.690> why<00:00:57.809> I'm<00:00:57.870> not<00:00:58.050> explaining<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.710> this

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
that's why I'm not explaining it in this

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.130 
that's why I'm not explaining it in this
tutorial<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.670> yeah<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.629> we're<00:01:00.899> going<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.079> be

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
tutorial and yeah so we're going to be

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.900 
tutorial and yeah so we're going to be
solving<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> white<00:01:01.800> layer<00:01:02.010> first<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.640> may<00:01:02.789> or

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
solving the white layer first you may or

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.579 
solving the white layer first you may or
may<00:01:03.000> not<00:01:03.030> know<00:01:03.239> how<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:03.960> do<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.260> if<00:01:04.500> you

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
may not know how to do this if you

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.750 
may not know how to do this if you
already<00:01:04.680> know<00:01:04.920> how<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.100> solve<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.460> way<00:01:05.549> layer

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760

part two this tutorial okay so now that

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.789 
part two this tutorial okay so now that
we're<00:01:12.659> ready<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.930> solve<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.409> white<00:01:13.590> layer

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
we're ready to solve the white layer

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.980 
we're ready to solve the white layer
we're<00:01:14.490> going<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.700> first<00:01:15.090> pick<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.450> white<00:01:15.750> piece

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
we're going to first pick a white piece

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.039 
we're going to first pick a white piece
here's<00:01:16.530> white<00:01:16.740> piece<00:01:17.420> okay<00:01:18.420> we're<00:01:18.869> going<00:01:18.960> to

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
here's white piece okay we're going to

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.450 
here's white piece okay we're going to
look<00:01:19.110> at<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.290> other<00:01:19.439> two<00:01:19.680> colors<00:01:19.860> on<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
look at the other two colors on the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.870 
look at the other two colors on the
piece<00:01:20.670> there's<00:01:21.299> pink<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.439> there's<00:01:23.009> green<00:01:23.310> so

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
piece there's pink and there's green so

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.100 
piece there's pink and there's green so
we're<00:01:24.000> going<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.180> find<00:01:24.330> another<00:01:24.600> white<00:01:24.869> piece

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
we're going to find another white piece

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.429 
we're going to find another white piece
that<00:01:25.500> has<00:01:25.650> pink<00:01:26.040> or<00:01:26.159> green<00:01:26.310> on<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:27.290> this<00:01:28.290> is

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
that has pink or green on it this is

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.679 
that has pink or green on it this is
good<00:01:28.680> it's<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.009> white<00:01:29.189> piece<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.610> has<00:01:29.729> green<00:01:30.000> so

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
good it's a white piece it has green so

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.539 
good it's a white piece it has green so
what<00:01:31.409> we're<00:01:31.560> going<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.740> do<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.100> we're<00:01:32.400> going<00:01:32.490> to

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.640 
what we're going to do is we're going to
take<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:33.299> white<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:34.049> original<00:01:34.409> way<00:01:34.500> and

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
take this white the original way and

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.050 
take this white the original way and
we're<00:01:34.770> going<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.950> put<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.610> left

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
we're going to put it in the left

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.560 
we're going to put it in the left
position<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:37.670> because<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:39.060> reason<00:01:39.329> we<00:01:39.420> put

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
position and because the reason we put

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.719 
position and because the reason we put
in<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.780> left<00:01:39.960> position<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:41.460> is

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
in the left position is that this is

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.270 
in the left position is that this is
pink<00:01:42.090> pink<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.869> always<00:01:43.259> opposite<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.829> red<00:01:44.130> in

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
pink pink is always opposite of red in

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.730 
pink pink is always opposite of red in
this<00:01:44.399> cube<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.229> piece<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.439> we're

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
this cube and this the piece that we're

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.030 
this cube and this the piece that we're
trying<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.100> Orion<00:01:47.430> has<00:01:47.880> read<00:01:48.329> on<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.920> red<00:01:49.920> is

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
trying to Orion has read on it red is

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.889 
trying to Orion has read on it red is
going<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.250> be<00:01:50.340> here<00:01:50.579> red<00:01:51.000> red<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.479> then<00:01:51.689> pink

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
going to be here red red and then pink

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.389 
going to be here red red and then pink
is<00:01:51.990> going<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.200> be<00:01:52.290> here<00:01:52.409> pink<00:01:52.770> pink<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.369> is

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
is going to be here pink pink that is

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.340 
is going to be here pink pink that is
very<00:01:53.700> simple<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.180> then<00:01:54.689> obviously<00:01:54.869> the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
very simple and then obviously the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.760 
very simple and then obviously the
Greens<00:01:55.590> match<00:01:55.860> up<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:56.130> we<00:01:57.119> get<00:01:57.570> their<00:01:57.719> piece<00:01:57.990> we

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
Greens match up so we get their piece we

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.789 
Greens match up so we get their piece we
we<00:01:59.250> get<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.520> piece<00:01:59.700> there<00:02:00.090> there<00:02:00.600> we're<00:02:01.320> sorry

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
we get the piece there there we're sorry

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.889 
we get the piece there there we're sorry
we<00:02:02.189> get<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.549> white<00:02:02.850> color<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.689> piece

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
we get the white color of the piece

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.789 
we get the white color of the piece
there<00:02:04.649> there<00:02:05.159> there<00:02:05.430> there<00:02:06.210> or<00:02:06.840> there<00:02:07.079> that

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
there there there there or there that

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.070 
there there there there or there that
all<00:02:08.129> those<00:02:08.610> positions<00:02:09.000> are<00:02:09.330> places<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.750> this

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
all those positions are places that this

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.380 
all those positions are places that this
would<00:02:10.289> work<00:02:10.760> pretend<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.849> pieces<00:02:12.209> there

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
would work pretend the pieces there

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.190 
would work pretend the pieces there
we're<00:02:12.629> going<00:02:12.780> to

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
we're going to

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.720 
we're going to
move<00:02:13.379> it<00:02:13.500> over<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.950> one<00:02:14.370> of<00:02:14.400> those<00:02:14.520> positions

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
move it over to one of those positions

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.410 
move it over to one of those positions
which<00:02:15.180> is<00:02:15.330> right<00:02:15.510> here<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:16.340> if<00:02:17.340> it's<00:02:17.550> right<00:02:17.970> in

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
which is right here and if it's right in

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.750 
which is right here and if it's right in
the<00:02:19.019> back<00:02:19.200> face<00:02:19.470> are<00:02:19.980> just<00:02:20.190> going<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.370> turn<00:02:20.610> it

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
the back face are just going to turn it

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.270 
the back face are just going to turn it
twice<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.239> now<00:02:21.330> it's<00:02:21.480> there<00:02:21.860> fits<00:02:22.860> in<00:02:23.160> the

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
twice and now it's there fits in the

twice and now it's there fits in the
back<00:02:23.459> over<00:02:23.730> here<00:02:24.060> turning<00:02:25.050> it<00:02:25.140> twice<00:02:25.379> and<00:02:25.680> now

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
back over here turning it twice and now

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.800 
back over here turning it twice and now
it's<00:02:26.340> there<00:02:26.519> and<00:02:27.239> we're<00:02:27.390> going<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.540> be<00:02:27.660> doing

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
it's there and we're going to be doing

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.890 
it's there and we're going to be doing
the<00:02:28.019> simple<00:02:28.200> algorithm<00:02:28.739> that<00:02:29.519> is<00:02:29.580> going<00:02:29.819> to

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
the simple algorithm that is going to

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.600 
the simple algorithm that is going to
insert<00:02:30.900> it<00:02:30.959> right<00:02:31.200> there<00:02:31.410> right<00:02:32.190> inverted

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
insert it right there right inverted

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.009 
insert it right there right inverted

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
inverted down averted right down and now

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.589 
inverted down averted right down and now
the<00:02:49.980> piece<00:02:50.220> is<00:02:50.430> inserted<00:02:50.880> just<00:02:51.120> keep<00:02:51.329> doing

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
the piece is inserted just keep doing

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.870 
the piece is inserted just keep doing
that<00:02:51.720> until<00:02:51.989> your<00:02:52.410> piece<00:02:52.560> gets<00:02:52.799> inserted<00:02:53.099> okay

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
that until your piece gets inserted okay

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.280 
that until your piece gets inserted okay
so<00:02:53.970> now<00:02:54.239> that<00:02:54.269> we<00:02:54.510> have<00:02:54.540> two<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.110> four

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
so now that we have two of the four

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.650 
so now that we have two of the four
pieces<00:02:55.500> we<00:02:55.769> need<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.340> white<00:02:56.519> layer<00:02:56.790> we're

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
pieces we need and the white layer we're

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.020 
pieces we need and the white layer we're
going<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.840> find<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.470> third<00:02:58.709> or<00:02:59.400> fourth<00:02:59.849> and

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
going to find the third or fourth and

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.229 
going to find the third or fourth and
here's<00:03:00.810> another<00:03:00.870> way<00:03:01.290> piece<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.890> it<00:03:02.340> has<00:03:02.519> pink

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
here's another way piece and it has pink

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.789 
here's another way piece and it has pink
and<00:03:03.540> blue<00:03:03.810> so<00:03:04.049> we're<00:03:04.260> going<00:03:04.349> to<00:03:04.440> know<00:03:04.590> that

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
and blue so we're going to know that

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.800 
and blue so we're going to know that
it's<00:03:04.950> going<00:03:05.069> to<00:03:05.160> be<00:03:05.280> there<00:03:05.700> matching<00:03:06.630> up<00:03:06.690> at

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
it's going to be there matching up at

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.850 
it's going to be there matching up at
the<00:03:06.870> pink<00:03:07.049> so<00:03:07.920> as<00:03:08.280> I<00:03:08.549> said<00:03:08.610> before<00:03:08.760> just<00:03:09.860> get

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
the pink so as I said before just get

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.100 
the pink so as I said before just get
this<00:03:11.069> piece<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.819> position<00:03:12.269> needs<00:03:12.510> be

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
this piece and the position needs be

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.789 
this piece and the position needs be
right<00:03:13.470> above<00:03:13.769> I'm<00:03:14.099> right<00:03:15.090> but<00:03:15.440> get<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.590> piece

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
right above I'm right but get the piece

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.410 
right above I'm right but get the piece
it's<00:03:17.190> going<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.430> be<00:03:17.519> at<00:03:17.639> nita<00:03:17.880> I'm<00:03:18.030> be<00:03:18.180> on<00:03:18.299> the

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
it's going to be at nita I'm be on the

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.319 
it's going to be at nita I'm be on the
top<00:03:18.660> so<00:03:18.870> get<00:03:19.049> it<00:03:19.170> right<00:03:19.470> below<00:03:19.680> it<00:03:19.799> and<00:03:20.239> one<00:03:21.239> of

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
top so get it right below it and one of

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.300 
top so get it right below it and one of
the<00:03:21.420> five<00:03:21.569> positions<00:03:21.989> like<00:03:22.109> I<00:03:22.230> said<00:03:22.470> and<00:03:22.709> then

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
the five positions like I said and then

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.220 
the five positions like I said and then
do<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.549> algorithm<00:03:23.940> right<00:03:24.540> inverted<00:03:24.959> down

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
do the algorithm right inverted down

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.050 
do the algorithm right inverted down
inverted<00:03:25.680> right<00:03:26.069> down<00:03:26.430> read<00:03:26.700> and<00:03:26.819> write<00:03:26.910> it

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
inverted right down read and write it

down<00:03:27.209> inverted<00:03:27.600> right<00:03:27.780> down<00:03:28.049> and<00:03:28.319> just<00:03:28.410> keep

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
down inverted right down and just keep

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.120 
down inverted right down and just keep
doing<00:03:28.889> it<00:03:29.010> until<00:03:29.040> your<00:03:29.430> piece<00:03:29.579> gets<00:03:29.790> inserted

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
doing it until your piece gets inserted

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.129 
doing it until your piece gets inserted
okay<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.400> now<00:03:32.730> our<00:03:32.760> piece<00:03:33.120> is<00:03:33.150> inserted<00:03:33.750> pink

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
okay and now our piece is inserted pink

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.470 
okay and now our piece is inserted pink
pink<00:03:34.350> white<00:03:34.889> white<00:03:35.100> and<00:03:35.430> now<00:03:36.090> we<00:03:36.150> only<00:03:36.359> have

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
pink white white and now we only have

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.129 
pink white white and now we only have
one<00:03:36.569> more<00:03:36.810> piece<00:03:37.019> and<00:03:37.400> so<00:03:38.400> just<00:03:38.519> find<00:03:38.730> it<00:03:39.139> there

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
one more piece and so just find it there

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:41.840 
one more piece and so just find it there
it<00:03:40.260> is<00:03:40.350> so<00:03:40.920> we<00:03:41.040> need<00:03:41.160> to<00:03:41.220> get<00:03:41.310> it<00:03:41.459> right<00:03:41.639> below

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
it is so we need to get it right below

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.849 
it is so we need to get it right below
that<00:03:42.000> so<00:03:42.810> you<00:03:42.870> can<00:03:43.049> either<00:03:43.170> turn<00:03:43.560> it<00:03:43.709> this<00:03:43.799> way

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
that so you can either turn it this way

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:45.680 
that so you can either turn it this way
or<00:03:44.220> you<00:03:44.459> can<00:03:44.579> just<00:03:44.639> turn<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:45.030> top<00:03:45.239> layer<00:03:45.450> and

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
or you can just turn the top layer and

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.449 
or you can just turn the top layer and
just<00:03:46.109> do<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.319> simple<00:03:46.680> algorithm<00:03:47.069> algorithm

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
just do the simple algorithm algorithm
