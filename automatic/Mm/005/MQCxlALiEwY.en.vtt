 the famous rock that makes the celebrity 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.590

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.989
 rock iceberg 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.469
 he defies talent for millions 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.579
 of years this gigantic market 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:58.199

00:00:52.579 --> 00:01:00.770
 I'm going to do a little bit of panning the 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:09.420
 parade finished I'm going to paint 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:13.530
 there it is necessary to work that baths 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.220
 is particularly cold which does not 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.180
 not very hot 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.799
 and there all the interest of various courses 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.540
 in the jura bear fruit 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:28.220
 I would like to imagine is too precise 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.220
 in the evening heat 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:42.130
 but night falls and the cold is bright 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.240
 I finish my motive I will come back 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.299
 tomlin domain 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.299
 and 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.990
 today I find the pierced rock 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.610
 in the morning light 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.909
 it is even more impressive the 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.860
 majestic, almost unreal 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.520
 simple as floating on the surface of 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.700
 the water it releases a force and a mystery 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.700
 unbelievable 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.680

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.200
 go see it more closely by 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.420
 approaching we see how much he

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.150
 country 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.370
 the power of the elements and 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.740
 the inexorable flow of the table not 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.900
 astonishing that many artists and 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.380
 writers came here 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.280
 fascinated by the pierced rock I leave to 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.840
 my turn this strange mischievous poetry goes there 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.080
 devote an entire page to the rock 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.080
 perforated
