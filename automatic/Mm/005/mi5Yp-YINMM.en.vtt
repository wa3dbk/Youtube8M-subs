your it's a just a basic receiver like
to<00:02:28.959> harm<00:02:29.170> le<00:02:29.319> Wallach<00:02:29.680> said<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:30.459> it's<00:02:31.209> a<00:02:31.269> four

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
to harm le Wallach said and it's a four

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.550 
to harm le Wallach said and it's a four
channel<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:32.019> it's<00:02:32.590> set<00:02:32.800> up<00:02:32.830> on<00:02:34.290> one<00:02:35.290> right<00:02:35.530> now

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
channel and it's set up on one right now

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.940 
channel and it's set up on one right now
or<00:02:36.810> I'd<00:02:37.810> have<00:02:37.870> to<00:02:38.080> see<00:02:38.230> what<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:38.470> codes<00:02:38.709> mean

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
or I'd have to see what the codes mean

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.509 
or I'd have to see what the codes mean
it's<00:02:39.340> one<00:02:39.700> down<00:02:39.940> three<00:02:39.970> up<00:02:40.920> one<00:02:41.920> down<00:02:42.099> and<00:02:42.370> two

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
it's one down three up one down and two

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.600 
it's one down three up one down and two
three<00:02:42.760> four<00:02:42.970> is<00:02:43.120> up<00:02:43.300> so<00:02:43.709> I'd<00:02:44.709> have<00:02:44.769> to<00:02:45.010> check<00:02:45.220> it

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
three four is up so I'd have to check it

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.750 
three four is up so I'd have to check it
but<00:02:45.760> I<00:02:45.790> think<00:02:46.260> from<00:02:47.260> what<00:02:47.380> I<00:02:47.440> gather<00:02:47.830> 0<00:02:48.430> was<00:02:48.610> the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
but I think from what I gather 0 was the

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.490 
but I think from what I gather 0 was the
u.s.<00:02:49.260> channel<00:02:50.260> son<00:02:51.630> but<00:02:52.630> that's<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:53.080> that's<00:02:53.350> the

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
u.s. channel son but that's a that's the

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.020 
u.s. channel son but that's a that's the
receiver<00:02:53.860> itself<00:02:54.100> and<00:02:54.280> they<00:02:54.340> say<00:02:54.519> don't<00:02:54.700> power

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
receiver itself and they say don't power

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.300 
receiver itself and they say don't power
it<00:02:55.209> up<00:02:55.269> until<00:02:55.569> you've<00:02:55.780> got<00:02:55.950> your<00:02:56.950> antenna

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
it up until you've got your antenna

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.460 
it up until you've got your antenna
because<00:02:57.730> it<00:02:57.880> antenna<00:02:58.330> acts<00:02:58.569> as<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:58.840> transistor

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
because it antenna acts as a transistor

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.630 
because it antenna acts as a transistor
or<00:02:59.500> something<00:02:59.799> like<00:02:59.860> that<00:02:59.950> on<00:03:00.069> the<00:03:00.370> on<00:03:00.580> the

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
or something like that on the on the

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.880 
or something like that on the on the
whole<00:03:00.910> system<00:03:01.120> so<00:03:02.310> don't<00:03:03.310> plug<00:03:03.519> it<00:03:03.670> in<00:03:04.890> max

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
whole system so don't plug it in max

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.690 
whole system so don't plug it in max
keep<00:03:06.580> unfolding<00:03:08.099> this<00:03:09.099> is<00:03:09.250> one<00:03:09.430> thing<00:03:09.549> i<00:03:09.640> don't

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
keep unfolding this is one thing i don't

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.100 
keep unfolding this is one thing i don't
like<00:03:09.940> they<00:03:10.840> just<00:03:12.330> they<00:03:13.330> just<00:03:13.360> put<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.780> camera

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
like they just they just put the camera

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.430 
like they just they just put the camera
in<00:03:14.170> there<00:03:14.319> like<00:03:14.440> this<00:03:14.730> so<00:03:15.840> so<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:16.900> bouncer<00:03:17.290> are

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
in there like this so so the bouncer are

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.729 
in there like this so so the bouncer are

the<00:03:23.739> back<00:03:23.920> of<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.100> camera<00:03:24.340> it's<00:03:25.239> got<00:03:25.359> a<00:03:25.390> blue

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
the back of the camera it's got a blue

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.009 
the back of the camera it's got a blue
PCB<00:03:26.079> sort<00:03:26.680> of<00:03:26.829> quality<00:03:27.040> looks<00:03:27.340> really<00:03:27.640> good

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
PCB sort of quality looks really good

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.569 
PCB sort of quality looks really good
and<00:03:29.019> it's<00:03:29.500> not<00:03:29.650> real<00:03:29.859> thin<00:03:30.959> thin<00:03:31.959> PCB<00:03:32.579> camera

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
and it's not real thin thin PCB camera

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:38.699 
and it's not real thin thin PCB camera
has<00:03:33.700> a<00:03:33.730> little<00:03:33.940> cover<00:03:34.120> on<00:03:34.299> it<00:03:34.329> I<00:03:37.410> don't<00:03:38.410> it

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
has a little cover on it I don't it

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.890 
has a little cover on it I don't it
doesn't<00:03:38.890> look<00:03:39.160> plastic<00:03:39.760> but<00:03:40.480> then<00:03:40.630> again<00:03:40.750> I

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
doesn't look plastic but then again I

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.620 
doesn't look plastic but then again I
mean<00:03:41.109> who<00:03:41.739> knows<00:03:42.150> maybe<00:03:43.150> it<00:03:43.299> was<00:03:43.389> a<00:03:43.450> different

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
mean who knows maybe it was a different

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.420 
mean who knows maybe it was a different
camera<00:03:43.959> they're<00:03:44.200> talking<00:03:44.620> about<00:03:44.709> but<00:03:45.010> we'll

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
camera they're talking about but we'll

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.520 
camera they're talking about but we'll
we'll<00:03:46.150> test<00:03:46.389> it<00:03:46.540> out<00:03:46.630> anyways<00:03:47.019> and<00:03:47.109> find<00:03:47.350> that

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
we'll test it out anyways and find that

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.009 
we'll test it out anyways and find that
out<00:03:47.700> that's<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:48.850> camera<00:03:49.180> came<00:03:49.329> with<00:03:49.450> it<00:03:49.569> there

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
out that's the camera came with it there

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.199 
out that's the camera came with it there
were<00:03:50.109> also<00:03:50.170> some<00:03:50.590> reports<00:03:51.040> that<00:03:51.100> the<00:03:51.519> deposit

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
were also some reports that the deposit

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.610 
were also some reports that the deposit
and<00:03:52.269> the<00:03:52.359> negative<00:03:52.780> were<00:03:52.930> reversed<00:03:53.350> on<00:03:53.500> the

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
and the negative were reversed on the

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.940 
and the negative were reversed on the
plug<00:03:53.799> on<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:55.180> on<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:55.870> actual<00:03:56.290> plug<00:03:56.560> in<00:03:56.739> here

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
plug on the on the actual plug in here

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.370 
plug on the on the actual plug in here
so<00:03:57.609> when<00:03:57.760> you<00:03:57.819> plug<00:03:58.000> it<00:03:58.120> in<00:03:58.239> it<00:03:58.870> burned<00:03:59.109> up<00:03:59.290> the

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
so when you plug it in it burned up the

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.170 
so when you plug it in it burned up the
camera<00:03:59.739> and<00:03:59.769> I'm<00:04:00.730> going<00:04:00.880> to<00:04:00.910> make<00:04:01.030> sure<00:04:01.150> I

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
camera and I'm going to make sure I

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.020 
camera and I'm going to make sure I
check<00:04:01.480> that<00:04:01.660> before<00:04:02.049> I<00:04:02.319> do<00:04:02.980> anything<00:04:03.130> else<00:04:03.579> so

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
check that before I do anything else so

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.059 
check that before I do anything else so
that's<00:04:04.840> the<00:04:05.049> camera

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.410 

right<00:04:09.579> there<00:04:10.109> there's<00:04:11.109> two<00:04:11.230> antennas<00:04:11.680> here

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
right there there's two antennas here

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.050 
right there there's two antennas here
civil<00:04:13.420> bigger<00:04:14.019> antennas<00:04:14.499> I<00:04:14.879> don't<00:04:15.879> know

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
civil bigger antennas I don't know

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.050 
civil bigger antennas I don't know
especially<00:04:16.359> antennas<00:04:17.139> okay<00:04:17.680> I<00:04:18.280> don't<00:04:18.970> even

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
especially antennas okay I don't even

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.560 
especially antennas okay I don't even
know<00:04:19.180> if<00:04:19.239> their<00:04:19.359> honor<00:04:19.509> but<00:04:19.930> a<00:04:21.479> larger<00:04:22.479> than

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
know if their honor but a larger than

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.659 
know if their honor but a larger than
your<00:04:22.720> standard<00:04:22.870> one<00:04:23.199> so<00:04:23.440> it's<00:04:23.979> only<00:04:24.070> 200<00:04:24.639> a

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
your standard one so it's only 200 a

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.100 
your standard one so it's only 200 a
lock<00:04:24.880> system<00:04:25.210> so<00:04:25.389> as<00:04:25.419> you<00:04:25.660> know<00:04:25.690> you're<00:04:25.990> going

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
lock system so as you know you're going

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
lock system so as you know you're going
to<00:04:26.169> get<00:04:26.349> basic<00:04:27.160> stuff<00:04:27.370> here<00:04:28.139> RCA<00:04:29.139> cables<00:04:29.590> video

to get basic stuff here RCA cables video
audio<00:04:30.490> of<00:04:30.789> course<00:04:31.120> there's<00:04:31.270> no<00:04:31.360> audio<00:04:31.660> on<00:04:31.720> this

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
audio of course there's no audio on this

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.170 
audio of course there's no audio on this
camera<00:04:32.110> so<00:04:32.680> and<00:04:33.250> then<00:04:33.460> this<00:04:33.610> is<00:04:33.729> what<00:04:33.849> they<00:04:33.970> say

camera so and then this is what they say
is<00:04:34.360> really<00:04:34.570> important<00:04:35.020> for<00:04:35.169> fue<00:04:35.650> you<00:04:35.889> don't

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
is really important for fue you don't

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:37.379 
is really important for fue you don't
have<00:04:36.130> to<00:04:36.250> make<00:04:36.340> up<00:04:36.400> your<00:04:36.520> own<00:04:36.639> wiring<00:04:36.910> harness

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
have to make up your own wiring harness

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:42.659 
have to make up your own wiring harness
for<00:04:37.599> it<00:04:39.030> the<00:04:40.030> receiver<00:04:40.419> and<00:04:41.280> plug<00:04:42.280> just<00:04:42.490> plug

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
for it the receiver and plug just plug

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:43.890 
for it the receiver and plug just plug
right<00:04:42.820> in<00:04:43.000> but<00:04:43.300> you<00:04:43.360> got<00:04:43.479> to<00:04:43.539> make<00:04:43.690> sure<00:04:43.750> that

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
right in but you got to make sure that

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.600 
right in but you got to make sure that
these<00:04:44.139> wires<00:04:44.380> match<00:04:44.680> up<00:04:44.949> the<00:04:44.979> yellow<00:04:45.310> white

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
these wires match up the yellow white

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.589 
these wires match up the yellow white
video<00:04:47.310> the<00:04:48.310> red<00:04:48.490> and<00:04:48.580> the<00:04:48.639> black<00:04:48.820> he's<00:04:49.300> outside

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:49.599 
video the red and the black he's outside

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:52.520 
video the red and the black he's outside
yeah<00:04:50.349> red<00:04:50.830> in<00:04:50.949> the<00:04:51.070> black<00:04:51.280> line<00:04:51.699> up<00:04:51.880> here<00:04:52.150> and

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
yeah red in the black line up here and

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.659 
yeah red in the black line up here and
then<00:04:53.530> it's<00:04:53.710> got<00:04:53.889> your<00:04:54.039> plug<00:04:54.220> for<00:04:54.400> your<00:04:54.490> battery

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
then it's got your plug for your battery

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.939 
then it's got your plug for your battery
and<00:04:55.479> of<00:04:56.259> course<00:04:56.500> your<00:04:56.800> camera<00:04:57.639> camera<00:04:58.360> and<00:04:58.949> so

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
and of course your camera camera and so

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:01.650 
and of course your camera camera and so
if<00:05:00.220> you<00:05:00.340> look<00:05:00.520> on<00:05:00.639> the<00:05:00.759> camera<00:05:01.120> see<00:05:01.419> they<00:05:01.539> had

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
if you look on the camera see they had

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.969 
if you look on the camera see they had
to<00:05:01.780> switch<00:05:02.020> something<00:05:02.380> on<00:05:02.470> there<00:05:02.620> so<00:05:02.740> I<00:05:02.800> wonder

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
to switch something on there so I wonder

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:04.950 
to switch something on there so I wonder
if<00:05:03.099> that<00:05:03.220> was<00:05:03.400> the<00:05:03.639> switch<00:05:03.940> he's<00:05:04.690> got<00:05:04.900> the

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
if that was the switch he's got the

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.930 
if that was the switch he's got the
black<00:05:05.169> and<00:05:05.320> the<00:05:05.410> red<00:05:05.500> switch<00:05:05.800> so<00:05:06.669> that's<00:05:06.820> the

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
black and the red switch so that's the

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.659 
black and the red switch so that's the
camera<00:05:07.240> there<00:05:07.389> and<00:05:07.539> it<00:05:07.599> also<00:05:07.720> comes<00:05:08.020> with<00:05:08.110> a

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
camera there and it also comes with a

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.089 
camera there and it also comes with a
pluckers<00:05:09.669> eight<00:05:09.960> to<00:05:10.960> wire<00:05:11.139> up<00:05:11.169> your<00:05:11.410> own<00:05:11.590> to

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:12.099 
pluckers eight to wire up your own to

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:15.270 
pluckers eight to wire up your own to
use<00:05:12.250> the<00:05:12.460> audio<00:05:12.669> I<00:05:13.259> believe<00:05:14.259> if<00:05:14.830> you<00:05:15.099> have

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
use the audio I believe if you have

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.180 
use the audio I believe if you have
another<00:05:15.550> camera<00:05:16.030> that<00:05:16.930> has<00:05:17.110> audio<00:05:17.349> there's<00:05:17.889> 4

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
another camera that has audio there's 4

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.120 
another camera that has audio there's 4
wires<00:05:18.400> on<00:05:18.520> this<00:05:18.729> one<00:05:18.880> they<00:05:18.970> all<00:05:19.060> match<00:05:19.300> up

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
wires on this one they all match up

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:27.510 
wires on this one they all match up
yellow<00:05:21.130> red<00:05:21.280> white<00:05:21.310> and<00:05:21.610> black<00:05:21.759> so<00:05:25.949> that<00:05:26.949> the

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
yellow red white and black so that the

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.399 
yellow red white and black so that the
quality<00:05:27.849> looks<00:05:28.030> good<00:05:28.330> I<00:05:28.509> can't<00:05:29.050> wait<00:05:29.169> to<00:05:29.199> try

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:29.409 
quality looks good I can't wait to try

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:31.649 
quality looks good I can't wait to try
it<00:05:29.440> out<00:05:29.650> just<00:05:30.490> this<00:05:30.729> is<00:05:30.880> a<00:05:30.909> basic<00:05:31.120> system<00:05:31.539> that
