hi<00:00:00.269> Rebecca<00:00:00.630> in<00:00:00.989> permaculture<00:00:01.709> and<00:00:02.129> also<00:00:02.580> in

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
hi Rebecca in permaculture and also in

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.950 
hi Rebecca in permaculture and also in
Montessori<00:00:03.179> education<00:00:03.300> and<00:00:04.069> I<00:00:05.870> put<00:00:06.870> together

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
Montessori education and I put together

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.320 
Montessori education and I put together
this<00:00:07.350> church<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.700> help<00:00:08.820> myself<00:00:09.710> what<00:00:10.710> to

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
this church to to help myself what to

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.150 
this church to to help myself what to
sort<00:00:12.330> of<00:00:12.420> distill<00:00:12.809> some<00:00:13.019> of<00:00:13.200> that<00:00:13.440> wisdom<00:00:13.679> that

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
sort of distill some of that wisdom that

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.200 
sort of distill some of that wisdom that
I<00:00:14.219> gained<00:00:14.490> from<00:00:14.730> those<00:00:14.940> two<00:00:14.969> traditions<00:00:15.630> and

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
I gained from those two traditions and

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.420 
I gained from those two traditions and
hopefully<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.449> use<00:00:19.289> that<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.980> share<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.310> with

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
hopefully to use that to share it with

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.310 
hopefully to use that to share it with
other<00:00:20.580> other<00:00:21.330> individuals<00:00:22.109> and

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
other other individuals and

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.540 
other other individuals and
organizations<00:00:23.930> because<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.769> draws<00:00:26.070> on<00:00:26.250> so

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
organizations because it it draws on so

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.670 
organizations because it it draws on so
much<00:00:26.760> learning<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.480> did<00:00:27.750> for<00:00:28.080> period

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
much learning that I did for period

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.259 
much learning that I did for period
about<00:00:28.769> 10<00:00:29.099> years<00:00:29.279> in<00:00:29.789> permaculture

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
about 10 years in permaculture

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.459 
about 10 years in permaculture
principles<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:31.700> a<00:00:33.110> lot<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.320> learning

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
principles and a lot of that learning

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.940 
principles and a lot of that learning
was<00:00:34.860> very<00:00:35.100> difficult<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.870> convoluted<00:00:37.530> for<00:00:37.829> me

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
was very difficult and convoluted for me

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.819 
was very difficult and convoluted for me
and<00:00:38.040> it's<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.250> lot<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.610> time<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.710> understand<00:00:40.710> it

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
and it's a lot of time to understand it

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.950 
and it's a lot of time to understand it
the<00:00:40.980> way<00:00:41.250> they<00:00:41.399> truly<00:00:42.180> came<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:44.329> embody<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.629> was

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
the way they truly came to embody it was

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.990 
the way they truly came to embody it was
by<00:00:46.230> taking<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.430> more<00:00:47.579> personal<00:00:47.969> level

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
by taking it to a more personal level

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.389 
by taking it to a more personal level
rather<00:00:48.660> than<00:00:48.809> keeping<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.860> ass<00:00:50.070> track

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
rather than keeping it in the ass track

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.850 
rather than keeping it in the ass track
I<00:00:51.230> guess<00:00:52.230> some<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.469> them<00:00:52.710> are<00:00:52.860> connected<00:00:53.370> but

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
I guess some of them are connected but

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.709 
I guess some of them are connected but
share<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.890> abundance<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.300> very<00:00:57.539> simple

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
share the abundance is a very simple

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.779 
share the abundance is a very simple
principle<00:00:58.020> but<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.920> really<00:00:59.129> makes<00:00:59.489> sense

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
principle but it it really makes sense

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.719 
principle but it it really makes sense
if<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.899> plan<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.680> have<00:01:02.129> enough<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.550> share<00:01:03.260> and

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
if you plan to have enough to share and

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.340 
if you plan to have enough to share and
you<00:01:05.729> go<00:01:05.909> into<00:01:06.299> any<00:01:06.479> project<00:01:07.020> with<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
you go into any project with the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.719 
you go into any project with the
knowledge<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.860> you're<00:01:08.159> going<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.520> be

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
knowledge that you're going to be

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.370 
knowledge that you're going to be
sharing<00:01:08.970> what<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.479> different<00:01:09.780> perspective<00:01:10.020> you

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
sharing what a different perspective you

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.280 
sharing what a different perspective you
have<00:01:10.560> them<00:01:10.799> then<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.549> scarcity<00:01:12.150> principle

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
have them then the scarcity principle

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.800 
have them then the scarcity principle
there's<00:01:13.290> never<00:01:13.530> enough<00:01:14.000> there's<00:01:15.000> always<00:01:15.330> an

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
there's never enough there's always an

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.980 
there's never enough there's always an
abundance<00:01:16.340> it<00:01:17.340> does<00:01:18.030> require<00:01:18.240> looking<00:01:18.750> for<00:01:18.930> it

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
abundance it does require looking for it

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.410 
abundance it does require looking for it
sometimes<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.580> kind<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:20.970> connects<00:01:21.270> with

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
sometimes and that kind of connects with

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.929 
sometimes and that kind of connects with
this<00:01:21.570> idea<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.080> harvest<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.530> unlimited

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
this idea that the harvest is unlimited

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.999 
this idea that the harvest is unlimited
so<00:01:26.000> as<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.060> Montessori<00:01:27.840> teacher<00:01:27.869> one<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
so as a Montessori teacher one of the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.190 
so as a Montessori teacher one of the
things<00:01:29.130> we<00:01:29.369> talked<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.390> lot<00:01:30.509> about<00:01:30.570> where<00:01:31.079> it's

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
things we talked a lot about where it's

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.060 
things we talked a lot about where it's
planting<00:01:31.619> seeds<00:01:31.950> with<00:01:32.759> young<00:01:32.939> children

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
planting seeds with young children

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.260 
planting seeds with young children
show<00:01:35.070> there<00:01:35.189> between<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.520> age<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.670> about<00:01:35.909> six

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
show there between the age of about six

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.289 
show there between the age of about six
and<00:01:36.450> 12<00:01:36.689> are<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.049> eager<00:01:37.320> for<00:01:37.729> for<00:01:38.729> information

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
and 12 are so eager for for information

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.090 
and 12 are so eager for for information
they<00:01:39.420> may<00:01:39.540> not<00:01:39.659> mean<00:01:39.810> they<00:01:40.350> may<00:01:40.530> not<00:01:40.680> carry

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
they may not mean they may not carry

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.010 
they may not mean they may not carry
that<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.729> details<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.330> the<00:01:42.420> information<00:01:42.750> but

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
that the details of the information but

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.929 
that the details of the information but
you<00:01:43.110> can<00:01:43.259> plant<00:01:43.530> seeds<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.159> will<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.909> they

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
you can plant seeds that will that they

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.120 
you can plant seeds that will that they
can<00:01:45.149> return<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.720> out<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.350> get<00:01:46.770> more<00:01:47.040> in

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
can return to this out and get more in

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.969 
can return to this out and get more in
depth<00:01:47.659> so<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.810> idea<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.290> harvest<00:01:49.680> I

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
depth so the idea that the harvest I

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.300 
depth so the idea that the harvest I
really<00:01:50.940> love<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.330> concept<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.259> harvest<00:01:52.680> any

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
really love the concept of a harvest any

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.899 
really love the concept of a harvest any
kind<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.810> endeavor<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:54.930> we<00:01:55.170> go<00:01:56.159> into<00:01:56.369> if<00:01:56.700> we

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
kind of endeavor that we go into if we

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.760 
kind of endeavor that we go into if we
think<00:01:57.390> about<00:01:57.509> where<00:01:58.140> do<00:01:58.200> we<00:01:58.289> try<00:01:58.470> to<00:01:58.530> harvest

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
think about where do we try to harvest

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:06.010 
think about where do we try to harvest
are<00:01:59.070> we<00:01:59.250> trying<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.580> share<00:01:59.939> out<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:03.590> and

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
are we trying to share out of that and

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.020 
are we trying to share out of that and
again<00:02:07.310> infernal<00:02:08.310> culture<00:02:08.580> when<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.819> harvest

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
again infernal culture when you harvest

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.999 
again infernal culture when you harvest
you're<00:02:09.390> never<00:02:09.660> going<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.050> damage<00:02:10.319> the

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
you're never going to damage the

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.009 
you're never going to damage the
structures<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.670> have<00:02:11.850> in<00:02:12.030> place<00:02:12.239> your

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
structures that you have in place your

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.710 
structures that you have in place your
goal<00:02:13.260> isn't<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.680> rip<00:02:14.280> up<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.640> soil<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.209> expose

dynamics that are being created so your

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.219 
dynamics that are being created so your
solution<00:06:12.800> is<00:06:13.130> already<00:06:13.639> there<00:06:14.600> and<00:06:14.930> it<00:06:15.110> may

solution is already there and it may

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:16.870 
solution is already there and it may
take<00:06:15.470> some<00:06:15.620> untangling<00:06:16.190> but<00:06:16.460> you're<00:06:16.639> probably

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
take some untangling but you're probably

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:24.210 
take some untangling but you're probably
there<00:06:19.840> this<00:06:20.840> one<00:06:21.050> I<00:06:21.110> think<00:06:21.259> is<00:06:22.030> very<00:06:23.030> useful
