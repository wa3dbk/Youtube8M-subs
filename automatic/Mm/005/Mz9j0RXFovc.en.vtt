minutes<00:01:32.970> after<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:34.020> take<00:01:34.409> my<00:01:34.439> CJC<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.250> take

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
minutes after I take my CJC so I take

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.420 
minutes after I take my CJC so I take
the<00:01:35.549> CJC<00:01:35.850> first<00:01:36.380> obviously<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.650> CJC<00:01:37.979> helps

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
the CJC first obviously the CJC helps

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.270 
the CJC first obviously the CJC helps
create<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.450> GH<00:01:39.869> rp6<00:01:40.350> releases<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.070> so

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
create it in the GH rp6 releases it so

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.350 
create it in the GH rp6 releases it so
that's<00:01:42.090> why<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.299> do<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.770> um<00:01:44.060> other<00:01:45.060> than<00:01:45.180> that
