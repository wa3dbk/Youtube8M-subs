00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.870
 tight then you are more like a putty but 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:04.120
 very 5 on lips 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:07.070
 and he only caramel on the verge of pink 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.720

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.570
 in a shade of 18 pairs of papaya movie 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.750
 and he doesn't like it in principle either 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:28.409
 the fact that he is absolutely not sticky with him 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.409
 very nice . 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.399
 but their principle is not visible that is such 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:39.369
 gentle peach just the color on the lips and 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:42.069
 smells like some apricot kai gasoline 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.500

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:47.439

 This is from the very first such we observe color 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:07.229
 like mousse 1 what time i bought it 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.539
 also in Germany by the way because we have 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.510
 In general, this shade was not I was so 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.910
 so glad but in principle I'm not particularly so 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.150
 and many did not use but good for 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.490
 magicians that does not cause to be 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.459
 perfect lips of course necessary in principle 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:27.060

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.530
 Well, in principle, on the lips it is not very 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:42.660
 love was she taking someone with such 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:44.489
 wet effect just here but not me not 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.830

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.470
 they are felt on the lips 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.250
 roll probably brain strangling team 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.250
 unpleasant 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.290
 with 4 pallets of that money I have odnushki 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.860

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.080

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.100
 with them by 7 I go it by the way he does not 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.240
 growth is not reflected 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:29.080
 and I am generally very beautiful but when I 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:32.630
 Here they were applied to the eyes, they just 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.970
 board I did not master it for 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.700
 chunks of raids but what do I have ever 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.130
 dry but honestly to me some 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.250
 but we all dried well 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:48.320
 not so much and when the color tattoo came out 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:50.270
 we are not yet tired of these 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.280

 so beautiful but also on the eyelids at prayer 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:04.790
 it looks like I'm one of the things 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:08.600
 the same name is pretty but I also came across 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:11.270
 colors that are generally not very 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:15.020
 they rolled off very quickly but these 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:18.430
 minutes in shade 35 party all night 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:23.570

 sequins sequins dish sequins close 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.080

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.300

 emerald souls there are such and this is even 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:41.530
 more pigmented than my dugout 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:43.900
 I just take the substrate as we will and this 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:46.570
 heart times we already talk about the eyes off 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.800
 I also have a pencil is from the series 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:50.460
 long lasting 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.460
 oh pansy 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:55.599
 and here such type as kayal which 

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:58.119
 unscrewed from me when it was even 

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:59.860
 makeup with this summer makeup is very 

00:06:58.119 --> 00:07:04.539
 cool pencil in the sense that 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:07.119
 kept until you did not want to put his 

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:09.580
 laying he does not cause very irritation 

00:07:07.119 --> 00:07:15.330
 fashion line on the water line he too 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:18.309
 it seems that he is so dark 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:20.830
 grassy green love very much 

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:22.779
 Well, I think I'll draw an eye for the summer 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.360
 it seems under blue eyes under brown 

00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:27.339
 eyes I do not know very very cool 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.409
 Looks dissatisfied and I have this 

00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:32.830
 white from and specially bought and they 

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:35.349
 dvd is not up to but honestly he is very somehow 

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:37.959
 bad at not holding literally two 

00:07:35.349 --> 00:07:38.619
 and so very cool as a base and I 

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:41.349
 searched 

00:07:38.619 --> 00:07:43.539
 Germany as nowhere jumbo pencil even 

00:07:41.349 --> 00:07:45.789
 small did not find emptiness 

00:07:43.539 --> 00:07:48.639
 white immediately there is a chalk called everything 

00:07:45.789 --> 00:07:50.199
 snapping up does and I'm pretty honest 

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:52.479
 saying he's very good pigmented 

00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:54.099
 but the hotel is not on this substrate 

00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:57.129
 only there just there to draw 

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:59.589
 new incomes yes that's all you can 

00:07:57.129 --> 00:08:02.139
 come to the brown channel and see 

00:07:59.589 --> 00:08:05.849
 other products and our opinions of them and 

00:08:02.139 --> 00:08:05.849
 until new meetings bye
