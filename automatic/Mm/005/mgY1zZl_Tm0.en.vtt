00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.970 

later<00:01:54.140> on<00:01:54.290> it<00:01:54.410> sounds<00:01:54.590> like<00:01:54.680> it's<00:01:54.770> gonna<00:01:54.830> go

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
so you could just take the slide up to

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:06.250 
so you could just take the slide up to
