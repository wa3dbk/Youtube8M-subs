00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.289 
it's it's one one definite one good
point<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.290> think<00:01:34.729> okay<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:35.759> we're<00:01:36.060> saying<00:01:36.210> that

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
point to think okay so we're saying that

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.270 
point to think okay so we're saying that
Gary<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.659> having<00:01:37.530> his<00:01:37.619> arms<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:37.950> or<00:01:38.040> too<00:01:38.130> high

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
Gary is having his arms on or too high

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.620 
Gary is having his arms on or too high
let's<00:01:38.490> just<00:01:38.670> go<00:01:38.790> for<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.299> top<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.570> the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
let's just go for that so the top of the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.330 
let's just go for that so the top of the
backswing<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.049> stand<00:01:40.259> up<00:01:40.380> possibly

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
backswing you stand up possibly

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.210 
backswing you stand up possibly
Gary's<00:01:42.030> arms<00:01:42.329> they're<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.750> little<00:01:43.200> bit<00:01:43.409> -<00:01:43.649> yeah

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
Gary's arms they're a little bit - yeah

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.740 
Gary's arms they're a little bit - yeah
that<00:01:44.520> sounds<00:01:44.700> about<00:01:44.850> right<00:01:45.000> yeah<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:45.659> I'm

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
that sounds about right yeah and so I'm

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.420 
that sounds about right yeah and so I'm
here<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.290> move<00:01:46.500> really<00:01:46.770> makes<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.220> very

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
here the move really makes it very

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.980 
here the move really makes it very
difficult<00:01:47.939> then<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.119> actually<00:01:48.540> get<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.840> tool

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
difficult then to actually get the tool

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.510 
difficult then to actually get the tool
back<00:01:49.200> on<00:01:49.409> fine<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.829> be<00:01:49.950> very<00:01:50.100> coordinated

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
back on fine it to be very coordinated

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.600 
back on fine it to be very coordinated
very<00:01:51.360> talented<00:01:51.630> but<00:01:52.590> what<00:01:52.799> can<00:01:53.130> often<00:01:53.430> happen

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
very talented but what can often happen

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.280 
very talented but what can often happen
premiere<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.149> sort<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.420> smoothly<00:01:54.960> comes

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
premiere is is sort of smoothly comes

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.260 
premiere is is sort of smoothly comes
very<00:01:55.590> steep<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.219> way<00:01:56.399> above<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.850> swing<00:01:57.060> plane

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
very steep and way above the swing plane

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.819 
very steep and way above the swing plane
and<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:58.020> caused<00:01:58.259> all<00:01:58.469> sorts<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.770> problems

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
and this caused all sorts of problems

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.560 
and this caused all sorts of problems
players<00:01:59.250> yeah<00:01:59.460> things<00:01:59.939> interesting<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.420> say

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
players yeah things interesting you say

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.420 
players yeah things interesting you say
there<00:02:00.750> Andy<00:02:01.020> if<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.500> spend<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.799> lot<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.040> time

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
there Andy if you spend a lot of time

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.130 
there Andy if you spend a lot of time
hitting<00:02:02.759> shots<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.390> you're<00:02:03.479> aware<00:02:03.869> that

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
hitting shots and you're aware that

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.600 
hitting shots and you're aware that
you're<00:02:04.350> over<00:02:04.590> you're<00:02:04.920> over<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.280> top<00:02:05.460> from

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
you're over you're over the top from

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.459 
you're over you're over the top from
your<00:02:05.700> side<00:02:05.850> position<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.659> can<00:02:06.899> shallow<00:02:07.259> it

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
your side position you can shallow it

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.469 
your side position you can shallow it
down<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:07.979> some<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.369> best<00:02:08.640> players<00:02:08.940> in<00:02:09.090> the

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
down so some of the best players in the

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.360 
down so some of the best players in the
best<00:02:09.840> ball<00:02:10.050> strikers<00:02:10.500> ever<00:02:10.679> in<00:02:10.830> fury<00:02:11.129> think

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
best ball strikers ever in fury think

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.610 
best ball strikers ever in fury think
absolutely<00:02:12.180> think<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:12.750> Nick<00:02:12.870> Faldo<00:02:13.290> as<00:02:13.470> well

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
absolutely think it Nick Faldo as well

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.400 
absolutely think it Nick Faldo as well
with<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.890> first<00:02:14.670> person<00:02:15.030> we<00:02:15.150> really<00:02:15.180> saw<00:02:15.690> put

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
with the first person we really saw put

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.570 
with the first person we really saw put
a<00:02:16.440> lot<00:02:16.590> of<00:02:16.680> emphasis<00:02:16.860> on<00:02:17.190> this<00:02:17.430> you<00:02:17.550> know

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
a lot of emphasis on this you know

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.280 
a lot of emphasis on this you know
dropping<00:02:18.180> that<00:02:18.300> arm<00:02:18.510> playing<00:02:18.840> from<00:02:19.050> a<00:02:19.140> high

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
dropping that arm playing from a high

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.920 
dropping that arm playing from a high
position<00:02:19.560> so<00:02:20.220> that<00:02:20.400> can<00:02:20.580> absolutely<00:02:20.819> work<00:02:21.540> but

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
position so that can absolutely work but

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.960 
position so that can absolutely work but
maybe<00:02:22.620> we<00:02:22.830> can<00:02:22.950> make<00:02:23.099> it<00:02:23.220> easy<00:02:23.370> so<00:02:23.519> just<00:02:23.670> do<00:02:23.819> one

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
maybe we can make it easy so just do one

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.130 
maybe we can make it easy so just do one
more<00:02:24.090> time<00:02:24.269> for<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.599> bad<00:02:24.810> one<00:02:24.989> if<00:02:25.080> you

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
more time for the bad one if you

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.509 
more time for the bad one if you
couldn't<00:02:25.349> we're<00:02:25.590> going<00:02:25.709> to<00:02:25.769> get<00:02:25.860> Andy<00:02:26.130> to<00:02:26.160> hit

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
couldn't we're going to get Andy to hit

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.120 
couldn't we're going to get Andy to hit
one<00:02:26.730> there's<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.360> bad<00:02:27.510> one<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:27.959> swing<00:02:28.530> down<00:02:28.650> just

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
one there's a bad one so swing down just

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.400 
one there's a bad one so swing down just
so<00:02:29.250> half<00:02:29.519> way<00:02:29.730> down<00:02:29.940> for<00:02:30.209> me<00:02:30.360> this<00:02:30.870> is<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.110> move

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
so half way down for me this is the move

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.500 
so half way down for me this is the move
that<00:02:31.590> I<00:02:31.650> like<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.190> call<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.550> decapitation

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
that I like to call the decapitation

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.780 
that I like to call the decapitation
move<00:02:33.780> because<00:02:34.470> when<00:02:34.620> we<00:02:34.739> get<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.010> camera<00:02:35.430> it

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
move because when we get the camera it

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.280 
move because when we get the camera it
sounds<00:02:36.090> disgusting<00:02:36.209> doesn't<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.780> but<00:02:37.110> when<00:02:37.260> we

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
sounds disgusting doesn't it but when we

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.380 
sounds disgusting doesn't it but when we
get<00:02:37.590> there<00:02:38.069> people<00:02:38.489> move<00:02:38.670> video<00:02:39.000> them<00:02:39.209> on<00:02:39.299> the

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
get there people move video them on the

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.390 
get there people move video them on the
goal<00:02:39.540> spoon<00:02:39.780> we<00:02:39.900> can<00:02:40.049> see<00:02:40.260> if<00:02:40.349> this<00:02:40.500> shaft<00:02:41.160> were

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
goal spoon we can see if this shaft were

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.400 
goal spoon we can see if this shaft were
sword<00:02:41.880> and<00:02:42.209> they<00:02:42.660> would<00:02:42.810> be<00:02:42.900> chopping<00:02:43.290> his

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
sword and they would be chopping his

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.910 
sword and they would be chopping his
head<00:02:43.440> off

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
head off

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.460 
head off
Ryan<00:02:44.099> now<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:44.910> thus<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.599> decapitation<00:02:46.260> moves

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
Ryan now so thus the decapitation moves

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.300 
Ryan now so thus the decapitation moves
so<00:02:46.709> from<00:02:46.920> there

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
so from there

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.030 
so from there
very<00:02:47.730> difficult<00:02:48.269> to<00:02:48.690> hit<00:02:48.870> maybe<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.380> straight

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
very difficult to hit maybe a straight

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.259 
very difficult to hit maybe a straight
definitely<00:02:50.430> very<00:02:50.579> difficult<00:02:50.880> it<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.030> straight

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
definitely very difficult it a straight

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.300 
definitely very difficult it a straight
shot<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.750> you're<00:02:52.620> probably<00:02:52.829> going<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.220> a

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
shot and you're probably going to a

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.979 
shot and you're probably going to a
phase<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:54.090> unfortunately<00:02:54.690> you're<00:02:54.840> probably

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
phase and unfortunately you're probably

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.180 
phase and unfortunately you're probably
due<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.410> slice<00:02:55.620> yes

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
due to a slice yes

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.789 
due to a slice yes
so<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.400> think<00:02:56.519> I'll<00:02:56.760> go<00:02:57.060> please<00:02:57.390> okay<00:02:57.799> otherwise

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
so I think I'll go please okay otherwise

lower our look and see what happens
let's<00:04:00.150> just<00:04:00.299> go<00:04:00.420> through<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.840> description<00:04:01.440> of

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
let's just go through the description of

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.979 
let's just go through the description of
that<00:04:01.560> okay<00:04:02.280> so<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.910> lower<00:04:03.120> arm<00:04:03.389> playing<00:04:03.690> so

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
it's really sort of more connected on

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:06.860 
it's really sort of more connected on
the<00:04:05.609> way<00:04:05.730> back<00:04:05.910> walls<00:04:06.120> notice<00:04:06.480> five<00:04:06.630> swing

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
the way back walls notice five swing

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.930 
the way back walls notice five swing
back<00:04:07.079> here<00:04:07.290> my<00:04:07.440> arms<00:04:08.310> and<00:04:08.430> body<00:04:08.549> are<00:04:08.790> a<00:04:08.819> little

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
back here my arms and body are a little

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.550 
back here my arms and body are a little
bit<00:04:09.120> more<00:04:09.150> in<00:04:09.419> sync<00:04:09.690> so<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:09.989> left<00:04:10.169> arm<00:04:10.380> is<00:04:10.530> a

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
bit more in sync so the left arm is a

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.949 
bit more in sync so the left arm is a
little<00:04:10.739> bit<00:04:10.859> more<00:04:10.980> across<00:04:11.639> the<00:04:11.849> chest<00:04:12.150> similar

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
angle to my my shoulder angles within a

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.890 
angle to my my shoulder angles within a
video<00:04:14.940> on<00:04:15.030> this<00:04:15.120> tree<00:04:15.299> so<00:04:15.359> that<00:04:15.419> we<00:04:15.569> just<00:04:15.780> did

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
video on this tree so that we just did

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.930 
video on this tree so that we just did
Rose<00:04:16.079> yet<00:04:16.470> how<00:04:16.829> we've<00:04:16.979> made<00:04:17.220> that<00:04:17.430> change<00:04:17.669> and

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
Rose yet how we've made that change and

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.250 
Rose yet how we've made that change and
from<00:04:18.090> here<00:04:18.269> now<00:04:18.419> it's<00:04:18.599> so<00:04:18.750> much<00:04:18.810> easier<00:04:19.019> then

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
from here now it's so much easier then

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.020

there look at the plane much much better

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.700 
there look at the plane much much better
that<00:06:06.790> club<00:06:07.030> from<00:06:07.570> there<00:06:07.870> you<00:06:08.410> can<00:06:08.560> hit<00:06:08.650> it

that club from there you can hit it

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.020 
that club from there you can hit it
right<00:06:08.980> but<00:06:09.220> it's<00:06:09.370> going<00:06:09.460> to<00:06:09.520> be<00:06:09.640> a<00:06:09.670> different

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
right but it's going to be a different

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.100 
right but it's going to be a different
kind<00:06:10.150> of<00:06:10.330> right<00:06:10.480> it's<00:06:10.660> not<00:06:10.750> going<00:06:10.870> to<00:06:10.960> be<00:06:11.020> the

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
kind of right it's not going to be the

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.600 
kind of right it's not going to be the
slice<00:06:11.380> like<00:06:11.650> you'll<00:06:11.890> be<00:06:11.950> the<00:06:12.160> over<00:06:12.370> the<00:06:12.430> top

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
slice like you'll be the over the top

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.210 
slice like you'll be the over the top
slice<00:06:12.850> so<00:06:13.510> I<00:06:13.780> think<00:06:14.230> that<00:06:14.500> the<00:06:14.770> big<00:06:14.950> thing<00:06:15.130> for

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
slice so I think that the big thing for

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.340 
slice so I think that the big thing for
you<00:06:15.340> to<00:06:15.430> do<00:06:15.580> Gary's<00:06:15.970> work<00:06:16.480> at<00:06:16.750> getting<00:06:17.020> the<00:06:17.110> arm

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:17.350 
you to do Gary's work at getting the arm

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:20.190 
you to do Gary's work at getting the arm
plane<00:06:17.710> lower<00:06:18.130> and<00:06:18.490> then<00:06:19.090> be<00:06:19.270> patient<00:06:19.540> make

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.200 
plane lower and then be patient make

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.140 
plane lower and then be patient make
sure<00:06:20.560> from<00:06:20.890> the<00:06:21.010> start<00:06:21.340> of<00:06:21.490> the<00:06:21.550> downswing

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
sure from the start of the downswing

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.560 
sure from the start of the downswing
you<00:06:22.720> feel<00:06:23.110> arms<00:06:24.100> stay<00:06:24.460> at<00:06:24.610> the<00:06:24.700> top<00:06:24.970> lower<00:06:25.270> body

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:38.950 
this one from the middle from there we

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.770 
this one from the middle from there we
just<00:06:39.130> lost<00:06:39.340> one<00:06:39.460> the<00:06:40.090> backswing<00:06:40.450> is<00:06:40.510> so

for<00:06:42.520> that<00:06:42.700> downswing<00:06:43.330> to<00:06:43.840> make<00:06:44.020> it<00:06:44.140> as<00:06:44.260> easy

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.380 
for that downswing to make it as easy

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.860 
for that downswing to make it as easy
impossible<00:06:44.950> okay<00:06:45.940> here<00:06:46.090> we<00:06:46.150> go<00:06:46.180> bit<00:06:46.720> more

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:46.870 
impossible okay here we go bit more

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:58.230 
impossible okay here we go bit more
rounded<00:06:47.260> on<00:06:47.350> this<00:06:47.470> one<00:06:55.620> for<00:06:56.620> sure<00:06:57.090> but<00:06:58.090> yeah

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 
rounded on this one for sure but yeah

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.790 
rounded on this one for sure but yeah
much<00:06:58.630> much<00:06:58.870> better<00:06:59.080> now<00:06:59.380> I<00:06:59.410> will<00:06:59.590> say<00:06:59.740> from

00:06:59.790 --> 00:06:59.800 
much much better now I will say from

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.620 
much much better now I will say from
there<00:07:00.040> a<00:07:00.070> lot<00:07:00.250> easier<00:07:00.550> to<00:07:00.640> be<00:07:00.760> more<00:07:00.910> rotary<00:07:01.570> in

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:01.630
