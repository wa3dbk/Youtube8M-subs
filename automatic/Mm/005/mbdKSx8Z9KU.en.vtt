00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
so let me see if I can get a good way to

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.450 
so let me see if I can get a good way to
say<00:01:55.880> it<00:01:56.439> okay<00:01:57.439> so<00:01:57.500> that's<00:01:57.860> how<00:01:58.040> much<00:01:58.159> the

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
say it okay so that's how much the

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.310 
say it okay so that's how much the
concave<00:01:59.450> it<00:01:59.690> is<00:02:00.640> it's<00:02:01.640> got<00:02:01.880> more<00:02:02.479> concave<00:02:03.080> than

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
concave it is it's got more concave than

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.700 
concave it is it's got more concave than
a<00:02:03.350> tech<00:02:03.619> deck<00:02:04.869> it's<00:02:05.869> got<00:02:06.020> more<00:02:06.170> concave<00:02:06.560> than<00:02:06.680> a

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
a tech deck it's got more concave than a

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.930 
a tech deck it's got more concave than a
septic<00:02:07.149> the<00:02:08.149> grip<00:02:09.080> tape<00:02:09.369> grips<00:02:10.369> your<00:02:10.520> fingers

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
septic the grip tape grips your fingers

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.729 
septic the grip tape grips your fingers
a<00:02:11.090> lot<00:02:11.420> better<00:02:11.690> but<00:02:11.900> also<00:02:12.080> gives<00:02:12.440> you<00:02:12.500> enough

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
a lot better but also gives you enough

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.059 
a lot better but also gives you enough
to<00:02:13.640> slide<00:02:13.970> for<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.480> finger<00:02:14.870> boards<00:02:15.200> for<00:02:15.560> that

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
to slide for the finger boards for that

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.890 
to slide for the finger boards for that
kick<00:02:16.250> flips<00:02:16.489> and<00:02:16.580> stuff<00:02:16.700> like<00:02:16.850> that<00:02:16.940> if<00:02:17.300> you

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
kick flips and stuff like that if you

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.620 
kick flips and stuff like that if you
used<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.380> think<00:02:18.560> up<00:02:18.830> tech<00:02:19.550> ducks<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.480> buy

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
used to think up tech ducks and you buy

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.780 
used to think up tech ducks and you buy
one<00:02:20.810> of<00:02:20.840> these<00:02:21.020> these<00:02:21.830> things<00:02:22.160> are<00:02:22.430> really

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
one of these these things are really

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:23.830 
one of these these things are really
different<00:02:23.090> they<00:02:23.360> feel<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:23.569> lot<00:02:23.810> different

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
different they feel a lot different

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.210 
different they feel a lot different
because<00:02:24.319> the<00:02:24.530> concave<00:02:24.980> is<00:02:25.190> more<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:26.180> kicks<00:02:26.600> on

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
because the concave is more the kicks on

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.979 
because the concave is more the kicks on
the<00:02:28.220> fingerboard<00:02:28.610> or<00:02:29.120> more<00:02:29.300> than<00:02:29.450> a<00:02:29.569> tech<00:02:29.750> deck

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
the fingerboard or more than a tech deck

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.370 
the fingerboard or more than a tech deck
and<00:02:30.890> you<00:02:31.040> don't<00:02:31.250> have<00:02:31.310> a<00:02:31.370> technical<00:02:31.700> affair<00:02:32.120> to

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
and you don't have a technical affair to

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.100 
and you don't have a technical affair to
but<00:02:33.380> I<00:02:33.410> mean<00:02:33.860> it's<00:02:34.250> really<00:02:35.090> well-built<00:02:35.810> it's

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
but I mean it's really well-built it's

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.949 
but I mean it's really well-built it's
lighter<00:02:36.590> than<00:02:36.709> a<00:02:36.950> tech<00:02:37.190> deck<00:02:37.780> it's<00:02:38.780> got

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
lighter than a tech deck it's got

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.050 
lighter than a tech deck it's got
greater<00:02:39.380> pop<00:02:39.769> it's<00:02:40.130> lighter<00:02:40.459> so<00:02:40.790> I<00:02:40.819> can<00:02:40.970> go

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
greater pop it's lighter so I can go

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.650 
greater pop it's lighter so I can go
higher<00:02:41.830> the<00:02:42.830> wheels<00:02:43.130> are<00:02:43.580> a<00:02:43.640> little<00:02:44.330> farther

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
higher the wheels are a little farther

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.170 
higher the wheels are a little farther
away<00:02:44.900> from<00:02:45.049> the<00:02:45.260> board<00:02:45.590> so<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:46.580> trucks<00:02:46.880> are<00:02:47.120> a

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
away from the board so the trucks are a

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.020 
away from the board so the trucks are a
little<00:02:47.540> higher<00:02:47.870> but<00:02:48.290> they<00:02:49.220> kind<00:02:49.489> of<00:02:49.549> look<00:02:49.700> just

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
little higher but they kind of look just

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.940 
little higher but they kind of look just
like<00:02:50.180> tech<00:02:50.480> deck<00:02:50.720> trucks<00:02:51.940> but<00:02:52.940> it's<00:02:53.360> a<00:02:53.950> it's

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
like tech deck trucks but it's a it's

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.940 
like tech deck trucks but it's a it's
just<00:02:55.100> a<00:02:55.400> really<00:02:56.200> really<00:02:57.200> really<00:02:57.650> good
