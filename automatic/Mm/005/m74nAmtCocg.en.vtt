enjoy<00:00:50.519> but<00:00:50.970> in<00:00:51.089> this<00:00:51.210> case<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.720> didn't<00:00:51.989> really

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
enjoy but in this case it didn't really

work<00:00:52.530> for<00:00:52.739> me<00:00:53.070> not<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.940> much<00:00:54.269> of<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.659> made<00:00:55.110> a

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
work for me not that much of it made a

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.579 
work for me not that much of it made a
lot<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.739> sense<00:00:56.070> which<00:00:56.870> is<00:00:57.870> also<00:00:58.199> another<00:00:58.440> thing

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
lot of sense which is also another thing

00:00:58.589 --> 00:00:59.990 
lot of sense which is also another thing
that's<00:00:58.890> not<00:00:59.040> necessarily<00:00:59.549> a<00:00:59.729> deal-breaker

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000
