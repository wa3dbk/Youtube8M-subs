stingray<00:00:05.069> USB<00:00:05.730> oscilloscope<00:00:06.089> and<00:00:06.509> today<00:00:07.080> I

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
stingray USB oscilloscope and today I

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.419 
stingray USB oscilloscope and today I
would<00:00:07.259> like<00:00:07.290> to<00:00:07.379> show<00:00:07.529> you<00:00:07.770> how<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.099> measure

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
would like to show you how to measure

this<00:00:16.020> will<00:00:16.230> be<00:00:16.410> on<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.740> one<00:00:16.949> example<00:00:17.310> what<00:00:17.789> you

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
this will be on the one example what you

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.040 
this will be on the one example what you
can<00:00:18.240> do<00:00:18.449> so<00:00:18.960> let's<00:00:19.320> start<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:19.680> in<00:00:20.720> what<00:00:21.720> we<00:00:21.869> got

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
can do so let's start it in what we got

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.200 
can do so let's start it in what we got

need<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.479> lock<00:01:51.990> your<00:01:52.200> probe<00:01:52.439> into<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.130> red

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
need to lock your probe into the red

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.980 
need to lock your probe into the red
cable<00:01:53.700> as<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:55.530> can<00:01:55.619> see<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:55.950> four<00:01:56.250> point<00:01:56.579> 92<00:01:57.390> 94

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
cable as you can see is four point 92 94

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.380 
cable as you can see is four point 92 94
and<00:01:59.240> to<00:02:00.240> measure<00:02:00.390> 3.3<00:02:01.350> voltage<00:02:01.939> volts<00:02:02.939> or<00:02:03.090> enid

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
and to measure 3.3 voltage volts or enid

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.180 
and to measure 3.3 voltage volts or enid
voltage<00:02:04.520> plugged<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:05.729> your<00:02:06.390> probe<00:02:06.689> into<00:02:06.990> the

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
voltage plugged in your probe into the

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.609 
voltage plugged in your probe into the
orange<00:02:08.190> cable<00:02:08.599> as<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.840> can<00:02:10.020> see<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.289> three

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
orange cable as you can see is three

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.350 
orange cable as you can see is three
point<00:02:11.420> 27

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
point 27

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.980 
point 27
3.3<00:02:14.700> so<00:02:15.700> as<00:02:15.790> you<00:02:15.910> can<00:02:16.030> see<00:02:16.210> is<00:02:16.330> very<00:02:16.540> simple

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
3.3 so as you can see is very simple

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.770 
3.3 so as you can see is very simple
very<00:02:17.140> very<00:02:17.890> easy<00:02:18.070> to<00:02:18.220> do<00:02:18.370> I<00:02:18.580> hope<00:02:19.270> that<00:02:19.480> video

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
very very easy to do I hope that video

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.660 
very very easy to do I hope that video
was<00:02:19.930> helpful<00:02:20.220> thank<00:02:21.220> you<00:02:21.310> very<00:02:21.520> much<00:02:21.640> for
