00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.760
 but I can tell you for sure that 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.830
 We take care when you use them 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.930
 if you take out you the right your 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.000
 then correct a dog says a dog 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.830
 but also in quotes that 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.550
 sign for the minimum water 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.580
 must jump is the goal of our 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.949
 work is but the absence of 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.360
 corrections and the greatest possible 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.920
 freedom for dog and human and ours 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.570
 work does not work because we 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.590
 any buttons on the dogs 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.250
 squeezed the work works 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.100
 long term and that's important yes 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.390
 long term only if you what something something 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.860
 We give you the hand when you say 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.230
 yes I can live that too 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.270
 I understood this that it is the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.489
 part of my normal life 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.460
 because the dogs are the trunk so 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.170
 we will say correct her 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.830
 I'll say there 's still time 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.500
 not i stop thinking forward no matter in 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.260
 which way 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.720
 why make it better go to the dog 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.610
 it is not healthy to freak out completely 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.490
 because you have another dog sid there 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.950
 quite a lot and so is the question 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.680
 for our work to eventually 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.210
 not anita or linda what am i doing 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.490
 if the dog latches when one 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.600
 looks kind but the question is 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.220
 how can we treat you with our dog 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.020
 do not work that first 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.020
 that's another's coming
