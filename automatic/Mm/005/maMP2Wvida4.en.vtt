00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:04.940 

this<00:00:02.399> is<00:00:02.879> my<00:00:03.540> other<00:00:04.110> experiment<00:00:04.890> in

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
this is my other experiment in

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.330 
this is my other experiment in
hydroponics<00:00:05.640> I<00:00:06.319> built<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.440> system<00:00:07.649> last<00:00:08.040> summer

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
hydroponics I built a system last summer

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.950 
hydroponics I built a system last summer
as<00:00:08.519> well

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.519 

it's<00:00:12.980> actually<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.009> pretty<00:00:14.160> simple<00:00:14.400> setup<00:00:15.529> of

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
it's actually a pretty simple setup of

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.349 
it's actually a pretty simple setup of
course<00:00:16.770> if<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:16.949> had<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.190> do<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.490> all<00:00:17.730> again<00:00:18.000> I

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
course if I had to do it all again I

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.000 
course if I had to do it all again I
would<00:00:18.690> probably<00:00:18.869> do<00:00:19.140> quite<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.439> few<00:00:19.590> things

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
would probably do quite a few things

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.010 
would probably do quite a few things
differently

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
differently

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.460 
differently
but<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:22.949> know<00:00:23.119> DIY<00:00:24.119> projects<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:25.050> know<00:00:25.140> sort

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
but you know DIY projects you know sort

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.240 
but you know DIY projects you know sort
of<00:00:25.560> trial<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:25.949> error<00:00:27.590> so<00:00:28.590> basically<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.189> is

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
of trial and error so basically this is

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.770 
of trial and error so basically this is
sort<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.300> combination<00:00:32.210> NFT<00:00:33.210> deep<00:00:33.510> water

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
sort of a combination NFT deep water

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.010 
sort of a combination NFT deep water
culture<00:00:34.219> technique<00:00:35.219> it's<00:00:35.430> actually<00:00:36.020> more

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
culture technique it's actually more

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.270 
culture technique it's actually more
accurately<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.559> deep<00:00:37.829> water<00:00:38.040> culture

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
accurately a deep water culture

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.760 
accurately a deep water culture
technique<00:00:38.910> all<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.690> roots<00:00:39.899> basically<00:00:40.110> sit

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
technique all the roots basically sit

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.490 
technique all the roots basically sit
down<00:00:40.950> in<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.190> water<00:00:41.629> the<00:00:42.629> water<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.989> pumped<00:00:43.230> up

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
down in the water the water is pumped up

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.740 
down in the water the water is pumped up
from<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.950> reservoir<00:00:44.340> here<00:00:46.940> I<00:00:47.940> also<00:00:48.300> have<00:00:48.480> an

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
from the reservoir here I also have an

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.080 
from the reservoir here I also have an
air<00:00:48.899> stone<00:00:49.200> inside<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.739> reservoir<00:00:50.090> keeping

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
air stone inside the reservoir keeping

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.549 
air stone inside the reservoir keeping
everything<00:00:51.329> oxygen<00:00:52.140> oxygenated<00:00:54.199> ideally<00:00:55.199> you

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
everything oxygen oxygenated ideally you

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.470 
everything oxygen oxygenated ideally you
would<00:00:55.680> want<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:55.980> wrap<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.789> no<00:00:56.969> algae<00:00:57.329> can

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
would want to wrap this so no algae can

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.170 
would want to wrap this so no algae can
grow<00:00:57.660> inside<00:00:58.079> there<00:00:58.579> last<00:00:59.579> summer<00:00:59.850> I<00:00:59.940> had<00:01:00.149> a

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
grow inside there last summer I had a

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.779 
grow inside there last summer I had a
blanket<00:01:00.539> around<00:01:00.809> at<00:01:00.960> all<00:01:01.050> summer<00:01:01.789> I'll

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
blanket around at all summer I'll

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.270 
blanket around at all summer I'll
probably<00:01:03.030> have<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.680> wrap<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:04.890> up<00:01:05.070> with<00:01:05.129> some

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
probably have to wrap this up with some

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.000 
probably have to wrap this up with some
black<00:01:05.640> tape<00:01:05.880> here<00:01:06.150> pretty<00:01:06.330> soon

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
black tape here pretty soon

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.100 
black tape here pretty soon
but<00:01:08.640> it's<00:01:08.850> been<00:01:09.060> running<00:01:09.360> for<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.600> good<00:01:09.930> two

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
but it's been running for a good two

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.350 
but it's been running for a good two
weeks<00:01:10.229> now<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.799> hasn't<00:01:10.950> grown<00:01:11.760> anything

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
weeks now and it hasn't grown anything

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.950 
weeks now and it hasn't grown anything
really<00:01:13.700> no<00:01:14.700> light<00:01:14.939> can<00:01:15.119> really<00:01:15.360> get<00:01:15.509> into<00:01:15.780> this

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
really no light can really get into this

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:23.270 
really no light can really get into this
large<00:01:16.229> tube<00:01:16.560> here<00:01:19.939> also<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.509> this<00:01:22.080> there<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.799> I

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
large tube here also in this there is I

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.999 
large tube here also in this there is I
have<00:01:24.180> one<00:01:24.600> air<00:01:24.840> stone<00:01:25.259> on<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.680> line<00:01:27.710> first<00:01:28.710> water

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
have one air stone on a line first water

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.219 
have one air stone on a line first water
if<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.759> can<00:01:29.970> see<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.630> water<00:01:30.840> just<00:01:31.049> gets

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
if you can see that the water just gets

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.190 
if you can see that the water just gets
pumped<00:01:31.560> into<00:01:31.680> little<00:01:32.040> hose<00:01:32.250> there<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.990> roots

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
pumped into little hose there the roots

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.899 
pumped into little hose there the roots
hang<00:01:34.439> down<00:01:34.619> directly<00:01:35.009> into<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.460> water<00:01:37.909> this

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
hang down directly into the water this

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.920 
hang down directly into the water this
is<00:01:39.119> basil<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:41.090> parsley<00:01:42.090> which<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.600> grew<00:01:42.780> from

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
is basil and parsley which I grew from

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.649 
is basil and parsley which I grew from
seed<00:01:43.460> I've<00:01:44.460> got<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> couple<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.060> strawberry

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
seed I've got a couple of strawberry

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.710 
seed I've got a couple of strawberry
plants<00:01:46.290> in<00:01:46.470> here<00:01:47.040> which<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.149> picked<00:01:48.390> up<00:01:48.509> at<00:01:48.689> the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
plants in here which I picked up at the

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.499 
plants in here which I picked up at the
nursery<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.490> they've<00:01:50.490> really<00:01:50.700> taken<00:01:51.119> off<00:01:51.210> so

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
nursery and they've really taken off so

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.980 
nursery and they've really taken off so
far<00:01:53.450> cilantro<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.479> grew<00:01:54.750> from<00:01:54.899> seed<00:01:56.270> sage<00:01:57.270> I

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
far cilantro I grew from seed sage I

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.160 
far cilantro I grew from seed sage I
grew<00:01:58.920> from<00:01:59.159> seed<00:01:59.750> these<00:02:00.750> are<00:02:00.869> going<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.020> be

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
grew from seed these are going to be

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.780 
grew from seed these are going to be
peppers<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.829> may<00:02:01.950> have<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.219> move<00:02:02.369> them<00:02:02.549> out<00:02:02.670> of

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
peppers I may have to move them out of

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.539 
peppers I may have to move them out of
this<00:02:02.909> system<00:02:03.180> soon<00:02:03.689> also<00:02:04.380> from<00:02:04.890> seed<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.219> the

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
this system soon also from seed and the

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.070 
this system soon also from seed and the
oregano<00:02:06.149> as<00:02:06.509> well<00:02:08.179> now<00:02:09.179> all<00:02:09.360> these<00:02:09.569> seem<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:09.899> be

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
oregano as well now all these seem to be

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.869 
oregano as well now all these seem to be
doing<00:02:10.319> really<00:02:10.349> well<00:02:10.679> in<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.039> same<00:02:11.220> nutrient

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
doing really well in the same nutrient

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.430 
doing really well in the same nutrient
regimen

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
regimen

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.559 
regimen
that'll<00:02:14.310> all<00:02:14.370> change<00:02:14.400> of<00:02:14.909> course<00:02:15.120> if<00:02:15.299> I<00:02:15.390> want

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
that'll all change of course if I want

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.000 
that'll all change of course if I want
to<00:02:15.659> try<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.840> get<00:02:15.989> some<00:02:16.170> strawberries<00:02:16.709> out<00:02:16.890> of

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
to try to get some strawberries out of

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.600 
to try to get some strawberries out of
these<00:02:18.440> I've<00:02:19.440> got<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.709> couple<00:02:19.920> more<00:02:20.129> strawberry

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
these I've got a couple more strawberry

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.949 
these I've got a couple more strawberry
plants<00:02:20.879> that<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.060> may<00:02:21.180> put<00:02:21.390> in<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.540> other<00:02:21.690> holes

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
plants that I may put in the other holes

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.130 
plants that I may put in the other holes
and<00:02:22.290> just<00:02:22.970> move<00:02:23.970> all<00:02:24.150> my<00:02:24.330> herbs<00:02:24.540> or<00:02:24.810> harvest

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
and just move all my herbs or harvest

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.070 
and just move all my herbs or harvest
all<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.290> herbs<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:26.190> I<00:02:26.220> can<00:02:26.760> bloom<00:02:27.750> some

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
all the herbs so I can bloom some

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.630 
all the herbs so I can bloom some
strawberries<00:02:28.769> and<00:02:28.950> get<00:02:29.040> some<00:02:29.220> fruit<00:02:29.459> out<00:02:29.579> of

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
strawberries and get some fruit out of

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.800 
strawberries and get some fruit out of
those<00:02:30.530> last<00:02:31.530> summer<00:02:31.829> I<00:02:32.129> grew<00:02:32.760> tomatoes<00:02:33.450> in

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
those last summer I grew tomatoes in

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.009 
those last summer I grew tomatoes in
this<00:02:34.709> setup<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.870> it<00:02:36.870> was<00:02:37.319> not<00:02:37.920> large<00:02:38.790> enough

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
this setup and it was not large enough

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.479 
this setup and it was not large enough
the<00:02:40.019> root<00:02:40.200> mass<00:02:40.440> completely<00:02:40.980> took<00:02:41.129> over<00:02:41.250> the

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
the root mass completely took over the

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.660 
the root mass completely took over the
pipe<00:02:42.620> so<00:02:43.620> if<00:02:43.769> you<00:02:43.860> wanted<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.129> build<00:02:44.250> this<00:02:44.430> sort

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
pipe so if you wanted to build this sort

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.309 
pipe so if you wanted to build this sort
of<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.819> setup<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.269> grow<00:02:45.420> tomatoes<00:02:45.599> I<00:02:46.170> would

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
of a setup to grow tomatoes I would

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.830 
of a setup to grow tomatoes I would
suggest<00:02:46.500> using<00:02:46.950> at<00:02:47.190> least<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.489> six<00:02:47.760> inch<00:02:48.030> or

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
suggest using at least a six inch or

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.199 
suggest using at least a six inch or
probably<00:02:49.590> an<00:02:49.769> eight<00:02:49.950> inch<00:02:50.160> pipe<00:02:50.489> would<00:02:51.000> be<00:02:51.180> a

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
probably an eight inch pipe would be a

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.150 
probably an eight inch pipe would be a
better<00:02:51.590> way<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.620> go<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:55.260> like<00:02:55.440> I<00:02:55.530> said<00:02:55.739> I<00:02:55.769> would

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
better way to go and like I said I would

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.479 
better way to go and like I said I would
do<00:02:56.280> things<00:02:56.519> quite<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.030> bit<00:02:57.239> differently<00:02:58.220> all<00:02:59.220> of

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
do things quite a bit differently all of

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.699 
do things quite a bit differently all of
this<00:02:59.609> is<00:02:59.790> pretty<00:02:59.940> ghetto<00:03:00.239> rigged<00:03:00.599> the<00:03:01.560> way

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
this is pretty ghetto rigged the way

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.149 
this is pretty ghetto rigged the way
that<00:03:01.920> is<00:03:02.099> hooked<00:03:02.250> up<00:03:02.489> there<00:03:04.010> and<00:03:05.010> of<00:03:05.099> course

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
that is hooked up there and of course

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.759 
that is hooked up there and of course
the<00:03:05.459> way<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:05.730> water<00:03:05.940> in<00:03:06.900> is<00:03:07.200> hooked<00:03:07.440> up<00:03:07.560> in

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
the way the water in is hooked up in

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.420 
the way the water in is hooked up in
there<00:03:07.920> with<00:03:08.069> just<00:03:08.099> duct<00:03:08.730> tape<00:03:08.940> would<00:03:09.150> be<00:03:09.420> awful

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
there with just duct tape would be awful

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.089 
there with just duct tape would be awful
one<00:03:11.430> thing<00:03:11.640> I<00:03:11.730> want<00:03:11.909> to<00:03:12.000> just<00:03:12.150> show<00:03:12.390> you<00:03:13.099> was

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
one thing I want to just show you was

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.110 
one thing I want to just show you was
the<00:03:15.409> there's<00:03:16.409> also<00:03:16.680> an<00:03:16.919> air<00:03:17.130> stone<00:03:17.430> inside<00:03:17.940> the

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
the there's also an air stone inside the

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.900 
the there's also an air stone inside the
chamber<00:03:18.680> to<00:03:19.680> make<00:03:19.859> sure<00:03:20.069> there's<00:03:20.280> more<00:03:20.609> air

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
chamber to make sure there's more air

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
chamber to make sure there's more air
bubbles<00:03:21.359> in<00:03:21.630> there<00:03:22.340> and<00:03:23.340> there<00:03:24.209> is<00:03:24.359> all<00:03:24.569> the

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
bubbles in there and there is all the

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.069 
bubbles in there and there is all the
hose<00:03:25.169> I<00:03:25.380> used<00:03:25.680> has<00:03:25.980> holes<00:03:26.340> in<00:03:26.489> it<00:03:26.579> as<00:03:26.760> well<00:03:27.079> so

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
hose I used has holes in it as well so

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.599 
hose I used has holes in it as well so
all<00:03:28.379> along<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.799> chamber<00:03:29.129> there's<00:03:29.310> a<00:03:29.370> few

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
all along the chamber there's a few

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:33.500 
all along the chamber there's a few
holes<00:03:29.989> to<00:03:30.989> really<00:03:31.950> keep<00:03:32.129> lots<00:03:32.730> of<00:03:32.910> oxygen<00:03:33.419> to

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
holes to really keep lots of oxygen to

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:41.629 
holes to really keep lots of oxygen to
the<00:03:33.629> roots<00:03:35.930> and<00:03:36.930> that<00:03:37.919> is<00:03:38.280> my<00:03:38.669> window
