00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:19.499
 it was out 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:22.499
 and changes 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.479
 famous 

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:32.660
 not 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.000
 official 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 not 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.130
 at bunin 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.950
 did not have 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.290
 in a statement 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.420
 population 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.420
 does not have 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.849
 as practice has shown 

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:19.339
 and as it turned out as if it were a song 

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:20.069
 sung 

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:22.399
 i really this song should be attributed 

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:23.809
 her very 

00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:26.719
 so much 

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:29.719
 great game began to meet the criteria 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.889
 where it is said that several times in my 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.400
 goosebumps run to the whole body and at the end 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.539
 were standing 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:41.539
 tears on eyes 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.080
 and of course I would like to joke 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.379
 but surely this is the wrong place hour 

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:54.989
 she sang very well songs it was generally 

00:04:54.989 --> 00:04:57.249
 not your best presentation in 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:58.830
 I saw this contest 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.059
 and shake rejuvenated 

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:03.579
 what you did now is very you 

00:05:03.579 --> 00:05:04.589
 fits 

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:07.589
 not signed 40 achievements there is strong 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.430
 standing right before my eyes sang opinions I don't know 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.449
 You said that why you looked at the car 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.449
 me all the time 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:20.539
 but I have to say that 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:22.009
 I agree 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:25.480
 at least with mom as for drinking is not necessary 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.820
 and she told me very little to say last 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.809
 never say 

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:31.959
 saw relatives on testing 

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:33.949
 identification group 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:36.999
 let's do it yes tears but so 

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:38.830
 apart pity, I understand that I, too 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.280
 we should be shown further 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.610
 really kept very 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:42.510
 it was good 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.320
 some little things they're not even here she 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.600
 just speak well oberhausen them 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.160
 there is a total percentage a little bit if there was 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.250
 would live music she explained a little bit 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.060
 intensity she's on your voice like 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.450
 finishing the song, yes, it was interesting 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:58.650
