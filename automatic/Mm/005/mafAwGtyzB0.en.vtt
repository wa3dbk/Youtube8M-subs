00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 ruud brood how is your team and your staff 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.089
 of yourself responded to that first 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.849
 victory against FC Eindhoven 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.969
 yes it would always be good to win 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.259
 I here is a competition but also it 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.360
 forward because before you know it 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.340
 the weather friday we were busy without it 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.140
 So the reasonable professional 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.910
 post-discussion done the day after and 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.750
 on to volendam 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.210
 but it is important 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.550
 of course for the process that you bag 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.619
 I immediately forwarded 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.580
 to Volendam about FC Eindhoven I said 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.170
 I really don't know how well they are here 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.820
 go out and play how they know 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.140
 you do that from Volendam 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.260
 well we we they from Eindhoven that we 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.460
 soccer team was and is and that there is 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.160
 was almost gone 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.660
 they also showed that yes 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.520
 The red card was of course important 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.920
 we had the dominance of volendam, we know 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.809
 so I myself have been 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.789
 and then a few physical boys 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.699
 in addition, there is a player who you walk 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.199
 can regularly score a goal 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.350
 so they have speed on the flanks 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.270
 your normal soccer team at home with 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.920
 choices of grass yes that is sometimes 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.629
 So surprising, but we're good 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.880
 prepared that also the difference between 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.340
 at home in the sacrifice and play 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.909
 what is that difference well what i just have 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.240
 say it's the field you start with 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:17.250
 but also do so now again another 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.990
 things around it look at preconditions 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.990
 which should keep sitting here with you rain 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.750
 the 75 100 will be great to do there 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.220
 it that number isn't with yes 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.420
 Enough from supporters but don't go along 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.250
 then you may not be guided 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.590
 we have to see our game they play and 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.659
 just try to be very professional with 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.040
 each other full for profit they go it 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.720
 about your game 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.850
 I wonder if you are a trainer 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.200
 who only plays the same game 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.720
 also want to adjust 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.159
 to an opponent 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.579
 I think you are in today's football 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.350
 it is about but it is also about 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.299
 impractical detail 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.640
 it goes natural that is would you say 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.810
 want to win it's about winning but the 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.390
 way 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.560
 but then you have to look so maybe you should 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.810
 you have a tactical detail 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.180
 and what players have on that 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.920
 available to you but you have to 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.899
 well steadiness is not quite me 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.270
 team start throwing each other in terms of 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.680
 field occupation 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.060
 which means you can actually get everyone back 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.400
 and can improve in that 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.350
 tasks but you may look at the 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.400
 opponent that that is just the fun 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.680
 of it 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.600
 talking about solidity in your team 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.640
 transfer period is of course still ongoing 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.780
 to what extent is that difficult in the process 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.160
 what you are doing with a go players 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.989
 new one coming this week 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.180
 players 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.670
 I don't know if the new players 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.030
 leave but yes we are constant 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.370
 busy anticipating the fact that 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.140
 there comes the means in this club 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.030
 and wants a certain type of player 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.530
 buy from us 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.319
 well then you have to be prepared for that 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.630
 we are also very active on the market 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.160
 that is also evident from the keepers' name 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.360
 who circulates on the internet would 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.920
 may be that tomorrow is just one 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.590
 another goalie enthusiastic striker among the 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.290
 the bar is against Volendam there is 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.220
 depending on the administration yes 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.829
 indeed 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.269
 is the keeper released or not and 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.290
 then if so then we can do one 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.660
 make a choice 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.340
 so there is that chance, yes, well 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.280
 for us was not yet because he is still 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.620
 not released but if that still 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.120
 this afternoon is yes then have a choice so 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.739
 the chance is yours 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.720
 finally you don't like predictions 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.540
 but nec tomorrow the favorite 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.370
 find you in volendam 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.140
 they are difficult to estimate because one 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.540
 number of things certainly play a role how 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.970
 my team deals with circumstances 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.040
 like that field not that the boys still 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.340
 never played a course but have 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.989
 also to do with a different entourage 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.989
 if you look at it we are always secs 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.769
 I find this every opponent's favorite 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.769
 nice thank you there
