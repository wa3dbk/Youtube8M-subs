from a burgundy to a reddish brown I
don't<00:01:31.600> know<00:01:31.780> what<00:01:32.710> in<00:01:32.890> the<00:01:33.010> world<00:01:33.400> happened

with<00:01:34.150> that<00:01:34.180> but<00:01:34.750> it<00:01:35.140> wasn't<00:01:35.830> an<00:01:35.920> ugly<00:01:36.250> color<00:01:36.430> I

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
with that but it wasn't an ugly color I

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.750 
with that but it wasn't an ugly color I
actually<00:01:36.960> liked<00:01:37.960> it<00:01:38.200> way<00:01:39.040> better<00:01:39.280> than<00:01:39.640> the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
actually liked it way better than the

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.370 
actually liked it way better than the
burgundy<00:01:40.240> actually<00:01:40.659> I<00:01:40.690> just<00:01:40.930> don't<00:01:41.110> know<00:01:41.200> why

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
burgundy actually I just don't know why

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.590 
burgundy actually I just don't know why
it<00:01:41.440> turned<00:01:42.280> that<00:01:42.549> way<00:01:42.729> after<00:01:42.850> washing<00:01:43.390> it<00:01:43.450> so

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.200 
it turned that way after washing it so
much<00:01:43.780> but<00:01:44.020> whatever<00:01:44.920> i<00:01:45.280> guess<00:01:45.340> that's<00:01:46.119> just

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
much but whatever i guess that's just

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.710 
much but whatever i guess that's just
what<00:01:46.479> happens<00:01:46.840> um<00:01:47.760> but<00:01:48.760> as<00:01:48.880> you<00:01:49.060> can<00:01:49.180> see<00:01:49.479> is

what happens um but as you can see is

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.590

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.240 
after wearing it for like a week or two

a<00:06:19.339> little<00:06:19.520> bit<00:06:19.669> different<00:06:20.120> but<00:06:20.289> chop<00:06:21.289> it<00:06:21.469> up

00:06:21.519 --> 00:06:21.529

and<00:06:21.620> make<00:06:21.770> a<00:06:21.800> little<00:06:22.039> bit<00:06:22.159> shorter<00:06:22.610> because<00:06:23.150> I

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
and make a little bit shorter because I

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.839 
and make a little bit shorter because I
