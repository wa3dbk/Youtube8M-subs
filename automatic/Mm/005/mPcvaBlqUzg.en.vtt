so<00:01:33.469> we're<00:01:33.829> going<00:01:33.889> to<00:01:34.039> do<00:01:34.159> that

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.590 

generally<00:01:47.550> you<00:01:47.640> want<00:01:47.760> a<00:01:47.880> scissors<00:01:48.330> on<00:01:48.480> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
generally you want a scissors on the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.530 
generally you want a scissors on the
trail<00:01:48.900> but<00:01:49.200> since<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.620> have<00:01:49.650> them<00:01:52.040> and<00:01:53.540> there's

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
trail but since I have them and there's

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:06.020 
trail but since I have them and there's
a<00:01:56.000> 16<00:01:57.000> ounces<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.510> water<00:02:03.050> so<00:02:04.550> throw<00:02:05.550> that<00:02:05.730> up<00:02:05.910> a

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
a 16 ounces of water so throw that up a

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.890 
a 16 ounces of water so throw that up a
little<00:02:06.180> bit<00:02:06.800> make<00:02:07.800> sure<00:02:07.830> it<00:02:08.220> dissolves<00:02:11.900> okay

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
little bit make sure it dissolves okay

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.300 
little bit make sure it dissolves okay
so<00:02:12.960> we're<00:02:13.440> going<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.650> go<00:02:13.710> ahead<00:02:13.740> and<00:02:13.920> light<00:02:14.130> the

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
so we're going to go ahead and light the

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.730 
so we're going to go ahead and light the
stove<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:15.800> I<00:02:17.450> found<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.780> right<00:02:19.110> up<00:02:19.350> to<00:02:19.590> the

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
stove and I found that right up to the

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.310 
stove and I found that right up to the
bottom<00:02:20.220> of<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:21.830> that<00:02:22.830> hole<00:02:23.130> is<00:02:23.160> about<00:02:24.320> an

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
bottom of that that hole is about an

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.550 
bottom of that that hole is about an
ounce<00:02:25.590> of<00:02:25.830> fuel<00:02:26.070> I<00:02:26.400> think<00:02:28.070> so<00:02:30.080> it<00:02:31.080> really<00:02:31.350> won't

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
ounce of fuel I think so it really won't

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.090 
ounce of fuel I think so it really won't
take<00:02:31.830> that<00:02:31.860> much<00:02:32.070> to<00:02:32.460> boil<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.820> water<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:34.100> don't

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
take that much to boil the water I don't

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:46.010 
take that much to boil the water I don't
think<00:02:35.930> so<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:37.500> mean<00:02:38.310> what<00:02:38.520> my<00:02:38.670> hands<00:02:39.060> off

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.080 

okay<00:02:46.890> that's<00:02:47.250> I'm<00:02:47.490> going<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.670> turn<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.880> light

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
okay that's I'm going to turn the light

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.320 
okay that's I'm going to turn the light
out<00:02:48.120> so<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:48.540> can<00:02:48.660> see<00:02:48.930> that<00:02:48.960> that<00:02:49.200> is<00:02:50.150> that<00:02:51.150> is

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
out so you can see that that is that is

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.250 
out so you can see that that is that is
indeed<00:02:52.910> there's<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:54.030> flame<00:02:54.420> there<00:02:54.750> I<00:02:54.780> think<00:02:54.990> you

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
indeed there's a flame there I think you

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:07.460 
indeed there's a flame there I think you
can<00:02:55.410> see<00:02:55.650> that<00:02:57.980> and<00:03:03.320> pre<00:03:04.320> heat<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.530> pot<00:03:06.290> just<00:03:07.290> a

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
can see that and pre heat the pot just a

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:16.410 
can see that and pre heat the pot just a
little<00:03:07.710> bit

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.870 

and<00:03:16.540> it<00:03:17.170> usually<00:03:17.380> won't<00:03:17.770> blossom<00:03:18.430> out<00:03:18.610> right

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
and it usually won't blossom out right

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:27.220 
and it usually won't blossom out right
away<00:03:23.730> but

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.100 

ok<00:03:27.950> we're<00:03:28.220> going<00:03:28.340> to<00:03:28.459> let<00:03:28.640> that<00:03:28.720> let<00:03:29.720> me<00:03:29.810> start

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110

ok we're going to let that let me start
to<00:03:30.170> stop<00:03:30.530> watch<00:03:30.830> to<00:03:30.860> see<00:03:31.370> how<00:03:31.610> long<00:03:31.640> this<00:03:33.310> takes

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
to stop watch to see how long this takes

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.360 
to stop watch to see how long this takes
ok<00:03:35.599> you<00:03:35.659> can<00:03:36.110> I'm<00:03:36.379> gonna<00:03:36.590> move<00:03:36.709> the<00:03:36.860> camera<00:03:37.099> so

shouldn't be doing that but done it
before<00:03:55.640> windscreen<00:03:56.450> is<00:03:57.099> pretty<00:03:58.099> essential<00:03:58.489> as

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
you can see and that will hold a lot of

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:13.839 
you can see and that will hold a lot of
the<00:04:07.040> heat<00:04:07.310> in<00:04:11.530> ok<00:04:12.530> so<00:04:12.890> when<00:04:13.069> that<00:04:13.190> boils<00:04:13.640> i'm

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849

that boils turn it back on ok you can

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.050 
that boils turn it back on ok you can
see<00:04:22.880> we're<00:04:23.770> pretty<00:04:24.770> close<00:04:24.979> to<00:04:25.039> seven<00:04:25.639> minutes

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060
