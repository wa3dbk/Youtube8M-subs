ruffle at the waistline and this is a

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.909 
ruffle at the waistline and this is a
flattering<00:03:39.180> detail<00:03:39.690> that<00:03:39.930> can<00:03:39.959> really<00:03:40.290> but

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
flattering detail that can really but

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.289 
flattering detail that can really but
