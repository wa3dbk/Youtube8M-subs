00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.229 
and 3 megabits down and one or less up
right<00:02:06.979> now<00:02:07.100> I'm<00:02:07.220> getting<00:02:07.369> higher<00:02:07.670> up<00:02:07.939> than<00:02:08.119> I

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
right now I'm getting higher up than I

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.930 
right now I'm getting higher up than I
am<00:02:08.269> down<00:02:08.979> so<00:02:09.979> this<00:02:10.130> is<00:02:10.280> it<00:02:10.459> this<00:02:10.670> is<00:02:10.729> not

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
am down so this is it this is not

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.870 
am down so this is it this is not
typical<00:02:11.420> of<00:02:11.450> what<00:02:11.630> I've<00:02:11.720> been<00:02:11.810> seeing<00:02:12.099> but<00:02:13.099> you

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
typical of what I've been seeing but you

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.550 
typical of what I've been seeing but you
know<00:02:14.000> these<00:02:14.120> are<00:02:14.180> 3g<00:02:14.540> speeds<00:02:14.989> there's<00:02:15.290> no<00:02:15.440> way

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
know these are 3g speeds there's no way

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.470 
know these are 3g speeds there's no way
on<00:02:15.709> this<00:02:15.860> device<00:02:16.160> to<00:02:16.430> differentiate<00:02:17.390> between

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
on this device to differentiate between

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.690 
on this device to differentiate between
an<00:02:17.870> hspa+<00:02:18.739> connection<00:02:19.220> or<00:02:19.370> just<00:02:19.549> a<00:02:19.610> regular

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
an hspa+ connection or just a regular

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.120 
an hspa+ connection or just a regular
HSPA<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:20.840> so<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.200> difference<00:02:21.350> of<00:02:21.530> that<00:02:21.680> is<00:02:21.799> 3g

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
HSPA and so the difference of that is 3g

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.990 
HSPA and so the difference of that is 3g
versus<00:02:22.430> force<00:02:22.670> 4g<00:02:23.440> so<00:02:24.440> none<00:02:25.340> of<00:02:25.370> us<00:02:25.580> really

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
versus force 4g so none of us really

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.570 
versus force 4g so none of us really
know<00:02:26.150> unless<00:02:26.330> we're<00:02:26.690> getting<00:02:26.930> you<00:02:27.110> know

down<00:02:33.799> there's<00:02:34.430> no<00:02:34.700> way<00:02:34.880> to<00:02:34.940> really<00:02:35.330> know<00:02:35.510> that

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
down there's no way to really know that

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:41.470 
down there's no way to really know that
you're<00:02:36.650> connected<00:02:36.980> to<00:02:37.010> hspa+

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.630 

they<00:02:42.019> said<00:02:42.260> typically<00:02:42.709> I<00:02:42.980> should<00:02:43.310> be<00:02:43.430> getting

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
they said typically I should be getting

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.509 
they said typically I should be getting
around<00:02:43.879> five<00:02:44.180> down<00:02:44.480> on<00:02:44.750> plus<00:02:45.080> and<00:02:45.470> it's<00:02:46.310> more

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
around five down on plus and it's more

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.580 
around five down on plus and it's more
like<00:02:46.700> three<00:02:47.000> or<00:02:47.090> four<00:02:47.150> possibly<00:02:48.140> up<00:02:48.260> to<00:02:48.290> five

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
like three or four possibly up to five

on<00:02:48.920> regular<00:02:49.879> 3g<00:02:50.409> so<00:02:51.409> everything<00:02:51.920> I'm<00:02:52.069> seeing

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
on regular 3g so everything I'm seeing

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.970 
on regular 3g so everything I'm seeing
tells<00:02:52.610> me<00:02:52.730> that<00:02:52.849> I'm<00:02:52.909> on<00:02:53.030> 3g<00:02:53.569> I<00:02:53.780> know<00:02:54.620> that<00:02:56.980> okay

tells me that I'm on 3g I know that okay

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.680 
tells me that I'm on 3g I know that okay
you<00:02:58.220> guys<00:02:58.340> hear<00:02:58.640> these<00:02:58.819> guys<00:02:59.000> singing<00:02:59.299> from<00:02:59.569> a

limo hummer limo that I want to go ok so

if<00:03:06.590> I<00:03:06.680> go<00:03:06.709> to<00:03:06.890> about<00:03:07.519> phone<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:09.940> go<00:03:10.940> to<00:03:11.000> stat<00:03:11.420> it

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
if I go to about phone and go to stat it

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.360 
if I go to about phone and go to stat it
you<00:03:12.019> can<00:03:12.140> see<00:03:12.290> that<00:03:12.319> i'm<00:03:12.530> connected<00:03:12.890> to<00:03:12.980> UMTS

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
you can see that i'm connected to UMTS

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.009 
you can see that i'm connected to UMTS
it<00:03:13.640> does<00:03:13.760> hace<00:03:14.060> edge<00:03:14.269> which<00:03:14.569> is<00:03:14.720> what<00:03:14.840> it<00:03:14.930> would

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
it does hace edge which is what it would

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:20.229 
it does hace edge which is what it would
say<00:03:15.170> if<00:03:15.230> i<00:03:15.319> was<00:03:15.500> you<00:03:16.280> know<00:03:16.310> 2g<00:03:18.910> so<00:03:19.910> all<00:03:20.090> i<00:03:20.120> know

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
say if i was you know 2g so all i know

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.349 
say if i was you know 2g so all i know
is<00:03:20.329> that<00:03:20.450> i<00:03:20.569> have<00:03:20.720> 3g<00:03:21.140> plus<00:03:21.890> it<00:03:22.040> says<00:03:22.190> HSPA<00:03:22.700> or

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
is that i have 3g plus it says HSPA or

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:24.759 
is that i have 3g plus it says HSPA or
it<00:03:23.480> says<00:03:23.629> h<00:03:23.840> up<00:03:24.019> at<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.200> top<00:03:24.349> there<00:03:24.410> which

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
it says h up at the top there which

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.819 
it says h up at the top there which
would<00:03:24.950> just<00:03:26.049> that<00:03:27.049> indicates<00:03:27.470> that<00:03:27.560> i'm<00:03:27.709> on

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
would just that indicates that i'm on

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.119 
would just that indicates that i'm on
the<00:03:27.950> HSPA<00:03:28.879> network<00:03:28.970> not<00:03:29.510> necessarily<00:03:29.989> plus<00:03:30.230> so

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 
the HSPA network not necessarily plus so

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.069 
the HSPA network not necessarily plus so
there<00:03:31.280> you<00:03:31.310> have<00:03:31.400> it<00:03:31.599> not<00:03:32.599> sure<00:03:32.750> where<00:03:32.900> to<00:03:32.930> take

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
there you have it not sure where to take

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.280 
there you have it not sure where to take
it<00:03:33.140> from<00:03:33.379> here<00:03:33.620> but<00:03:34.519> I've<00:03:35.120> run<00:03:35.780> this<00:03:35.959> test

seeing the results speed test has shown
to<00:03:46.790> be<00:03:46.910> a<00:03:46.940> little<00:03:47.150> bit<00:03:47.410> buggy<00:03:48.410> but<00:03:49.190> I<00:03:49.220> certainly

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
to be a little bit buggy but I certainly

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:55.030 
to be a little bit buggy but I certainly
can't<00:03:50.150> blame<00:03:52.780> consistently<00:03:53.780> bad<00:03:54.019> speeds<00:03:54.620> on

this<00:03:55.549> program<00:03:55.819> love<00:03:56.239> tried<00:03:56.780> other<00:03:56.930> programs

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
this program love tried other programs

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.220 
this program love tried other programs
of<00:03:57.739> tried<00:03:57.919> websites<00:03:58.690> and<00:03:59.690> the<00:03:59.810> fact<00:04:00.049> of<00:04:00.169> the

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
of tried websites and the fact of the

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.289 
of tried websites and the fact of the
matter<00:04:00.319> is<00:04:00.530> that<00:04:00.700> just<00:04:01.700> not<00:04:01.910> getting<00:04:02.120> very

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
matter is that just not getting very

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:09.470 
matter is that just not getting very
good<00:04:02.540> download<00:04:02.870> speeds

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.840 

that's<00:04:10.480> right
