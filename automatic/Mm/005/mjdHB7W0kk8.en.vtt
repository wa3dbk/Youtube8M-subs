I've<00:00:01.860> been<00:00:02.159> looking<00:00:02.460> for<00:00:02.700> ways<00:00:02.850> to<00:00:02.929> remove

00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:04.279 
I've been looking for ways to remove

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.490 
I've been looking for ways to remove
undercoating<00:00:05.279> from<00:00:05.490> my<00:00:05.609> 66<00:00:06.240> sub<00:00:06.779> Monte<00:00:07.170> Carlo

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
undercoating from my 66 sub Monte Carlo

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.060 
undercoating from my 66 sub Monte Carlo
850<00:00:08.840> recently<00:00:09.840> did<00:00:10.050> a<00:00:10.080> video<00:00:10.290> where<00:00:10.679> I<00:00:10.710> showed

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
850 recently did a video where I showed

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.549 
850 recently did a video where I showed
a<00:00:11.099> needle<00:00:11.759> scale<00:00:12.030> or<00:00:12.240> in<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.480> stringer<00:00:13.380> bead

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
a needle scale or in a stringer bead

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.430 
a needle scale or in a stringer bead
wheel<00:00:13.799> which<00:00:14.009> worked<00:00:14.340> pretty<00:00:14.610> good<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:15.440> said

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
wheel which worked pretty good I said

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.580 
wheel which worked pretty good I said
there<00:00:16.980> that<00:00:17.160> it<00:00:17.310> didn't<00:00:17.850> like<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.320> air<00:00:19.320> hammer

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
there that it didn't like the air hammer

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.290 
there that it didn't like the air hammer
and<00:00:19.830> chisel<00:00:20.160> because<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:20.850> messed<00:00:21.060> up<00:00:21.240> the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
and chisel because it messed up the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.220 
and chisel because it messed up the
metal<00:00:21.660> pretty<00:00:21.900> good<00:00:23.180> but<00:00:24.180> turns<00:00:24.810> out<00:00:25.050> it's

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
metal pretty good but turns out it's

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.200 
metal pretty good but turns out it's
mostly<00:00:25.590> my<00:00:25.830> own<00:00:26.010> cluelessness<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:27.029> lack<00:00:27.180> of

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
mostly my own cluelessness and lack of

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.150 
mostly my own cluelessness and lack of
experience<00:00:28.609> that<00:00:29.609> was<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.939> problem

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
experience that was the problem

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.040 
experience that was the problem
I've<00:00:32.160> always<00:00:32.430> operated<00:00:33.030> these<00:00:33.180> at<00:00:33.420> like<00:00:33.630> 90

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
I've always operated these at like 90

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.520 
I've always operated these at like 90
plus<00:00:34.320> psi<00:00:35.480> but<00:00:36.480> on<00:00:36.630> sheet<00:00:36.930> metal<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:37.320> gives

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
plus psi but on sheet metal that gives

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.040 
plus psi but on sheet metal that gives
you<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.620> real<00:00:37.890> handful<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:39.030> bumps<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.660> chisel

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
you a real handful of bumps and chisel

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.010 
you a real handful of bumps and chisel
will<00:00:40.230> work<00:00:40.379> with<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:41.329> found<00:00:42.329> out<00:00:42.510> when<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.690> turned

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
will work with I found out when I turned

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.049 
will work with I found out when I turned
it<00:00:43.140> down<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.290> 40<00:00:43.800> psi<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.460> works<00:00:44.670> pretty<00:00:44.910> darn

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
it down to 40 psi it works pretty darn

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.680 
it down to 40 psi it works pretty darn
good<00:00:46.129> one<00:00:47.129> other<00:00:47.340> little<00:00:47.760> modification<00:00:48.570> I

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
good one other little modification I

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.549 
good one other little modification I
made<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.079> sharp<00:00:49.620> corners<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.370> chisel

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
made the sharp corners of the chisel

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.069 
made the sharp corners of the chisel
were<00:00:52.910> gouging<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.030> metal<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.570> just<00:00:54.750> hit<00:00:54.930> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
were gouging the metal so I just hit the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.959 
were gouging the metal so I just hit the
corners<00:00:55.469> with<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.800> grinder<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.309> polished<00:00:56.789> it

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
corners with the grinder and polished it

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.939 
corners with the grinder and polished it
just<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.270> little<00:00:57.480> bit<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.930> sharp<00:00:58.500> corners

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
just a little bit so the sharp corners

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.130 
just a little bit so the sharp corners
are<00:00:59.100> going<00:00:59.340> on<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.609> doesn't<00:00:59.789> couch<00:01:00.780> then

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
are going on it doesn't couch then

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.800 
are going on it doesn't couch then
that'll<00:01:04.460> we'll<00:01:05.460> try<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:05.820> again<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.360> see<00:01:06.600> if<00:01:06.689> I

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
that'll we'll try it again and see if I

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.469 
that'll we'll try it again and see if I
get<00:01:07.020> better<00:01:07.680> results<00:01:08.369> or<00:01:08.670> similar<00:01:09.030> results

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
get better results or similar results

00:01:09.479 --> 00:02:04.240 
get better results or similar results
this<00:01:09.659> time

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.730 

okay<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.280> think<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.700> can<00:02:05.850> see<00:02:06.090> from<00:02:06.300> that<00:02:06.740> that

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
okay I think you can see from that that

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.380 
okay I think you can see from that that
this<00:02:08.250> worked<00:02:08.490> pretty<00:02:08.729> good<00:02:08.850> you'll<00:02:09.240> see

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
this worked pretty good you'll see

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.410 
this worked pretty good you'll see
little<00:02:09.630> streaks<00:02:09.960> here<00:02:10.229> in<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:11.430> middle<00:02:11.760> or<00:02:12.210> in

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
little streaks here in the middle or in

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.920 
little streaks here in the middle or in
the<00:02:12.510> paint

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
the paint

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.170 
the paint
that's<00:02:13.190> just<00:02:14.190> marking<00:02:14.550> in<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.730> paint<00:02:14.970> there's

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
that's just marking in the paint there's

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.330 
that's just marking in the paint there's
no<00:02:15.480> gouging<00:02:15.930> in<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.140> middle<00:02:16.410> whatsoever

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
no gouging in the middle whatsoever

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.460 
no gouging in the middle whatsoever
I'm<00:02:17.910> really<00:02:18.150> happy<00:02:18.510> with<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:19.110> saw<00:02:19.320> how

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
I'm really happy with that you saw how

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.440 
I'm really happy with that you saw how
easy<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.890> came<00:02:20.100> off<00:02:20.340> every<00:02:20.880> other<00:02:20.970> method<00:02:21.360> I've

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
easy it came off every other method I've

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.440 
easy it came off every other method I've
tried<00:02:21.720> has<00:02:22.459> been<00:02:23.459> hard<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.790> get<00:02:23.910> this<00:02:24.030> off<00:02:24.270> the

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
tried has been hard to get this off the

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.720 
tried has been hard to get this off the
stuff<00:02:24.720> sticks<00:02:24.990> pretty<00:02:25.230> good<00:02:25.560> but<00:02:26.190> this

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
stuff sticks pretty good but this

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.610 
stuff sticks pretty good but this
separates<00:02:27.180> from<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.390> paint<00:02:27.690> very<00:02:27.870> nicely

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
separates from the paint very nicely

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.370 
separates from the paint very nicely

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
what's it Eric shizzle the only problem

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.920 
what's it Eric shizzle the only problem
is<00:02:31.530> on<00:02:31.860> a<00:02:31.920> ridge<00:02:32.190> like<00:02:32.459> this<00:02:32.760> you<00:02:33.600> can't<00:02:33.840> really

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
is on a ridge like this you can't really

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.350 
is on a ridge like this you can't really
keep<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.470> chozo<00:02:34.739> on<00:02:35.070> there<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.640> once<00:02:35.820> it

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
keep the chozo on there and once it

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.479 
keep the chozo on there and once it
rotates<00:02:36.840> in<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.110> tool<00:02:37.320> and<00:02:37.350> it<00:02:37.590> just<00:02:37.980> crumbs

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
rotates in the tool and it just crumbs

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.010 
rotates in the tool and it just crumbs
off<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.730> side<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.270> you<00:02:39.360> can't<00:02:39.540> get<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.780> sides

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
off the side and you can't get the sides

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.160 
off the side and you can't get the sides
either<00:02:40.290> I'll<00:02:40.530> use<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:42.209> needle<00:02:42.720> scale<00:02:42.989> or

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
either I'll use the the needle scale or

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.040 
either I'll use the the needle scale or
the<00:02:43.500> bead<00:02:44.070> stringer<00:02:44.430> wheel<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:45.360> clean<00:02:45.840> those
