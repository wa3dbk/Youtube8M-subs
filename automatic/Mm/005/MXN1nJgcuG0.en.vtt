00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
kind of hard right now because you know

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:38.949 
kind of hard right now because you know
it's<00:03:36.379> really<00:03:36.980> small<00:03:37.340> but<00:03:37.609> you<00:03:38.030> can<00:03:38.269> and<00:03:38.540> that

here slide all the way up but I did that
earlier<00:04:23.990> there<00:04:24.380> we<00:04:24.440> go<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:24.770> just<00:04:25.310> view<00:04:25.669> the

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
earlier there we go and just view the

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:27.250 
earlier there we go and just view the
foreground<00:04:26.840> app

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
foreground app

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.130 
foreground app
just<00:04:27.410> like<00:04:27.590> that<00:04:27.830> so<00:04:28.460> folks<00:04:28.820> that<00:04:29.420> is<00:04:29.720> reach

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
just like that so folks that is reach

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.440 
just like that so folks that is reach
app<00:04:30.380> it<00:04:30.620> is<00:04:30.770> an<00:04:30.920> upcoming<00:04:31.160> jailbreak<00:04:31.940> tweak<00:04:32.240> it

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
app it is an upcoming jailbreak tweak it

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.800 
app it is an upcoming jailbreak tweak it
is<00:04:33.440> extremely<00:04:34.220> promising<00:04:34.880> and<00:04:35.270> it<00:04:35.630> brings

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
very long time and probably something

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.380 
very long time and probably something
that<00:04:42.590> we<00:04:42.680> all<00:04:42.760> envisioned<00:04:43.760> when<00:04:43.880> we<00:04:44.000> first<00:04:44.240> saw

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
that we all envisioned when we first saw

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.960 
that we all envisioned when we first saw
reach<00:04:44.630> ability<00:04:45.050> and<00:04:45.350> saw<00:04:45.650> the<00:04:45.710> potential<00:04:46.160> from

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
reach ability and saw the potential from

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.270 
reach ability and saw the potential from
a<00:04:47.060> jailbreak<00:04:47.480> perspective<00:04:48.170> folks<00:04:48.410> reach<00:04:49.040> app

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
a jailbreak perspective folks reach app

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.940 
a jailbreak perspective folks reach app
it<00:04:49.520> is<00:04:49.550> work<00:04:49.970> in<00:04:50.120> progress<00:04:50.360> but<00:04:50.660> it<00:04:51.080> is<00:04:51.260> super

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
it is work in progress but it is super
