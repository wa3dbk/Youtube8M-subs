00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 in spring the main thing is to fool an onion fly for 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.450
 it needs an early landing 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.730
 so that the bow is strengthened it becomes rougher for 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.280
 planting onions need earth loose and 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.560
 fertile after planting tight 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.520
 press down the tighter the faster 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.310
 onions sprout onions onion loves topping 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.730
 ash and frequent loosening especially after 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.119
 rain and watering plant onions more often and 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.329
 or there pull thin fresh 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.600
 the greens is a good bed to mulch and 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:41.370
 a layer of humus predecessor for onions 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:44.879
 maybe cucumber or oats is a good grade 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.570
 it's half the battle and less important how is it 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.070
 take care and for you tips and tricks 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:55.199
 our Kuzbass gardeners 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.710
 in the spring on this oat he already lies after 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.820
 of snow 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:04.280
 pour the sifted compost well 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.630
 bucket per square meter then plant 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.890
 onion sets 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:15.240
 small soot flush with the ground 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.950
 the bottle capron hole but this is me from 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.049
 under the soda water and a half liters 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.420
 two-liter bottom cutting at an angle 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.930
 filling with the same sieved compost and 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.259
 I make beds on top, well, I roll in rollers 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.450
 such about a centimeter two tall but 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.869
 they crumble and it also turns out 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.729
 and almost no secret stand for the summer they 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.670
 decompose slowly with water too 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.500
 are blurred and there are 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.770
 By the fall, Rita had already seen the month 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.280
 grandson bare no longer need him better 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.340
 poured his land does not hold and more 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:55.500
 onion warms up in the sun 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:58.290
 okay onion plants before May 5th else 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.170
 loot someone like the soil 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:05.159
 but I'm not soil quickly 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.290
 It turns out the bed should be stapled 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.050
 well fertilized 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.700
 all prepared seedbed parsing if I 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.250
 show now because 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.320
 just to show how I plant 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.990
 so do not pay attention to what 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.900
 the end of the bed is not prepared here you 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.690
 the bed draw a line where you 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.730
 you will plant a bow that's just a little 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.950
 you have outlined and do not plant onions 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.320
 leave it to believe here just to put 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.650
 why because I eat for planting onions 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.260
 so that the bulb was tall for onions 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.030
 the bulb was nadi my roots in the ground we 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.250
 this can not achieve that 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.220
 to achieve that's what i am doing 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.700
 here again put a bow at that distance 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.040
 how he should be here and now 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:59.130
 I close it 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:01.320
 the whole earth both from this side and from 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:05.070
 that side you can plant radishes 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.870
 I did it this year, close it with 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.860
 left side just a little bit 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.670
 wake up and then go on care 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.720
 we 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:20.070
 Iâ€™m doing this homework 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:24.060
 singe feed fed looser and eat 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:26.340
 just a little bit here radish 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.580
 gradually closes the ground so 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:33.180
 watering too radish onions allowed 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:37.830
 roots in the hole for water but this hill 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:41.880
 in the process of growth quietly slips off 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:44.810
 you understand him, and the bow becomes bare 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:49.860
 here's the first phase 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:51.480
 then the sun get on the onion here 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:56.459
 falls on the bulb 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:58.590
 and the bulb begins to grow 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.590
 in size and thus also itself 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.920
 you gradually radish everything 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:08.010
 will remove it will not interfere with the bow anymore 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:14.489
 the sun and the greater the harvest here 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:17.010
 please bow last year I don't remember 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:20.630
 what was garlic was probably my equal 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:23.120
 winter was removed and I sowed it phacelia 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.250
 the land means then dug over yet 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.440
 a little hamster for the winter fertilized and 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.150
 Here landed this year here onions but I 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.380
 a little bit not figured out what he would be 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.230
 so massive 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.520
 such feathers and so much moisture was what I 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.090
 it seems I have a little landing 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:41.030
 thickened but phytosporin processed 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:43.370
 because of prevention for prevention here 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.110
 so that was not mealy 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:54.680
 and make onions grow healthy here 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:59.720
 golden mc but this year I 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.980
 Onions planted May 1 in the feast of sadi bow 1 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.670
 August I removed my hand 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.530
 I took only 90 days with a bow 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.560
 one and a half kilograms because somehow we 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:12.170
 my wife and I decided to better buy onions if 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.020
 not enough for us but the harvest was 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:18.110
 canceled and I looked at both friends and 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:22.130
 familiar with relatives onions everyone has a good 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:24.770
 all without exception, this is a miracle bow 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:27.440
 just a miracle gorgeous this time 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.870
 it rained and then there was a good heat 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.180
 I have never watered it this year 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.810
 used to water a bow this year 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.090
 I have never 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.940
 for his you bow is not beautiful in her 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.790
 most importantly or not completely clean 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:44.600
 I have it on August 1, I've already fallen all 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:52.510
 I think all 90 days I choose and collected 14 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:52.510
 there are 14 drawers of such boxes
