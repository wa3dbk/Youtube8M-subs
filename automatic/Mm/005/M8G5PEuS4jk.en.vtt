heard that you can actually go through a

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.970 
heard that you can actually go through a
whole<00:00:59.070> entire<00:00:59.489> elk<00:00:59.789> on<00:01:00.149> this<00:01:00.629> blade<00:01:00.930> one<00:01:01.829> of

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
whole entire elk on this blade one of

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.229 
whole entire elk on this blade one of
these<00:01:02.100> blades<00:01:02.460> will<00:01:02.550> go<00:01:02.760> through<00:01:02.910> an<00:01:03.000> entire

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
these blades will go through an entire

these blades will go through an entire
elk<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.870> then<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.949> just<00:01:05.070> change<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.460> out<00:01:05.720> so

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
elk and then you just change it out so

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.760 
elk and then you just change it out so
you<00:01:06.810> don't<00:01:06.930> have<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.260> deal<00:01:07.409> with<00:01:07.650> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
you don't have to deal with the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.219 
you don't have to deal with the
sharpening<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.580> getting<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.270> super

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
sharpening and getting this super

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.070 
sharpening and getting this super
razor-sharp<00:01:10.740> edge<00:01:11.159> taking<00:01:11.729> hours<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.930> to

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
razor-sharp edge taking hours just to

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.780 
razor-sharp edge taking hours just to
perfect<00:01:13.439> your<00:01:13.590> edge<00:01:13.770> instead<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.430> can<00:01:14.610> just

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
perfect your edge instead you can just

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.560 
perfect your edge instead you can just
throw<00:01:15.380> on<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.409> new<00:01:16.650> blade<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.420> you're<00:01:18.420> good<00:01:18.540> to

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
throw on a new blade and you're good to

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.499 
throw on a new blade and you're good to
go<00:01:19.159> so<00:01:20.159> it's<00:01:20.520> actually<00:01:20.909> fairly<00:01:21.090> easy<00:01:21.390> process

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
go so it's actually fairly easy process

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.960 
go so it's actually fairly easy process
to<00:01:22.200> do<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:24.650> change<00:01:25.650> out<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:26.189> was<00:01:26.700> going<00:01:26.880> to

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
to do the the change out I was going to

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.060 
to do the the change out I was going to
just<00:01:27.119> show<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.509> here<00:01:28.610> so<00:01:30.770> this<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:31.860> how<00:01:31.950> it

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
just show that here so this is how it

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.330 
just show that here so this is how it
works<00:01:32.360> basically<00:01:33.890> you're<00:01:34.890> going<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.130> push

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
works basically you're going to push

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.330 
works basically you're going to push
with<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:35.729> finger<00:01:36.090> here<00:01:36.799> forward<00:01:37.799> you're

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
with this finger here forward you're

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.990 
with this finger here forward you're
going<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.579> pull<00:01:38.820> with<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.299> one<00:01:39.509> here<00:01:41.000> and

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
going to pull with this one here and

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.260 
going to pull with this one here and
that<00:01:42.869> slides<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.320> out<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.549> clips<00:01:44.790> into<00:01:45.060> this

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
that slides it out so it clips into this

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.670 
that slides it out so it clips into this
little<00:01:45.530> station<00:01:46.530> here<00:01:47.149> along<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.560> if<00:01:49.560> you

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
little station here along that if you

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.330 
little station here along that if you
can<00:01:49.770> see<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.189> very<00:01:50.520> well<00:01:50.700> but<00:01:52.040> that's<00:01:53.040> how<00:01:53.220> it

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
can see that very well but that's how it

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:01.580 
can see that very well but that's how it
works<00:01:54.860> here's<00:01:55.860> your<00:01:55.950> blade<00:01:57.290> and<00:01:58.820> then<00:02:00.590> this

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
works here's your blade and then this

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.819 
works here's your blade and then this
little<00:02:02.719> case<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:03.990> comes<00:02:04.170> with<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.409> which<00:02:04.710> is

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
little case that comes with it which is

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.950 
little case that comes with it which is
really<00:02:04.860> nice<00:02:05.210> it<00:02:06.210> actually<00:02:06.420> has<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.780> little

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
really nice it actually has a little

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.479 
really nice it actually has a little
loop<00:02:08.270> you<00:02:09.270> can<00:02:09.330> stick<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.780> on<00:02:09.869> your<00:02:09.899> belt<00:02:10.489> and

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
loop you can stick it on your belt and

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.710 
loop you can stick it on your belt and
you<00:02:11.520> can<00:02:11.700> stick<00:02:11.910> your<00:02:11.940> knife<00:02:12.150> in<00:02:12.390> there<00:02:12.510> and

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
you can stick your knife in there and

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.280 
you can stick your knife in there and
then<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:12.900> has

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
then it has

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.679 
then it has
little<00:02:13.469> spot<00:02:13.769> on<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:13.980> back<00:02:14.159> that<00:02:14.579> you<00:02:15.390> can<00:02:15.540> go

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689 
little spot on the back that you can go

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.509 
little spot on the back that you can go
and<00:02:15.900> stick<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.379> know<00:02:16.530> all<00:02:16.739> your<00:02:16.890> extra<00:02:17.250> blades
