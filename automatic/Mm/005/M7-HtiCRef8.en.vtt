00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
about I was contemplating doing it but

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.600

the<00:05:23.479> 84th<00:05:23.990> minute<00:05:24.110> very<00:05:24.500> late<00:05:24.770> in<00:05:24.889> the<00:05:24.979> match

the 84th minute very late in the match

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:26.950 
the 84th minute very late in the match
and<00:05:25.340> it<00:05:25.460> actually<00:05:25.610> took<00:05:26.029> a<00:05:26.090> deflection<00:05:26.360> so<00:05:26.870> he

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
and it actually took a deflection so he

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.990 
and it actually took a deflection so he
got<00:05:27.110> a<00:05:27.139> little<00:05:27.319> bit<00:05:27.560> lucky<00:05:27.919> the<00:05:28.400> keeper<00:05:28.789> went

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
got a little bit lucky the keeper went

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.939 
got a little bit lucky the keeper went
one<00:05:29.210> way<00:05:29.240> the<00:05:29.599> ball<00:05:29.750> deflects<00:05:29.960> to<00:05:30.379> his<00:05:30.589> left

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:30.949 
one way the ball deflects to his left

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:33.610 
one way the ball deflects to his left
which<00:05:31.129> was<00:05:31.190> right<00:05:31.550> I<00:05:31.580> guess<00:05:31.879> and<00:05:32.150> it<00:05:33.050> goes<00:05:33.229> into
