I'm confident that the new beetle will
become<00:01:56.140> a<00:01:56.170> great<00:01:56.259> success<00:01:57.060> we<00:01:58.060> gave<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.479> car

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
become a great success we gave the car

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.710 
become a great success we gave the car
everything<00:01:59.140> it<00:01:59.259> needs<00:01:59.500> to<00:01:59.799> be<00:01:59.920> successful
