00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
but I mean obviously my hope is that

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.809 
but I mean obviously my hope is that
everything<00:03:08.580> calms<00:03:08.819> down<00:03:08.970> and<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:10.280> that<00:03:11.280> they

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
everything calms down and and that they

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
come to some kind of solution

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.000 
come to some kind of solution
certainly<00:03:14.989> opinion<00:03:15.989> polls<00:03:16.260> even<00:03:16.859> very

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
certainly opinion polls even very

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.670 
certainly opinion polls even very
recently<00:03:17.549> don't<00:03:18.450> show<00:03:18.810> up<00:03:19.049> majority<00:03:19.530> people

segment of the population and who have
some<00:03:30.840> resources<00:03:31.290> whether<00:03:31.739> they<00:03:31.920> come<00:03:32.100> from

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
some resources whether they come from

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.580 
some resources whether they come from
Yanukovych's<00:03:34.739> party<00:03:35.569> hangers<00:03:36.569> on<00:03:36.750> with<00:03:37.290> them

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.460 
or holy guards or whatever other sources
they're<00:03:41.819> certainly<00:03:42.269> keeping<00:03:43.139> all<00:03:43.290> that

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
they're certainly keeping all that

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.449 
they're certainly keeping all that
action<00:03:43.680> alive<00:03:44.160> there<00:03:45.200> so<00:03:46.200> we<00:03:46.769> will<00:03:46.980> just<00:03:47.190> hope

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459

Education said in that interview that I

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:51.499 
Education said in that interview that I
heard<00:04:49.620> about<00:04:49.680> a<00:04:49.830> month<00:04:50.069> ago<00:04:50.190> that<00:04:50.550> in<00:04:51.389> the

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 
heard about a month ago that in the

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:53.570 
heard about a month ago that in the
Universities<00:04:52.169> they<00:04:52.349> only<00:04:52.590> offer<00:04:52.919> courses<00:04:53.250> in

power for the last however many years so

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.409 
power for the last however many years so
it's<00:05:19.139> not<00:05:19.289> you<00:05:20.039> can't<00:05:20.310> tie<00:05:20.610> that<00:05:20.909> necessarily

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
it's not you can't tie that necessarily

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:24.050 
it's not you can't tie that necessarily
to<00:05:21.719> the<00:05:22.080> group<00:05:22.259> that's<00:05:22.500> now<00:05:22.680> in<00:05:22.919> power<00:05:23.190> in<00:05:23.550> in

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
to the group that's now in power in in

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.939 
to the group that's now in power in in
Kiev<00:05:24.509> and<00:05:24.690> who<00:05:24.810> are<00:05:24.930> in<00:05:25.020> any<00:05:25.139> case<00:05:25.349> an<00:05:25.500> interim

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:25.949 
Kiev and who are in any case an interim

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:28.369 
Kiev and who are in any case an interim
government<00:05:26.039> so<00:05:26.699> I<00:05:26.729> really<00:05:27.210> think<00:05:27.449> that<00:05:27.659> always

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:28.379 
government so I really think that always

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:30.200 
government so I really think that always
talk<00:05:28.560> about<00:05:28.590> referendum<00:05:29.400> is<00:05:29.520> extremely

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
talk about referendum is extremely

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.519 
talk about referendum is extremely
premature<00:05:30.539> I<00:05:30.810> think<00:05:31.110> there<00:05:31.229> should<00:05:31.259> be<00:05:31.409> a

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:31.529 
premature I think there should be a

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:34.249 
premature I think there should be a
president<00:05:32.009> so<00:05:32.419> recollection<00:05:33.419> and<00:05:33.509> then<00:05:34.080> a

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:34.259 
president so recollection and then a

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:36.170 
president so recollection and then a
parliamentary<00:05:35.009> election<00:05:35.159> and<00:05:35.639> then<00:05:36.029> they

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
parliamentary election and then they

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.170 
parliamentary election and then they
deal<00:05:36.330> with<00:05:36.449> their<00:05:36.719> issues<00:05:37.729> you<00:05:38.729> know<00:05:38.819> that<00:05:38.849> but

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
deal with their issues you know that but

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.450 
deal with their issues you know that but
that's<00:05:39.360> me<00:05:39.960> sitting<00:05:40.469> on<00:05:40.560> the<00:05:40.650> sidelines<00:05:41.130> I

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
that's me sitting on the sidelines I

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.399 
that's me sitting on the sidelines I
have<00:05:42.090> no<00:05:42.210> influence<00:05:42.479> in<00:05:42.750> what<00:05:42.840> goes<00:05:43.020> on<00:05:43.139> there
