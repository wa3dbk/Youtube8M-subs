how<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.740> ran<00:00:20.100> this<00:00:20.340> benchmark<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:21.029> like<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.420> fill

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
how I ran this benchmark I like to fill

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.939 
how I ran this benchmark I like to fill
this<00:00:21.720> bench<00:00:21.960> marking<00:00:22.199> around<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.439> torch<00:00:22.769> run

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
this bench marking around the torch run

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:23.929 
this bench marking around the torch run
if<00:00:23.070> you<00:00:23.160> can<00:00:23.279> see<00:00:23.430> right<00:00:23.609> there<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.789> was

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
if you can see right there I was

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.540 
if you can see right there I was
standing<00:00:24.119> beside<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> torch<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:26.099> idea<00:00:26.460> of

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
standing beside a torch and the idea of

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.759 
standing beside a torch and the idea of
this<00:00:26.910> run<00:00:27.210> was<00:00:27.570> all<00:00:27.900> my<00:00:28.019> benchmarks<00:00:28.500> are<00:00:28.619> about

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
this run was all my benchmarks are about

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.400 
this run was all my benchmarks are about
2<00:00:28.949> minutes<00:00:29.250> long<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:29.760> had<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.240> get<00:00:30.420> somewhere

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
2 minutes long so I had to get somewhere

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.740 
2 minutes long so I had to get somewhere
free<00:00:31.920> running<00:00:32.279> within<00:00:32.579> two<00:00:32.940> minutes<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.719> I

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
free running within two minutes so I

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.020 
free running within two minutes so I
went<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.469> an<00:00:34.890> opposing<00:00:35.340> Beach<00:00:35.579> on<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.820> other

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
went to an opposing Beach on the other

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.319 
went to an opposing Beach on the other
side<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.300> Nassau<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.370> I<00:00:38.370> made<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.730> about<00:00:38.910> 2

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
side of Nassau and I made it about 2

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.569 
side of Nassau and I made it about 2
minutes<00:00:39.600> long<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:40.140> end<00:00:40.350> by<00:00:40.530> another<00:00:41.219> torch

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
minutes long and I end by another torch

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.360 
minutes long and I end by another torch
which<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.570> don't<00:00:43.440> know<00:00:43.500> kind<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:43.950> random<00:00:44.340> but

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
which is I don't know kind of random but

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.100 
which is I don't know kind of random but
I<00:00:44.520> just<00:00:44.700> thought<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:44.940> was<00:00:45.059> cool<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.420> ended<00:00:46.020> up

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
I just thought it was cool I ended up

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.860 
I just thought it was cool I ended up
going<00:00:46.260> with<00:00:46.469> free<00:00:46.680> running<00:00:47.450> not<00:00:48.450> just<00:00:48.660> because

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
going with free running not just because

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.510 
going with free running not just because
it<00:00:49.020> was<00:00:49.140> easy<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.530> tried<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> few<00:00:50.190> different

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
it was easy I tried a few different

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.250 
it was easy I tried a few different
things<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.059> one<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.539> ones<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.780> really<00:00:52.050> want

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
things and one of the ones I really want

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.920 
things and one of the ones I really want
to<00:00:52.350> do<00:00:52.440> was<00:00:52.680> ship<00:00:52.949> battles<00:00:53.370> because<00:00:54.360> that's<00:00:54.809> a

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
to do was ship battles because that's a

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.529 
to do was ship battles because that's a
big<00:00:55.800> part<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.280> Black<00:00:56.550> Flag<00:00:56.760> that's<00:00:57.239> why<00:00:57.390> it's

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
big part of Black Flag that's why it's

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.340 
big part of Black Flag that's why it's
called<00:00:57.719> Black<00:00:58.350> Flag<00:00:58.620> as<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.039> have<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> ship

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
called Black Flag as you have a ship

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.410 
called Black Flag as you have a ship
called<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.500> jackdaw<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.820> want<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.210> fight

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
called the jackdaw and I want to fight

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.660 
called the jackdaw and I want to fight
in<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.780> jackdaw<00:01:04.199> but<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.530> found<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.189> with<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
in the jackdaw but I found that with the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.130 
in the jackdaw but I found that with the
wave<00:01:05.880> mechanics<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.630> everything<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:07.049> are

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
wave mechanics and everything that are

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.390 
wave mechanics and everything that are
in<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.320> game<00:01:07.530> which<00:01:07.740> are<00:01:07.950> really<00:01:08.549> fun<00:01:08.700> um

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
in this game which are really fun um

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.740 
in this game which are really fun um
they're<00:01:11.400> not<00:01:11.430> exactly<00:01:11.939> very<00:01:12.060> good<00:01:12.510> for

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
they're not exactly very good for

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.230 
they're not exactly very good for
benchmarking<00:01:13.080> because<00:01:13.740> they're<00:01:13.979> not<00:01:14.240> exactly

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
benchmarking because they're not exactly

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.090 
benchmarking because they're not exactly
the<00:01:15.450> same<00:01:15.689> every<00:01:15.960> time<00:01:15.990> which<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.560> good<00:01:16.890> for

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
the same every time which is good for

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.940 
the same every time which is good for
gameplay<00:01:17.420> don't<00:01:18.420> get<00:01:18.630> me<00:01:18.750> wrong<00:01:18.900> but<00:01:19.290> not<00:01:19.650> good

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
gameplay don't get me wrong but not good

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.830 
gameplay don't get me wrong but not good
for<00:01:19.979> benchmarking<00:01:20.369> which<00:01:20.850> almost<00:01:21.450> no<00:01:21.689> one's

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
for benchmarking which almost no one's

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.050 
for benchmarking which almost no one's
going<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.080> do<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.409> that's<00:01:22.590> completely<00:01:23.009> fine<00:01:23.340> so

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
going to do so that's completely fine so

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.580 
going to do so that's completely fine so
I<00:01:24.090> had<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.420> go<00:01:24.540> something<00:01:24.780> more<00:01:25.049> consistent

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
I had to go something more consistent

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.440 
I had to go something more consistent
though<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.009> ended<00:01:26.159> up<00:01:26.250> falling<00:01:26.430> back<00:01:26.759> on<00:01:27.030> an

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
though and I ended up falling back on an

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.719 
though and I ended up falling back on an
assassin's<00:01:27.960> creed<00:01:28.200> staple<00:01:28.710> which<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.490> free

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
assassin's creed staple which is free

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.760 
assassin's creed staple which is free
running<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.630> tried<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.020> make<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.530> little

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
running so I tried to make it a little

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.080 
running so I tried to make it a little
bit<00:01:31.979> interesting<00:01:32.460> by<00:01:32.610> going<00:01:32.820> through<00:01:32.939> the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
bit interesting by going through the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.270 
bit interesting by going through the
trees<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.540> stuff<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.079> then<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.439> do<00:01:34.710> kill<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
trees and stuff and then I do kill the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.429 
trees and stuff and then I do kill the
dude<00:01:35.490> at<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.729> top<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.240> watchtower<00:01:36.750> but

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
dude at the top of this watchtower but

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.319 
dude at the top of this watchtower but
that's<00:01:37.619> honestly<00:01:38.520> more<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.790> necessity<00:01:39.060> than

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
that's honestly more of a necessity than

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.880 
that's honestly more of a necessity than
anything<00:01:39.840> because<00:01:40.110> if<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.290> don't<00:01:40.470> kill<00:01:40.710> him

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
anything because if you don't kill him

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.219 
anything because if you don't kill him
when<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.130> get<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.430> top<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.820> tower<00:01:42.229> he

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
when you get to the top of the tower he

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.170 
when you get to the top of the tower he
will<00:01:43.409> shoot<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.799> later<00:01:44.250> on<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.729> benchmark

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
will shoot you later on in the benchmark

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.719 
will shoot you later on in the benchmark
and<00:01:45.799> that<00:01:46.799> kind<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.220> screws<00:01:47.490> up<00:01:47.640> your

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
and that kind of screws up your

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.069 
and that kind of screws up your
freerunning<00:01:48.240> because<00:01:48.450> your<00:01:48.570> dad<00:01:48.720> will<00:01:48.869> fall

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
freerunning because your dad will fall

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.969 
freerunning because your dad will fall
so<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.829> stabbed<00:01:50.130> him<00:01:50.360> hello<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.689> climb<00:01:52.649> up<00:01:52.829> the

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
so I stabbed him hello so climb up the

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.460 
so I stabbed him hello so climb up the
very<00:01:53.159> top<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.610> tower<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.090> then<00:01:55.049> we<00:01:55.320> do<00:01:55.439> a

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
very top of the tower and then we do a

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.219 
very top of the tower and then we do a
leap<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.799> faith<00:01:55.860> here<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:59.299> what<00:02:00.299> good<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.840> any

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
leap of faith here and what good is any

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.440 
leap of faith here and what good is any
Assassin's<00:02:01.829> Creed<00:02:02.040> video<00:02:02.340> with<00:02:02.820> only<00:02:03.060> one

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
Assassin's Creed video with only one

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.050 
Assassin's Creed video with only one
leap<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.840> faith<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:04.619> we<00:02:05.040> climb<00:02:05.399> this<00:02:05.549> one<00:02:05.759> get

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
leap of faith so we climb this one get

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.520 
leap of faith so we climb this one get
stuck<00:02:06.299> here<00:02:06.450> for<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.630> quick<00:02:06.810> second<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.290> then

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
stuck here for a quick second and then

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.220 
stuck here for a quick second and then
another<00:02:09.069> leap<00:02:09.340> of<00:02:09.490> faith<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:10.810> one<00:02:11.080> a<00:02:11.110> little

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
another leap of faith this one a little

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.490 
another leap of faith this one a little
bit<00:02:11.380> more<00:02:11.470> black<00:02:11.890> flag<00:02:12.130> oriented<00:02:12.990> and<00:02:13.990> then<00:02:14.350> as

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
bit more black flag oriented and then as

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.670 
bit more black flag oriented and then as
you<00:02:14.650> can<00:02:14.800> see<00:02:15.040> there<00:02:15.940> is<00:02:16.090> one<00:02:16.420> more<00:02:16.750> torch<00:02:17.170> we

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
you can see there is one more torch we

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.530 
you can see there is one more torch we
stopped<00:02:17.980> by<00:02:18.160> that<00:02:18.190> we<00:02:18.850> have<00:02:18.940> completed<00:02:19.360> the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
stopped by that we have completed the

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.720 
stopped by that we have completed the
torch<00:02:19.750> run<00:02:19.959> the<00:02:20.830> cards<00:02:21.100> performed<00:02:21.490> pretty

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
torch run the cards performed pretty

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.190 
torch run the cards performed pretty
much<00:02:21.850> as<00:02:22.000> expected<00:02:22.360> in<00:02:22.600> this<00:02:22.750> game

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
much as expected in this game

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.040 
much as expected in this game
I<00:02:23.230> noticed<00:02:23.800> things<00:02:24.010> like<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.370> NVIDIA<00:02:25.000> GTX<00:02:25.239> 770

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
I noticed things like the NVIDIA GTX 770

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.910 
I noticed things like the NVIDIA GTX 770
was<00:02:26.680> above<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.459> Radeon<00:02:28.030> r9<00:02:28.270> 280x<00:02:29.080> and<00:02:29.530> that

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
was above the Radeon r9 280x and that

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.620 
was above the Radeon r9 280x and that
was<00:02:30.069> not<00:02:30.250> surprising<00:02:30.430> because<00:02:31.060> this<00:02:31.390> is<00:02:31.510> an

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
was not surprising because this is an

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.000 
was not surprising because this is an
Nvidia<00:02:31.959> title<00:02:32.319> and<00:02:32.440> I've<00:02:32.530> noticed<00:02:32.709> those

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
Nvidia title and I've noticed those

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.710 
Nvidia title and I've noticed those
cards<00:02:33.340> trade<00:02:33.670> depending<00:02:34.180> on<00:02:34.300> which<00:02:34.480> games

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
cards trade depending on which games

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.410 
cards trade depending on which games
title<00:02:35.020> it<00:02:35.230> was<00:02:35.440> and<00:02:35.770> with<00:02:36.489> no<00:02:36.730> new<00:02:36.970> drivers

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
title it was and with no new drivers

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.930 
title it was and with no new drivers
from<00:02:37.660> AMD<00:02:38.140> that<00:02:38.380> was<00:02:38.830> to<00:02:39.580> be<00:02:39.700> expected

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
from AMD that was to be expected

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.430 
from AMD that was to be expected
although<00:02:40.420> it<00:02:40.600> might<00:02:40.720> change<00:02:40.930> in<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.170> future

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
although it might change in the future

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.110 
although it might change in the future
not<00:02:41.590> entirely<00:02:41.980> sure<00:02:42.160> another<00:02:42.850> thing<00:02:43.030> you

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
not entirely sure another thing you

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.949 
not entirely sure another thing you
might<00:02:43.239> notice<00:02:43.390> is<00:02:43.690> that

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
might notice is that

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.020 
might notice is that
godrays<00:02:44.560> were<00:02:44.800> disabled<00:02:45.340> I<00:02:45.459> found<00:02:45.790> that

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
godrays were disabled I found that

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.420 
godrays were disabled I found that
enabling<00:02:46.810> godrays<00:02:47.260> even<00:02:47.680> on<00:02:47.800> high<00:02:48.010> didn't

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
enabling godrays even on high didn't

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.330 
enabling godrays even on high didn't
lower<00:02:48.550> the<00:02:48.760> FPS<00:02:49.360> a<00:02:49.570> ton<00:02:49.840> overall<00:02:50.440> but<00:02:51.010> it<00:02:51.100> did

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
lower the FPS a ton overall but it did

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.070 
lower the FPS a ton overall but it did
create<00:02:51.700> inconsistencies<00:02:52.450> in<00:02:52.600> between<00:02:52.959> my

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
create inconsistencies in between my

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.570 
create inconsistencies in between my
benchmarks<00:02:53.590> so<00:02:53.680> each<00:02:53.860> run<00:02:54.160> there<00:02:54.400> would<00:02:54.550> be

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
benchmarks so each run there would be

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.300 
benchmarks so each run there would be
too<00:02:55.180> much<00:02:55.360> of<00:02:55.630> a<00:02:55.750> differential<00:02:56.470> in<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.920> final

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
too much of a differential in the final

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.070 
too much of a differential in the final
number<00:02:57.550> that<00:02:57.700> was<00:02:57.850> output<00:02:58.180> so<00:02:58.600> I<00:02:58.630> decided<00:02:58.930> to

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
number that was output so I decided to

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.900 
number that was output so I decided to
leave<00:02:59.230> it<00:02:59.260> out<00:02:59.500> because<00:02:59.739> it<00:03:00.190> just<00:03:00.220> wasn't<00:03:00.880> a

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
leave it out because it just wasn't a

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.080 
leave it out because it just wasn't a
very<00:03:00.940> good<00:03:01.360> result<00:03:01.810> at<00:03:02.019> the<00:03:02.050> very<00:03:02.319> end<00:03:03.090> this

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
very good result at the very end this

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.790 
very good result at the very end this
game<00:03:04.540> when<00:03:04.780> I<00:03:04.810> first<00:03:05.080> booted<00:03:05.350> up<00:03:05.440> I<00:03:05.560> didn't

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
game when I first booted up I didn't

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.199 
game when I first booted up I didn't
think<00:03:05.830> it<00:03:06.069> was<00:03:06.160> going<00:03:06.340> to<00:03:06.400> be<00:03:06.489> that<00:03:06.640> hard<00:03:06.910> to

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
think it was going to be that hard to

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.699 
think it was going to be that hard to
run<00:03:07.360> because<00:03:07.660> it<00:03:07.780> was<00:03:07.870> Assassin's<00:03:08.319> Creed<00:03:08.530> game

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
run because it was Assassin's Creed game

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:09.870 
run because it was Assassin's Creed game
I<00:03:08.830> was<00:03:08.920> like<00:03:09.010> I<00:03:09.040> never<00:03:09.250> had<00:03:09.400> problems<00:03:09.790> with

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
I was like I never had problems with

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.759 
I was like I never had problems with
these<00:03:10.030> before<00:03:10.420> but<00:03:10.630> cranking<00:03:11.440> all<00:03:11.620> the

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
these before but cranking all the

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.380 
these before but cranking all the
settings<00:03:12.100> it<00:03:12.250> was<00:03:12.459> really<00:03:12.790> hard<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.030> run<00:03:13.209> and

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
settings it was really hard to run and

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.850 
settings it was really hard to run and
it's<00:03:13.540> not<00:03:13.690> surprising<00:03:13.840> because<00:03:14.290> once<00:03:14.620> you<00:03:14.739> get

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
it's not surprising because once you get

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.830 
it's not surprising because once you get
in<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.040> game<00:03:15.220> it's<00:03:15.519> absolutely<00:03:16.239> beautiful

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
in the game it's absolutely beautiful

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.840 
in the game it's absolutely beautiful
the<00:03:17.230> water<00:03:17.470> is<00:03:17.709> amazing<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.459> general

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
the water is amazing the general

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.009 
the water is amazing the general
graphics<00:03:19.209> around<00:03:19.329> everywhere<00:03:19.750> are<00:03:19.870> just

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
graphics around everywhere are just

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.020 
graphics around everywhere are just
absolutely<00:03:20.470> fantastic<00:03:20.650> if<00:03:21.640> you<00:03:21.730> liked<00:03:21.910> this
