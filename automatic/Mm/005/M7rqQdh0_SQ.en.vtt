chrysalis doll focusing on that a long

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.140 
chrysalis doll focusing on that a long
time<00:03:18.450> I'm<00:03:18.989> sure<00:03:19.200> it's<00:03:19.910> some<00:03:20.910> kind<00:03:21.120> of

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
time I'm sure it's some kind of

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:33.120 
time I'm sure it's some kind of
reference<00:03:22.580> lots<00:03:23.580> of<00:03:23.730> options<00:03:24.090> there

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.820 

oh<00:03:37.470> wow

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
oh wow

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:58.350 
oh wow
that's<00:03:39.660> okay<00:03:42.480> those<00:03:43.480> eyes

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:06.240 

and<00:03:59.360> there's<00:03:59.750> gummy<00:04:00.140> being<00:04:00.709> all<00:04:01.510> weird<00:04:02.510> okay

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:16.659 

well<00:04:07.250> it<00:04:10.659> just<00:04:13.000> jump<00:04:14.000> in<00:04:14.230> the<00:04:15.230> actual<00:04:15.669> Futurama

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
well it just jump in the actual Futurama

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:31.689 
well it just jump in the actual Futurama
characters<00:04:23.199> okay<00:04:28.930> well<00:04:29.930> I<00:04:30.560> think<00:04:31.039> I<00:04:31.430> was<00:04:31.520> even

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699 
characters okay well I think I was even

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:33.430 
characters okay well I think I was even
less<00:04:31.910> prepared<00:04:32.300> for<00:04:32.510> the<00:04:32.570> Futurama<00:04:32.900> one<00:04:33.289> than

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
less prepared for the Futurama one than

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.980 
less prepared for the Futurama one than
I<00:04:33.500> thought<00:04:33.680> I'd<00:04:33.830> be<00:04:34.000> so<00:04:35.000> many<00:04:35.240> references<00:04:35.479> that

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
I thought I'd be so many references that

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.930 
I thought I'd be so many references that
went<00:04:36.169> straight<00:04:36.440> over<00:04:36.470> my<00:04:36.650> head<00:04:36.949> but<00:04:37.220> as<00:04:37.550> I<00:04:37.729> said

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
went straight over my head but as I said

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.430 
went straight over my head but as I said
I've<00:04:38.180> only<00:04:38.419> really<00:04:38.630> seen<00:04:38.930> a<00:04:38.960> handful<00:04:39.320> of

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
I've only really seen a handful of

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.290 
I've only really seen a handful of
episodes<00:04:39.560> of<00:04:39.979> the<00:04:40.070> thing<00:04:40.310> so<00:04:40.340> I<00:04:40.669> guess<00:04:41.090> that's

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
episodes of the thing so I guess that's

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.960 
episodes of the thing so I guess that's
to<00:04:41.419> be<00:04:41.449> expected<00:04:41.630> I<00:04:42.229> at<00:04:43.160> least<00:04:43.310> knew<00:04:43.490> it<00:04:43.610> as<00:04:43.699> the

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
to be expected I at least knew it as the

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.300 
to be expected I at least knew it as the
lead<00:04:44.180> characters<00:04:44.720> and<00:04:45.080> I<00:04:45.169> guess<00:04:45.410> Dan<00:04:46.099> was

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
lead characters and I guess Dan was

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.999 
lead characters and I guess Dan was
supposed<00:04:46.580> to<00:04:46.669> be<00:04:46.729> bender<00:04:47.620> didn't<00:04:48.620> really<00:04:48.830> pick

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:49.009 
supposed to be bender didn't really pick

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:51.189 
supposed to be bender didn't really pick
up<00:04:49.039> on<00:04:49.280> that<00:04:49.460> right<00:04:49.699> away<00:04:49.940> as<00:04:50.240> I<00:04:50.539> think<00:04:50.810> I<00:04:50.930> kind

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 
up on that right away as I think I kind

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.320 
up on that right away as I think I kind
of<00:04:51.289> forgot<00:04:51.590> about<00:04:51.650> bender<00:04:52.220> entirely<00:04:52.669> until<00:04:53.300> I

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
of forgot about bender entirely until I

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.200 
of forgot about bender entirely until I
saw<00:04:53.990> him<00:04:54.139> at<00:04:54.259> the<00:04:54.289> end<00:04:54.470> there<00:04:54.820> not<00:04:55.820> sure<00:04:56.060> how

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
saw him at the end there not sure how

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.310 
saw him at the end there not sure how
that<00:04:56.270> happened<00:04:56.570> I<00:04:57.550> don't<00:04:58.550> know<00:04:58.760> but<00:04:59.030> I'm<00:04:59.240> uh

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
that happened I don't know but I'm uh

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.520 
that happened I don't know but I'm uh
I'm<00:05:00.320> probably<00:05:00.590> not<00:05:00.949> the<00:05:01.099> best<00:05:01.360> reactor<00:05:02.530> for

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
I'm probably not the best reactor for

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.089 
I'm probably not the best reactor for
this<00:05:03.680> kind<00:05:03.949> of<00:05:04.010> video<00:05:04.250> considering<00:05:05.000> I<00:05:06.099> don't

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099 
this kind of video considering I don't

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:11.740 
this kind of video considering I don't
really<00:05:07.820> have<00:05:08.030> much<00:05:08.270> context<00:05:09.080> but<00:05:10.630> it<00:05:11.630> was

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
really have much context but it was

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.439 
really have much context but it was
still<00:05:11.960> enjoyable<00:05:12.289> I<00:05:13.120> thought<00:05:14.120> the<00:05:14.240> first

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:14.449 
still enjoyable I thought the first

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:16.870 
still enjoyable I thought the first
video<00:05:14.840> was<00:05:15.139> also<00:05:15.349> pretty<00:05:15.800> neat<00:05:16.039> it<00:05:16.370> was<00:05:16.580> a<00:05:16.610> nice

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
video was also pretty neat it was a nice

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.920 
video was also pretty neat it was a nice
little<00:05:16.909> half<00:05:17.659> minute<00:05:18.020> slice<00:05:18.289> of<00:05:18.470> absurdity

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
little half minute slice of absurdity

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.830 
little half minute slice of absurdity
fluffle<00:05:20.930> is<00:05:22.270> simultaneously<00:05:23.270> light<00:05:23.599> enough

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
fluffle is simultaneously light enough

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.570 
fluffle is simultaneously light enough
to<00:05:23.870> float<00:05:24.229> away<00:05:24.380> but<00:05:24.740> heavy<00:05:25.039> enough<00:05:25.070> to<00:05:25.310> be

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
to float away but heavy enough to be

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.860 
to float away but heavy enough to be
immovable<00:05:26.620> even<00:05:27.620> with<00:05:27.800> bulk<00:05:28.659> trying<00:05:29.659> his<00:05:29.840> best

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
immovable even with bulk trying his best

immovable even with bulk trying his best
there<00:05:30.820> that<00:05:31.820> was<00:05:32.060> a<00:05:32.090> fun<00:05:32.330> little<00:05:32.419> bit<00:05:32.690> of
