00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
included the intel appup client which

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.750 
included the intel appup client which
allows<00:02:32.870> us<00:02:33.079> to<00:02:33.290> add<00:02:33.650> new<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:34.579> innovative

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
allows us to add new and innovative

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.539 
allows us to add new and innovative
applications<00:02:35.599> as<00:02:35.780> they<00:02:35.870> become<00:02:36.109> available

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
applications as they become available

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.250 
applications as they become available
the<00:02:37.549> intel<00:02:37.790> appup<00:02:37.939> client<00:02:38.540> is<00:02:38.659> divided<00:02:39.079> into

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
the intel appup client is divided into

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.170 
the intel appup client is divided into
multiple<00:02:39.560> categories<00:02:39.829> of<00:02:40.400> applications<00:02:40.939> so<00:02:41.120> i

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
multiple categories of applications so i

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.210 
multiple categories of applications so i
can<00:02:41.359> find<00:02:41.569> the<00:02:41.689> applications<00:02:42.260> that<00:02:42.500> i'm<00:02:43.010> most

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
can find the applications that i'm most

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.750 
can find the applications that i'm most
interested<00:02:43.400> in<00:02:43.790> i<00:02:45.430> can<00:02:46.430> find<00:02:46.609> information

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
interested in i can find information

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.920 
interested in i can find information
about<00:02:47.239> applications<00:02:49.299> as<00:02:50.299> well<00:02:50.359> as<00:02:50.689> see<00:02:50.810> the

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
about applications as well as see the

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.390 
about applications as well as see the
applications<00:02:51.470> i've<00:02:51.620> already<00:02:51.829> installed<00:02:52.069> it

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
applications i've already installed it

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.390 
applications i've already installed it
by<00:02:52.760> selecting<00:02:53.030> my<00:02:53.450> applications<00:02:54.109> I<00:02:54.349> can<00:02:55.310> even

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
by selecting my applications I can even

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.129 
by selecting my applications I can even
launch<00:02:55.730> applications<00:02:56.419> directly<00:02:56.750> within<00:02:56.959> the

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:57.139 
launch applications directly within the

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:01.000 
launch applications directly within the
app<00:02:57.230> client<00:02:57.919> and<00:02:59.680> finger<00:03:00.680> paint<00:03:00.889> is

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
app client and finger paint is

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
app client and finger paint is
particularly<00:03:01.430> interesting<00:03:01.790> because<00:03:01.819> it

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
particularly interesting because it

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.149 
particularly interesting because it
shows<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.329> five<00:03:02.569> simultaneous<00:03:02.870> input<00:03:03.829> points

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 
shows the five simultaneous input points

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:10.270 
shows the five simultaneous input points
of<00:03:04.250> this<00:03:04.370> particular<00:03:04.579> tablet<00:03:09.129> hopefully<00:03:10.129> this

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
of this particular tablet hopefully this

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.949 
of this particular tablet hopefully this
brief<00:03:10.730> look<00:03:11.030> at<00:03:11.269> Miguel<00:03:11.510> has<00:03:11.780> been
