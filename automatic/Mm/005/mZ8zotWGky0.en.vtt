00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
these beds are very hard they're

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.309 
these beds are very hard they're
extremely<00:02:56.519> hard<00:02:56.819> and<00:02:57.120> almost<00:02:57.750> uncomfortable

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
extremely hard and almost uncomfortable

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.610 
extremely hard and almost uncomfortable
so<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:59.220> batting<00:02:59.610> adds<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.940> little<00:03:00.180> bit<00:03:00.299> of

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
so the batting adds a little bit of

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.520 
so the batting adds a little bit of
almost<00:03:01.620> like<00:03:02.390> cushion<00:03:03.390> to<00:03:03.599> cushion<00:03:04.349> to<00:03:04.500> the

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
almost like cushion to cushion to the

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.400 
almost like cushion to cushion to the
bed<00:03:06.260> moving<00:03:07.260> on<00:03:07.470> right<00:03:08.099> here<00:03:08.370> is<00:03:08.489> my<00:03:08.640> desk<00:03:09.410> it's

Seoul<00:03:20.130> is<00:03:20.370> really<00:03:20.819> cool<00:03:21.060> for<00:03:21.480> about<00:03:21.870> three

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
Seoul is really cool for about three

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.879 
Seoul is really cool for about three
reasons<00:03:23.329> on<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:24.420> one<00:03:24.569> hand<00:03:24.840> I've<00:03:25.500> got<00:03:25.739> the

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
reasons on the one hand I've got the

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.789 
reasons on the one hand I've got the
nice<00:03:26.040> cityscape<00:03:26.730> to<00:03:26.880> look<00:03:27.030> at<00:03:27.150> on<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.590> other

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
nice cityscape to look at on the other

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.210 
nice cityscape to look at on the other
hand<00:03:29.010> I<00:03:29.190> also<00:03:29.340> have<00:03:29.790> a<00:03:30.680> nice<00:03:31.680> view<00:03:32.010> of<00:03:32.069> the

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
hand I also have a nice view of the

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.069 
hand I also have a nice view of the
mountain<00:03:32.700> range<00:03:32.970> in<00:03:33.239> the<00:03:33.269> background<00:03:33.780> and

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
mountain range in the background and

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.039 
mountain range in the background and

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
then one of my favorite reasons for this

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.449 
then one of my favorite reasons for this
view<00:03:37.319> is<00:03:39.440> people<00:03:40.440> watching<00:03:40.590> opportunities

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
about the room the switch right here is

00:03:51.959 --> 00:04:02.930 
about the room the switch right here is
actually<00:03:52.880> for<00:03:56.389> my<00:03:57.389> heated<00:03:57.810> floors<00:04:01.940> funny

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
actually for my heated floors funny

actually for my heated floors funny
thing<00:04:03.239> is<00:04:03.420> I<00:04:03.450> really<00:04:03.900> had<00:04:04.440> a<00:04:04.680> lot<00:04:04.829> of

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
thing is I really had a lot of

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:08.660 
thing is I really had a lot of
difficulty<00:04:05.459> figuring<00:04:05.730> out<00:04:07.609> figuring<00:04:08.609> out

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
difficulty figuring out figuring out

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.430 
difficulty figuring out figuring out
Celsius<00:04:09.209> in<00:04:09.299> my<00:04:09.420> head<00:04:09.630> like<00:04:10.019> I<00:04:10.170> know<00:04:10.230> how<00:04:10.380> to

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
Celsius in my head like I know how to

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.509 
Celsius in my head like I know how to
convert<00:04:10.799> but<00:04:11.190> the<00:04:11.880> lookin<00:04:12.720> it<00:04:13.680> wasn't<00:04:14.430> making

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
convert but the lookin it wasn't making

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.870 
convert but the lookin it wasn't making
really<00:04:14.880> it<00:04:15.120> wasn't<00:04:15.269> making<00:04:15.630> that<00:04:15.660> much<00:04:15.870> sense

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
really it wasn't making that much sense

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.150 
really it wasn't making that much sense
when<00:04:17.880> I<00:04:17.910> started<00:04:18.660> out<00:04:18.810> so<00:04:19.079> I<00:04:19.109> was<00:04:19.200> like<00:04:19.410> okay

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
when I started out so I was like okay

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.719 
when I started out so I was like okay
let<00:04:20.400> me<00:04:20.489> just<00:04:20.519> put<00:04:20.970> it<00:04:21.359> on<00:04:21.539> 40<00:04:22.019> but<00:04:22.890> 40<00:04:22.919> Celsius

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
let me just put it on 40 but 40 Celsius

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.940 
let me just put it on 40 but 40 Celsius
is<00:04:23.849> actually<00:04:24.380> extremely<00:04:25.380> hot

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
devices so things don't charge well

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.050

while<00:05:02.880> you're<00:05:03.090> not<00:05:03.210> here<00:05:04.100> but<00:05:05.100> yeah<00:05:05.190> all<00:05:05.700> right

time<00:05:06.390> for<00:05:06.540> the<00:05:06.630> next<00:05:06.810> place<00:05:07.490> okay<00:05:08.490> I'm<00:05:08.580> gonna

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
time for the next place okay I'm gonna

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.610 
time for the next place okay I'm gonna
take<00:05:09.090> the<00:05:09.360> elevator<00:05:09.780> but<00:05:09.990> it's<00:05:10.110> actually

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
take the elevator but it's actually

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.650 
take the elevator but it's actually
really<00:05:10.860> really<00:05:11.640> slow<00:05:12.060> so<00:05:12.300> I'm<00:05:12.390> probably<00:05:12.480> just

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
really really slow so I'm probably just

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.450 
really really slow so I'm probably just
gonna<00:05:12.810> take<00:05:13.050> the<00:05:13.140> stairs<00:05:13.380> instead<00:05:13.620> this<00:05:14.400> is

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
gonna take the stairs instead this is

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.290 
gonna take the stairs instead this is
actually<00:05:14.940> pretty<00:05:15.120> cool<00:05:15.270> because<00:05:15.840> on<00:05:17.000> all<00:05:18.000> the

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
actually pretty cool because on all the

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.280 
actually pretty cool because on all the
lights<00:05:18.450> turn<00:05:19.230> on<00:05:19.590> as<00:05:19.950> you<00:05:20.690> go<00:05:21.690> up<00:05:21.720> the<00:05:21.990> stairs

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
lights turn on as you go up the stairs

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.410 
lights turn on as you go up the stairs
it<00:05:22.560> sounds<00:05:22.770> like<00:05:22.890> a<00:05:22.920> motion<00:05:23.730> sensor<00:05:23.940> says<00:05:24.240> I

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
it sounds like a motion sensor says I

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:34.660 
it sounds like a motion sensor says I
see

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.670 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:45.160
