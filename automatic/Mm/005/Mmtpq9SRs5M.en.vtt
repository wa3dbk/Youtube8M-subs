00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.770
 what it means to me to see each other lyrics 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.850
 I call it black for me it's a march 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.400
 that allows me to enjoy an environment 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.380
 very close and spectacular and at the same time 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.870
 run consists of runners of 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.930
 different places my personal challenges 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.380
 and others 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.690
 between the runners and the second and not 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.680
 less important is to overcome the marks 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.680
 of previous years 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:13.550
 what does it mean for monegros 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.530
 or if it's a 90 and a unique event 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.229
 you know a lot of mountain people 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.180
 bike a total adrenaline rush in 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.340
 the exit with 6,000 runners my challenge 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.140
 current fixation of bikers and 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.259
 come back from overcoming a problem 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.869
 cardiac and choose this sport with the 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.610
 form of sports activity for that reason the 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.680
 dredge the tomato or no dragon and 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.300
 now it all starts in the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.399
 preparations prepare the marathon 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.840
 doing discrete running in the gym 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.660
 I recognize that it is an area for 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.080
 motivation that the test generates 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.080
 it would cost much more 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.130
 what did monegros for friends 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.750
 it is a challenge 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.340
 in my case it has to do with the personal 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.520
 it is an experience that always 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.930
 sum feeds my desire to excel and 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.930
 allows me to achieve unattainable goals 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.800
 what is your line
