00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:13.380

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:15.289
 been of course a motor brother it's like 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.449
 first action 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:21.300
 his cinema because it's my passion and 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.570
 that the fact of us doing it in high school in 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.470
 heavy option that's great and and that 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.240
 it's a professional project 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.759
 a priori it's harry the directors - 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.590
 of sireuil and I would like to become 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.670
 stunt you're hours but I'm trying 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.530
 to continue all that and make sure 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.469
 to have more choices 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.510
 the optional option is open to all 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.309
 high school students of all 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.840
 series the schedule these three hours by 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.899
 week 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:52.379
 the coefficient at the ferry is a 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.789
 coefficient 2 so only count the 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.469
 points above average while 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.390
 that the heavy option is reserved for 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.940
 students of the series l these five hours by 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.890
 week we have a heavier program in 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.989
 writing script term of studies 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.909
 of editing study of the history of cinema 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.290
 studies mostly from the exercise of 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.010
 film analysis exactly as in 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.689
 a French course or there an analysis t 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.979
 we analyze a text here we analyze a 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.630
 sequence his analysis of the processes of 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.040
 staging for example of a fact his 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.810
 work on the film or other Hitchcock 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.080
 I could say that these constructions 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.159
 and favorite movies but I will not be 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.850
 really because especially when 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.930
 the cinema option we are open to a 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.670
 wider cinema vision 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.229
 he obviously works not only on 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.159
 blogs our stars even though blockbusters 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.720
 are not proscribed 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.720
 the cinema option on the contrary 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.729
 students who already practice it that 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.770
 make films that edit 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.979
 others not at all had any knowledge 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.229
 make 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.490
 but that's exactly why we are 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.500
 here first is to learn 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.270
 today we just go rocks 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.490
 so we're going to look we're going to do what 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.530
 stratis told you we're going to look if 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.299
 you turned his name valet if I 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:05.219
 am the language choice of one or 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.110
 the other hanged of the project 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.110
 orientation of the lips if it is intended 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.310
 rather to film studies on it 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.560
 advise instead to choose the option 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.860
 obligatory finally teaching 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.209
 determination and if he wants rather a 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.010
 cultural openness have more than 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.690
 points to the bac to work a 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.489
 matter that interest him but in addition 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.540
 of a normal curriculum we will advise rather 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.519
 the optional option 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.989
 this year we are preparing a film 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.280
 next we will also present a 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.019
 madoff trial but that will be noted 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.640
 for the ferry too I framed them 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.799
 for all the making of a court 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.180
 footage writing the script the 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.349
 very cutting with the actors 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.329
 filming and editing 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.410
 at the start i signed up i got 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.970
 says ' like in movies 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.609
 in fact it's I think it's rather 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.280
 reserved for people who want to 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:49.470
 work and discover something 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.299
 without putting in force and passion 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.650
 it's true that a lot of students think 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.850
 that they will have a good time making 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.670
 movies make a movie that requires a lot 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.560
 of rigor work there they come out of 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.389
 their shoots so when I saw this 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.350
 morning they told me we are hollow and we have 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:04.100
 spent all weekend 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.100
 we ended at no time 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.000
 these ladies at play does it so I 'm going 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.620
 the sequence be just mourning all of 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.910
 laon the surface still more or less 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.310
 important for example a big downpour 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.230
 to know who was making sun so this 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.070
 who postponed our 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.110
 our shoot 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.940
 the fact that there was wind on saone 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.280
 last last scene on last 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.470
 place so we had to find from the fact that 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.840
 the means of april edge scarf for 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.180
 the microphone it forces us to take us 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.340
 in hand ourselves and to lead because 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.330
 that it's still our movie so 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.130
 lead but despite all work 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.900
 fun to say that if we give ourselves the 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.730
 means if we give ourselves the rigor if we 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.030
 do it seriously we really have fun 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.030
 to do it
