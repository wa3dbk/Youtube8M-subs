tractor<00:00:15.500> what<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:16.529> did<00:00:16.800> was<00:00:17.699> put<00:00:18.180> on<00:00:18.779> piece<00:00:18.990> of

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
tractor what I did was put on piece of

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.599 
tractor what I did was put on piece of
square<00:00:19.650> tubing<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:21.350> made<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.680> piece<00:00:23.279> on<00:00:23.430> both

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
square tubing and made a piece on both

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.810 
square tubing and made a piece on both
ends<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.320> that's<00:00:25.320> got<00:00:25.619> just<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.980> little<00:00:26.460> bit<00:00:26.640> of

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
ends and that's got just a little bit of

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.509 
ends and that's got just a little bit of
play<00:00:27.060> in<00:00:27.090> there<00:00:27.800> which<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:28.949> good<00:00:29.189> because<00:00:29.340> I

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
play in there which is good because I

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.540 
play in there which is good because I
plan<00:00:29.730> on<00:00:29.760> packing<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.390> full<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.689> grease<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.890> I

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
plan on packing it full of grease and I

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.130 
plan on packing it full of grease and I
don't<00:00:32.790> want<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.059> completely<00:00:33.210> rigid<00:00:33.960> because

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
don't want it completely rigid because

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.459 
don't want it completely rigid because
then<00:00:34.530> things<00:00:34.770> break<00:00:35.960> well<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:36.989> did<00:00:37.260> on<00:00:37.380> the

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
then things break well I did on the

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.670 
then things break well I did on the
bottom<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:38.540> just<00:00:39.540> light<00:00:39.780> down<00:00:39.960> here<00:00:40.020> is

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
bottom is just light down here is

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.080 
bottom is just light down here is
basically<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.820> same<00:00:42.000> thing<00:00:42.360> except<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.200> used

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
basically the same thing except I used

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.819 
basically the same thing except I used
tube<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.890> tube<00:00:48.350> other<00:00:49.350> than<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.620> it's

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
tube and tube other than that it's

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.130 
tube and tube other than that it's
exactly<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:51.000> same<00:00:51.410> same<00:00:52.410> setup<00:00:53.840> now<00:00:54.840> what<00:00:55.050> I'm

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
exactly the same same setup now what I'm

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.389 
exactly the same same setup now what I'm
going<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.350> do<00:00:55.500> now<00:00:55.910> is<00:00:56.930> make<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> piece<00:00:58.399> or

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
going to do now is make a piece or

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.900 
going to do now is make a piece or
actually<00:00:59.730> two<00:00:59.940> pieces<00:01:00.230> that<00:01:01.230> go<00:01:01.550> from<00:01:02.550> here

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
actually two pieces that go from here

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.080 
actually two pieces that go from here
off<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.409> square<00:01:04.710> tubing<00:01:05.100> down<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
off of the square tubing down to the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.530 
off of the square tubing down to the
round<00:01:06.270> stock<00:01:06.740> and<00:01:07.790> that'll<00:01:08.790> allow<00:01:09.000> both<00:01:09.270> these

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
round stock and that'll allow both these

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.740 
round stock and that'll allow both these
pieces<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:10.799> pivot<00:01:11.060> and<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.299> reason<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.570> want

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
pieces to pivot and the reason I want

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.410 
pieces to pivot and the reason I want
this<00:01:12.900> piece<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.170> pivot<00:01:13.520> is<00:01:14.520> because<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:14.939> will<00:01:15.270> be

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
this piece to pivot is because I will be

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.030 
this piece to pivot is because I will be
mounting<00:01:16.280> kick<00:01:17.280> Springs<00:01:17.670> from<00:01:18.240> here<00:01:19.040> to

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
mounting kick Springs from here to

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.460 
mounting kick Springs from here to
probably<00:01:20.729> well<00:01:21.570> yeah

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
probably well yeah

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.300 
probably well yeah
from<00:01:23.369> here<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.700> here<00:01:23.729> somewhere<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.420> may<00:01:24.659> go<00:01:24.840> to

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
from here to here somewhere I may go to

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.830 
from here to here somewhere I may go to
come<00:01:26.310> off<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:26.759> way<00:01:26.939> come<00:01:27.420> off<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:27.780> way

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
come off of this way come off this way

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.530 
come off of this way come off this way
so<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.439> if<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.619> hit<00:01:28.770> something<00:01:29.100> solid<00:01:29.540> it'll

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
so that if I hit something solid it'll

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.720 
so that if I hit something solid it'll
roll<00:01:30.869> forward<00:01:33.229> okay<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.259> know<00:01:34.470> for<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.829> fact

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.380 

all<00:01:38.730> this<00:01:38.970> stuff<00:01:39.810> you're<00:01:39.960> seeing<00:01:40.320> here

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
all this stuff you're seeing here

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.710 
all this stuff you're seeing here
probably<00:01:42.390> appears<00:01:42.870> to<00:01:42.990> be<00:01:43.110> gobbledygook

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
probably appears to be gobbledygook

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.950 
probably appears to be gobbledygook
but<00:01:45.720> I'm<00:01:45.960> just<00:01:46.140> about<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.380> tack<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.950> up<00:01:47.120> I<00:01:48.120> got

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
but I'm just about to tack it up I got

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.890 
but I'm just about to tack it up I got
that<00:01:49.140> piece<00:01:49.380> on<00:01:49.940> and<00:01:50.940> attack<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.480> piece<00:01:51.720> on

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
that piece on and attack that piece on

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.990 
that piece on and attack that piece on
temporarily<00:01:52.500> because<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.460> don't<00:01:53.700> have<00:01:53.820> my

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
temporarily because I don't have my

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.930 
temporarily because I don't have my
Springs<00:01:54.390> yet<00:01:54.890> so<00:01:55.890> that'll<00:01:56.190> just<00:01:56.340> keep<00:01:56.550> it<00:01:56.730> from

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
Springs yet so that'll just keep it from

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.180 
Springs yet so that'll just keep it from
flopping<00:01:57.900> around<00:01:58.170> maybe<00:01:58.620> pitching<00:01:59.100> your

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
flopping around maybe pitching your

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:06.050 
flopping around maybe pitching your
fingers<00:02:00.350> what<00:02:01.350> I'm<00:02:01.440> going<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.650> do<00:02:02.190> now<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:05.060> tack

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
fingers what I'm going to do now is tack

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.930 
fingers what I'm going to do now is tack
on<00:02:06.620> those<00:02:07.620> two<00:02:08.330> strips<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.510> flat<00:02:09.720> stock<00:02:10.080> there

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
on those two strips of flat stock there

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.120 
on those two strips of flat stock there
then<00:02:11.940> I'll<00:02:12.360> pull<00:02:12.600> it<00:02:12.630> off<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.230> move<00:02:13.860> it<00:02:14.010> onto

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
then I'll pull it off and move it onto

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.090 
then I'll pull it off and move it onto
my<00:02:14.340> workbench<00:02:15.290> okay<00:02:16.290> let's<00:02:16.590> see<00:02:16.740> what<00:02:16.980> he

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
my workbench okay let's see what he

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.310 
my workbench okay let's see what he
decided<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.460> do<00:02:17.640> instead<00:02:17.880> of<00:02:18.030> taking<00:02:18.930> tube

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
decided to do instead of taking tube

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.220 
decided to do instead of taking tube
steel<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:20.070> I<00:02:20.190> had<00:02:20.310> this<00:02:20.460> whole<00:02:20.640> piece<00:02:20.940> of

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
steel and I had this whole piece of

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.180 
steel and I had this whole piece of
angle<00:02:22.230> outside<00:02:23.600> instead<00:02:24.600> of<00:02:24.750> ripping<00:02:25.560> tube

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
angle outside instead of ripping tube

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.800 
angle outside instead of ripping tube
steel<00:02:26.520> down<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:27.090> making<00:02:27.330> it<00:02:27.420> like<00:02:27.570> see

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
steel down and making it like see

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.320 
steel down and making it like see
Channel<00:02:28.520> I'm<00:02:29.520> just<00:02:30.300> adding<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:31.820> chunk<00:02:32.820> of<00:02:32.880> angle

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
Channel I'm just adding a chunk of angle

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.050 
Channel I'm just adding a chunk of angle
in<00:02:34.170> between<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:35.190> support<00:02:36.000> that<00:02:36.210> and<00:02:37.790> I<00:02:38.790> believe

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
in between to support that and I believe

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.010 
in between to support that and I believe
it'll<00:02:39.750> be<00:02:39.870> plenty<00:02:40.080> good<00:02:41.420> well<00:02:42.420> here's<00:02:42.660> what<00:02:42.900> we

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
it'll be plenty good well here's what we

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.670 
it'll be plenty good well here's what we
ended<00:02:43.260> up<00:02:43.350> with<00:02:43.620> so<00:02:44.370> far<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:45.350> couple<00:02:46.350> of<00:02:46.560> things

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
ended up with so far a couple of things

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.030 
ended up with so far a couple of things
I'm<00:02:46.920> not<00:02:47.040> too<00:02:47.280> happy<00:02:47.430> with<00:02:48.620> one<00:02:49.620> of<00:02:49.740> them<00:02:49.890> would

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
I'm not too happy with one of them would

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.600 
I'm not too happy with one of them would
be<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.610> fact<00:02:51.510> that<00:02:51.630> when<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:51.870> lifts<00:02:52.260> up<00:02:52.410> I<00:02:52.739> mean

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
be the fact that when it lifts up I mean

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.979 
be the fact that when it lifts up I mean
I<00:02:53.790> get<00:02:54.030> good<00:02:54.570> clearance<00:02:56.360> but<00:02:57.360> that's<00:02:57.690> where<00:02:57.959> I

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
I get good clearance but that's where I

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.940 
I get good clearance but that's where I
was<00:02:58.320> thinking

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
was thinking

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.720 
was thinking
I<00:02:59.980> should<00:03:00.700> have<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:02.260> know<00:03:02.290> made<00:03:02.560> me<00:03:02.710> step<00:03:03.010> this

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
I should have you know made me step this

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.370 
I should have you know made me step this
down<00:03:04.350> got<00:03:05.350> a<00:03:05.380> lower<00:03:05.680> to<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.070> ground<00:03:07.350> but<00:03:08.350> still

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
down got a lower to the ground but still

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.800 
down got a lower to the ground but still
as<00:03:08.980> far<00:03:09.160> as<00:03:09.310> pushing<00:03:09.580> snow<00:03:09.850> I<00:03:10.240> think<00:03:10.660> would<00:03:10.780> be

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
as far as pushing snow I think would be

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.120 
as far as pushing snow I think would be
fine<00:03:11.080> I<00:03:11.980> added<00:03:12.850> on<00:03:12.940> these<00:03:13.210> Stoppers<00:03:13.920> so<00:03:14.920> that

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
fine I added on these Stoppers so that

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.340 
fine I added on these Stoppers so that
when<00:03:15.250> I<00:03:15.280> get<00:03:15.460> my<00:03:15.640> spring<00:03:16.060> so<00:03:16.870> that<00:03:16.930> when<00:03:17.260> you

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
when I get my spring so that when you

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.930 
when I get my spring so that when you
hit<00:03:17.500> something<00:03:17.860> solid<00:03:18.070> and<00:03:18.400> leg<00:03:18.730> kicks<00:03:20.940> tells

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
hit something solid and leg kicks tells

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.490 
hit something solid and leg kicks tells
me<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:22.300> stoppers<00:03:22.750> that<00:03:22.780> catch<00:03:23.110> it<00:03:23.260> when<00:03:23.410> it

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
me the stoppers that catch it when it

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.390 
me the stoppers that catch it when it
comes<00:03:23.650> back<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:26.130> other<00:03:27.130> than<00:03:27.370> that<00:03:27.640> uh<00:03:29.400> thank

the chunk this to make the cutting blade
that's<00:04:33.190> why<00:04:33.490> right<00:04:33.970> now<00:04:34.030> the<00:04:34.240> plows<00:04:34.840> a<00:04:35.350> little

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
that's why right now the plows a little

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.810 
that's why right now the plows a little
more<00:04:36.370> vertical<00:04:36.700> than<00:04:37.060> it<00:04:37.419> should<00:04:37.630> be
