 new video of gta 5 then 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.319
 today we find ourselves in the water 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.700
 just here so franklin will stop going 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.290
 hold his breath for two minutes so much 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.330
 that shows you the location on the map 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.250
 is right at this lake at 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.719
 level of this piece of land right here 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.449
 end this mini he 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.890
 so here it is really off first 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.430
 easy to find gets paid hot 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.900
 so here we go we take it and 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.900
 franklin will once again surrender 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.240
 ridiculous with his famous fins choice 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.410
 are he finally going to put his hand in 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.380
 simulate fish once we have 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:41.390
 completed the hallucination of franklin is going 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:43.680
 to turn it into fertilizer at would 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:48.110
 look very stoic at first you know 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.110
 really moved to vary the whole thing 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:01:02.190
 it's really very weird that kills 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:06.869
 we really have a real hard and it shows 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:10.110
 and also flaccid may be no 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.979
 comment no I'm too strong on 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.100
 will calm down 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.240
 it's really very weird 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.369
 hello I'm an ear after the 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.799
 hammerhead of the strabismus 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.720
 strabismus of the stop go go good the 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.500
 comments i will avoid all 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:32.340
 jokes about the bus stop everything 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:35.250
 other 1 1 we read through his jokes 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.549
 of this level there good even if I wait 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.560
 some at the turn so keep 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.329
 franklin there are animations you go 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.710
 do us good obviously like every 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.720
 aquatic animal has not much to 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:51.780
 to do apart we will say discover the 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.950
 seabed even so good here by 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.110
 the two three boats or tank we 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.100
 can find in the same oph kill 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.780
 animals it's true that the hammerhead shark 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.229
 with them when it was not too bad 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.200
 anyway 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.000
 but but here we are not big 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.569
 thing to do with his kidneys to talk 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.619
 to admire them is really weird when 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.769
 we swim with 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.049
 with 5 10 or 20 below it's 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:20.340
 always done it's weird 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:21.540
 with the gills also that's good I 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.769
 think we'll stop here for 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.319
 this little host country because not big 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.569
 thing to say about it apart from you 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.739
 much closer to the end even if 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.349
 it is true that said almost every 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.760
 episode now here is franklin what 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:37.739
 I am particularly interested in animation 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.629
 what are you going to do to us after that was you 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.890
 do like any other fish to 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.840
 I would have expected the hair 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.980
 it's disappointing on the spot I 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.209
 was expecting them to have what 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.950
 moves all parts of his body 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.989
 finally in his arms the stuff 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.180
 like that because he does it I can not 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:55.040
 you limit epileptic seizure you want 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:03:00.480
 no we see the photo a weird thing 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:04.049
 but yes good enough disappointed I was waiting 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.060
 especially a lot of it I expected 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.829
 the stop in anthem criticism but hey 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.239
 apparently it's not so good 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.739
 anyway we will leave each other on his shelves 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.459
 of sun so here is this beautiful 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.959
 franklin coming out of the water the little 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.180
 music behind so in any case if 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.349
 you liked this pretty good little pilot 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.630
 I will not say out of the ordinary but who 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.730
 change 28 at the level of animals 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.290
 aquatic and do not hesitate to like 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.269
