00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
back door engines down here a little

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.850 
back door engines down here a little
button<00:00:59.550> right<00:00:59.699> there<00:00:59.870> as<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.199> push<00:01:01.500> that

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860

button r2d2 supposed to eject what
doesn't<00:01:05.430> work<00:01:05.520> that<00:01:05.729> one<00:01:06.680> as<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.830> can<00:01:07.950> look<00:01:08.130> in

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
doesn't work that one as you can look in

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.300 
doesn't work that one as you can look in
here<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.200> there<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.289> has<00:01:10.440> a<00:01:10.470> little<00:01:10.830> gear

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
here and there it has a little gear

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.300 
here and there it has a little gear
system<00:01:12.180> we<00:01:12.270> push<00:01:12.479> on<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.780> knob<00:01:12.960> in<00:01:14.390> that<00:01:15.390> moves

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
system we push on the knob in that moves

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.890 
system we push on the knob in that moves
so<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.430> doesn't<00:01:17.670> really<00:01:17.760> work<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.420> well<00:01:18.600> that

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
so it doesn't really work that well that

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.840 
so it doesn't really work that well that
says<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.380> say<00:01:20.150> should<00:01:21.150> probably<00:01:21.570> go<00:01:22.580> and<00:01:23.580> it

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850
