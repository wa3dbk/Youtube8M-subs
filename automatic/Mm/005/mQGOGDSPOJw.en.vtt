00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
kind of interesting because i'm i'm

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.160 
kind of interesting because i'm i'm

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
pretty sure that they are technically a

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.520 
pretty sure that they are technically a
company<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.220> one<00:01:26.520> company<00:01:27.060> i<00:01:27.479> don't<00:01:28.350> i

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
company of this one company i don't i

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.630 
company of this one company i don't i
don't<00:01:28.560> know<00:01:28.770> exactly<00:01:29.130> what<00:01:29.280> it's<00:01:29.400> called<00:01:29.579> but

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
don't know exactly what it's called but

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.429 
don't know exactly what it's called but
I<00:01:29.790> know<00:01:29.880> like<00:01:30.030> all<00:01:30.360> these<00:01:30.509> somewhat<00:01:31.020> small

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
I know like all these somewhat small

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.800 
I know like all these somewhat small
ones<00:01:31.829> such<00:01:32.340> as<00:01:32.369> like<00:01:32.729> T<00:01:33.060> quality<00:01:33.420> gems<00:01:33.689> like

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
ones such as like T quality gems like

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.109 
ones such as like T quality gems like
that<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.170> guess<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.740> big<00:01:35.189> one<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:35.759> company

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
that I guess the big one of this company

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.730 
that I guess the big one of this company
but<00:01:36.659> it's<00:01:36.900> kind<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.170> interesting<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.680> think

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
but it's kind of interesting I think

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.010 
but it's kind of interesting I think
because<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.460> seems<00:01:39.030> like<00:01:39.150> all<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.750> them<00:01:39.840> are

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
because it seems like all of them are

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.539 
because it seems like all of them are
coming<00:01:40.290> from<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.590> company<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.400> like

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.560 
or I guess even like Search and Destroy
but<00:02:49.160> i<00:02:49.190> never<00:02:49.430> played<00:02:49.610> Search<00:02:49.820> and<00:02:50.000> Destroy<00:02:50.030> so
