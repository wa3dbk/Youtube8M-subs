00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.200
 that's why I can hear it from here and the 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.120
 Xunta wants to kill himself and even if he follows them 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.309
 blocking the breath is the language of 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.219
 those who were born killers their fate 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.049
 will continue to dream, although sometimes it hurts 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.330
 and I know you left caravan 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.710
 that the night became more possible each 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.720
 time the loads were filled 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.330
 in these afternoons that when I told him 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.769
 the mouth thought it was the elevator and 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.630
 when the naked tourist you imagined 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.999
 the turn then resists with fury 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.550
 and how it was so pleasant you turned it on 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:35.190
 give and instead of saying I love you when 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.550
 you finished breakfast paid until the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.840
 mother answer and she did not understand anything 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.390
 if someday they understood I want to sleep 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.579
 that you smoke more than double that is the 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.770
 daily a thousand times that you take numbers and 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.930
 you do accounts that you wish evil to the 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.519
 rivals that you put the radio that 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.899
 you invite the rapporteur to eat a barbecue and 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:54.390
 I asked is a street phrase for 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.600
 Flag and I spend nights talking about voice 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.760
 and that's the phrase and it's another excuse for 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.559
 that the wait will not be eternal there are many 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.750
 who do not want to hear me from the 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.640
 suffering from being away damn 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.010
 the repression that does not let my people 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.300
 sing you are paying for your greatness 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.730
 workshops 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.410
 I am guilty of a reality you will look for the 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.690
 hug the crowds a nod to the 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.730
 sky, you take me out to your girl, take your 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.420
 children on the shoulders give me a thousand times you 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.670
 I want 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.350
 You will either believe in yourself or you will not return to 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.240
 kiss the lost ones that once 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.760
 are you will do the biggest roast 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.380
 of the world will take life and fernet up 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.320
 going crazy relatives will flirt 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.480
 fought the chetos go to the sergeant and 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.550
 the blacks will make quilombo without cross the 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.770
 blonde who plays hockey takes a 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.600
 mason's pawn and sun bed but 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.300
 of the country will offer marriage to the 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.880
 maid the priests will be coherent the 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.670
 more human doctors do not condemn more 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.010
 art and me and I may understand that 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.590
 while I'm with all I'm never going to 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.690
 to be with one today I come for pleasure and in 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.550
 alcohol and some other vice I will find 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.710
 the inspiration so that my story will 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.860
 make feel here I'm not sure that 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.200
 can but it is better to try than to die 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.600
 without feeling your voice rogelio taught me 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.570
 on those nights that will soon return with 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.130
 the matador that is what God wants and 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.130
 God wants me to win workshops
