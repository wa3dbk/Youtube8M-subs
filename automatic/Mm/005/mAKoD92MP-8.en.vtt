00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:12.200
 hello everyone in this life teaches them 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.260
 how to format your camera card 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.330
 if they have one that is like that, a sticker 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.490
 they teach how to put it this is going to erase 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.800
 everything and basically restore and if they have 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.009
 an error inside the card as 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.160
 first we have to go to the magnifying glass and 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.779
 let's write floppy drive or 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.829
 discs 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.210
 then I bought is in English 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:36.390
 then of writing 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.410
 since I get desserts maybe they have in 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.390
 Spanish that is to say utility of disks in 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.960
 disk utility is where we are going to 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.730
 do everything is basically from here 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.270
 they have to see your card 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.770
 already this card may say no name without 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.990
 first name 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.270
 anything but they will be able to see 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.670
 how many times are we going to click on the 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.800
 first thing that we see I know that he teaches them to 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.360
 two but basically the first one is 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.350
 because we have to format what is the 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.790
 same 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.550
 equally team can not see others 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.610
 discs they have on the computer 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:14.610
 from here we have to go to delete in 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.700
 erase what we want to always put in 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.040
 ms-dos fat because that's the format for 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.250
 your camera without any of these other 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.350
 it will not work ex fat could 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.670
 work them but it's always the best 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.860
 this for now we're going to leave her here 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.390
 let's put some title 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.370
 they can put any name that 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.920
 want your perfect not because nothing that 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.720
 see can leave you without a title even in 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.970
 this case since I have a man of 6 gb 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.860
 let's leave the untitled let's give 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.260
 click on delete 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.230
 erase once again this will erase all 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.440
 the information on your card and it's going to 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.660
 format again restructure your 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.730
 card so that it works again is 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.520
 that is not working well if this does not 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.479
 you fix your card or if not erase all 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.479
 If they have an error 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.360
 you can try again and there are other 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.910
 ways to fix it but this is the 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.700
 faster solution and usually it's 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.340
 good to reformat the card after 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.320
 sometimes of use then not only is 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.750
 good to erase what you have in the 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.110
 content of your card from time to time 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.340
 but reformatting it's good 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.980
 Especially used on your card 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.930
 your memory enough of the card 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.700
 equally is your camera enough to 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.440
 take pictures and it's good to reformat 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.600
 after they delete all the photos 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.880
 this is a very easy and fast way 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.030
 also to erase the photos within your 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.010
 card since they made their cow where 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.530
 your card came in here they will see that 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.380
 there is nothing and it is late formatted if they have 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.090
 some problem with this or is more 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.100
 information can write here below in 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.870
