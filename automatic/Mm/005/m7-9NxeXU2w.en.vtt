00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.600
 where it is in the wine 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.340
 that in the car 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.110
 it was not so that's what happened 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.180
 but it was not easy to do so we 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.260
 will say it was easily done 25 years 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.080
 and the one that pushes and that puts us 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.520
 pressure in the elsewhere was 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.230
 still largely ahead in front of 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.290
 all the other corners so that's when 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.570
 even though we were on a big pace but 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.160
 it has not been easy in all cases and 25 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.680
 second it's someone special 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.710
 lakers of the day as a species 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.260
 special workshop where I released a 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.910
 little where I wanted to spend on a rhythm 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.980
 even more 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.660
 the safe but hey I take you only in a 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.970
 false rhythm at least with the health he 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.250
 must meet 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.330
 here is the penalty was immediate 4 km 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.160
 and lost five seconds that had 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.390
 really something that was wrong 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.489
 it's not the case not against second 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.690
 passage in a stratum it was for 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.690
 to show that 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.430
 and there and 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.860
 it seems specially to show 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.479
 yeah that's sure to show him 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.920
 we are going to know how to do and we want 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.150
 keep our lead after not getting 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.490
 built in a more beautiful special 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.740
 monte carlo 6 is absolutely finish finish 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.330
 finish finished latin little more freedom 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.940
 to play to do what you want to do 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.220
 let's free death the times the slims 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.910
 it is sure has taken a confidence we are 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.950
 trust each other 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.430
 after we are not stupid we think when 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.810
 even enormously championship but if he 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.820
 had been too difficult to contain 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.720
 this day 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:39.140
 finish second because the second 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:42.590
 for our championship are so 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.729
 I can not wait to tell you anyway 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.290
 think of victory and she to manage 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.430
 it's after the first special stage 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.780
 the afternoon arnaud 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.070
 81 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.119
 webb elsewhere it's an afternoon like 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:56.450
 I saw that it was done naturally 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:59.140
 that was yesterday I knew for his 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.770
 transfer and carrots enjoy it 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.909
 if it is not necessarily the case 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.320
 today today I had 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.430
 the impression of seeing where the poorest 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.430
 to keep the pace to do 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.119
 you specialties maybe a little 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.950
 little harder a little bit 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.090
 the more we see the conditions I found 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.920
 your difficult him that happens 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.250
 currently 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.750
 in moments frankly 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.220
 we got a touch of order in 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.930
 the last one there because there were 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.420
 bodies begin to leave in has to 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.510
 that we lost the 12 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.650
 nothing 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.280
 frankly nothing very violent 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.280
 hitherto 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:35.480
 means follow just one is so 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.900
 bother with the question what's it 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.290
 to be behind me to be here in front of 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.569
 more 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.769
 here as elsewhere to this good fauna 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.740
 performance when we find ourselves in front 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.150
 it's clear 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.100
 it is the reference throughout all 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.270
 ways on all rallies so happen 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.480
 to be in front is fine now he 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.890
 must go to the end 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.890
 for it to be really a plus
