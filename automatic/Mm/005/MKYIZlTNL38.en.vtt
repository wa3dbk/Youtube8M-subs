called topping and tailing since when do

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.680 
called topping and tailing since when do
you<00:04:40.680> use<00:04:40.770> a<00:04:41.400> color<00:04:41.669> up<00:04:41.850> the<00:04:41.970> top<00:04:42.210> and<00:04:42.450> a<00:04:42.480> color

you use a color up the top and a color

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:43.970 
you use a color up the top and a color
at<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:42.870> bottom<00:04:42.990> and<00:04:43.320> you<00:04:43.410> sandwich<00:04:43.860> in

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
at the bottom and you sandwich in

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.440 
at the bottom and you sandwich in
between<00:04:44.010> the<00:04:44.370> two<00:04:44.490> with<00:04:44.669> another<00:04:44.940> block<00:04:45.150> color

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
between the two with another block color

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.330 
between the two with another block color
and<00:04:45.870> what<00:04:46.050> that<00:04:46.169> does<00:04:46.440> is<00:04:46.740> that<00:04:46.770> just<00:04:47.040> creates

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
and what that does is that just creates

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.670 
and what that does is that just creates
really<00:04:47.669> even<00:04:48.360> proportions<00:04:48.900> and<00:04:49.080> elongates

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
the body and I've used Sharla's natural

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.260 
the body and I've used Sharla's natural
hair<00:04:52.530> color<00:04:52.740> to<00:04:52.890> match<00:04:53.040> the<00:04:53.250> shoes<00:04:53.490> so<00:04:54.060> just

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
hair color to match the shoes so just

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.610 
hair color to match the shoes so just
kind<00:04:54.419> of<00:04:54.450> really<00:04:54.870> pans<00:04:55.110> it<00:04:55.260> all<00:04:55.350> out<00:04:55.500> and<00:04:55.560> then

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
kind of really pans it all out and then

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.710 
kind of really pans it all out and then
obviously<00:04:55.890> a<00:04:56.130> bag<00:04:56.370> to<00:04:56.880> match<00:04:57.060> the<00:04:57.270> dress<00:04:57.510> and

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
obviously a bag to match the dress and

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.510 
obviously a bag to match the dress and
then<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:57.960> dress<00:04:58.169> ties<00:04:58.800> in<00:04:59.100> at<00:04:59.190> the<00:04:59.280> smallest

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
then the dress ties in at the smallest

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.430 
then the dress ties in at the smallest
