00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.380
 on the last six matches nîmes remains 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.269
 on five wins and a draw in Monaco 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.189
 a very good draw in 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.750
 principality nor is clearly the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.759
 best team of these last two 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.890
 month in league 2 a big test so at caen 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.890
 third is a proven candidate for the climb 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:42.379
 will the Nîmes be able to 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.379
 resist caen at the stadium michel d'ornano 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:51.420
 the handshake between the two 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:54.870
 captains the kickoff is given by 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.320
 the canes and first elements of 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.809
 reply 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.309
 at the 3rd minute corner for the normans 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.890
 the head of jean jacques pierre opening 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.850
 score for the Normans 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.259
 jean jacques pierre who marks his 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.259
 first goal of the season 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.649
 Nîmes, picked cold from the beginning 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.289
 of the meeting is trying to react very good 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:15.149
 benazé work on the left side there 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:17.009
 serves ogunbiyi the striking 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.750
 the two points of perquis and then 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.280
 it is to you that he can not 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.759
 recover the high level ball of the 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.759
 surface to repair 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.869
 but the Caen they want to impose 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.969
 their superiority hits her far away on 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.359
 the crossbar signed moussavou 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:39.429
 that he was barely 21 years old could have been 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:40.810
 the very first goal of his career and 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:42.749
 duhamel behind fails to 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.310
 straighten the ball 

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:48.099
 another opportunity for canes and 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.439
 nabob for duhamel incredible misfire 

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:51.849
 the striker Caennais the rescue in 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:53.500
 last minute the foal all happy to see 

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:55.030
 the balloon get him on the chest the 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.429
 clearing without asking any questions 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:04.420
 in the wake and it's half time 1 0 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:05.890
 so for 3rd league cadets 2 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.849
 Nimes are generally not the 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.849
 choice for now 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.470
 we are well 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.430
 william lavis sole referee gives the shot 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.430
 sending the second period 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.080
 these ten months more enterprising good 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:30.010
 work with ogunbiyi who will be at the 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.230
 receiving this opportunity and parrying it 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.680
 of damien perquis very movement 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.630
 collective gardois one last 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.730
 opportunity for canes and livio 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.890
 nabob stands alone facing 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.790
 merville and merville anticipates well the 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.790
 dribble of nabob 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.810
 the final whistle test no 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.650
 concluding therefore for the nîmes series 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.780
 invincibility 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.569
 ashley and greece woods anyway 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.489
 sixth in the six-point ranking of the 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.489
 third place occupied by the Caen 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.629
 this world
