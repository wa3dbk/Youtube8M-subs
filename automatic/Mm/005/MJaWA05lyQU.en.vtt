a strong guy but look at the elusiveness

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.789

in<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.810> athleticism

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
in the athleticism

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.639 
in the athleticism

that's a Ben Roethlisberger type play

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.620 
that's a Ben Roethlisberger type play
out<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.700> guy<00:01:56.880> who's<00:01:57.149> got<00:01:57.329> Ben

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
Roethlisberger type size that's why you

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.240 
Roethlisberger type size that's why you
hear<00:02:00.780> in<00:02:00.869> some<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:01.140> those<00:02:01.200> comparisons<00:02:02.009> I

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
hear in some of those comparisons I

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.160 
hear in some of those comparisons I
think<00:02:02.909> he's<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.030> fine<00:02:03.299> quarterback<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.869> fine

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
think he's a fine quarterback a fine

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.499 
think he's a fine quarterback a fine
prospect<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:05.460> in<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.640> right<00:02:05.790> situation<00:02:06.420> I

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
prospect and in the right situation I

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.089 
prospect and in the right situation I
think<00:02:06.570> will<00:02:06.810> do<00:02:06.960> well<00:02:07.140> yeah<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.469> then<00:02:07.829> went<00:02:08.069> to

think will do well yeah and then went to

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.330 
think will do well yeah and then went to
Miami<00:02:08.369> Ohio<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.910> no<00:02:09.000> one

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
Miami Ohio and no one

Miami Ohio and no one
he<00:02:09.640> was<00:02:09.849> and<00:02:10.060> then<00:02:10.149> all<00:02:10.239> the<00:02:10.360> sudden<00:02:10.479> he<00:02:10.690> was

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
he was and then all the sudden he was

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.540 
he was and then all the sudden he was
rocketing<00:02:11.349> up<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.560> draft<00:02:11.769> boards<00:02:12.099> it's<00:02:12.370> same

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
thing is happening with Blake bortles

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.940 
thing is happening with Blake bortles
got<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.810> little<00:02:14.019> more<00:02:14.140> exposure<00:02:14.440> with<00:02:14.739> some<00:02:14.830> of

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
got a little more exposure with some of

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.690 
got a little more exposure with some of
his<00:02:15.040> games<00:02:15.280> that<00:02:15.459> were<00:02:15.550> playing<00:02:15.790> on<00:02:15.910> ESPN<00:02:16.450> oh

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
his games that were playing on ESPN oh

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.190 
his games that were playing on ESPN oh
yeah<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:19.090> we<00:02:19.150> saw<00:02:19.269> we<00:02:19.390> saw<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.629> little<00:02:19.810> bit<00:02:19.959> more

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
yeah and we saw we saw a little bit more

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.360 
yeah and we saw we saw a little bit more
of<00:02:20.349> him<00:02:20.560> there<00:02:20.800> are<00:02:20.830> a<00:02:20.920> lot<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.069> teams<00:02:21.310> that

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
of him there are a lot of teams that

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.250 
of him there are a lot of teams that
need<00:02:21.519> a<00:02:21.580> quarterback<00:02:21.940> he<00:02:22.569> might<00:02:22.750> be<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.050> first

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
need a quarterback he might be the first

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.570 
need a quarterback he might be the first
one<00:02:23.410> off<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.680> board<00:02:23.890> is<00:02:24.040> there<00:02:24.190> a<00:02:24.220> fit<00:02:24.550> that

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
one off the board is there a fit that

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.009 
one off the board is there a fit that
you<00:02:24.879> see<00:02:25.120> that<00:02:25.269> would<00:02:25.360> be<00:02:25.480> right<00:02:25.660> for<00:02:25.690> him<00:02:25.840> if

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
you see that would be right for him if

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.539 
you see that would be right for him if
he<00:02:26.110> lands<00:02:26.319> a<00:02:26.470> bit<00:02:26.620> listen<00:02:26.890> I<00:02:26.920> think<00:02:27.370> he's<00:02:27.459> the

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
he lands a bit listen I think he's the

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:28.800 
he lands a bit listen I think he's the
best<00:02:27.760> prospect<00:02:28.239> of<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.420> quarterback

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
best prospect of the quarterback

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.539 
best prospect of the quarterback
position<00:02:28.989> because<00:02:29.620> of<00:02:29.769> where<00:02:29.950> he<00:02:29.980> is<00:02:30.160> now<00:02:30.340> and

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
position because of where he is now and

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.119 
position because of where he is now and
what<00:02:30.730> he<00:02:30.819> can<00:02:31.060> possibly<00:02:31.390> be<00:02:31.989> so<00:02:32.379> I<00:02:32.620> think<00:02:32.950> there

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
what he can possibly be so I think there

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:34.650 
what he can possibly be so I think there
are<00:02:33.220> a<00:02:33.250> lot<00:02:33.430> of<00:02:33.459> teams<00:02:33.760> that<00:02:33.940> would<00:02:34.180> be<00:02:34.480> a<00:02:34.510> good

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
are a lot of teams that would be a good

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.210 
are a lot of teams that would be a good
fit<00:02:34.900> for<00:02:34.930> him<00:02:35.230> I<00:02:35.410> would<00:02:35.890> look<00:02:35.980> at<00:02:36.099> the

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
fit for him I would look at the

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.339 
fit for him I would look at the
Minnesota<00:02:36.670> Vikings<00:02:36.790> at<00:02:37.450> seven<00:02:37.930> it's<00:02:38.049> not<00:02:38.170> the

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
Minnesota Vikings at seven it's not the

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:39.690 
Minnesota Vikings at seven it's not the
very<00:02:38.470> top<00:02:38.799> of<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.040> draft<00:02:39.250> they<00:02:39.489> obviously

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
very top of the draft they obviously

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.910 
very top of the draft they obviously
have<00:02:40.120> issues<00:02:40.330> trying<00:02:41.230> to<00:02:41.290> sort<00:02:41.530> out<00:02:41.680> their

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
have issues trying to sort out their

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.800 
have issues trying to sort out their
quarterback<00:02:42.459> position<00:02:42.640> norv<00:02:43.180> turner<00:02:43.269> has<00:02:43.690> had

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
quarterback position norv turner has had

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.750 
quarterback position norv turner has had
success<00:02:44.290> with<00:02:44.950> a<00:02:45.280> number<00:02:45.640> of<00:02:45.670> different

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
success with a number of different

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.309 
success with a number of different
quarterbacks<00:02:46.480> that<00:02:46.599> have<00:02:46.750> similar<00:02:46.989> type

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
quarterbacks that have similar type

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.979 
quarterbacks that have similar type
skillsets<00:02:47.890> as<00:02:48.730> Blake<00:02:49.030> bortles<00:02:49.209> house<00:02:49.540> so<00:02:49.810> I

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
skillsets as Blake bortles house so I

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.630 
skillsets as Blake bortles house so I
think<00:02:50.230> when<00:02:50.380> you<00:02:50.410> look<00:02:50.500> at<00:02:50.799> it<00:02:50.950> in<00:02:51.099> that<00:02:51.250> regard

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
think when you look at it in that regard

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.059 
think when you look at it in that regard
Minnesota<00:02:52.630> would<00:02:53.260> be<00:02:53.410> a<00:02:53.440> nice<00:02:53.680> fit<00:02:53.950> especially

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
Minnesota would be a nice fit especially

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:55.470 
Minnesota would be a nice fit especially
when<00:02:54.519> you<00:02:54.610> think<00:02:54.760> he<00:02:54.879> would<00:02:55.000> be<00:02:55.090> going<00:02:55.269> to<00:02:55.450> a

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
when you think he would be going to a

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.289 
when you think he would be going to a
team<00:02:55.920> that<00:02:56.920> has<00:02:57.069> decent<00:02:57.430> perimeter<00:02:57.940> talent

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
team that has decent perimeter talent

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.610 
team that has decent perimeter talent
but<00:02:58.390> they<00:02:58.510> obviously<00:02:58.660> will<00:02:59.079> depend<00:02:59.410> on<00:02:59.530> the

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
but they obviously will depend on the

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.010 
but they obviously will depend on the
running<00:02:59.860> game
