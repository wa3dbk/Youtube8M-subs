which char USB 2.0 on the back we have a

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.800 
which char USB 2.0 on the back we have a
ethernet<00:01:19.560> connector<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:21.000> power<00:01:21.240> connector

so<00:01:28.829> we<00:01:28.979> can<00:01:29.430> output<00:01:29.880> our<00:01:30.030> audio<00:01:30.360> /<00:01:30.750> optical

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
so we can output our audio / optical

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.550 
so we can output our audio / optical
left<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.340> right<00:01:32.490> audio<00:01:32.990> on<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.049> couple<00:01:34.470> of

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.730 

lens<00:02:07.070> adapter<00:02:07.580> so<00:02:08.000> that's<00:02:08.330> a<00:02:08.600> not<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.530> race

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
have to use HDMI or component so shame

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.440 
have to use HDMI or component so shame
that<00:02:58.160> they<00:02:58.310> aren't<00:02:58.490> supplying<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.060> cable

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
that they aren't supplying the cable

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.449 
that they aren't supplying the cable
especially<00:03:00.050> when<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.230> cables<00:03:00.590> even<00:03:01.220> a<00:03:01.280> cheap

Kabletown<00:03:01.880> is<00:03:02.390> only<00:03:02.720> a<00:03:02.810> couple<00:03:02.930> of<00:03:03.110> quid<00:03:03.350> and

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
Kabletown is only a couple of quid and

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.500 
Kabletown is only a couple of quid and
so<00:03:04.400> it's<00:03:04.520> a<00:03:04.580> bit<00:03:04.700> of<00:03:04.790> a<00:03:04.850> shame<00:03:05.030> that<00:03:05.060> those<00:03:05.330> and

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
so it's a bit of a shame that those and

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.290 
so it's a bit of a shame that those and

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
little interesting not sure how they

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.470 
little interesting not sure how they
