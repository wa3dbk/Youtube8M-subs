00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.170 
coins it's also a pretty good idea to
make<00:02:49.769> rare<00:02:50.250> open<00:02:50.549> rocket<00:02:50.760> packs<00:02:50.910> and<00:02:51.090> we're

set<00:03:22.230> very<00:03:22.560> worthwhile<00:03:22.859> for<00:03:23.069> me<00:03:23.370> i<00:03:23.549> only<00:03:23.910> spent

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
set very worthwhile for me i only spent

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.849

2500<00:03:24.569> coins<00:03:24.959> on<00:03:25.109> all<00:03:25.260> those<00:03:25.380> cards<00:03:25.709> when<00:03:25.829> I

2500 coins on all those cards when I

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:26.960 
2500 coins on all those cards when I
probably<00:03:26.100> would<00:03:26.280> have<00:03:26.340> spent<00:03:26.519> at<00:03:26.609> least<00:03:26.639> a

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
probably would have spent at least a

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.970 
probably would have spent at least a
thousand<00:03:27.329> on<00:03:27.420> each<00:03:27.569> one<00:03:27.750> individually<00:03:28.049> and

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
thousand on each one individually and

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.710 
thousand on each one individually and
even<00:03:29.190> if<00:03:29.280> i<00:03:29.310> only<00:03:29.489> spent<00:03:29.639> 700<00:03:30.239> individually

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
even if i only spent 700 individually

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.360 
even if i only spent 700 individually
that<00:03:30.870> would<00:03:30.989> still<00:03:31.260> be<00:03:31.440> more<00:03:31.709> than<00:03:32.160> i<00:03:32.190> would

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
that would still be more than i would

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.890 
that would still be more than i would
have<00:03:32.400> liked<00:03:32.609> to<00:03:32.700> spend<00:03:32.940> so<00:03:33.480> overall<00:03:33.750> i<00:03:33.870> think

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
have liked to spend so overall i think

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.900 
have liked to spend so overall i think
it's<00:03:34.139> very<00:03:34.200> very<00:03:34.560> worth<00:03:34.769> doing<00:03:35.010> these<00:03:35.250> again

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
it's very very worth doing these again

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.120 
it's very very worth doing these again
right<00:03:36.120> here<00:03:36.239> so<00:03:36.540> far<00:03:36.780> we're<00:03:37.079> getting<00:03:37.410> good<00:03:37.560> big

backfield set but he's not any free
agent<00:03:45.510> trophy<00:03:46.500> set<00:03:46.680> so<00:03:46.799> that's<00:03:46.919> a<00:03:46.980> little<00:03:47.040> bit

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.600 
he's in a trophy set so it's very nice
yeah<00:05:00.410> i<00:05:00.440> think<00:05:00.620> you<00:05:00.800> get<00:05:00.890> two<00:05:01.130> or<00:05:01.340> three

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
yeah i think you get two or three

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.400 
yeah i think you get two or three
bronzes<00:05:01.970> in<00:05:02.150> these<00:05:02.330> and<00:05:02.570> two<00:05:02.840> silvers<00:05:03.260> so

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
bronzes in these and two silvers so

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.800 
bronzes in these and two silvers so
pretty<00:05:04.400> much<00:05:04.520> if<00:05:04.580> you<00:05:04.820> wanted<00:05:04.970> to<00:05:05.240> you<00:05:05.720> could

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
pretty much if you wanted to you could

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.300 
pretty much if you wanted to you could
open<00:05:06.080> pro<00:05:06.380> packs<00:05:06.620> as<00:05:06.770> well<00:05:06.919> but<00:05:07.100> if<00:05:07.190> you're

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
open pro packs as well but if you're

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.760 
open pro packs as well but if you're
just<00:05:07.610> going<00:05:07.940> for<00:05:08.360> the<00:05:09.050> trophy<00:05:09.320> sets<00:05:09.620> i

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
just going for the trophy sets i

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.130 
just going for the trophy sets i
recommend<00:05:10.280> opening<00:05:11.120> the<00:05:11.510> rookie<00:05:11.750> packs<00:05:11.960> just

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
recommend opening the rookie packs just

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.540 
recommend opening the rookie packs just
because<00:05:12.410> they're<00:05:12.560> way<00:05:12.710> cheaper<00:05:12.740> than<00:05:13.130> propex

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
because they're way cheaper than propex

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.620 
because they're way cheaper than propex
but<00:05:13.760> you<00:05:13.910> know<00:05:14.000> if<00:05:14.090> you're<00:05:14.210> trying<00:05:14.360> to<00:05:14.450> ball

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
but you know if you're trying to ball

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.090 
but you know if you're trying to ball
out<00:05:14.660> just<00:05:15.380> definitely<00:05:15.620> make<00:05:15.800> sure<00:05:15.830> you're

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
out just definitely make sure you're

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.409 
out just definitely make sure you're
adding<00:05:16.340> all<00:05:16.460> these<00:05:16.550> obviously<00:05:17.060> you<00:05:17.120> guys<00:05:17.240> can

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
adding all these obviously you guys can

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:19.060 
adding all these obviously you guys can
see<00:05:17.540> every<00:05:17.840> single<00:05:18.110> silver<00:05:18.350> and<00:05:18.560> bronze<00:05:18.710> there

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
see every single silver and bronze there

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.159 
see every single silver and bronze there
was<00:05:19.790> actually<00:05:20.120> in<00:05:20.240> a<00:05:20.300> trophy<00:05:20.630> set<00:05:20.810> of<00:05:20.900> mind<00:05:21.050> so

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
was actually in a trophy set of mind so

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.050 
was actually in a trophy set of mind so
that<00:05:21.200> was<00:05:21.380> very<00:05:21.410> very<00:05:21.620> nice<00:05:21.890> and<00:05:22.100> I<00:05:22.580> added<00:05:22.850> them

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
that was very very nice and I added them

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.280 
that was very very nice and I added them
all<00:05:23.210> and<00:05:23.480> it's<00:05:23.630> going<00:05:23.720> to<00:05:23.780> make<00:05:23.900> it<00:05:24.020> a<00:05:24.080> lot

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
all and it's going to make it a lot

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.500 
all and it's going to make it a lot
easier<00:05:24.320> for<00:05:24.650> you<00:05:24.800> guys<00:05:24.860> if<00:05:25.070> you<00:05:25.160> just<00:05:25.340> open

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
easier for you guys if you just open

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.850 
easier for you guys if you just open
packs<00:05:26.510> i<00:05:26.690> would<00:05:26.840> say<00:05:27.050> in<00:05:27.169> general<00:05:27.200> but<00:05:27.680> rookie

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
packs i would say in general but rookie

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.470 
packs i would say in general but rookie
packs<00:05:28.190> are<00:05:28.370> probably<00:05:28.730> the<00:05:28.880> best<00:05:29.090> now<00:05:29.300> let's

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
packs are probably the best now let's

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.670 
packs are probably the best now let's
keep<00:05:29.720> it<00:05:29.840> going<00:05:29.870> what<00:05:30.260> are<00:05:30.320> we<00:05:30.410> gonna<00:05:30.500> get

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
keep it going what are we gonna get

keep it going what are we gonna get
kellen<00:05:31.340> winslow<00:05:31.479> not<00:05:32.479> the<00:05:32.660> best<00:05:32.870> pole<00:05:33.140> there<00:05:33.350> i

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
kellen winslow not the best pole there i

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.650 
kellen winslow not the best pole there i
think<00:05:33.680> he's<00:05:33.860> in<00:05:34.100> no<00:05:34.850> sets<00:05:35.180> so<00:05:35.419> that's<00:05:35.600> very

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
think he's in no sets so that's very

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.170

that I you know opening packs at this
point<00:05:45.500> in<00:05:45.650> the<00:05:45.740> game<00:05:45.770> is<00:05:46.070> probably<00:05:46.220> the<00:05:46.490> best

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
point in the game is probably the best

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:48.250 
point in the game is probably the best
idea<00:05:46.820> but<00:05:47.120> honestly<00:05:47.510> I<00:05:47.600> would<00:05:47.900> seriously

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
idea but honestly I would seriously

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.770

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
recommend opening rookie packs above all

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.350 
recommend opening rookie packs above all
else<00:05:50.840> even<00:05:51.440> though<00:05:51.640> you<00:05:52.640> know<00:05:52.729> you<00:05:53.120> can't

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
else even though you know you can't

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.400 
else even though you know you can't
really<00:05:53.450> buy<00:05:53.600> them<00:05:53.720> with<00:05:53.840> points<00:05:54.140> or<00:05:54.200> anything

really buy them with points or anything
like<00:05:54.440> that<00:05:54.560> I<00:05:54.919> wouldn't<00:05:55.220> worry<00:05:55.310> about<00:05:55.520> all

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
like that I wouldn't worry about all

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.190 
like that I wouldn't worry about all
about<00:05:55.820> that<00:05:55.940> we<00:05:56.120> got<00:05:56.240> a<00:05:56.270> Daniel<00:05:56.630> thao<00:05:56.810> Newsome

hope<00:06:07.460> he's<00:06:07.640> in<00:06:07.790> the<00:06:07.880> side<00:06:08.060> he's<00:06:08.210> probably<00:06:08.419> cost

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
hope he's in the side he's probably cost

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.810 
hope he's in the side he's probably cost
a<00:06:08.930> lot<00:06:09.110> looks<00:06:09.650> like<00:06:09.800> he<00:06:09.950> is<00:06:09.979> right<00:06:10.430> there<00:06:10.610> high

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
a lot looks like he is right there high

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.150 
a lot looks like he is right there high
overall<00:06:11.150> silver<00:06:11.600> in<00:06:12.260> the<00:06:12.320> trophy<00:06:12.710> set<00:06:12.919> and

overall silver in the trophy set and
another<00:06:13.430> set<00:06:13.669> so<00:06:13.790> he<00:06:13.880> probably<00:06:14.060> will<00:06:14.240> cost<00:06:14.450> a

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
another set so he probably will cost a

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.820 
another set so he probably will cost a
lot<00:06:14.690> but<00:06:14.750> I'm<00:06:14.960> gonna<00:06:15.110> need<00:06:15.290> them<00:06:15.440> so<00:06:15.560> i<00:06:15.590> might
