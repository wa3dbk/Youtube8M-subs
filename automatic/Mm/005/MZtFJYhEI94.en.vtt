00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
okay so now we're taking a look at some

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.670 
okay so now we're taking a look at some
of<00:00:03.060> the<00:00:03.149> animation<00:00:03.659> tool<00:00:03.870> so<00:00:04.170> you<00:00:04.230> have<00:00:04.410> an<00:00:04.560> L

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
of the animation tool so you have an L

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.780 
of the animation tool so you have an L
brush<00:00:06.080> I'm<00:00:07.080> saying<00:00:07.529> why<00:00:07.859> don't<00:00:08.069> suppose<00:00:08.490> we

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
brush I'm saying why don't suppose we

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.089 
brush I'm saying why don't suppose we
might<00:00:08.970> wanna<00:00:09.389> just<00:00:09.809> gonna<00:00:09.990> listen<00:00:10.380> to<00:00:10.590> that's

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
might wanna just gonna listen to that's

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.589 
might wanna just gonna listen to that's
the<00:00:11.309> audio<00:00:11.580> track<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:12.090> we're<00:00:12.210> going<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.389> try

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
the audio track that we're going to try

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.700 
the audio track that we're going to try
and<00:00:12.630> lip-sync<00:00:13.110> here<00:00:14.450> as<00:00:15.450> you<00:00:16.109> can<00:00:16.139> see<00:00:16.289> as<00:00:16.529> you

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
and lip-sync here as you can see as you

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.700 
and lip-sync here as you can see as you
as<00:00:16.920> you<00:00:17.750> scroll<00:00:18.750> through<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.050> timeline<00:00:19.289> you

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
as you scroll through the timeline you

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.710 
as you scroll through the timeline you
can<00:00:19.740> hear<00:00:20.250> audio<00:00:22.430> I'm<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.580> sounds<00:00:23.970> choppy<00:00:24.269> but

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
can hear audio I'm it sounds choppy but

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.359 
can hear audio I'm it sounds choppy but
that's<00:00:25.380> actually<00:00:25.560> what<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:25.920> want<00:00:26.160> because

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
that's actually what you want because

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.790 
that's actually what you want because
it's<00:00:26.670> precise<00:00:27.090> it's<00:00:27.449> exactly<00:00:27.960> what<00:00:28.289> audio<00:00:28.650> is

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
it's precise it's exactly what audio is

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.089 
it's precise it's exactly what audio is
being<00:00:29.039> played<00:00:29.340> on<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:30.269> particular<00:00:30.510> frame

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
being played on that particular frame

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.500 
being played on that particular frame
and<00:00:32.099> often<00:00:32.910> when<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.180> just<00:00:33.450> listen<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:34.340> 11

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
and often when you just listen to the 11

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.060 
and often when you just listen to the 11
frame<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.690> audio<00:00:37.050> becomes<00:00:37.530> much<00:00:37.739> more<00:00:37.920> obvious

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
frame of audio becomes much more obvious

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.940 
frame of audio becomes much more obvious
which<00:00:38.610> phoneme<00:00:39.090> target<00:00:39.719> really<00:00:40.710> ought<00:00:40.800> to

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
which phoneme target really ought to

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.729 
which phoneme target really ought to
belong<00:00:44.360> just<00:00:45.360> clicking<00:00:45.629> on<00:00:45.840> targets<00:00:46.320> here<00:00:46.559> as

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
belong just clicking on targets here as

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.130 
belong just clicking on targets here as
I<00:00:47.100> do<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:48.030> can<00:00:48.210> look<00:00:48.329> down<00:00:48.450> on<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.690> time-

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
I do that you can look down on the time-

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.729 
I do that you can look down on the time-
can<00:00:49.620> create

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:09.110 

they<00:00:56.739> saying<00:00:57.010> why<00:00:57.219> are<00:00:57.280> you<00:00:57.460> so<00:00:57.730> nervous

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.780 

so<00:01:09.750> as<00:01:10.110> I'm<00:01:10.320> laying<00:01:10.500> these<00:01:10.680> down<00:01:10.980> but<00:01:11.400> what's

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
so as I'm laying these down but what's

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.280 
so as I'm laying these down but what's
important<00:01:12.180> enough<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.420> any<00:01:12.630> time<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:12.990> could

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
important enough that any time you could

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.530 
important enough that any time you could
just<00:01:13.440> go<00:01:13.680> ahead<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:13.890> scroll<00:01:14.310> through<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
just go ahead and scroll through the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.840 
just go ahead and scroll through the
timeline<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.230> review<00:01:16.710> what<00:01:16.740> you've<00:01:17.040> done<00:01:17.220> but

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
timeline and review what you've done but

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.240 
timeline and review what you've done but
um<00:01:18.480> but<00:01:19.230> we're<00:01:19.350> just<00:01:19.500> gonna<00:01:19.620> cruise<00:01:19.920> through

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
um but we're just gonna cruise through

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.580 
um but we're just gonna cruise through
these<00:01:21.440> two<00:01:23.600> just<00:01:24.600> go<00:01:24.720> as<00:01:24.780> fast<00:01:24.990> as<00:01:25.200> we<00:01:25.320> can<00:01:25.530> and

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
these two just go as fast as we can and

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:33.110 
these two just go as fast as we can and
time<00:01:26.010> allowed<00:01:31.310> until<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.610> already<00:01:32.850> laid<00:01:32.970> down

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
time allowed until you already laid down

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.760 
time allowed until you already laid down
quite<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.510> few<00:01:33.690> key<00:01:33.900> frames<00:01:35.750> um<00:01:36.750> because<00:01:37.440> of<00:01:37.710> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
quite a few key frames um because of the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.890 
quite a few key frames um because of the
precision<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.730> you<00:01:38.940> that<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.270> hear<00:01:39.750> the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
precision that you that you hear the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.050 
precision that you that you hear the
audio<00:01:40.760> it's<00:01:43.280> gonna<00:01:44.280> be<00:01:44.400> surprised<00:01:44.730> when<00:01:44.880> you

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
audio it's gonna be surprised when you

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.700 
audio it's gonna be surprised when you
go<00:01:45.270> back<00:01:45.420> through<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:45.870> how<00:01:46.020> accurate<00:01:46.560> these

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
go back through this how accurate these

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.380 
go back through this how accurate these
keyframes<00:01:47.010> under<00:01:47.580> laying<00:01:47.790> down<00:01:50.180> it's<00:01:51.180> good

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
keyframes under laying down it's good

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:02.210 
keyframes under laying down it's good
now<00:01:51.480> let's<00:01:51.600> go<00:01:51.840> back

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.399

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
nervous you can also create a foot book

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.589 
nervous you can also create a foot book
which<00:02:17.519> we're<00:02:17.670> going<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.849> do<00:02:17.970> later<00:02:18.120> on<00:02:18.269> but

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
which we're going to do later on but

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.059 
which we're going to do later on but
first<00:02:18.810> we're<00:02:19.049> going<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.230> create<00:02:19.440> performance

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
first we're going to create performance

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.229 
first we're going to create performance
tracks<00:02:20.400> ah<00:02:21.260> now<00:02:22.260> for<00:02:22.680> those<00:02:22.849> have<00:02:23.849> you<00:02:24.060> look<00:02:24.209> at

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
tracks ah now for those have you look at

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.089 
tracks ah now for those have you look at
we've<00:02:24.450> set<00:02:24.780> up<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:25.049> performance<00:02:25.620> groups<00:02:25.890> here

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
we've set up to performance groups here

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.330 
we've set up to performance groups here
one<00:02:26.370> for<00:02:26.700> performing<00:02:27.629> eyebrows<00:02:28.010> where<00:02:29.010> each

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
one for performing eyebrows where each

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.130 
one for performing eyebrows where each
of<00:02:29.459> those<00:02:29.549> targets<00:02:30.000> are<00:02:30.120> mapped<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.599> a<00:02:30.720> corner

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
of those targets are mapped to a corner

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.050 
of those targets are mapped to a corner
of<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.290> screen<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.860> moving<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.580> monster<00:02:32.940> on

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
of the screen and moving the monster on

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.970 
of the screen and moving the monster on
blends<00:02:33.360> between<00:02:33.930> those<00:02:34.379> and<00:02:35.000> another<00:02:36.739> we<00:02:37.739> set

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
blends between those and another we set

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.770 
blends between those and another we set
up<00:02:38.099> for<00:02:38.280> doing<00:02:38.549> just<00:02:38.580> eye<00:02:39.060> blinks<00:02:39.510> where<00:02:39.720> you

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
up for doing just eye blinks where you

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.330 
up for doing just eye blinks where you
have<00:02:39.959> two<00:02:40.230> targets<00:02:40.410> that<00:02:40.709> are<00:02:40.769> the<00:02:40.920> same<00:02:41.129> at
