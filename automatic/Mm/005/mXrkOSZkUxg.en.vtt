00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.190
 moment of my mother killing three 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.550
 times in 30 seconds are a dead there 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.539

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.180

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:58.990
 We killed him, we killed him 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.450
 for this it is worth the return 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:05.970
 more someone has made me years here 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:10.500

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.090

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.920
 ok we kill this new man there is a 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.480
 little bit apart from how good having yes 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.950
 that the two have entered my mind to 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.690
 they mutually 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.920
 there is a mini rachita that is good for 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.920
 to be able to catch the rhythm of the game 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.270
 let's make part effect like the return there 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:45.310
 I think more or less perfect the 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.310
 departure 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.310
 OK 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.120
 worth you die effect streak of 5 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.860

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.860
 that dead one wants final worth 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.600

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.749
 perfect you have to keep looking at the 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.459
 distance because this is a moment of 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:35.090
 the remote 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.090

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.880
