the<00:01:54.599> reason<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.869> preferred<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:55.319> shoe<00:01:55.470> is

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
the reason I preferred this shoe is

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.169 
the reason I preferred this shoe is
simply<00:01:56.250> because<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.550> lot<00:01:56.789> of<00:01:56.819> those<00:01:56.970> leather

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
simply because a lot of those leather

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.749 
simply because a lot of those leather
quality<00:01:57.390> on<00:01:57.660> these<00:01:57.810> shoes<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.200> really<00:01:58.759> amazing

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
quality on these shoes is really amazing

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.309 
quality on these shoes is really amazing
to<00:01:59.789> be<00:02:00.030> honest<00:02:00.360> it's<00:02:00.479> probably<00:02:00.599> one<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:01.319 
to be honest it's probably one of the

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:03.740 
to be honest it's probably one of the
nicer<00:02:01.709> leather<00:02:01.979> shoes<00:02:02.369> period<00:02:03.360> forget<00:02:03.630> about

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
nicer leather shoes period forget about

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.990 
nicer leather shoes period forget about
for<00:02:04.440> speed<00:02:04.739> boots<00:02:04.950> it's<00:02:05.160> just<00:02:05.310> one<00:02:05.819> of<00:02:05.849> the

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
for speed boots it's just one of the

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.600 
for speed boots it's just one of the
nicer<00:02:06.330> leather<00:02:06.539> shoes<00:02:06.780> I've<00:02:06.929> ever<00:02:07.020> worn

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
nicer leather shoes I've ever worn

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.999 
nicer leather shoes I've ever worn
there's<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.700> lot<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:08.910> padding<00:02:09.390> but<00:02:09.830> it's<00:02:10.830> also

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
there's a lot of padding but it's also

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.619 
there's a lot of padding but it's also
probably<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.520> most<00:02:11.670> protective<00:02:12.239> lightweight

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
probably the most protective lightweight

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.360 
probably the most protective lightweight
shoes<00:02:12.870> over<00:02:13.170> eight<00:02:13.290> ounces<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:13.800> get<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.950> lot<00:02:14.220> of

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
shoes over eight ounces you get a lot of

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.940 
shoes over eight ounces you get a lot of

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
shoe I feel on synthetic version is

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.800 
shoe I feel on synthetic version is
pretty<00:02:17.130> much<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.490> same<00:02:17.670> shoe<00:02:17.940> there<00:02:18.600> are<00:02:18.690> some

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
pretty much the same shoe there are some

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.090 
pretty much the same shoe there are some
slight<00:02:18.930> differences<00:02:19.200> uh<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.920> get<00:02:20.070> a

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
slight differences uh you get a

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.830 
slight differences uh you get a
synthetic<00:02:20.310> leather<00:02:20.730> heel<00:02:21.060> liner

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
synthetic leather heel liner

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.410 
synthetic leather heel liner
instead<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.069> upper<00:02:23.310> is<00:02:23.489> predominantly

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
instead and the upper is predominantly

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.820 
instead and the upper is predominantly
synthetic<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:27.360> synthetic<00:02:27.840> is<00:02:28.019> pretty<00:02:28.680> good

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
synthetic the synthetic is pretty good

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.559 
synthetic the synthetic is pretty good
for<00:02:28.890> Puma<00:02:29.220> actually<00:02:29.700> it's<00:02:29.819> it's<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.120> softer

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
for Puma actually it's it's a softer

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.800 
for Puma actually it's it's a softer
more<00:02:30.750> leather<00:02:30.930> like<00:02:31.230> synthetic<00:02:31.440> I<00:02:31.800> find<00:02:32.099> then

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
more leather like synthetic I find then

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.140 
more leather like synthetic I find then
in<00:02:33.810> comparison<00:02:34.410> to<00:02:34.580> Nike<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.730> Adidas<00:02:35.760> is

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
in comparison to Nike and Adidas is

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.660 
in comparison to Nike and Adidas is
synthetics<00:02:36.800> it's<00:02:37.800> a<00:02:37.890> lot<00:02:38.040> softer<00:02:38.250> you're

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
synthetics it's a lot softer you're

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.800 
synthetics it's a lot softer you're
going<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.849> see<00:02:38.940> it's<00:02:39.060> going<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.269> bend<00:02:39.510> pretty

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
going to see it's going to bend pretty

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.610 
going to see it's going to bend pretty
easily<00:02:40.019> and<00:02:41.540> it<00:02:42.540> makes<00:02:42.750> for<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.959> really<00:02:43.410> good

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
easily and it makes for a really good

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.220 
easily and it makes for a really good
feel<00:02:44.580> on<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.910> ball<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.090> found<00:02:45.420> there<00:02:45.959> is<00:02:46.080> some

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
feel on the ball I found there is some

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.400 
feel on the ball I found there is some
grip<00:02:46.440> on<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.830> on<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.489> on<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:48.810> finish<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:49.260> guess

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
grip on the on the on the finish I guess

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.630 
grip on the on the on the finish I guess
so<00:02:49.560> there<00:02:49.680> is<00:02:49.769> some<00:02:49.920> grip<00:02:50.069> on<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.310> ball<00:02:50.430> if<00:02:50.549> you

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
so there is some grip on the ball if you

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.400 
so there is some grip on the ball if you
do<00:02:50.730> like<00:02:50.910> that<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.780> again<00:02:52.019> you<00:02:52.140> get<00:02:52.230> that

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
do like that and again you get that

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.289 
do like that and again you get that
protective<00:02:52.950> extra<00:02:53.459> protection<00:02:53.910> because<00:02:54.180> of

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
protective extra protection because of

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.770 
protective extra protection because of
the<00:02:54.620> lace<00:02:55.620> cover<00:02:56.150> same<00:02:57.150> thing<00:02:57.390> you<00:02:57.540> get<00:02:57.630> that

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
the lace cover same thing you get that

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.490 
the lace cover same thing you get that
same<00:02:58.560> carbon<00:02:59.400> fiber<00:02:59.579> insert<00:03:00.319> anatomical<00:03:01.319> toe

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
same carbon fiber insert anatomical toe

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.400 
same weight you're getting a suede heel
liner<00:03:40.769> you're<00:03:41.459> getting<00:03:41.700> a<00:03:42.090> thicker<00:03:42.930> soleplate

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410
