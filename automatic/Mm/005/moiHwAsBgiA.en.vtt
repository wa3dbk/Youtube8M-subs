00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.280
 hello my name is a fictional beginning of the video you'll see is the 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.939
 fruit of fifteen years of generous research from which mike 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:08.780
 leigh of the greenhouse have developed the world's first helmet against choice 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.739
 between enthusiasts in the end 

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:14.409
 capital rotation no brain injury because any impact to the head 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:17.699
 no rotation of the latter believes something 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.939
 and this causes serious irreversible damage or blood vessels and 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:21.810
 your neurons 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.849
 according to this survey 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:26.929
 so far no case this was designed to minimize the forces of 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:31.429
 rotation not all minds but the superskin laser go from a membrane 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:34.400
 lubricated attached to the outside of the cap 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.880
 the runway helmet at the moment of impact which reduces the rotations of the brain 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.070
 in all cases what are tested by dropping them from several meters of 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.560
 high on an anvil acquney tnt 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.630
 reuters this is the best way to stimulate brain impact during a 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.210
 accident the act 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.140
 and the rotation that follows 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.330
 and in this video you will see the comparison between a lazer helmet 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.720
 standard without membrane and the same lazer helmet with superskin membrane 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.720
 thanks to which the rotation greatly reduces the bill 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.590
 on this picture look at the base of the helmet falling sideways with the head 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.100
 artificial inside I do not know 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.390
 sizes as if this post you double cap and the artificial head are going 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.390
 to be dropped on the anvil bates laments foundry 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.930
 the green cross at the base of the helmets and blow makes it possible to visualize clearly 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.990
 that rotation click here 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.720
 I believe if a standard helmet without real membrane 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.400
 when he falls he carries the anvil and his rotation continues even after having 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.720
 rebounded against it in the same way that the head bounces after 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.720
 its impact on the balance what against what article 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.970
 no but now here is a superskin helmet misguided as the 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.970
 rotation is greatly reduced and the stormy match 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.960
 keystone this difference is even more obvious when comparing the 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.960
 two rabassa side-by-side helmets 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:17.429
 the Swiss is even clearer with features on pious images 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.139
 indeed indeed effect except the effects on the brain are shown on these 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:26.969
 diagrams 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:30.279
 observe the haemorrhage and the moral damage not on the left image 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:33.679
 phenomenon absent on right image

 senior louis professor cnrs at the university of strasbourg for 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.199
 examine these texts and certify that the laser helmets are persuaded to reduce 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:45.069
 60% in the rotation I'm beaten and I'm not that increases the protection of 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.500
 your head and your brain by almost 70% compared to the standard helmet 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.879
 since November 28 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.879
 the first gasquet against rotational shock in the world 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:58.049
 will there be a single reason to wear another general
