00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
bringing it to you on launch day what is

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:15.890 
bringing it to you on launch day what is
that

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
that

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.970 
that
that's<00:00:16.080> sli<00:00:16.859> performance<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.880> two<00:00:18.150> gtx<00:00:19.020> 770<00:00:19.680> s

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
that's sli performance of two gtx 770 s

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.269 
that's sli performance of two gtx 770 s
now<00:00:20.220> we<00:00:20.850> took<00:00:21.029> these<00:00:21.210> cards<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.810> one<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:23.039> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
now we took these cards and one is the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.890 
now we took these cards and one is the
reference<00:00:23.580> base<00:00:23.820> card<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.330> one<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.869> a

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
reference base card and one is the a

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.320 
reference base card and one is the a
zeus<00:00:25.289> direct<00:00:25.830> cu2<00:00:26.400> card<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.939> we<00:00:27.119> basically

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
zeus direct cu2 card and we basically

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.419 
zeus direct cu2 card and we basically
clock<00:00:27.779> these<00:00:27.960> cards<00:00:28.260> exactly<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.859> same<00:00:29.099> using

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
clock these cards exactly the same using

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.910 
clock these cards exactly the same using
GPU<00:00:29.939> tweak<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.480> then<00:00:30.929> we<00:00:31.019> began<00:00:31.320> all<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.830> our

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
GPU tweak and then we began all of our

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.100 
GPU tweak and then we began all of our
tests<00:00:32.279> we<00:00:32.430> also<00:00:32.610> tested<00:00:33.120> these<00:00:33.239> cards<00:00:33.630> against

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
tests we also tested these cards against

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.100 
tests we also tested these cards against
a<00:00:34.200> bunch<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.680> others<00:00:35.040> we<00:00:35.219> test<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.610> against<00:00:35.910> the

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
a bunch of others we test it against the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.470 
a bunch of others we test it against the
7970<00:00:37.110> against<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.980> titan<00:00:38.370> against<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.969> 780

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
7970 against the titan against the 780

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.170 
7970 against the titan against the 780
just<00:00:40.110> all<00:00:40.379> kinds<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:40.950> good<00:00:41.160> stuff<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:42.030> with

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
just all kinds of good stuff so with

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.180 
just all kinds of good stuff so with
that<00:00:42.329> said<00:00:42.629> let's<00:00:43.110> actually<00:00:43.320> jump<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:43.980> and

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
that said let's actually jump in and

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.529 
that said let's actually jump in and
let's<00:00:44.460> take<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.700> look<00:00:45.000> at<00:00:45.149> some<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.420> the

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
let's take a look at some of the

00:00:45.539 --> 00:01:52.930 
let's take a look at some of the
performance

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.270 

hi<00:01:53.480> folks<00:01:53.840> so<00:01:54.140> there<00:01:54.380> you<00:01:54.500> have<00:01:54.530> it<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:55.010> quick

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
hi folks so there you have it the quick

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.270 
hi folks so there you have it the quick
down<00:01:55.730> and<00:01:55.760> dirty<00:01:56.150> of<00:01:56.630> SLI<00:01:57.110> performance<00:01:57.950> of<00:01:58.160> the

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
down and dirty of SLI performance of the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.690 
down and dirty of SLI performance of the
new<00:01:58.430> geforce<00:01:59.090> gtx<00:01:59.570> 770<00:02:00.410> now<00:02:01.130> you<00:02:01.190> guys<00:02:01.400> can<00:02:01.670> see

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
new geforce gtx 770 now you guys can see

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.790 
new geforce gtx 770 now you guys can see
from<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.180> scores<00:02:02.480> that<00:02:02.720> these<00:02:02.900> cards<00:02:03.170> really

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
from the scores that these cards really

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.970 
from the scores that these cards really
really<00:02:04.340> kick<00:02:04.700> ass<00:02:04.940> in<00:02:05.390> an<00:02:05.690> SLI<00:02:06.080> configuration

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
really kick ass in an SLI configuration

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.660 
really kick ass in an SLI configuration
I<00:02:07.130> mean<00:02:07.610> look<00:02:07.820> a<00:02:08.000> Titan<00:02:08.450> cost<00:02:08.979> $1000<00:02:09.979> a<00:02:10.160> pair<00:02:10.640> of

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
I mean look a Titan cost $1000 a pair of

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.940 
I mean look a Titan cost $1000 a pair of
these<00:02:10.880> cards<00:02:11.240> cost<00:02:11.480> 800<00:02:12.020> dollars<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:12.440> you<00:02:12.770> get

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
these cards cost 800 dollars and you get

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.370 
these cards cost 800 dollars and you get
superior<00:02:13.690> performance<00:02:14.690> I<00:02:14.810> mean<00:02:14.960> that's

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
superior performance I mean that's

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.190 
superior performance I mean that's
something<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.860> really<00:02:16.070> consider<00:02:16.280> now<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.630> GTX

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
something to really consider now the GTX

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.530 
something to really consider now the GTX
780<00:02:18.740> it<00:02:19.040> cost<00:02:19.430> about<00:02:19.700> six<00:02:20.000> hundred<00:02:20.060> forty<00:02:20.480> nine

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
780 it cost about six hundred forty nine

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.480 
780 it cost about six hundred forty nine
dollars<00:02:21.080> but<00:02:21.230> obviously<00:02:21.620> this<00:02:21.890> still<00:02:22.160> totally

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
dollars but obviously this still totally

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.090 
dollars but obviously this still totally
blows<00:02:23.090> that<00:02:23.570> away<00:02:23.870> what<00:02:24.410> I'd<00:02:24.500> really<00:02:24.770> like<00:02:24.950> to

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
blows that away what I'd really like to

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.920 
blows that away what I'd really like to
know<00:02:25.130> from<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:25.460> guys<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:26.060> you<00:02:26.330> guys<00:02:26.510> feel<00:02:26.900> that

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
know from you guys is you guys feel that

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.320 
know from you guys is you guys feel that
it's<00:02:27.320> worth<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.800> extra<00:02:27.920> money<00:02:28.190> and<00:02:28.550> all<00:02:29.030> the

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
it's worth the extra money and all the

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.270 
it's worth the extra money and all the
extra<00:02:29.630> power<00:02:29.810> that<00:02:30.170> it<00:02:30.290> requires<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:30.770> actually

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
extra power that it requires to actually

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.060 
extra power that it requires to actually
use<00:02:31.520> an<00:02:31.700> SL<00:02:31.970> configuration<00:02:32.930> or<00:02:33.110> would<00:02:33.890> you

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
use an SL configuration or would you

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.010 
use an SL configuration or would you
prefer<00:02:34.100> just<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.760> go<00:02:34.880> ahead<00:02:35.000> and<00:02:35.270> buy<00:02:35.420> a<00:02:35.660> really

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
prefer just to go ahead and buy a really

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.770 
prefer just to go ahead and buy a really
high-end<00:02:36.620> card<00:02:37.250> now<00:02:37.790> one<00:02:38.060> way<00:02:38.210> to<00:02:38.240> break<00:02:38.570> this

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
high-end card now one way to break this

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.140 
high-end card now one way to break this
down<00:02:38.990> as<00:02:39.170> you<00:02:39.320> guys<00:02:39.470> all<00:02:39.830> know<00:02:40.070> that<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.580> GTX

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
down as you guys all know that the GTX

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.470 
down as you guys all know that the GTX
690<00:02:41.780> is<00:02:41.870> basically<00:02:42.470> two<00:02:42.950> 680<00:02:43.700> s<00:02:43.820> on<00:02:43.970> a<00:02:44.000> single

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
690 is basically two 680 s on a single

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.530 
690 is basically two 680 s on a single
PCB<00:02:45.140> and<00:02:45.380> since<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.040> new<00:02:46.160> 770<00:02:47.030> is<00:02:47.090> nothing<00:02:47.420> but

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
PCB and since the new 770 is nothing but

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.170 
PCB and since the new 770 is nothing but
a<00:02:47.600> souped-up<00:02:48.140> 680<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:49.160> cards<00:02:49.490> performance<00:02:50.060> is

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
a souped-up 680 the cards performance is

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.450 
a souped-up 680 the cards performance is
actually<00:02:50.390> quite<00:02:50.930> incredible<00:02:51.590> so<00:02:52.130> there<00:02:52.310> you
