00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.940
 water is an essential element in our 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.059
 life - in games 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.120
 because it is the known aquatic phases in the 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.359
 games can be cute music 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.810
 cool but at the end of the day is a 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.300
 really water with games never matched 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.170
 much advertising ecco the dolphin by 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.640
 who is not a creditor 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.170
 if you are a good end then binds the 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.630
 Water is cool, little game that I have. 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.550
 talking is after all how do I imitate one 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.550
 so annan dolphin 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.270
 so in this video here 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.690
 let's talk about some games with phases 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.879
 aquatic species, whether legal or 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.030
 those who do you punched me in the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.000
 middle of the tv to the boss 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.000
 remembering that the phases are not even one 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.370
 specific order hockey then a 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.090
 stuck in the water and follow me the good ones. 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.930
 beginning with a simple homage is 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:07.350
 tribute to the aquatic phases of the franchise 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.470
 mere slug what we call even today metal 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.590
 slug the aquatic phases incredibly 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.990
 of the games of this franchise are legal 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.420
 You can fly submarines, you can not. 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.720
 dies drowned frenetic show yesterday 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.540
 honor are crazy even you should be 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.509
 finding bizarre I speak well of fados 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.479
 aquatic but calm there there comes the part 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.090
 disgusting boy and let's talk about this game that 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.990
 I so love the playstation which the dino 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.290
 2 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.299
 this game is sensational - in the 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.250
 Water, because you're in a rhythm. 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.470
 frantic in the game 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.270
 there goes to the water that sucks and has 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.320
 aquatic dinosaurs that are 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.140
 difficult 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.110
 it's all slow type slow motion knows 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.270
 without doubt the most annoying part of the game and 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.340
 when you go out it is a relief not put 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.610
 but anyway let's go back a little in time 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.000
 little not enough on the little nintendinho 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.460
 the game of ninja turtles as it is and 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.710
 thing you do not have a game you think 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.650
 it will be easy that an aquatic phase 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.890
 Because you're a turtle, right? 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.810
 hard you can not touch anything and 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.620
 not to mention the character anything 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.030
 The way the troublesome phase is 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.200
 complicated and traumatized a lot 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:31.260
 people and it is logical that the 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.630
 famous mario games nintendo i 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.360
 could stay on the side and how practically 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.550
 everything game has its aquatic phase 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.459
 it is worth highlighting the two main 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.480
 the first is the little nintendinho and the super 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.730
 mario world 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.970
 the nintendinho has a song 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.760
 calm and not so difficult but in this 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.220
 game that left me pissed is the phase that 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:58.530
 come then with these damn fish 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:01.410
 flying fucking shit and in the super mario world 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.630
 the aquatic phases also have songs 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.300
 cool just not so cool 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.580
 so everyone has to kill without pity and 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.700
 no mercy who played this game cable to 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.820
 knows how the phases of water require 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:20.250
 patience and care other than eyes to 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:23.790
 Much and since I'm talking let's talk 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.880
 of Mario 64 has phase of inheriting docs 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.360
 who is somewhat hated by the staff but by 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.370
 have a lot of music so this one 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.319
 goes by 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.319
 [Music] 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.950
 And you know why it 's easier to play. 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.700
 in these phases with the small mario because 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.200
 he is marine ranga and speaking of 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.659
 nintendo 64 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.569
 both games of the zelda ocarina franchise 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:57.720
 we have a problem 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.340
 with the damn water in the times but this 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.340
 Who will ever vent? 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.609
 It's tomÃ¡s del terri show because they do. 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.549
 Hate it because it's the water times of 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:10.829
 sky 64 is really a cup oder 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.989
 cariri time of the team that sucks 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:15.480
 because seriously who did this 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.940
 temple and what a confusing time it was 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.889
 the architect of this shit but relaxes it 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.000
 great bay while the Amazons but not 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.490
 Stay behind 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.020
 the time is also extremely confusing and 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.970
 Do you still have to worry about the 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.190
 play time it because time runs out 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.050
 you die ford whole mouth and so it is 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:37.560
 considered by many to be the worst 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:39.900
 All and last game my friend is not 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.900
 last but not least we are talking about 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.090
 sonic our seeing how I got angry with 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.550
 this aquatic phase of sonic 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.830
 in fact I can until today the stage is 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.780
 Pretty bitch full of things for you. 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.880
 stay watching and everything else 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.880
 that's when you realize if you died drowned 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.720
 [Music] 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.140
 You have to keep catching the bubbles. 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:14.620
 air that childhood trauma 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:17.290
 but then there's a big fat Italian mustache 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:20.380
 can swim without catching because I consumed 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.300
 can not too is an injustice is 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.670
 no wonder that nowadays 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.020
 good part of the new sonic games are 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.250
 he falls in the water he dies 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.890
 instantly 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:32.130
 He got so tired of drowning that he got 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.130
 if 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.860
 [Music] 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:45.110
 so this is personal this was the stage to 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:48.020
 I see the most important ones and I know that 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.780

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.570

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.910
 put on the list but how I like the 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.920
 water phases donkey kong I just 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.530
 asking on twitter if people liked 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.810
 and a good part, so I do not even 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.880
 concluded that he even follows me in 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.160
 twitter is the only clothes to tape 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.560
 you can comment on the subject with 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.520
 games you picked up on the water went up 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.060
