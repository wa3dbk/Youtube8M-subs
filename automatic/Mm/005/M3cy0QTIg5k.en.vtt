I did use a primer a mineral veil and
everything<00:04:28.960> but<00:04:29.259> I<00:04:29.349> like<00:04:29.530> the<00:04:29.650> way<00:04:29.740> that<00:04:29.919> the

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
everything but I like the way that the

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
spray feels on my face so this is like

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.860 
spray feels on my face so this is like
the<00:04:33.669> best<00:04:33.819> lighting<00:04:34.090> that<00:04:34.270> I<00:04:34.360> could<00:04:34.539> get<00:04:34.690> right

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
the best lighting that I could get right

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.390 
the best lighting that I could get right
here<00:04:35.139> is<00:04:35.289> I'm<00:04:35.530> kind<00:04:35.740> of<00:04:35.770> shaking<00:04:36.129> the<00:04:36.280> camera

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.490 
here is I'm kind of shaking the camera
around<00:04:36.699> but<00:04:37.500> this<00:04:38.500> is<00:04:38.740> what<00:04:38.919> my<00:04:39.039> face<00:04:39.370> usually

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
around but this is what my face usually

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.260 
around but this is what my face usually
finishes<00:04:41.500> off<00:04:41.889> looking<00:04:42.340> like<00:04:42.370> the<00:04:43.060> bare
