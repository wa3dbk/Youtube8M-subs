00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:10.930 

I<00:00:08.619> actually<00:00:09.619> think<00:00:09.920> of<00:00:10.250> fragrance<00:00:10.760> as

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:10.940 
I actually think of fragrance as

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.970 
I actually think of fragrance as
importantly<00:00:11.570> as<00:00:11.780> I<00:00:11.930> do<00:00:11.990> all<00:00:12.559> the<00:00:12.860> other

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
importantly as I do all the other

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.609 
importantly as I do all the other
accessories<00:00:13.639> like<00:00:14.000> my<00:00:14.119> bag<00:00:14.420> or<00:00:14.809> my<00:00:15.020> shoes<00:00:15.289> are

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:15.619 
accessories like my bag or my shoes are

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.170 
accessories like my bag or my shoes are
actually<00:00:15.949> my<00:00:16.100> nail<00:00:16.250> polish<00:00:16.430> I'm<00:00:16.730> really<00:00:16.970> into

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
actually my nail polish I'm really into

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.850 
actually my nail polish I'm really into
nail-polish<00:00:17.480> so<00:00:17.900> I<00:00:18.110> think<00:00:18.440> it's<00:00:18.620> a<00:00:18.710> really

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:18.860 
nail-polish so I think it's a really

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.410 
nail-polish so I think it's a really
great<00:00:19.160> finishing<00:00:19.640> touch<00:00:19.850> and<00:00:19.880> I<00:00:20.150> think<00:00:20.330> it

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
great finishing touch and I think it

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.030 
great finishing touch and I think it
kind<00:00:20.660> of<00:00:20.690> makes<00:00:20.900> you<00:00:21.020> feel<00:00:21.170> complete<00:00:21.530> I<00:00:21.710> think

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:22.040 
kind of makes you feel complete I think

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.860 
kind of makes you feel complete I think
for<00:00:22.220> me<00:00:22.340> it<00:00:22.760> definitely<00:00:22.910> completes<00:00:23.570> the<00:00:23.720> whole

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:23.870 
for me it definitely completes the whole

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.260 
for me it definitely completes the whole
look<00:00:24.080> I<00:00:24.410> think<00:00:24.620> once<00:00:24.770> you're<00:00:24.920> out<00:00:25.010> the<00:00:25.160> door

look I think once you're out the door

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.880 
look I think once you're out the door
that's<00:00:26.270> the<00:00:26.660> smell<00:00:27.289> that<00:00:27.500> you're<00:00:27.650> wearing

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
that's the smell that you're wearing

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.560 
that's the smell that you're wearing
that<00:00:28.070> day<00:00:28.369> I<00:00:28.400> think<00:00:28.640> defines<00:00:29.000> who<00:00:29.270> you<00:00:29.330> are

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.219 

I<00:01:09.009> mean<00:01:09.729> I<00:01:09.789> think<00:01:09.820> beauty<00:01:10.240> and<00:01:10.570> fashion<00:01:10.780> and

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
I mean I think beauty and fashion and

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.170 
I mean I think beauty and fashion and
fragrance<00:01:11.740> are<00:01:11.920> all<00:01:12.009> intrinsically<00:01:12.610> linked<00:01:13.090> I

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
fragrance are all intrinsically linked I

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.569 
fragrance are all intrinsically linked I
think<00:01:13.479> it<00:01:13.570> goes<00:01:13.750> hand<00:01:13.990> in<00:01:14.110> hand<00:01:14.170> I<00:01:14.469> think<00:01:14.799> you

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
think it goes hand in hand I think you

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:18.240 
think it goes hand in hand I think you
know<00:01:15.700> fashion<00:01:16.119> you<00:01:17.079> need<00:01:17.320> fragance<00:01:17.890> in<00:01:18.039> order

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
know fashion you need fragance in order

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.490 
know fashion you need fragance in order
to<00:01:18.399> complete<00:01:18.579> the<00:01:18.880> overall<00:01:19.570> look<00:01:19.840> you<00:01:20.380> know<00:01:20.439> I

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
to complete the overall look you know I

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.410 
to complete the overall look you know I
think<00:01:20.619> fashion<00:01:20.950> it's<00:01:21.520> just<00:01:21.759> about<00:01:22.000> making

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
think fashion it's just about making

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.300 
think fashion it's just about making
yourself<00:01:22.869> a<00:01:22.960> beautiful<00:01:23.500> and<00:01:23.740> comfortable<00:01:23.920> and

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
yourself a beautiful and comfortable and

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.029 
yourself a beautiful and comfortable and
confident<00:01:24.789> so<00:01:25.390> I<00:01:25.750> think<00:01:25.869> fragrance<00:01:26.439> it's<00:01:26.770> the

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
confident so I think fragrance it's the

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:28.710 
confident so I think fragrance it's the
same<00:01:27.220> thing<00:01:27.280> a<00:01:27.700> beautiful<00:01:28.299> scent<00:01:28.569> is

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
same thing a beautiful scent is

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.559 
same thing a beautiful scent is

a very unique style I think the best
thing<00:02:24.280> though<00:02:24.609> is<00:02:24.760> that<00:02:24.790> if<00:02:25.000> everyone<00:02:25.239> can

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450
