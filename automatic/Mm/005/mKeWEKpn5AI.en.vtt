alright<00:00:00.750> so<00:00:00.989> reassembling<00:00:02.179> get<00:00:03.179> the

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
alright so reassembling get the

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.630 
alright so reassembling get the
motherboard<00:00:03.899> in<00:00:04.080> this<00:00:04.230> way<00:00:04.520> doesn't<00:00:05.520> really

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
motherboard in this way doesn't really

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.419 
motherboard in this way doesn't really
matter<00:00:05.960> which<00:00:06.960> way<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.290> airport<00:00:07.770> cables<00:00:08.160> go

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
matter which way the airport cables go

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.150 
matter which way the airport cables go
but<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.420> doll<00:00:09.630> card<00:00:09.929> is<00:00:10.110> actually<00:00:10.590> labeled

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
but the doll card is actually labeled

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.539 
but the doll card is actually labeled
white<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.090> black<00:00:12.410> so<00:00:13.410> we'll<00:00:13.620> just<00:00:13.650> go<00:00:14.400> with

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
white and black so we'll just go with

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.650 
white and black so we'll just go with
what<00:00:14.670> they<00:00:14.849> have<00:00:15.269> on<00:00:15.509> here<00:00:17.180> one<00:00:18.180> black<00:00:18.480> these

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
what they have on here one black these

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.269 
what they have on here one black these
can<00:00:18.810> be<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:18.930> bit<00:00:19.080> fiddly<00:00:19.380> especially<00:00:20.100> if<00:00:20.189> they

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
can be a bit fiddly especially if they

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.910 
can be a bit fiddly especially if they
get<00:00:20.430> damaged<00:00:20.970> with<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.390> can<00:00:21.510> be<00:00:21.600> easily<00:00:22.470> fixed

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
get damaged with it can be easily fixed

course your epc will turn to toast and

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.290 
course your epc will turn to toast and

will be useless connect the LVDS cable
all<00:02:13.300> right<00:02:13.510> and<00:02:13.780> then<00:02:14.349> we<00:02:14.500> can<00:02:14.680> get<00:02:14.860> back<00:02:15.040> to

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
all right and then we can get back to

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.990 
all right and then we can get back to
putting<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.819> top<00:02:16.630> case<00:02:16.900> on<00:02:17.110> it<00:02:17.230> now<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.730> top

putting the top case on it now the top

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.470 
putting the top case on it now the top
case<00:02:19.270> make<00:02:19.870> sure<00:02:20.110> that<00:02:20.319> your<00:02:21.239> thermal<00:02:22.239> pads

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
case make sure that your thermal pads

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.660 
case make sure that your thermal pads
are<00:02:22.750> somewhere<00:02:23.050> as<00:02:24.010> you<00:02:24.100> can<00:02:24.190> see<00:02:24.370> I've<00:02:24.489> got

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
are somewhere as you can see I've got

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.509 
are somewhere as you can see I've got
two<00:02:25.360> missing<00:02:25.510> there<00:02:25.810> one<00:02:26.200> on<00:02:26.230> there<00:02:26.380> I've<00:02:27.280> got

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
two missing there one on there I've got

two on the top case in one missing as

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.930 
two on the top case in one missing as
long<00:02:30.010> as<00:02:30.040> they're<00:02:30.220> all<00:02:30.310> there<00:02:30.489> you<00:02:30.519> should<00:02:30.849> be

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
long as they're all there you should be

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.120 
long as they're all there you should be
okay<00:02:32.760> so<00:02:33.760> just<00:02:33.880> pop<00:02:34.150> that<00:02:34.180> back<00:02:34.540> on<00:02:34.980> move<00:02:35.980> to
