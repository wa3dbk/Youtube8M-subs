map<00:02:12.420> that's<00:02:12.690> right<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:13.350> what<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.620> does<00:02:13.740> is

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
map that's right and so what it does is

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.740 
map that's right and so what it does is
it<00:02:13.980> tracks<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.370> GPS<00:02:14.850> you<00:02:15.090> also<00:02:15.270> uses<00:02:15.570> Wi-Fi

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750
