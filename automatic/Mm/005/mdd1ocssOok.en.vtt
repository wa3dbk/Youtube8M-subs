00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:19.110
 at this moment the vision although in this 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:23.300
 I have been representing a few moments 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.300

 and street said candles says with inn 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:44.129
 because Isabella Queen asked me to 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.719
 second then me at the moment that I 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.760
 was naming knights of the table 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.399

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.609
 put without the sword here and that I get up 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.620
 untimely and almost called and leaves me 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:58.079
 like all 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.600
 the fact is that he asked me to ask 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.940
 this is true why because 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.040
 suddenly he says because to me to me because he 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.110
 they realized that I had real blood 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.810
 effectively real and authentic me 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.850
 they drew blood they said no 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.380

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.930
 I've always been very laid 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.670

 plant 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.840
 such is the most commented subject of this 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.840
 land 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.790
 I am actually here 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.790
 again with this great group whose 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.590
 success is today a cluster or whatever 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.870
 what you need and what you have in the box 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.910
 famous disc and you all know us 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.490
 they are the loops but the best is not 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.030
 they knew there's a female version here 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:11.370
 in London 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:13.569
 they are the cheers and these are the 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.670
 unique 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:22.190
 this one was very salty 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:24.700
 and many times they come here in london to the 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.700
 policemen 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.750
 surely dispatch the and the 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:45.770
 they discovered if these are gentlemen 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:49.450
 of the round table but why not 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.450
 guess from this ask 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:59.230
 good if you allow me auditor and ford is 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.230
 that's why it's standard 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:15.990
 they married 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:15.990
 if royalty or royalty 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:31.870
 they understood the talk go well 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.870
 I started drinking bbc from london 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:40.979
 and everything that starts unfortunately 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.840
 has to end and I wanted a great 

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:44.789
 final a graffiti with my friends from 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.729
 English and I wanted him to introduce me in his 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:52.830
 yellow submarine and here is 

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:54.870
 effectively be sure the yellow 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.490
 submarine because the original background 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:58.590
 marked to the fair so we can 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:01.289
 interpret but good is a place is 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:03.389
 to make the grand finale because they passed 

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:05.160
 you already know how to know 

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:07.050
 all london all england without having 

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.800
 to leave the block and if you 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.990
 it looks good 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:14.840
