00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.430
 hello everyone so we are at alibert 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.040
 So one of the partners of millet 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.929
 expedition project we were together 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.969
 today so all of 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.799
 partners to study the files of 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.380
 millet shipment project 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.330
 so we spent the day globally 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.550
 study about sixty files 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:28.340
 it comes out today that we have 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.429
 pre-selected for 2015 12 files and 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.080
 so these files will be coming soon 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:35.900
 featured on facebook to participate 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.879
 to the public vote 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:43.930
 after what was not very clear it is 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:46.339
 that there is a very small budget all alone 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.670
 by the trend of the records of this 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:50.750
 year then the records of which he 62.6 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.530
 that we received it's still a 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.710
 great diversity 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:58.070
 we have kayak we have climbing 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.940
 we had to ski downhill skiing at 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.850
 Greenland 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.960
 we have mountaineering of course we have 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.560
 proposals to the 30 go tower we have 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.600
 proposals also in india 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.550
 so we have several activities of the zones 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.920
 geographical 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.120
 today that we do not necessarily have 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.580
 in a very common way of the same eye 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.230
 side shipping but what is the 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.600
 more important I would say it's the 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.830
 accompanying dimension what we are going 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.540
 can that all of 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.310
 partners will be able to bring to these 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:33.170
 expeditions and that's really advice 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:35.300
 material advice 1 remember that we 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.190
 has partners like polartec we have 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.810
 partners like a bo 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.640
 partners like kata dean who are going 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.280
 can help expeditions to choose 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.770
 their best the best material 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.200
 to go expert and then to 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.520
 accompanying training with 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.650
 technical partners like 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.540
 allibert technical partners 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.640
 like the gmhm the military group of 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.200
 high mountain that will make the 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.930
 almost customized training in 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.510
 according to the needs of training experiences 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.760
 GPS mapping conduct a 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.140
 experience 8 of a team acclimatization 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.440
 etc., etc 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.350
 so it's really this dimension 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.260
 coaching advice today who 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.660
 do the mx b and I think a 2015 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.180
 will still be a 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.180
 beautiful harvest of crises 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.620
 so that's both the heart of the 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.710
 mark because today we have 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.500
 technical advisers who are are 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.970
 experts in terms of exposure but the 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.350
 wish in any case of thousands to 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.040
 through millet expedition project 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:46.580
 it's to open to give the possibility 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.830
 to young practitioners to go in 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.810
 expedition to realize their dreams of exp 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.360
 and to have support in 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.190
 technical support from 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.360
 millet brand but also 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.860
 other partners to try to 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.760
 push back a little bit their limits and 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.010
 it's perfectly in adequacy 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.160
 today with the slogan of the brand 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.410
 in the middle who is daring in big or by 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.360
 gold in its English version to say 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.970
 the adventure and go on an adventure 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.070
 with the support of the mirex pichonne 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.440
 project is good and technical 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.480
 traditional and of which there are games 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.130
 would have asked the links 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.500
 eskimo so that's six 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.950
 minutes before the port point there 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.250
 down and the photos it's super nice 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.250
 series
