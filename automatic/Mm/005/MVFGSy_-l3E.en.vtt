00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.809
 Hello guys 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.750
 in this the flar this week the accelerant 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.890
 it is available for the boss and pretorium 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.230
 it is free 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.609
 He accelerates your iphone, I'll show you 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.769
 you here 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.930
 after installing your poison settings 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.240
 huh 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.769
 with adjustments you will go down and look for 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.530
 I will speed you up 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.270
 here you enable the first option and 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.690
 Look how quickly it got faster. 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.290
 close watch as it closes very fast 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.390
 just open a also open application 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.840
 quickly and I'll open it here in case 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.230
 Look, he's opened very fast. 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.949
 It's very interesting, I'll open it here. 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.890
 another application eg ps book 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.140
 it has opened very fast 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.340
 ok and close the app it also 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.439
 close very fast 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.270
 here you can choose the type of 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.990
 animation that you want 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.750
 For example, it accelerates 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:20.340
 if you put for example that from here 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:22.860
 a speed getting too slow too slow 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.830
 I prefer ferrari, I think the most 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.290
 fast and for me it's more useful because 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.420
 much faster and I can access 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.979
 applications in such a way that 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:39.299
 snapshot I practically come here 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:40.860
 ferrari is that you have some options that 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.930
 You, for example, sometimes do not want 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.909
 close an application fast eg 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.950
 when you close the application you do not 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.500
 want it to close fast as you can 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.950
 disable using this menu here say 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.619
 good 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.579
 I'll speed it up, okay, here you go. 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.140
 very cool 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.759
