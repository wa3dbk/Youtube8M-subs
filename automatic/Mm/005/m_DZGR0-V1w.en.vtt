colored extensions for the dragon fangs

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.399 
colored extensions for the dragon fangs

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.100 
and then again I got the hands from a
different<00:01:04.559> kit<00:01:04.970> I<00:01:05.970> didn't<00:01:06.450> do<00:01:06.540> any<00:01:06.750> joint

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180

this<00:01:30.600> crotch<00:01:30.990> piece<00:01:31.320> here<00:01:31.560> because

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
this crotch piece here because

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.300 
this crotch piece here because
originally<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.329> kit<00:01:33.509> came<00:01:33.750> with<00:01:34.310> actually

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
originally the kit came with actually

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.960 
originally the kit came with actually
the<00:01:35.490> whole<00:01:36.020> legs<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:37.920> crotch<00:01:38.220> piece<00:01:38.520> and

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
the whole legs and this crotch piece and

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.300 
the whole legs and this crotch piece and
a<00:01:39.210> few<00:01:39.930> other<00:01:40.079> parts<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.560> hands<00:01:40.950> were<00:01:41.130> all

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
a few other parts the hands were all

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.399 
a few other parts the hands were all
from<00:01:41.640> high-grade<00:01:42.180> Shindong<00:01:42.930> Gundam<00:01:43.290> which

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
from high-grade Shindong Gundam which

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.609 
from high-grade Shindong Gundam which
came<00:01:43.649> out<00:01:43.799> two<00:01:44.070> years<00:01:44.149> prior<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.509> kit<00:01:45.780> and

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
came out two years prior to this kit and

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.219 
came out two years prior to this kit and
I<00:01:47.280> guess<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.970> was<00:01:48.030> just<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.420> moment<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.810> laziness

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
I guess it was just a moment of laziness

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.289 
I guess it was just a moment of laziness
on<00:01:49.530> Bandai<00:01:49.860> sport<00:01:50.220> but<00:01:50.430> Shin<00:01:50.939> long<00:01:51.090> and

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
on Bandai sport but Shin long and

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.580 
on Bandai sport but Shin long and
something<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.750> talk<00:01:51.930> about<00:01:51.990> two<00:01:52.470> different

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
something to talk about two different

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.980 
something to talk about two different
crotch<00:01:52.979> pieces<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.850> had<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.420> scratch<00:01:54.689> build

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
crotch pieces so I had to scratch build

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.170 
crotch pieces so I had to scratch build
an<00:01:55.140> anime<00:01:55.530> accurate<00:01:56.070> one<00:01:57.049> and<00:01:58.490> that's<00:01:59.490> pretty

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
an anime accurate one and that's pretty

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.330 
an anime accurate one and that's pretty
much<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.810> added<00:02:01.469> some<00:02:01.619> little<00:02:01.799> vents<00:02:02.219> right

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
much it added some little vents right

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.389 
much it added some little vents right
here<00:02:02.670> on<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.880> sides<00:02:03.149> or<00:02:03.810> moored<00:02:04.710> accurately<00:02:05.369> I

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
here on the sides or moored accurately I

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
there as well I was thinking about doing

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.229 
there as well I was thinking about doing
on<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:40.780> shoulders<00:03:41.200> but<00:03:41.760> there's<00:03:42.760> really<00:03:43.000> not

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
on the shoulders but there's really not

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.970 
on the shoulders but there's really not
that<00:03:43.299> much<00:03:43.660> room<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:44.109> do<00:03:44.230> plot<00:03:44.500> plating<00:03:44.859> up

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
that much room to do plot plating up

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.090 
that much room to do plot plating up
under<00:03:45.250> there<00:03:45.430> and<00:03:46.680> not<00:03:47.680> sure<00:03:47.859> it<00:03:47.950> would<00:03:48.069> have

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
under there and not sure it would have

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.330 
under there and not sure it would have
been<00:03:48.310> all<00:03:49.000> that<00:03:49.209> good<00:03:49.660> anyway<00:03:50.019> so<00:03:50.200> all<00:03:51.010> I<00:03:51.069> did

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
been all that good anyway so all I did

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.160 
been all that good anyway so all I did
was<00:03:51.549> add<00:03:51.700> a<00:03:51.730> little<00:03:51.940> aftermarket<00:03:52.630> thruster

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
was add a little aftermarket thruster

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.809 
was add a little aftermarket thruster
right<00:03:53.350> there<00:03:53.560> up<00:03:53.829> under<00:03:54.130> the<00:03:54.280> shoulder<00:03:54.819> armor

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
right there up under the shoulder armor

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.430 
right there up under the shoulder armor
and<00:03:57.819> that's<00:03:58.269> pretty<00:03:58.630> much<00:03:58.840> it

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
and that's pretty much it

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.860 
and that's pretty much it

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
stripped the paint off and honestly I

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.039 
stripped the paint off and honestly I
don't<00:04:10.239> think<00:04:10.359> I'm<00:04:10.599> ever<00:04:10.720> going<00:04:10.870> to<00:04:10.930> do

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
don't think I'm ever going to do

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.620 
don't think I'm ever going to do
anything<00:04:11.079> with<00:04:11.530> it<00:04:11.650> so<00:04:11.680> I<00:04:12.069> used<00:04:12.639> gpo<00:04:13.389> ones

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
anything with it so I used gpo ones

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.680 
anything with it so I used gpo ones

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
two imposable hands and I was supposed

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.970 
two imposable hands and I was supposed
to<00:04:24.940> have<00:04:25.120> two<00:04:25.419> outstretched<00:04:26.260> hands<00:04:26.590> but

what happened to the other one oh well
for<00:04:32.920> the<00:04:33.130> beam<00:04:33.250> trident<00:04:34.080> I<00:04:35.100> basically<00:04:36.100> just

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
for the beam trident I basically just

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.390 
for the beam trident I basically just
painted<00:04:36.820> the<00:04:36.880> shaft<00:04:37.150> gray<00:04:37.780> and<00:04:38.080> then<00:04:38.920> went<00:04:39.280> in

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
painted the shaft gray and then went in

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.150 
painted the shaft gray and then went in
with<00:04:39.640> a<00:04:39.910> little<00:04:40.450> bit<00:04:40.570> of<00:04:40.690> a<00:04:40.870> gradient<00:04:41.230> on<00:04:41.680> the

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
with a little bit of a gradient on the

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.840 
with a little bit of a gradient on the
blades

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
blades

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.560 
blades
I<00:04:43.020> left<00:04:44.020> the<00:04:44.230> ends<00:04:44.650> clear<00:04:45.010> now<00:04:45.520> what<00:04:46.240> I<00:04:46.300> did<00:04:46.540> was

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
I left the ends clear now what I did was

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:47.970 
I left the ends clear now what I did was
I<00:04:46.810> went<00:04:47.020> up<00:04:47.110> about<00:04:47.350> half<00:04:47.650> way<00:04:47.950> with

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
I went up about half way with

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.820 
I went up about half way with
fluorescent<00:04:48.940> green<00:04:49.030> and<00:04:49.450> then<00:04:50.200> just<00:04:50.560> did

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
fluorescent green and then just did

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.890 
fluorescent green and then just did
these<00:04:51.130> little<00:04:51.340> base<00:04:51.670> spiky<00:04:52.450> things<00:04:52.660> down<00:04:52.870> here

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
these little base spiky things down here

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.670 
these little base spiky things down here
with<00:04:53.290> a<00:04:53.320> white<00:04:54.150> so<00:04:55.150> you<00:04:55.180> kind<00:04:55.690> of<00:04:55.780> a<00:04:55.900> gradient

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
with a white so you kind of a gradient

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.620 
with a white so you kind of a gradient

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
energy effect on the beam tried it there

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.620 
energy effect on the beam tried it there
and<00:04:59.500> the<00:05:00.220> gpo<00:05:00.610> one<00:05:00.850> hands<00:05:01.150> hold<00:05:01.360> the<00:05:01.480> beam

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
and the gpo one hands hold the beam

the<00:05:05.920> dragonfangs<00:05:06.520> still<00:05:06.760> have<00:05:06.910> a<00:05:06.940> bit<00:05:07.120> of

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
the dragonfangs still have a bit of

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.140 
the dragonfangs still have a bit of
weight<00:05:07.360> issues<00:05:07.750> but<00:05:08.070> then<00:05:09.070> again<00:05:09.220> I'm<00:05:10.090> not

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
weight issues but then again I'm not

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.270 
weight issues but then again I'm not
really<00:05:10.510> going<00:05:10.600> to<00:05:10.660> be<00:05:10.720> posing<00:05:11.080> it<00:05:11.380> all<00:05:11.980> that

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
really going to be posing it all that

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.530 
really going to be posing it all that
much<00:05:12.540> these<00:05:13.540> thingies<00:05:13.870> still<00:05:14.200> open<00:05:14.500> up<00:05:14.650> I

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
much these thingies still open up I

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.790 
much these thingies still open up I
painted<00:05:16.540> on<00:05:16.660> the<00:05:16.780> inside<00:05:17.140> of<00:05:17.230> the<00:05:17.290> dragon<00:05:17.620> Fang

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
painted on the inside of the dragon Fang

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.050 
painted on the inside of the dragon Fang
with<00:05:18.010> some<00:05:18.220> black<00:05:18.940> and<00:05:19.270> some<00:05:19.420> red<00:05:20.730> so<00:05:21.730> just<00:05:22.000> a

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
with some black and some red so just a

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.250 
with some black and some red so just a
little<00:05:22.270> bit<00:05:22.390> of<00:05:22.480> detailing<00:05:22.870> there<00:05:25.140> and<00:05:26.140> I

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
little bit of detailing there and I

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.230 
little bit of detailing there and I
guess<00:05:26.530> that's<00:05:26.800> just<00:05:27.070> about<00:05:27.280> it<00:05:27.550> I<00:05:27.850> can't

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
guess that's just about it I can't

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.180 
guess that's just about it I can't
really<00:05:28.360> think<00:05:28.630> of<00:05:28.750> anything<00:05:28.990> else<00:05:29.260> to<00:05:29.380> really

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
really think of anything else to really

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.290 
really think of anything else to really
show<00:05:30.790> off<00:05:31.560> I<00:05:32.700> guess<00:05:33.700> if<00:05:33.850> you<00:05:33.940> have<00:05:34.120> any

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
show off I guess if you have any

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.520 
show off I guess if you have any
questions<00:05:34.810> you<00:05:35.020> can<00:05:35.110> just<00:05:35.440> ask<00:05:36.250> away<00:05:36.490> or<00:05:37.530> more

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
questions you can just ask away or more

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:39.690 
questions you can just ask away or more
than<00:05:38.620> likely<00:05:38.650> I'm<00:05:39.100> out<00:05:39.220> of<00:05:39.310> an<00:05:39.430> hour<00:05:39.520> already

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
work-in-progress video but I guess that

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.920 
work-in-progress video but I guess that
about<00:05:43.990> does<00:05:44.320> it<00:05:44.380> for<00:05:44.530> this<00:05:45.310> little<00:05:45.930> show-off
