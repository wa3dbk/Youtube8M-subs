that we will have a nice bond and so I
look<00:01:10.260> like<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.470> young<00:01:10.860> for<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.549> role<00:01:14.360> I'm<00:01:15.360> kind

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
look like a young for this role I'm kind

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.690 
look like a young for this role I'm kind
of<00:01:15.659> one<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.960> first<00:01:16.170> things<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.530> we<00:01:16.680> do<00:01:17.490> is

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
of one of the first things that we do is

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.280 
of one of the first things that we do is
that<00:01:17.729> we<00:01:17.850> just<00:01:17.939> kind<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.390> see<00:01:18.600> how<00:01:18.900> they<00:01:19.140> are

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
that we just kind of see how they are

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.609 
that we just kind of see how they are
fitting<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.880> my<00:01:21.030> ear<00:01:21.299> right<00:01:21.479> here<00:01:21.780> Todd

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
fitting this is my ear right here Todd

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.560 
fitting this is my ear right here Todd
actually<00:01:22.979> made<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.159> mold<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.759> my<00:01:23.850> ear<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.450> then

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
actually made a mold of my ear and then

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.050 
actually made a mold of my ear and then
actually<00:01:24.869> sculpted<00:01:25.680> kind<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.759> show<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.000> a

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
actually sculpted kind of show you a

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.140 
actually sculpted kind of show you a
little<00:01:27.299> example<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.869> what<00:01:28.080> did<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:29.460> same<00:01:29.729> ear

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
little example of what did the same ear

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.480 
little example of what did the same ear
probably<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.470> just<00:01:31.740> took<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.340> then

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
probably is it just took that and then

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.929 
probably is it just took that and then
he<00:01:32.579> did<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.240> then<00:01:34.400> created<00:01:35.400> another<00:01:35.640> ear

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
he did that and then created another ear

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.300 
he did that and then created another ear
on<00:01:36.119> top<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.840> my<00:01:37.020> ear<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.619> be<00:01:37.770> able<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.130> make<00:01:38.250> it

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
on top of my ear to be able to make it

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.149 
on top of my ear to be able to make it
so<00:01:38.520> it's<00:01:38.759> fit<00:01:39.119> perfectly<00:01:39.810> was<00:01:40.500> just<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.740> latex

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
so it's fit perfectly was just a latex

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.660 
so it's fit perfectly was just a latex
build<00:01:41.490> up<00:01:41.640> your<00:01:41.670> very<00:01:42.060> simple<00:01:42.540> process<00:01:43.670> since

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
build up your very simple process since

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.010 
build up your very simple process since
yours<00:01:45.000> don't<00:01:45.149> really<00:01:45.479> have<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.659> much

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
yours don't really have that much

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.250 
yours don't really have that much
texture<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.710> them

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
texture to them

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.840 
texture to them
we<00:01:48.100> didn't<00:01:48.340> need<00:01:48.490> to<00:01:48.700> do<00:01:48.910> a<00:01:48.940> detailed<00:01:50.640> mold<00:01:51.640> to

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
we didn't need to do a detailed mold to

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.580 
we didn't need to do a detailed mold to
cast<00:01:52.060> it<00:01:52.270> so<00:01:52.630> we<00:01:52.720> just<00:01:52.870> kind<00:01:53.080> of<00:01:53.140> put<00:01:53.320> them<00:01:53.410> on

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
cast it so we just kind of put them on

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.030 
cast it so we just kind of put them on
just<00:01:54.070> to<00:01:54.190> make<00:01:54.490> sure<00:01:54.520> they<00:01:55.090> fit<00:01:55.420> nice<00:01:56.040> it's

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
just to make sure they fit nice it's

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
outside so now we're dry in the middle

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.110 
outside so now we're dry in the middle
there<00:02:51.190> so<00:02:51.670> let's<00:02:53.370> know<00:02:54.370> i'm<00:02:54.430> just<00:02:54.700> like<00:02:54.820> you're

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
trickiest part for me this part of his

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.610 
trickiest part for me this part of his
ear<00:03:04.209> fits<00:03:05.140> right<00:03:06.100> in<00:03:06.400> in<00:03:07.110> here<00:03:08.110> so<00:03:08.320> it<00:03:08.410> has<00:03:08.590> to

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
ear fits right in in here so it has to

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.930 
ear fits right in in here so it has to
fit<00:03:09.520> perfectly<00:03:10.330> in<00:03:10.810> there<00:03:11.430> before<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.790> rest

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
fit perfectly in there before the rest

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.740 
fit perfectly in there before the rest
of<00:03:13.120> it<00:03:13.950> can<00:03:14.950> come<00:03:15.130> on<00:03:17.700> I'll<00:03:18.700> just<00:03:18.760> okay<00:03:19.270> so<00:03:19.540> I

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
of it can come on I'll just okay so I

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.330 
of it can come on I'll just okay so I
think<00:03:19.900> we<00:03:20.110> got<00:03:20.140> one<00:03:20.500> year<00:03:20.709> on<00:03:20.740> now<00:03:21.190> we're

going to just be taking some of its

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.570 
going to just be taking some of its
bondo<00:03:34.480> kind<00:03:35.410> of<00:03:35.530> textured<00:03:36.070> stuff<00:03:36.370> that<00:03:36.519> will

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
bondo kind of textured stuff that will

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.949 
bondo kind of textured stuff that will
actually<00:03:36.730> go<00:03:36.970> around<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.269> edges<00:03:37.450> and<00:03:37.660> just

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
actually go around the edges and just

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
look a little more more natural so I'll

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:49.940 
look a little more more natural so I'll
just<00:03:44.050> be<00:03:44.380> kind<00:03:44.560> of<00:03:44.680> a<00:03:45.390> little<00:03:46.390> more

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.460 

I'm<00:03:50.400> just<00:03:50.550> going<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:50.790> kind<00:03:51.000> of<00:03:51.090> go<00:03:51.959> along<00:03:52.110> the

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
I'm just going to kind of go along the

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:59.790 
I'm just going to kind of go along the
cracks<00:03:52.890> here<00:03:53.840> sealing<00:03:54.840> it<00:03:54.989> all<00:03:55.110> up

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.500 

and<00:04:00.160> he'll<00:04:00.340> use<00:04:00.370> a<00:04:00.580> stipple<00:04:01.090> sponge<00:04:01.120> too

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
and he'll use a stipple sponge too

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:14.260 
and he'll use a stipple sponge too
blend<00:04:03.170> it<00:04:03.349> out

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.440 

and<00:04:14.780> that<00:04:14.960> kind<00:04:15.200> of<00:04:15.260> gives<00:04:15.470> it<00:04:15.590> more<00:04:15.800> of<00:04:15.860> a

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
and that kind of gives it more of a

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.760 
and that kind of gives it more of a
natural<00:04:17.450> effect<00:04:17.959> now<00:04:18.080> it's<00:04:18.200> going<00:04:18.350> on<00:04:18.500> white

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:18.770 
natural effect now it's going on white

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:23.710 
natural effect now it's going on white
but<00:04:19.040> it<00:04:19.130> will<00:04:19.220> actually<00:04:19.420> go<00:04:20.920> clear<00:04:22.270> and<00:04:23.270> then<00:04:23.690> a

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
but it will actually go clear and then a

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.050 
but it will actually go clear and then a
Bielecki<00:04:23.990> remains<00:04:24.410> sticky<00:04:24.860> but<00:04:25.070> then<00:04:25.310> i<00:04:25.610> will

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
Bielecki remains sticky but then i will

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:34.890 
Bielecki remains sticky but then i will
powder<00:04:26.450> that<00:04:26.870> down
