00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:55.820 

like<00:01:47.479> so<00:01:48.590> I'm<00:01:49.590> going<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.159> repeat<00:01:53.509> like<00:01:54.509> that

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
like so I'm going to repeat like that

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.610 
like so I'm going to repeat like that
and<00:01:56.820> then<00:01:57.120> this<00:01:57.300> one<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.600> going<00:01:58.050> to<00:01:58.110> finish<00:01:58.350> up

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
and then this one is going to finish up

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.190 
and then this one is going to finish up
our<00:01:58.770> box<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.550> I'm<00:01:59.670> going<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.940> put<00:02:00.000> when<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:00.870> say

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
put a he so there and I'm going to fold

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.650

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.570 

so<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.720> know<00:02:13.080> how<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.260> fold<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.710> box<00:02:13.920> top<00:02:14.280> and

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
so you know how you fold a box top and

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.010 
so you know how you fold a box top and
when<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.820> don't<00:02:14.940> have<00:02:15.090> packing<00:02:15.510> tape<00:02:15.750> and

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
when you don't have packing tape and

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.230 
when you don't have packing tape and
that<00:02:16.860> makes<00:02:17.160> kind<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.730> center<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.090> our

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
that makes kind of the center of our

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.810 
that makes kind of the center of our
flower<00:02:18.570> now<00:02:19.320> if<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.740> want<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.310> can<00:02:20.490> stop

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
flower now if you want you can stop

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.860 
flower now if you want you can stop
right<00:02:21.120> there<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:21.690> can<00:02:21.990> just<00:02:22.170> kind<00:02:22.440> of

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
right there and you can just kind of

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.420 
right there and you can just kind of
fluff<00:02:24.870> up<00:02:25.020> your<00:02:25.080> pedals<00:02:25.560> maybe<00:02:25.920> fold<00:02:26.250> them

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
fluff up your pedals maybe fold them

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:36.650 
fluff up your pedals maybe fold them
over<00:02:26.520> a<00:02:26.700> little<00:02:26.970> bit<00:02:27.240> like<00:02:27.570> this<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:36.180> me<00:02:36.360> to

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
over a little bit like this to me to

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.640 
over a little bit like this to me to
give<00:02:36.840> it<00:02:36.959> some<00:02:37.200> dimension<00:02:38.480> and<00:02:39.480> then<00:02:40.320> you<00:02:40.440> just

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
give it some dimension and then you just

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.310 
give it some dimension and then you just
stick<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:40.950> brad<00:02:41.400> or<00:02:41.790> like<00:02:42.630> a<00:02:42.660> button<00:02:43.110> in<00:02:43.230> the

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
stick a brad or like a button in the

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.480 
stick a brad or like a button in the
center<00:02:43.740> but<00:02:44.459> I<00:02:44.850> think<00:02:45.510> it's<00:02:46.020> even<00:02:46.260> cuter<00:02:46.770> if

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
center but I think it's even cuter if

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.940 
center but I think it's even cuter if
you<00:02:47.970> do<00:02:48.120> another<00:02:48.420> layer<00:02:48.660> so<00:02:49.530> I'm<00:02:49.650> going<00:02:49.709> to<00:02:49.830> do

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
you do another layer so I'm going to do

00:02:49.950 --> 00:03:13.460 
you do another layer so I'm going to do
that<00:02:50.100> really<00:02:50.310> quick<00:02:50.610> just<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:51.000> same

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.900 

and<00:03:14.470> then<00:03:14.620> I'm<00:03:14.770> going<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:15.010> be<00:03:15.130> the<00:03:15.250> same<00:03:15.520> thing

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
and then I'm going to be the same thing

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.740 
and then I'm going to be the same thing
where<00:03:16.150> I<00:03:16.210> kind<00:03:16.510> of<00:03:16.720> and<00:03:18.000> crease<00:03:19.000> those<00:03:19.420> petals

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
where I kind of and crease those petals

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.520 
where I kind of and crease those petals
so<00:03:20.110> that<00:03:20.260> I<00:03:20.290> get<00:03:20.410> some<00:03:21.840> dimension<00:03:22.840> going<00:03:23.080> and

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
so that I get some dimension going and

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:34.790 
so that I get some dimension going and
the<00:03:23.680> yeah<00:03:24.600> top<00:03:25.800> glower<00:03:29.610> I've<00:03:30.610> got<00:03:30.940> a<00:03:31.230> glue<00:03:32.230> dot
