paper and put it in little slots but

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.620 
paper and put it in little slots but
these<00:03:20.709> are<00:03:20.829> much<00:03:20.980> better<00:03:21.160> than<00:03:21.280> that<00:03:22.769> yellow

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
these are much better than that yellow

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.500 
these are much better than that yellow
red<00:03:25.630> and<00:03:25.660> green<00:03:26.079> there's<00:03:26.350> charge<00:03:26.709> and<00:03:26.920> Chuck<00:03:27.190> a

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:41.370 

sumo<00:03:35.769> brother<00:03:39.329> so<00:03:40.329> obviously<00:03:41.170> there's

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
sumo brother so obviously there's

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.400 
sumo brother so obviously there's
players<00:03:41.920> for<00:03:43.350> all<00:03:44.350> four<00:03:44.920> Mario's<00:03:46.200> so<00:03:47.200> it's<00:03:47.350> a

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
players for all four Mario's so it's a

four-player game whatever this is wary

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.620 
four-player game whatever this is wary
so<00:03:53.530> that's<00:03:53.680> neato<00:03:57.209> always<00:03:58.209> like<00:03:58.329> to<00:03:58.480> see

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
so that's neato always like to see

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.599 
so that's neato always like to see
plastic<00:03:59.049> instead<00:03:59.709> of<00:04:00.930> cardboard<00:04:01.930> and<00:04:02.609> here's

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
plastic instead of cardboard and here's

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:08.190 
plastic instead of cardboard and here's
just<00:04:03.819> a<00:04:03.910> parts<00:04:04.269> reference<00:04:04.720> board<00:04:06.000> for<00:04:07.000> all<00:04:07.989> the

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
just a parts reference board for all the

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.759 
just a parts reference board for all the
stuff<00:04:08.440> that<00:04:08.470> is<00:04:08.739> included<00:04:09.630> and<00:04:10.630> there's<00:04:11.590> like

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.180 

so<00:04:21.570> if<00:04:21.660> it's<00:04:21.810> in<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:21.989> bag<00:04:24.860> let's<00:04:25.860> look<00:04:25.980> at<00:04:26.130> the

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
so if it's in the bag let's look at the

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.090 
so if it's in the bag let's look at the
game<00:04:26.220> boards<00:04:27.260> and<00:04:28.260> again<00:04:28.500> it<00:04:28.590> just<00:04:28.620> comes<00:04:28.950> with

game boards and again it just comes with

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.950 
game boards and again it just comes with
a<00:04:29.160> standard<00:04:29.580> bored<00:04:29.880> and<00:04:30.480> then<00:04:31.470> you<00:04:31.500> overlay

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
a standard bored and then you overlay

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.830 
a standard bored and then you overlay
these<00:04:33.960> boards<00:04:34.410> on<00:04:34.590> top<00:04:34.880> and<00:04:35.880> they're<00:04:36.540> front

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
these boards on top and they're front

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.060 
these boards on top and they're front
and<00:04:36.960> back<00:04:37.520> full-color<00:04:39.020> game<00:04:40.020> boards<00:04:40.380> so<00:04:40.860> this

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
and back full-color game boards so this

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.110 
and back full-color game boards so this
looks<00:04:41.280> like<00:04:41.610> a<00:04:42.320> simple<00:04:43.460> piece<00:04:44.460> moving<00:04:44.910> game
