limit rule well it is not Ruben and
confirmed<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.599> my<00:02:12.870> assumption<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:13.500> Damian

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
confirmed is my assumption that Damian

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.650 
confirmed is my assumption that Damian
was<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.340> third<00:02:14.610> trainer<00:02:14.940> who<00:02:15.150> lived<00:02:15.450> in

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
Pallet Town and selected Charmander as a

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.400 
Pallet Town and selected Charmander as a
starter<00:02:18.239> the<00:02:18.360> proof<00:02:18.599> for<00:02:18.840> this<00:02:18.959> is<00:02:19.230> that

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
starter the proof for this is that

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.410 
starter the proof for this is that
Charmander<00:02:20.010> was<00:02:20.190> very<00:02:20.459> weak<00:02:20.730> but<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.269> could

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
Charmander was very weak but it could

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.940 
Charmander was very weak but it could

depending<00:05:17.120> on<00:05:17.210> your<00:05:17.390> interpretation<00:05:17.570> this<00:05:18.410> is

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
depending on your interpretation this is

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.440 
depending on your interpretation this is
really<00:05:18.830> confusing<00:05:19.010> based<00:05:19.550> on<00:05:19.760> names<00:05:20.150> and

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
really confusing based on names and

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.170 
really confusing based on names and
priests<00:05:20.960> select<00:05:21.320> Pokemon<00:05:21.920> and<00:05:22.130> the<00:05:22.760> different

the<00:05:26.630> games<00:05:26.840> never<00:05:27.380> showed<00:05:27.710> up<00:05:27.980> again<00:05:28.220> this

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
the games never showed up again this

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.420 
the games never showed up again this
isn't<00:05:28.790> tributed<00:05:29.570> to<00:05:29.810> the<00:05:30.020> limit<00:05:30.560> of<00:05:30.680> memory<00:05:31.190> so

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
isn't tributed to the limit of memory so

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.010 
isn't tributed to the limit of memory so
it's<00:05:31.610> no<00:05:31.730> surprise<00:05:31.910> that<00:05:32.150> there<00:05:32.420> was<00:05:32.600> no<00:05:32.780> third

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
it's no surprise that there was no third

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.710 
it's no surprise that there was no third
trainer<00:05:33.410> class<00:05:33.890> selectable<00:05:34.460> however<00:05:34.940> it<00:05:35.180> does

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
link the possibility of both the mystery

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.420 
link the possibility of both the mystery
woman<00:05:38.870> and<00:05:39.050> the<00:05:39.290> cut<00:05:39.470> trainer<00:05:39.770> class<00:05:40.070> being

one in the same and that is why the
mystery<00:05:42.860> woman<00:05:43.100> was<00:05:43.400> cut<00:05:43.640> as<00:05:43.760> well<00:05:43.940> this<00:05:44.180> was

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:44.420 
mystery woman was cut as well this was

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.270 
mystery woman was cut as well this was
more<00:05:44.660> likely<00:05:44.870> done<00:05:45.260> to<00:05:45.410> prevent<00:05:45.740> any<00:05:45.920> kind<00:05:46.130> of

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
more likely done to prevent any kind of

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.550 
more likely done to prevent any kind of
confusion<00:05:46.820> among<00:05:47.120> children<00:05:47.480> and<00:05:47.870> it<00:05:48.200> was<00:05:48.320> done

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
confusion among children and it was done

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.710 
confusion among children and it was done
so<00:05:48.920> early<00:05:49.460> that<00:05:49.490> not<00:05:49.940> even<00:05:50.240> a<00:05:50.330> single<00:05:50.510> episode

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
so early that not even a single episode

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.010 
so early that not even a single episode
not<00:05:51.470> even<00:05:51.860> the<00:05:52.160> pilot<00:05:52.460> episode<00:05:52.880> features<00:05:53.810> her

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
not even the pilot episode features her

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.790 
not even the pilot episode features her
once

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
once

once
so<00:05:55.100> to<00:05:55.400> summarize<00:05:55.820> the<00:05:56.000> theory<00:05:56.330> the<00:05:56.540> mystery

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
so to summarize the theory the mystery
