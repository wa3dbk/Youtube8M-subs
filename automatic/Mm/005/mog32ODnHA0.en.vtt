hair<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.289> hurt<00:00:52.530> by<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.710> end<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.010> day<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.789> I

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
hair and hurt by the end of the day so I

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.970 
hair and hurt by the end of the day so I
just<00:00:53.969> try<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.120> pace<00:00:54.570> them<00:00:54.750> out<00:00:54.870> equally<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.620> so

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
just try to pace them out equally and so

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.830 
just try to pace them out equally and so
I<00:00:56.010> put<00:00:56.190> my<00:00:56.309> hair<00:00:56.520> up<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.910> then<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.329> clipped<00:00:57.629> them

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
I put my hair up and then I clipped them

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.139 
I put my hair up and then I clipped them
in<00:00:58.050> X<00:00:58.980> then<00:00:59.219> just<00:00:59.399> kind<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.640> brush<00:00:59.850> them<00:01:00.059> out

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.729 
in X then just kind of brush them out
just<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.570> they<00:01:00.660> blend<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.079> little<00:01:01.109> bit<00:01:01.500> better

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
just so they blend a little bit better

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.439 
just so they blend a little bit better
