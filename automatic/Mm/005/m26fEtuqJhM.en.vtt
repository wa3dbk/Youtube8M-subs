if<00:03:00.950> you've<00:03:01.489> got<00:03:01.640> to<00:03:01.700> super<00:03:02.090> skinny<00:03:02.330> foot<00:03:02.660> yep

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
if you've got to super skinny foot yep

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.140 
if you've got to super skinny foot yep
which<00:03:04.160> offered<00:03:04.459> a<00:03:04.489> little<00:03:04.700> bit<00:03:04.790> of<00:03:04.880> a<00:03:04.910> skinny

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
which offered a little bit of a skinny

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.090 
which offered a little bit of a skinny
foot<00:03:05.390> then

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
foot then

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.280 
foot then
it's<00:03:06.400> probably<00:03:06.850> not<00:03:07.450> narrowing<00:03:07.810> up<00:03:08.050> through

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
it's probably not narrowing up through

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.750 
it's probably not narrowing up through
the<00:03:08.410> forefoot<00:03:08.800> so<00:03:09.070> you<00:03:09.160> do<00:03:09.280> have<00:03:09.430> to<00:03:09.580> tighten

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
the forefoot so you do have to tighten

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.860 
the forefoot so you do have to tighten
it<00:03:09.910> up<00:03:09.970> a<00:03:10.090> little<00:03:10.210> bit<00:03:10.360> so<00:03:10.480> if<00:03:10.600> you've<00:03:10.690> got<00:03:10.750> a

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
it up a little bit so if you've got a

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.260 
it up a little bit so if you've got a
super<00:03:11.140> skinny<00:03:11.350> foot<00:03:11.670> possibly<00:03:12.670> look<00:03:13.060> for

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
super skinny foot possibly look for

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.090 
super skinny foot possibly look for
something<00:03:13.480> else<00:03:13.660> so<00:03:14.470> this<00:03:14.620> is<00:03:14.650> a<00:03:14.770> bit<00:03:14.950> of<00:03:15.040> a

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
something else so this is a bit of a

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.900 
something else so this is a bit of a
step<00:03:15.940> away<00:03:16.060> from<00:03:16.240> the<00:03:16.500> usual<00:03:17.610> way<00:03:18.610> that<00:03:18.790> night

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
step away from the usual way that night

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.310 
step away from the usual way that night
you<00:03:19.060> puts<00:03:19.270> their<00:03:19.390> shoes<00:03:19.600> together<00:03:19.780> sometimes

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
you puts their shoes together sometimes

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.290 
you puts their shoes together sometimes
they<00:03:20.410> quite<00:03:20.650> narrow<00:03:21.040> fitting<00:03:21.730> even<00:03:22.240> though

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
they quite narrow fitting even though

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.730 
they quite narrow fitting even though
this<00:03:22.480> one's<00:03:22.720> a<00:03:22.810> bit<00:03:22.960> more<00:03:23.110> generous<00:03:23.530> fit

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
this one's a bit more generous fit

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.310 
this one's a bit more generous fit
through<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:24.760> mid-foot<00:03:25.060> and<00:03:25.360> also<00:03:25.930> down<00:03:26.140> into

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.200 
through the mid-foot and also down into
the<00:03:26.410> forefoot<00:03:26.710> as<00:03:26.860> well<00:03:27.010> it<00:03:27.280> is<00:03:27.460> yeah<00:03:27.940> just

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.210 
the forefoot as well it is yeah just

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.060 
the forefoot as well it is yeah just
especially<00:03:28.600> just<00:03:29.020> in<00:03:29.170> that<00:03:29.290> to<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.710> forefoot

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
especially just in that to the forefoot

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.280 
especially just in that to the forefoot
part<00:03:30.310> there<00:03:30.600> they<00:03:31.600> did<00:03:31.750> a<00:03:31.780> little<00:03:31.990> bit<00:03:32.110> more

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
part there they did a little bit more

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.410 
part there they did a little bit more
channels<00:03:32.530> yeah<00:03:33.010> so<00:03:33.430> if<00:03:33.670> you<00:03:33.760> have<00:03:33.880> got<00:03:34.000> a<00:03:34.060> super

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
channels yeah so if you have got a super

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.210 
channels yeah so if you have got a super
skinny<00:03:34.630> foot<00:03:34.900> then<00:03:35.200> this<00:03:35.710> is<00:03:35.860> probably<00:03:36.070> not

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
skinny foot then this is probably not

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.010 
skinny foot then this is probably not
going<00:03:36.490> to<00:03:36.550> fit<00:03:36.760> you<00:03:36.940> very<00:03:37.390> well<00:03:37.630> but<00:03:37.660> yeah

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
going to fit you very well but yeah

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.930 
going to fit you very well but yeah
everybody<00:03:38.620> else<00:03:38.800> you<00:03:39.220> should<00:03:39.250> be<00:03:39.520> swayed<00:03:39.790> and

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
everybody else you should be swayed and

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.940 
everybody else you should be swayed and
there's<00:03:40.570> obviously<00:03:40.840> we<00:03:41.050> positions<00:03:41.680> as<00:03:41.800> well

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
there's obviously we positions as well

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.740 
there's obviously we positions as well
keep<00:03:42.100> going<00:03:42.160> to<00:03:42.370> super<00:03:42.730> what<00:03:42.880> yeah<00:03:43.150> okay<00:03:44.130> a

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
keep going to super what yeah okay a

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.870 
keep going to super what yeah okay a
couple<00:03:46.750> of<00:03:46.840> other<00:03:46.990> things<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:48.430> cushioning

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
couple of other things the cushioning

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.210 
couple of other things the cushioning
has<00:03:49.000> changed<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:49.960> nature<00:03:50.140> pushing<00:03:50.770> itself<00:03:51.010> is

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
has changed the nature pushing itself is

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.640 
has changed the nature pushing itself is
lighter<00:03:51.660> is<00:03:52.660> crucial<00:03:53.050> eyes<00:03:53.140> lighter<00:03:53.470> than

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
lighter is crucial eyes lighter than

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.650 
lighter is crucial eyes lighter than
previous<00:03:53.860> models<00:03:54.220> too<00:03:54.670> so<00:03:54.910> that's<00:03:55.510> really

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
previous models too so that's really

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.170 
previous models too so that's really
helped<00:03:56.490> awesome<00:03:57.490> flexibility<00:03:58.060> in<00:03:58.120> the

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
helped awesome flexibility in the

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.670 
helped awesome flexibility in the
forefoot<00:03:58.570> yet<00:03:58.870> which<00:03:59.050> is<00:03:59.230> something<00:03:59.440> that

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
forefoot yet which is something that

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.440 
forefoot yet which is something that
bronze<00:03:59.950> pretty<00:04:00.220> pumped<00:04:00.460> about<00:04:00.490> yes<00:04:00.910> bang<00:04:01.270> on

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
bronze pretty pumped about yes bang on

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.210 
bronze pretty pumped about yes bang on
about<00:04:01.480> that<00:04:01.750> if<00:04:01.870> a<00:04:01.990> bit<00:04:02.170> yes<00:04:02.470> definitely<00:04:02.860> if

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
about that if a bit yes definitely if

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.980 
about that if a bit yes definitely if
you<00:04:03.430> get<00:04:03.790> a<00:04:03.820> bit<00:04:03.970> more<00:04:04.090> flexibility<00:04:04.720> through

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
you get a bit more flexibility through

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.260 
you get a bit more flexibility through
there<00:04:05.230> even<00:04:05.920> if<00:04:06.040> you've<00:04:06.190> got<00:04:06.400> some<00:04:06.850> cushion

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
there even if you've got some cushion

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.300 
there even if you've got some cushion
which<00:04:07.870> this<00:04:08.080> shoe<00:04:08.260> has<00:04:08.440> you<00:04:08.650> can<00:04:08.800> still<00:04:09.070> feel<00:04:09.250> a

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
which this shoe has you can still feel a

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.860 
which this shoe has you can still feel a
little<00:04:09.580> bit<00:04:09.700> more<00:04:09.880> about<00:04:09.940> what's<00:04:10.330> going<00:04:10.720> on

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
little bit more about what's going on

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.720 
little bit more about what's going on
underneath<00:04:11.140> you<00:04:11.380> year<00:04:11.680> does<00:04:12.100> force<00:04:12.370> your<00:04:12.550> foot

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
underneath you year does force your foot

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.520 
underneath you year does force your foot
to<00:04:12.880> work<00:04:13.090> a<00:04:13.360> little<00:04:13.690> bit<00:04:13.870> more<00:04:14.080> than<00:04:14.320> if<00:04:14.410> you've

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
to work a little bit more than if you've

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.620 
to work a little bit more than if you've
just<00:04:14.740> got<00:04:14.860> to<00:04:14.920> stick<00:04:15.760> plank<00:04:16.060> in<00:04:16.210> the<00:04:16.299> forefoot

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
just got to stick plank in the forefoot

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.539 
just got to stick plank in the forefoot
if<00:04:17.080> it's<00:04:17.590> definitely<00:04:17.890> some<00:04:18.010> flexibility

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
if it's definitely some flexibility

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.120 
if it's definitely some flexibility
which<00:04:18.790> is<00:04:18.910> great<00:04:19.200> one<00:04:20.200> thing<00:04:20.350> I<00:04:20.410> will<00:04:20.500> say<00:04:20.560> if

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
which is great one thing I will say if

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.940 
which is great one thing I will say if
you<00:04:21.580> want<00:04:21.790> to<00:04:21.850> use<00:04:22.000> this<00:04:22.180> for<00:04:22.390> probably<00:04:22.950> some

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
you want to use this for probably some

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.950 
you want to use this for probably some
faster<00:04:24.430> work<00:04:24.610> the<00:04:24.910> arrows<00:04:25.180> and<00:04:25.300> tempo<00:04:25.570> stuff<00:04:25.810> I

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
faster work the arrows and tempo stuff I

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.620 
faster work the arrows and tempo stuff I
probably<00:04:26.740> such<00:04:26.950> look<00:04:27.850> look<00:04:28.180> somewhere<00:04:28.600> else

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
probably such look look somewhere else

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.350 
probably such look look somewhere else
yeah<00:04:29.020> but<00:04:29.350> this<00:04:29.470> is<00:04:29.650> this<00:04:30.010> is<00:04:30.160> a<00:04:30.190> workhorse

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
yeah but this is this is a workhorse

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.240 
yeah but this is this is a workhorse
does<00:04:33.020> everything<00:04:33.379> you<00:04:33.500> want<00:04:33.710> it<00:04:33.770> to<00:04:33.800> do<00:04:33.949> as<00:04:34.069> far

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
does everything you want it to do as far

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.339 
does everything you want it to do as far
as<00:04:34.310> daily<00:04:35.270> stuff<00:04:35.449> you<00:04:35.569> can<00:04:35.689> whack<00:04:35.780> it<00:04:35.960> on<00:04:36.050> and

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:36.349 
as daily stuff you can whack it on and

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:38.920 
as daily stuff you can whack it on and
go<00:04:36.409> into<00:04:36.770> a<00:04:37.219> sleazy<00:04:37.789> job<00:04:38.060> here<00:04:38.330> or<00:04:38.449> two<00:04:38.780> hours

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
go into a sleazy job here or two hours

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.110 
go into a sleazy job here or two hours
or<00:04:39.319> what<00:04:39.680> our<00:04:39.860> it<00:04:40.099> doesn't<00:04:40.340> really<00:04:40.430> matter<00:04:40.639> yes

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
or what our it doesn't really matter yes

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.360 
or what our it doesn't really matter yes
it<00:04:41.419> just<00:04:41.599> goes<00:04:41.960> with<00:04:42.199> you<00:04:42.319> yeah<00:04:42.830> pretty<00:04:43.159> easy

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
it just goes with you yeah pretty easy

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.570 
it just goes with you yeah pretty easy
yeah<00:04:43.819> good<00:04:44.330> stuff<00:04:44.479> and<00:04:45.250> let's<00:04:46.250> just<00:04:46.340> have<00:04:46.550> a

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
yeah good stuff and let's just have a

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.189 
yeah good stuff and let's just have a
look<00:04:46.639> at<00:04:46.789> this<00:04:46.879> flexibility<00:04:47.449> myself<00:04:47.930> yeah

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 
look at this flexibility myself yeah

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:51.100 
look at this flexibility myself yeah
that<00:04:48.650> is<00:04:48.879> quite<00:04:49.879> significantly<00:04:50.569> flexible

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
that is quite significantly flexible

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.020 
that is quite significantly flexible
it's<00:04:51.319> obviously<00:04:51.590> not<00:04:51.710> quite<00:04:52.460> a<00:04:52.490> free<00:04:52.819> but<00:04:53.000> I

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
it's obviously not quite a free but I

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.129 
it's obviously not quite a free but I
think<00:04:53.240> at<00:04:53.300> one<00:04:53.419> stage<00:04:53.659> you<00:04:53.689> are<00:04:53.870> almost

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
think at one stage you are almost

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.059 
think at one stage you are almost
calling<00:04:54.500> the<00:04:54.680> trip<00:04:55.810> 37<00:04:56.810> 37<00:04:57.199> or<00:04:57.500> 38<00:04:57.740> or

00:04:58.059 --> 00:04:58.069 
calling the trip 37 37 or 38 or

00:04:58.069 --> 00:04:59.170 
calling the trip 37 37 or 38 or
something<00:04:58.400> here<00:04:58.550> has<00:04:58.759> almost<00:04:58.969> an

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
something here has almost an

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.969 
something here has almost an
introduction<00:04:59.689> to<00:04:59.719> that<00:04:59.960> but<00:05:00.169> it<00:05:00.469> almost<00:05:00.680> feels

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
introduction to that but it almost feels

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:02.439 
introduction to that but it almost feels
a<00:05:01.039> little<00:05:01.159> bit<00:05:01.340> different<00:05:01.669> if<00:05:01.819> you<00:05:02.120> could<00:05:02.210> line

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
a little bit different if you could line

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.159 
a little bit different if you could line
them<00:05:02.659> up<00:05:02.689> on<00:05:02.990> a<00:05:03.349> shoe<00:05:03.650> wall<00:05:03.889> I<00:05:04.819> would<00:05:05.419> have<00:05:05.930> this

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
them up on a shoe wall I would have this

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.559 
them up on a shoe wall I would have this
sitting<00:05:06.949> about<00:05:07.129> a<00:05:07.340> top<00:05:07.789> and<00:05:08.060> then<00:05:08.240> I'll

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:08.569 
sitting about a top and then I'll

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:10.179 
sitting about a top and then I'll
probably<00:05:08.840> happier<00:05:09.289> than<00:05:09.439> you<00:05:09.620> you're<00:05:09.949> free

00:05:10.179 --> 00:05:10.189 
probably happier than you you're free

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:12.279 
probably happier than you you're free

thought when i bought one for my sort of

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:15.580 
thought when i bought one for my sort of
shoe<00:05:12.529> so<00:05:13.210> great<00:05:14.210> flexibility<00:05:14.779> but<00:05:15.080> still

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
shoe so great flexibility but still

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.469 
shoe so great flexibility but still
plenty<00:05:15.860> cushioning<00:05:16.219> there<00:05:16.400> for<00:05:16.610> people<00:05:17.150> that

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
plenty cushioning there for people that

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.839 
plenty cushioning there for people that
can't<00:05:17.689> be<00:05:18.469> more<00:05:18.680> under<00:05:18.889> there<00:05:19.039> call<00:05:19.460> it<00:05:19.639> would

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
can't be more under there call it would

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:21.279 
can't be more under there call it would
now<00:05:20.150> this<00:05:20.300> one's<00:05:20.479> pretty<00:05:20.659> ugly<00:05:20.990> is<00:05:21.139> it

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
now this one's pretty ugly is it

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.379 
now this one's pretty ugly is it
available<00:05:21.740> in<00:05:22.099> other<00:05:22.279> case<00:05:22.550> this<00:05:23.180> was<00:05:23.360> a

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
available in other case this was a

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:25.029 
available in other case this was a
shocking<00:05:23.659> color<00:05:23.930> i<00:05:24.020> must<00:05:24.259> do<00:05:24.349> it<00:05:24.500> but<00:05:24.770> it<00:05:24.919> was

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 
shocking color i must do it but it was

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:27.219 
shocking color i must do it but it was
the<00:05:25.129> only<00:05:25.250> one<00:05:25.490> that<00:05:25.569> was<00:05:26.569> in<00:05:26.689> my<00:05:26.810> size<00:05:27.020> at<00:05:27.199> a

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
the only one that was in my size at a

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:28.600 
the only one that was in my size at a
time<00:05:27.439> when<00:05:27.650> I<00:05:27.680> wanted<00:05:27.800> to<00:05:27.979> bother<00:05:28.250> them<00:05:28.400> try

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
time when I wanted to bother them try

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.999 
time when I wanted to bother them try
them<00:05:28.669> so<00:05:28.939> yep<00:05:29.240> yes<00:05:30.229> this<00:05:30.500> is<00:05:30.650> probably<00:05:30.860> the

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:31.009 
them so yep yes this is probably the

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:32.589 
them so yep yes this is probably the
worst<00:05:31.069> color<00:05:31.400> of<00:05:31.520> it<00:05:31.610> Mikey<00:05:31.909> Bria<00:05:32.150> they<00:05:32.389> always

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:32.599 
worst color of it Mikey Bria they always

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:34.149 
worst color of it Mikey Bria they always
bring<00:05:32.840> out<00:05:32.990> some<00:05:33.199> pretty<00:05:33.590> awesome<00:05:33.710> colors

00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:34.159 
bring out some pretty awesome colors

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:36.159 
bring out some pretty awesome colors
there's<00:05:34.759> hatred<00:05:34.969> colors<00:05:35.330> of<00:05:35.449> the<00:05:35.569> Peter<00:05:35.779> pilot

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:36.169 
there's hatred colors of the Peter pilot

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:39.129 
there's hatred colors of the Peter pilot
so<00:05:36.440> much<00:05:37.430> nicer<00:05:37.610> than<00:05:37.819> this<00:05:37.969> one<00:05:38.150> the<00:05:38.900> prior

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
so much nicer than this one the prior

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:40.749 
so much nicer than this one the prior
yellow<00:05:39.379> one<00:05:39.620> sold<00:05:39.919> really<00:05:40.159> well<00:05:40.250> here<00:05:40.610> in

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 
yellow one sold really well here in

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:43.480 
yellow one sold really well here in
Australia<00:05:41.210> which<00:05:41.539> was<00:05:41.719> the<00:05:42.250> default<00:05:43.250> color

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
Australia which was the default color

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.930 
Australia which was the default color
for<00:05:43.759> the<00:05:43.819> mfing<00:05:44.150> so<00:05:44.389> that's<00:05:44.659> all<00:05:44.839> super<00:05:45.289> well

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
for the mfing so that's all super well

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.980 
for the mfing so that's all super well
this<00:05:46.940> one<00:05:47.120> probably

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
this one probably

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.230 
this one probably
as<00:05:48.140> much<00:05:48.320> but<00:05:48.520> another<00:05:49.520> quick<00:05:49.880> thing<00:05:50.030> I<00:05:50.090> want

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
as much but another quick thing I want

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.610 
as much but another quick thing I want
to<00:05:50.270> mention<00:05:50.330> is<00:05:50.690> the<00:05:50.720> problem<00:05:51.440> the<00:05:51.530> other

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
to mention is the problem the other

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.130 
to mention is the problem the other
fault<00:05:51.980> for<00:05:52.940> really<00:05:53.060> finding<00:05:53.540> the<00:05:53.660> shoe<00:05:53.870> and

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.140 
fault for really finding the shoe and

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.860 
fault for really finding the shoe and
such<00:05:54.380> as<00:05:54.560> just<00:05:55.220> under<00:05:56.150> here<00:05:56.360> through<00:05:56.600> the<00:05:56.720> art

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
such as just under here through the art

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.960 
such as just under here through the art
it<00:05:57.020> actually<00:05:57.290> just<00:05:57.410> cuts<00:05:57.710> away<00:05:57.860> a<00:05:58.250> little<00:05:58.850> bit

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
it actually just cuts away a little bit

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.450 
it actually just cuts away a little bit
too<00:05:59.240> much<00:05:59.480> um<00:06:00.110> so<00:06:00.920> if<00:06:00.980> you're<00:06:01.130> a<00:06:01.160> bit<00:06:01.310> unstable

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
too much um so if you're a bit unstable

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.420 
too much um so if you're a bit unstable
then<00:06:02.090> perhaps<00:06:02.350> maybe<00:06:03.350> avoid<00:06:03.680> this<00:06:03.950> is<00:06:04.160> your

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
then perhaps maybe avoid this is your

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.120 
then perhaps maybe avoid this is your
default<00:06:05.120> settings<00:06:05.420> you<00:06:05.600> yeah<00:06:06.050> yeah<00:06:06.530> exactly

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.130 
default settings you yeah yeah exactly

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.070 
default settings you yeah yeah exactly
if<00:06:07.280> just<00:06:07.670> I<00:06:07.820> think<00:06:08.060> if<00:06:08.150> they<00:06:08.300> should<00:06:08.570> just<00:06:08.720> off

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
if just I think if they should just off

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.390 
if just I think if they should just off
stir<00:06:09.230> that<00:06:09.380> up<00:06:09.410> a<00:06:09.530> little<00:06:09.680> bit<00:06:09.830> this<00:06:10.220> would

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
stir that up a little bit this would

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.300 
stir that up a little bit this would
actually<00:06:10.490> be<00:06:10.700> a<00:06:10.820> it<00:06:11.450> almost<00:06:12.050> unfold<00:06:12.920> I'm<00:06:13.160> sure

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.310 
actually be a it almost unfold I'm sure

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.100 
actually be a it almost unfold I'm sure
but<00:06:13.700> it's<00:06:13.850> just<00:06:14.090> just<00:06:14.480> cut<00:06:14.630> away<00:06:14.810> live<00:06:14.990> with

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
but it's just just cut away live with

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.710 
but it's just just cut away live with
Sophie<00:06:15.410> are<00:06:15.680> a<00:06:15.710> little<00:06:15.920> bit<00:06:16.070> able<00:06:16.720> you'll

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 
Sophie are a little bit able you'll

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.330 
Sophie are a little bit able you'll
likely<00:06:17.900> probably<00:06:18.290> just<00:06:18.860> collapse<00:06:19.190> that

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 
likely probably just collapse that

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.850 
likely probably just collapse that
little<00:06:19.640> bit<00:06:19.790> but<00:06:19.970> it's<00:06:20.120> on<00:06:20.330> the<00:06:20.360> bus<00:06:20.780> not<00:06:21.050> that

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
little bit but it's on the bus not that

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.470 
little bit but it's on the bus not that
sort<00:06:22.190> of<00:06:22.250> does<00:06:22.430> allow<00:06:22.670> to<00:06:22.730> sort<00:06:23.210> of<00:06:23.270> twist

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:23.480 
sort of does allow to sort of twist

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.950 
sort of does allow to sort of twist
through<00:06:23.750> that<00:06:25.000> sideways<00:06:26.000> motion<00:06:26.420> which<00:06:26.720> does

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
through that sideways motion which does

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.600 
through that sideways motion which does
give<00:06:27.140> you<00:06:27.230> sort<00:06:27.590> of<00:06:27.650> good<00:06:27.830> feel<00:06:28.040> and<00:06:28.190> lead<00:06:28.400> to

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610 
give you sort of good feel and lead to

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.990 
give you sort of good feel and lead to
move<00:06:28.940> fairly<00:06:29.540> naturally<00:06:30.050> so<00:06:30.260> yeah<00:06:31.040> you<00:06:31.430> pretty

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
move fairly naturally so yeah you pretty

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.910 
move fairly naturally so yeah you pretty
pumped<00:06:32.360> about<00:06:32.390> this<00:06:32.630> to<00:06:32.840> mark<00:06:33.080> so<00:06:33.260> you<00:06:33.350> wanted
