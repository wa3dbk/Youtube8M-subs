00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.970 

rekha<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:16.360> conscious<00:00:16.750> get<00:00:17.560> back<00:00:17.680> in<00:00:17.800> the<00:00:17.860> game

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
rekha you conscious get back in the game

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.060 
rekha you conscious get back in the game
and<00:00:18.220> stay<00:00:18.430> with<00:00:19.529> starting<00:00:20.529> a<00:00:20.619> game<00:00:20.830> on<00:00:21.039> a

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
and stay with starting a game on a

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.730 
and stay with starting a game on a
humorous<00:00:21.550> note<00:00:21.580> it's<00:00:21.970> always<00:00:22.210> a<00:00:22.480> plus<00:00:22.810> alright

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
humorous note it's always a plus alright

humorous note it's always a plus alright
with<00:00:23.890> that<00:00:23.920> out<00:00:24.130> of<00:00:24.160> the<00:00:24.250> way<00:00:24.310> let's<00:00:24.580> look<00:00:24.939> at

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:25.089 
with that out of the way let's look at

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:26.939 
with that out of the way let's look at
battlefield<00:00:25.570> 4<00:00:25.869> the<00:00:26.470> lighting<00:00:26.769> was

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:26.949 
battlefield 4 the lighting was

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:28.829 
battlefield 4 the lighting was
definitely<00:00:27.490> one<00:00:27.640> of<00:00:27.669> the<00:00:27.820> high<00:00:27.970> points<00:00:28.000> here

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:28.839 
definitely one of the high points here

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:29.939 
definitely one of the high points here
you<00:00:28.929> can<00:00:29.050> see<00:00:29.230> an<00:00:29.320> example<00:00:29.500> of<00:00:29.740> how<00:00:29.890> the

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:29.949 
you can see an example of how the

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:31.620 
you can see an example of how the
developers<00:00:30.519> it<00:00:30.669> dies<00:00:30.820> did<00:00:31.089> a<00:00:31.150> great<00:00:31.390> job<00:00:31.419> of

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
developers it dies did a great job of

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.120 
developers it dies did a great job of
hiding<00:00:32.020> some<00:00:32.439> of<00:00:32.529> their<00:00:32.710> tricks<00:00:32.980> to

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.130 
hiding some of their tricks to

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.800 
hiding some of their tricks to
accomplish<00:00:33.670> both<00:00:33.850> great<00:00:34.150> lighting<00:00:34.390> without

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:34.810 
accomplish both great lighting without

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.650 
accomplish both great lighting without
causing<00:00:35.440> lack<00:00:35.650> so<00:00:36.250> if<00:00:36.550> you<00:00:36.760> look<00:00:36.940> closely<00:00:37.180> here

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
causing lack so if you look closely here

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.840 
causing lack so if you look closely here
this<00:00:38.079> plant<00:00:38.500> is<00:00:38.650> not<00:00:38.950> actually<00:00:39.160> casting<00:00:39.789> a

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
this plant is not actually casting a

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.910 
this plant is not actually casting a
shadow<00:00:39.879> on<00:00:40.360> the<00:00:40.449> ground<00:00:40.570> below<00:00:41.050> it<00:00:41.350> it's<00:00:41.890> a

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
shadow on the ground below it it's a

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.010 
shadow on the ground below it it's a
great<00:00:42.190> way<00:00:42.370> to<00:00:42.430> save<00:00:42.820> on<00:00:43.059> processing<00:00:43.840> power

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
great way to save on processing power

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.840 
great way to save on processing power
for<00:00:44.289> this<00:00:44.410> cadre<00:00:44.620> effect<00:00:45.129> but<00:00:45.579> it's<00:00:45.699> really

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
for this cadre effect but it's really

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.130 
for this cadre effect but it's really
hard<00:00:46.120> to<00:00:46.239> tell<00:00:46.480> because<00:00:46.629> the<00:00:46.809> ground

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
hard to tell because the ground

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.680 
hard to tell because the ground
underneath<00:00:47.469> it<00:00:47.770> is<00:00:47.920> uneven<00:00:48.820> rubble<00:00:49.210> so<00:00:49.539> it

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
underneath it is uneven rubble so it

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.810 
underneath it is uneven rubble so it
does<00:00:49.840> a<00:00:49.870> great<00:00:50.320> job<00:00:50.350> of<00:00:50.649> hiding<00:00:51.160> that<00:00:51.579> there's

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
does a great job of hiding that there's

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.389 
does a great job of hiding that there's
no<00:00:52.120> shadow<00:00:52.629> from<00:00:53.320> the<00:00:53.800> plant<00:00:54.070> and<00:00:54.160> the<00:00:54.250> average

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
no shadow from the plant and the average

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.180 
no shadow from the plant and the average
passerby<00:00:55.059> won't<00:00:55.570> even<00:00:55.809> notice<00:00:56.170> and<00:00:57.039> one<00:00:57.160> thing

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
passerby won't even notice and one thing

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.400 
passerby won't even notice and one thing
is<00:00:57.430> really<00:00:57.670> cool<00:00:58.030> about<00:00:58.269> battlefield<00:00:58.780> is<00:00:59.079> to

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
is really cool about battlefield is to

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.139 
is really cool about battlefield is to
ever-changing<00:00:59.739> weather<00:01:00.280> it's<00:01:00.789> not<00:01:00.910> always<00:01:01.059> a

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
battlefield 4 may be almost a little too

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.600 
battlefield 4 may be almost a little too
often<00:01:16.000> in<00:01:16.120> some<00:01:16.330> cases<00:01:16.740> while<00:01:17.740> most<00:01:17.920> games<00:01:18.310> can

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
often in some cases while most games can

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.910 
often in some cases while most games can
limit<00:01:18.940> your<00:01:18.970> interactions<00:01:19.780> to<00:01:20.080> only<00:01:20.410> things

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
limit your interactions to only things

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.770 
limit your interactions to only things
that<00:01:21.100> you<00:01:21.220> really<00:01:21.490> need<00:01:21.760> to<00:01:21.790> do<00:01:22.150> to<00:01:22.420> progress

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
that you really need to do to progress

that you really need to do to progress
the<00:01:23.020> game<00:01:23.260> with<00:01:23.770> battlefield<00:01:24.280> 4<00:01:24.580> you<00:01:25.000> can

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
the game with battlefield 4 you can

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.210 
the game with battlefield 4 you can
interact<00:01:25.570> with<00:01:25.690> a<00:01:25.720> lot<00:01:25.990> more<00:01:26.230> than<00:01:26.380> that<00:01:26.410> for

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
interact with a lot more than that for

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.250 
interact with a lot more than that for
example<00:01:27.610> notice<00:01:27.940> we're<00:01:28.330> in<00:01:28.480> this<00:01:28.600> room<00:01:28.930> here

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
example notice we're in this room here

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.810 
example notice we're in this room here
there's<00:01:29.440> a<00:01:29.500> random<00:01:29.860> light<00:01:30.070> fixture<00:01:30.430> hanging

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
there's a random light fixture hanging

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.520 
there's a random light fixture hanging
from<00:01:30.970> the<00:01:31.120> ceiling<00:01:31.510> no<00:01:31.990> yeah<00:01:32.140> but<00:01:32.350> you<00:01:32.410> can

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
from the ceiling no yeah but you can

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.170 
from the ceiling no yeah but you can
actually<00:01:32.650> run<00:01:33.040> into<00:01:33.340> it<00:01:33.460> collided<00:01:33.850> with<00:01:33.970> it

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
actually run into it collided with it

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.210 
actually run into it collided with it
and<00:01:34.330> interact<00:01:34.720> with<00:01:34.900> this<00:01:35.050> object<00:01:35.560> it's<00:01:36.010> just

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
and interact with this object it's just

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.340 
and interact with this object it's just
a<00:01:36.280> nice<00:01:36.550> little<00:01:36.580> touch<00:01:37.180> to<00:01:37.570> really<00:01:37.840> help<00:01:38.080> make

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
a nice little touch to really help make

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.500 
a nice little touch to really help make
you<00:01:38.530> believe<00:01:38.770> that<00:01:39.400> the<00:01:39.520> environment<00:01:39.850> is<00:01:40.210> real

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
you believe that the environment is real

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.140 
you believe that the environment is real
of<00:01:41.440> course<00:01:41.680> it's<00:01:41.890> not<00:01:42.040> always<00:01:42.250> that<00:01:42.430> way<00:01:42.790> one

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
of course it's not always that way one

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.550 
of course it's not always that way one
of<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.360> things<00:01:43.540> that<00:01:43.660> took<00:01:43.870> us<00:01:44.050> out<00:01:44.200> of<00:01:44.260> the

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
of the things that took us out of the

of the things that took us out of the
believability<00:01:45.010> of<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.370> game<00:01:45.550> where<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.120> cost

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
cloth curtains are being blown around in

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.170 
cloth curtains are being blown around in
the<00:01:50.200> wind<00:01:50.350> so<00:01:50.980> you'd<00:01:51.160> think<00:01:51.190> that<00:01:51.640> since<00:01:52.090> you

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
the wind so you'd think that since you

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.270 
the wind so you'd think that since you
were<00:01:52.240> able<00:01:52.420> to<00:01:52.600> interact<00:01:52.960> with<00:01:53.290> the<00:01:53.890> random

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280

were able to interact with the random

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
to interact with the curtains that are

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.000

pick up a game like battlefield 4 to
play<00:02:04.870> with<00:02:05.050> curtains<00:02:05.440> so<00:02:05.950> here<00:02:06.220> we<00:02:06.250> threw<00:02:06.520> a

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
play with curtains so here we threw a

pick off the remaining bad guys it's a

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.330 
pick off the remaining bad guys it's a
great<00:02:19.719> example<00:02:20.079> of<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.739> type<00:02:20.980> of<00:02:21.010> store

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
great example of the type of store

great example of the type of store
that<00:02:21.730> you<00:02:21.879> can<00:02:22.060> do<00:02:22.300> in<00:02:22.569> battlefield<00:02:23.349> 4

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
that you can do in battlefield 4

that you can do in battlefield 4
something<00:02:24.849> that<00:02:24.970> really<00:02:25.120> stood<00:02:25.360> out<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:25.540> us

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
something that really stood out to us

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.960 
something that really stood out to us
was<00:02:25.959> the<00:02:26.080> great<00:02:26.319> use<00:02:26.560> of<00:02:26.590> props<00:02:27.129> and<00:02:27.400> assets

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
was the great use of props and assets

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.820 
was the great use of props and assets
for<00:02:28.180> set<00:02:28.360> dressing<00:02:28.540> notice<00:02:29.440> this<00:02:29.560> backpack

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
for set dressing notice this backpack

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.140 
for set dressing notice this backpack
and<00:02:30.220> clothes<00:02:30.430> laying<00:02:30.670> on<00:02:30.849> the<00:02:30.940> sidewalk

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
and clothes laying on the sidewalk

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.089 
and clothes laying on the sidewalk
technically<00:02:32.050> it's<00:02:32.200> modeled<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:32.680> textured

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
technically it's modeled and textured

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.400 
technically it's modeled and textured
really<00:02:33.519> well<00:02:33.730> but<00:02:34.209> it<00:02:34.300> serves<00:02:34.569> absolutely<00:02:35.200> no

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
really well but it serves absolutely no

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.410 
really well but it serves absolutely no
purpose<00:02:35.680> in<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:35.980> game<00:02:36.190> other<00:02:36.670> than<00:02:36.819> to<00:02:37.180> help

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
purpose in the game other than to help

purpose in the game other than to help
build<00:02:37.720> realism<00:02:38.459> now<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:39.519> great<00:02:39.849> use<00:02:40.030> of

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
build realism now the great use of

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.400 
build realism now the great use of
little<00:02:40.450> details<00:02:40.660> like<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.170> set-dressing

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
little details like the set-dressing

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.470 
little details like the set-dressing
meant<00:02:42.220> really<00:02:42.459> hard<00:02:42.700> for<00:02:42.849> us<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.030> overlook

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
meant really hard for us to overlook

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.210 
meant really hard for us to overlook
something<00:02:43.750> that<00:02:43.989> was<00:02:44.080> probably<00:02:44.379> the<00:02:44.980> biggest

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
something that was probably the biggest

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.949 
something that was probably the biggest
technical<00:02:45.940> issue<00:02:46.239> that<00:02:46.510> we<00:02:46.599> had<00:02:46.780> with<00:02:46.930> the

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
technical issue that we had with the

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.080 
technical issue that we had with the
game<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.440> that's<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:47.980> specular<00:02:48.640> highlight

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
game and that's the specular highlight

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.610 
game and that's the specular highlight
that<00:02:49.239> seemed<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.660> be<00:02:49.750> caked<00:02:50.049> all<00:02:50.230> over<00:02:50.349> the

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
that seemed to be caked all over the

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.289 
that seemed to be caked all over the
walls<00:02:50.860> throughout<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.459> entire<00:02:51.790> environment

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
walls throughout the entire environment

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.720 
walls throughout the entire environment
so<00:02:53.140> notice<00:02:53.590> in<00:02:53.709> this<00:02:53.799> really<00:02:54.069> dark<00:02:54.190> hallway

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
so notice in this really dark hallway

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.729 
so notice in this really dark hallway
there's<00:02:54.940> a<00:02:55.060> single<00:02:55.299> light<00:02:55.660> on<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:56.079> far<00:02:56.319> end<00:02:56.500> as

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
there's a single light on the far end as

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.890 
there's a single light on the far end as
we<00:02:57.190> make<00:02:57.370> our<00:02:57.519> way<00:02:57.549> down<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:58.239> hall<00:02:58.450> keep<00:02:58.750> your

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
we make our way down the hall keep your

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.390 
we make our way down the hall keep your
eye<00:02:58.930> on<00:02:59.110> the<00:02:59.440> walls<00:02:59.650> to<00:02:59.860> the<00:02:59.890> left<00:03:00.160> and<00:03:00.310> the

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
eye on the walls to the left and the

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.430 
eye on the walls to the left and the
right<00:03:00.430> notice<00:03:01.299> that<00:03:01.510> it's<00:03:01.870> that<00:03:02.260> high

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
right notice that it's that high

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.589 
right notice that it's that high
specularity<00:03:02.980> on<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.310> walls<00:03:03.549> is<00:03:03.849> creating

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
specularity on the walls is creating

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.180 
specularity on the walls is creating
almost<00:03:04.900> a<00:03:04.989> secondary<00:03:05.440> light<00:03:05.709> source<00:03:05.950> that's

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
almost a secondary light source that's

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.460 
almost a secondary light source that's
becoming<00:03:06.819> very<00:03:07.120> powerful<00:03:07.660> and<00:03:07.690> really<00:03:08.290> very

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
becoming very powerful and really very

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.009 
becoming very powerful and really very
distracting<00:03:09.190> of<00:03:09.849> course<00:03:10.090> we<00:03:10.569> did<00:03:10.750> just<00:03:10.930> get

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
distracting of course we did just get

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.479 
distracting of course we did just get
out<00:03:11.170> of<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.260> water<00:03:11.440> in<00:03:11.709> that<00:03:11.920> particular<00:03:12.160> area

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
out of the water in that particular area

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.190 
out of the water in that particular area
so<00:03:12.879> you<00:03:12.910> could<00:03:13.180> give<00:03:13.480> it<00:03:13.569> the<00:03:13.660> benefit<00:03:14.079> of<00:03:14.110> the

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
so you could give it the benefit of the

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.110 
so you could give it the benefit of the
doubt<00:03:14.410> assume<00:03:14.890> that<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.220> walls<00:03:15.430> are<00:03:15.640> damp<00:03:15.879> and

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
doubt assume that the walls are damp and

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.580 
doubt assume that the walls are damp and
wet<00:03:16.239> except<00:03:16.810> that's<00:03:16.930> not<00:03:17.049> the<00:03:17.290> only<00:03:17.440> place

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
wet except that's not the only place

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.350 
wet except that's not the only place
that<00:03:17.680> it<00:03:17.920> happens<00:03:18.250> notice<00:03:18.940> here<00:03:19.090> that<00:03:19.120> the

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360
