00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
own so you can see that there was this

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.910 
own so you can see that there was this
whole<00:01:41.369> propagation<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:43.079> basic<00:01:43.500> step<00:01:43.680> all

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
whole propagation of this basic step all

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.170 
whole propagation of this basic step all
throughout<00:01:44.189> New<00:01:44.369> York<00:01:44.549> City<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.939> course

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
throughout New York City and of course

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.090 
throughout New York City and of course
this<00:01:45.659> spread<00:01:46.049> through<00:01:46.320> other<00:01:46.439> cities<00:01:46.860> and

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
this spread through other cities and

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.920 
this spread through other cities and
ultimately<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.670> other<00:01:47.790> countries<00:01:48.030> then<00:01:48.810> when

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
ultimately to other countries then when

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.719 
ultimately to other countries then when
the<00:01:49.020> 90s<00:01:49.439> Kames<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.890> was<00:01:49.979> just<00:01:50.159> just<00:01:50.610> an

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
the 90s Kames it was just just an

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.210 
the 90s Kames it was just just an
explosion<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:52.950> when<00:01:53.100> this

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
explosion and that this is when this

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.550 
explosion and that this is when this
basics<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.729> really<00:01:54.060> took<00:01:54.210> off<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:55.350> other

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
basics that really took off the other

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.749 
basics that really took off the other
