using the treble and bass controls you

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.490 
using the treble and bass controls you
can<00:01:27.210> really<00:01:27.540> tweak<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.990> pedal<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.380> your

base is at 2 o'clock and trouble is at
11<00:01:56.220> o'clock<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:57.840> without

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.710 

it's<00:02:29.280> really<00:02:30.280> transparent<00:02:30.880> because<00:02:31.150> I<00:02:31.540> had<00:02:31.690> a

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
it's really transparent because I had a

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.020 
it's really transparent because I had a
sparkling<00:02:32.260> clean<00:02:32.650> sound<00:02:32.980> start<00:02:33.310> off<00:02:33.520> with<00:02:33.760> and

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
sparkling clean sound start off with and

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.090 
sparkling clean sound start off with and
on<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.930> bridge<00:02:35.110> back<00:02:35.290> pickup<00:02:35.680> of<00:02:35.770> the<00:02:35.830> guitar

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
on the bridge back pickup of the guitar

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.550 
on the bridge back pickup of the guitar
which<00:02:36.340> normally<00:02:36.910> should<00:02:37.290> sound<00:02:38.290> quite

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
which normally should sound quite

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.160 
which normally should sound quite
offensive<00:02:39.130> in<00:02:39.280> a<00:02:39.340> bit<00:02:39.490> harsh<00:02:39.760> but<00:02:40.510> it<00:02:40.930> sounds

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
offensive in a bit harsh but it sounds

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.140 
offensive in a bit harsh but it sounds
really<00:02:41.380> nice<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:41.710> warm<00:02:42.040> on<00:02:42.310> this<00:02:42.460> guitar<00:02:42.640> and

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
really nice and warm on this guitar and

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.510 
really nice and warm on this guitar and
then<00:02:43.690> just<00:02:43.960> adding<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.530> BB<00:02:44.830> preamp<00:02:45.040> and<00:02:45.400> it's

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
then just adding the BB preamp and it's

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.560 
then just adding the BB preamp and it's
a<00:02:45.610> different<00:02:45.970> dynamic<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.570> the<00:02:47.290> sound<00:02:47.590> so<00:02:48.010> it's

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
a different dynamic to the sound so it's

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.270 
a different dynamic to the sound so it's
making<00:02:49.570> a<00:02:49.630> bit<00:02:49.840> warmer<00:02:50.320> a<00:02:50.350> bit<00:02:50.650> crisper<00:02:51.250> and

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
making a bit warmer a bit crisper and

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.190 
making a bit warmer a bit crisper and
also<00:02:51.730> adding<00:02:52.060> obviously<00:02:52.630> adding<00:02:52.840> a<00:02:52.930> bit<00:02:53.080> of

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
also adding obviously adding a bit of

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.700 
also adding obviously adding a bit of
distortion<00:02:53.710> to<00:02:54.100> it<00:02:54.250> but<00:02:54.790> not<00:02:55.720> so<00:02:56.230> much<00:02:56.440> that

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
distortion to it but not so much that

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.380 
distortion to it but not so much that
it's<00:02:56.890> uncontrollable<00:02:57.370> because<00:02:58.000> as<00:02:58.150> you<00:02:58.270> could

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
it's uncontrollable because as you could

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.030 
it's uncontrollable because as you could
hear<00:02:58.570> at<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.870> end<00:02:58.900> of<00:02:59.170> that<00:02:59.230> passage<00:02:59.650> I<00:02:59.800> was

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
hear at the end of that passage I was

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.340 
hear at the end of that passage I was
rolling<00:03:00.460> the<00:03:00.520> volume<00:03:00.850> control<00:03:01.750> down<00:03:01.990> on<00:03:02.200> my

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
rolling the volume control down on my

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.410 
rolling the volume control down on my
guitar<00:03:02.710> and<00:03:02.950> that's<00:03:03.490> something<00:03:03.760> that<00:03:04.030> is<00:03:04.180> very

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
guitar and that's something that is very

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.960 
guitar and that's something that is very
cool<00:03:04.900> about<00:03:05.350> this<00:03:05.470> pedal<00:03:05.680> it<00:03:05.890> reacts<00:03:06.190> like<00:03:06.520> I'm

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
cool about this pedal it reacts like I'm

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.220 
cool about this pedal it reacts like I'm
going<00:03:07.270> to<00:03:07.330> show<00:03:07.600> you<00:03:07.690> what<00:03:07.840> it<00:03:07.930> sounds<00:03:08.200> like

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
going to show you what it sounds like

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.650 
going to show you what it sounds like
with<00:03:08.440> a<00:03:08.530> slightly<00:03:08.830> already<00:03:09.820> crunchy<00:03:10.209> sound<00:03:10.480> on

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
with a slightly already crunchy sound on

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:32.430 
with a slightly already crunchy sound on
the<00:03:10.750> amplifier

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.220 

it<00:03:33.440> just<00:03:33.680> adds<00:03:33.970> took<00:03:34.970> my<00:03:35.120> it's<00:03:35.540> all<00:03:35.720> so<00:03:35.930> much<00:03:36.049> I

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
it just adds took my it's all so much I

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.750 
it just adds took my it's all so much I
already<00:03:36.560> had<00:03:36.709> what<00:03:36.890> sounded<00:03:37.069> pretty<00:03:37.400> cold

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
already had what sounded pretty cold

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.580 
already had what sounded pretty cold
anyway<00:03:38.150> and<00:03:38.299> then<00:03:38.420> I<00:03:38.510> keep<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:38.780> PD<00:03:39.019> on<00:03:39.349> and

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
anyway and then I keep the PD on and

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.440 
anyway and then I keep the PD on and
then<00:03:40.220> that<00:03:40.489> makes<00:03:40.670> it<00:03:40.849> so<00:03:41.060> much<00:03:41.239> more

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
then that makes it so much more

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.809 
then that makes it so much more
harmonically<00:03:42.260> richer<00:03:42.769> and<00:03:42.830> sustains<00:03:43.489> for

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
harmonically richer and sustains for

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:44.289 
harmonically richer and sustains for
longer

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
longer

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.690 
longer
it's<00:03:44.660> just<00:03:44.810> nabli<00:03:45.379> and<00:03:45.860> lastly<00:03:46.280> with<00:03:46.549> this

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
it's just nabli and lastly with this

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.630 
it's just nabli and lastly with this
guitar<00:03:46.930> quite<00:03:47.930> often<00:03:48.140> what<00:03:48.319> people<00:03:48.379> do<00:03:48.920> is<00:03:49.220> use

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
guitar quite often what people do is use

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.850 
guitar quite often what people do is use
this<00:03:49.819> as<00:03:50.030> some<00:03:50.450> sort<00:03:50.660> of<00:03:50.780> lead<00:03:51.049> boost<00:03:51.349> so<00:03:51.709> what

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
this as some sort of lead boost so what

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.729 
this as some sort of lead boost so what
I'm<00:03:51.950> going<00:03:52.069> to<00:03:52.099> do<00:03:52.280> is<00:03:52.519> engage<00:03:53.319> kind<00:03:54.319> of<00:03:54.410> more

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
I'm going to do is engage kind of more

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.190 
I'm going to do is engage kind of more
high<00:03:54.920> gain<00:03:55.220> sound<00:03:55.670> on<00:03:55.819> the<00:03:55.879> diesel<00:03:56.200> something

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
high gain sound on the diesel something

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.750 
high gain sound on the diesel something
that<00:03:57.319> would<00:03:57.409> be<00:03:57.530> used<00:03:57.920> for<00:03:58.010> my<00:03:58.190> rhythm<00:03:58.489> sound

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
that would be used for my rhythm sound

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.240 
that would be used for my rhythm sound
and<00:03:59.120> then<00:03:59.329> it<00:03:59.420> goes<00:03:59.599> the<00:03:59.750> BB<00:04:00.140> and<00:04:00.890> maybe<00:04:01.129> a

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
and then it goes the BB and maybe a

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.190 
and then it goes the BB and maybe a
little<00:04:01.459> bit<00:04:01.579> of<00:04:01.670> delay<00:04:01.910> cursive<00:04:02.480> the<00:04:02.660> mxr

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
little bit of delay cursive the mxr

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.140 
little bit of delay cursive the mxr
carbon-copy<00:04:03.829> analog<00:04:04.459> delay<00:04:04.730> through<00:04:05.000> the

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
carbon-copy analog delay through the

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:39.480 
carbon-copy analog delay through the
effects<00:04:05.510> loop<00:04:05.629> to<00:04:05.810> get<00:04:05.959> a<00:04:05.989> nice<00:04:06.200> soaring<00:04:06.709> lead

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.400
