dropped<00:01:09.890> on<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:10.160> ground<00:01:10.840> around<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:12.290> feed

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
dropped on the ground around the feed

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.350 
dropped on the ground around the feed
machine<00:01:12.890> and<00:01:13.100> around<00:01:13.400> the<00:01:13.610> gate<00:01:14.090> where<00:01:14.270> the

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
machine and around the gate where the

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.040 
machine and around the gate where the
other<00:01:14.540> animals<00:01:14.960> eat<00:01:15.200> I<00:01:16.780> noticed<00:01:17.780> that<00:01:17.900> she<00:01:17.930> had

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
other animals eat I noticed that she had

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.930 
other animals eat I noticed that she had
a<00:01:18.170> lot<00:01:18.320> of<00:01:18.350> energy<00:01:18.830> so<00:01:19.430> I<00:01:19.460> thought<00:01:19.700> that<00:01:19.910> maybe

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
a lot of energy so I thought that maybe

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.180 
a lot of energy so I thought that maybe
if<00:01:20.390> I<00:01:20.420> could<00:01:20.750> take<00:01:21.170> that<00:01:21.230> energy<00:01:21.560> and<00:01:21.890> put<00:01:21.950> it

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
if I could take that energy and put it

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.649 
if I could take that energy and put it
into<00:01:22.370> something<00:01:22.580> else<00:01:22.820> maybe<00:01:23.240> she<00:01:23.480> wouldn't

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
into something else maybe she wouldn't

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.750 
into something else maybe she wouldn't
try<00:01:23.810> to<00:01:23.870> escape<00:01:24.170> as<00:01:24.350> much<00:01:24.500> during<00:01:24.710> the<00:01:24.860> day<00:01:24.890> so

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
try to escape as much during the day so

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.060 
try to escape as much during the day so
I<00:01:25.790> started<00:01:26.270> with<00:01:26.450> just<00:01:26.750> hurdles<00:01:27.650> running<00:01:27.980> in

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
I started with just hurdles running in

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.340 
I started with just hurdles running in
the<00:01:28.130> back<00:01:28.310> here<00:01:28.690> just<00:01:29.690> letting<00:01:29.960> her<00:01:30.080> get<00:01:30.260> out

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
the back here just letting her get out

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.170 
the back here just letting her get out
some<00:01:30.590> of<00:01:30.710> her<00:01:30.800> energy<00:01:30.950> and<00:01:31.430> it<00:01:31.700> seemed<00:01:32.000> to<00:01:32.150> work

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
some of her energy and it seemed to work

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.860 
some of her energy and it seemed to work
so<00:01:32.720> I<00:01:32.750> moved<00:01:33.200> it<00:01:33.350> to<00:01:33.620> doing<00:01:34.400> it<00:01:34.520> after<00:01:34.880> we

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
so I moved it to doing it after we

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.740 
so I moved it to doing it after we
closed<00:01:36.140> as<00:01:36.350> well<00:01:36.380> and<00:01:36.860> she<00:01:37.790> seems<00:01:38.090> on<00:01:38.450> most

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
closed as well and she seems on most

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.510 
closed as well and she seems on most
days<00:01:38.990> she'd<00:01:39.290> won't<00:01:39.500> try<00:01:39.680> to<00:01:39.740> escape<00:01:40.040> his<00:01:40.220> often

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
days she'd won't try to escape his often

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.670 
days she'd won't try to escape his often
sometimes<00:01:40.790> she<00:01:41.120> still<00:01:41.390> gets<00:01:41.870> the<00:01:42.080> urge<00:01:42.260> to<00:01:42.290> go

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
sometimes she still gets the urge to go

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.219 
sometimes she still gets the urge to go
exploring

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.870 

don't<00:01:47.229> stand<00:01:48.119> good<00:01:49.119> girl<00:01:49.420> I<00:01:50.579> started<00:01:51.579> treating

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
don't stand good girl I started treating

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.230 
don't stand good girl I started treating

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.580 
bowl of treats and then every time she
looked<00:01:58.090> at<00:01:58.270> me<00:01:58.420> when<00:01:58.600> I<00:01:58.810> responded<00:01:59.380> to<00:01:59.500> her

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
looked at me when I responded to her

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.289

name<00:01:59.770> I'd<00:01:59.979> get<00:02:00.189> click<00:02:00.520> and<00:02:00.759> give<00:02:00.939> her<00:02:01.060> a<00:02:01.090> treat

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
name I'd get click and give her a treat

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.449 
name I'd get click and give her a treat
right<00:02:01.509> away<00:02:01.719> and<00:02:02.140> we<00:02:02.859> did<00:02:03.009> that<00:02:03.159> for<00:02:03.369> a<00:02:03.429> couple

00:02:03.449 --> 00:02:03.459 
right away and we did that for a couple

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:04.919 
right away and we did that for a couple
of<00:02:03.759> days<00:02:03.909> just<00:02:03.939> to<00:02:04.299> get<00:02:04.390> her<00:02:04.479> used<00:02:04.630> to<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:04.810> idea

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
of days just to get her used to the idea
