what's in the box first there's a hex

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.089 
what's in the box first there's a hex
tool<00:00:25.500> here<00:00:25.910> this<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.300> bottom<00:00:28.289> base<00:00:28.769> plate

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
tool here this is the bottom base plate

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.260 
tool here this is the bottom base plate
that<00:00:29.279> attaches<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.789> your<00:00:29.939> camera<00:00:30.500> and<00:00:32.270> similar

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
to the VF 3 the viewfinder attaches to

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.880 
to the VF 3 the viewfinder attaches to
this<00:00:36.300> base<00:00:36.510> plate<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.500> works<00:00:37.680> as<00:00:37.860> a

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
this base plate so it works as a

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.760 
this base plate so it works as a
quick-release<00:00:38.160> system<00:00:39.559> there's<00:00:40.559> an

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
quick-release system there's an

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.709 
quick-release system there's an

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
it here you go this is the V f4 now I've

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.020 
it here you go this is the V f4 now I've
unboxed<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:58.920> already<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.460> try<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.670> put<00:00:59.940> it

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
unboxed this already and I try to put it

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.439 
unboxed this already and I try to put it
back<00:01:00.289> the<00:01:01.289> way<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.469> was<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:02.550> if<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.910> looks<00:01:02.940> used

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
back the way it was so if it looks used

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.219 
back the way it was so if it looks used
it<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.899> used<00:01:03.930> because<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.619> used<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:05.090> anyways

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
it is used because I used it anyways

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.920 
it is used because I used it anyways
this<00:01:07.229> bottom<00:01:08.130> bracket<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.850> pointing<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.810> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
this bottom bracket is pointing in the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.320 
this bottom bracket is pointing in the
opposite<00:01:10.290> direction<00:01:10.409> just<00:01:10.950> for<00:01:11.189> packaging<00:01:11.760> so

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
opposite direction just for packaging so

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.580 
opposite direction just for packaging so
when<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.689> get<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.049> you're<00:01:13.170> gonna<00:01:13.290> want<00:01:13.530> to

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
when you get it you're gonna want to

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.960 
when you get it you're gonna want to
flip<00:01:13.770> this<00:01:13.920> around<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.640> first<00:01:14.850> thing

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
flip this around so the first thing

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.880 
flip this around so the first thing
you're<00:01:15.119> gonna<00:01:15.210> do<00:01:15.420> just<00:01:16.350> take<00:01:16.530> off<00:01:16.710> these

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
you're gonna do just take off these

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.350 
you're gonna do just take off these
sides<00:01:17.189> here<00:01:18.380> take<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.530> bracket<00:01:20.090> just<00:01:21.090> flip<00:01:21.330> it

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
sides here take the bracket just flip it

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.160 
sides here take the bracket just flip it
around<00:01:21.830> and<00:01:22.830> then<00:01:22.950> put<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.689> screws<00:01:24.689> back<00:01:24.720> on

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
around and then put the screws back on

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:34.880 
around and then put the screws back on
the<00:01:25.259> side<00:01:29.930> and<00:01:30.930> that's<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.520> so<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:33.500> quick<00:01:34.500> look

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
the side and that's it so a quick look

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.499 
the side and that's it so a quick look
it's<00:01:35.189> slightly<00:01:35.520> different<00:01:35.909> than<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.270> VF<00:01:36.479> 3

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
it's slightly different than the VF 3

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.330 
it's slightly different than the VF 3
that<00:01:36.840> was<00:01:36.960> announced<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.560> little<00:01:37.979> while<00:01:38.130> ago

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
that was announced a little while ago

that was announced a little while ago
there's<00:01:38.700> some<00:01:38.850> some<00:01:39.659> small<00:01:39.990> minor<00:01:40.320> changes

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
there's some some small minor changes

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.950 
there's some some small minor changes
overall<00:01:41.700> everything's<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.360> same<00:01:42.390> but<00:01:42.600> these

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
overall everything's the same but these

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.749 
overall everything's the same but these
knobs<00:01:43.409> here<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.920> side<00:01:44.100> are<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.369> little<00:01:44.549> bit

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
knobs here on the side are a little bit

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:45.230 
knobs here on the side are a little bit
bigger

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
bigger

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.179 
bigger
they're<00:01:45.659> knurled<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.380> they're<00:01:46.530> textured<00:01:47.070> so

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
they're knurled so they're textured so

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.620 
they're knurled so they're textured so
you<00:01:47.280> can<00:01:47.430> grip<00:01:47.670> them<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:47.970> really<00:01:48.180> tighten

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
you can grip them and really tighten

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.950 
you can grip them and really tighten
them<00:01:48.810> down<00:01:49.310> as<00:01:50.310> well<00:01:50.490> as<00:01:50.640> down<00:01:50.820> here<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.720> hex

them<00:02:00.509> plenty<00:02:01.020> tight<00:02:01.350> with<00:02:01.619> just<00:02:01.880> tightening

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
them plenty tight with just tightening

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.730 
them plenty tight with just tightening
them<00:02:03.030> up<00:02:03.149> with<00:02:03.299> your<00:02:03.329> fingers<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:03.960> don't<00:02:04.619> worry

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
them up with your fingers so don't worry

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.719 
them up with your fingers so don't worry
about<00:02:04.860> that

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
about that

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.169 
about that
but<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:07.409> hex<00:02:07.649> tool<00:02:07.920> also<00:02:08.160> works<00:02:08.520> at<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.879> base

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
but the hex tool also works at the base

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.839 
but the hex tool also works at the base
plate<00:02:09.709> so<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:10.770> can<00:02:10.950> really<00:02:11.430> talk<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.700> down

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
plate so you can really talk you down

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.460 
plate so you can really talk you down
under<00:02:12.090> your<00:02:12.209> camera<00:02:12.599> here

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
under your camera here

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.720 
under your camera here
keep<00:02:13.710> that<00:02:13.890> from<00:02:14.070> slipping<00:02:14.430> under<00:02:14.610> your

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
keep that from slipping under your

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.270 
keep that from slipping under your
camera<00:02:15.060> there's<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.330> red<00:02:15.630> pad<00:02:15.930> here<00:02:16.320> that<00:02:16.500> is<00:02:16.680> a

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
camera there's a red pad here that is a

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.550 
camera there's a red pad here that is a
non-slip<00:02:18.210> but<00:02:18.990> you<00:02:19.050> could<00:02:19.200> still<00:02:19.380> use<00:02:19.410> a

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
non-slip but you could still use a

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.280 
non-slip but you could still use a
quarter<00:02:19.890> because<00:02:20.130> it's<00:02:20.430> slotted<00:02:20.850> as<00:02:20.970> well<00:02:21.290> so

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
quarter because it's slotted as well so

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.070 
quarter because it's slotted as well so
anyways<00:02:22.640> another<00:02:23.640> change<00:02:24.120> on<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.480> vf4<00:02:24.930> as

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
anyways another change on the vf4 as

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.530 
anyways another change on the vf4 as
opposed<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.560> vf3<00:02:26.190> is<00:02:26.400> this<00:02:27.030> bracket<00:02:27.510> is

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
opposed to the vf3 is this bracket is

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.850 
opposed to the vf3 is this bracket is
pushed<00:02:27.870> back<00:02:28.110> a<00:02:28.170> little<00:02:28.440> bit

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
pushed back a little bit

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.920 
pushed back a little bit
the<00:02:29.220> vf3<00:02:29.760> was<00:02:29.910> pretty<00:02:30.210> close<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.690> camera

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
the vf3 was pretty close to the camera

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.930 
the vf3 was pretty close to the camera
body<00:02:31.260> so<00:02:31.770> it<00:02:32.010> would<00:02:32.160> obstruct<00:02:32.520> some<00:02:32.790> of<00:02:32.880> the

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
body so it would obstruct some of the

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.420 
body so it would obstruct some of the
buttons<00:02:33.300> so<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:34.050> vf4<00:02:34.470> has<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:34.860> bracket<00:02:35.070> push

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
buttons so the vf4 has that bracket push

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.860 
buttons so the vf4 has that bracket push
back<00:02:35.670> now<00:02:35.910> so<00:02:36.150> that's<00:02:36.330> an<00:02:36.450> improved<00:02:36.780> design

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
back now so that's an improved design

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.770 
back now so that's an improved design
there<00:02:37.500> but<00:02:38.220> as<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.370> can<00:02:38.550> see<00:02:38.610> to<00:02:39.060> this<00:02:39.510> bracket

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
there but as you can see to this bracket

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.810 
there but as you can see to this bracket
is<00:02:40.020> a<00:02:40.080> little<00:02:40.380> bit<00:02:40.500> short<00:02:40.800> so<00:02:41.160> it's<00:02:41.310> not<00:02:41.490> going

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
is a little bit short so it's not going

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.790 
is a little bit short so it's not going
to<00:02:41.940> support<00:02:42.120> at<00:02:42.480> all<00:02:42.720> camera<00:02:43.290> or<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.500> battery

the<00:03:42.090> Canon<00:03:42.570> t4i<00:03:43.140> now<00:03:43.739> you<00:03:43.799> know<00:03:44.040> this<00:03:44.220> is<00:03:44.370> a

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
the Canon t4i now you know this is a

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.680

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
wide screen wide LCD screen 3.2 inch so

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.310 
wide screen wide LCD screen 3.2 inch so
the<00:03:48.959> VF<00:03:49.320> 4<00:03:49.620> is<00:03:49.920> actually<00:03:50.600> wider<00:03:51.600> than<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:52.049> VF<00:03:52.290> 3

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
the VF 4 is actually wider than the VF 3

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.620
