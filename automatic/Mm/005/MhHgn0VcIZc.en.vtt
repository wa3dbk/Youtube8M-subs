ask themselves you know i'll be really

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.270 
ask themselves you know i'll be really
doing<00:01:26.759> everything<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.270> we<00:01:27.479> can<00:01:27.650> in<00:01:28.650> order<00:01:28.979> to

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
doing everything that we can in order to

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.450 
doing everything that we can in order to
minimize<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:30.000> if<00:01:30.950> we<00:01:31.950> would<00:01:32.159> have<00:01:32.280> had<00:01:32.430> no

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
minimize that if we would have had no

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.670 
minimize that if we would have had no
violence<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:34.500> world<00:01:34.710> before<00:01:35.640> movies<00:01:36.680> then

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
violence in the world before movies then

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.050 
violence in the world before movies then
i<00:01:37.710> would<00:01:37.979> say<00:01:38.189> i<00:01:38.220> think<00:01:38.610> we<00:01:38.700> should<00:01:38.880> look

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
i would say i think we should look

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.969 
i would say i think we should look
seriously<00:01:39.450> at<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.720> movies<00:01:40.079> maybe<00:01:40.710> they've

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
seriously at the movies maybe they've

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.740 
seriously at the movies maybe they've
brought<00:01:41.220> about<00:01:41.520> violence<00:01:42.030> but<00:01:42.329> i<00:01:42.390> don't<00:01:42.720> think

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
brought about violence but i don't think

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.380 
brought about violence but i don't think
