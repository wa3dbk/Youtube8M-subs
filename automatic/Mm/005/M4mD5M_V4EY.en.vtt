 that dotted tasty dot tasty dot 

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:50.940

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.120
 we had the name ceviche 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.420
 but as I do not know, it was not patented 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.480
 because a plate then we 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.659
 We chose to look for a name because 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.420
 here the dishes are very rich and the 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:08.670
 clients come back and come back I think that 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.530
 they themselves are recommended used the 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.440
 dishes expressly because it's not worth it 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.299
 more or less of the Peruvian cuisine because 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.549
 It is also listed as one of the most 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.560

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.930

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.800
 there is a dish that calls us a lot 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.170
 Attention 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.180
 years that we were here because we did not 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.760
 talk about what the dish is about 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:54.940
 that dish is constituted the pique or 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:02:01.250
 The fisherman is a hot and cold dish 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:06.350

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:14.060
