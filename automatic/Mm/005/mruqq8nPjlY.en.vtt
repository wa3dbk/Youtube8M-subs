to get a good idea of what's happening
normal<00:00:15.360> screens<00:00:15.630> up<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.900> now<00:00:16.550> and<00:00:17.550> then<00:00:17.670> we<00:00:17.760> get

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
normal screens up to now and then we get

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.540 
normal screens up to now and then we get
this<00:00:18.150> message<00:00:18.840> straight<00:00:19.650> away<00:00:19.949> now<00:00:20.189> why

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
this message straight away now why

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.929 
this message straight away now why
normally<00:00:21.240> in<00:00:21.480> maybe<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:22.199> desktop<00:00:23.070> computer<00:00:23.699> and

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
normally in maybe a desktop computer and

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.630 
normally in maybe a desktop computer and
laptop<00:00:24.289> no<00:00:25.289> book<00:00:25.500> anything<00:00:25.890> like<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.099> that

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
laptop no book anything like that that

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.040 
laptop no book anything like that that
normally<00:00:27.000> means<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.510> hard<00:00:27.689> drivers

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
normally means that the hard drivers

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.919 
normally means that the hard drivers
stopped<00:00:28.289> working<00:00:29.359> now<00:00:30.359> I'm<00:00:30.480> thinking<00:00:30.900> that

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
stopped working now I'm thinking that

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.319 
stopped working now I'm thinking that
that<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.859> what's<00:00:32.160> happened<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:32.669> this<00:00:32.820> case<00:00:33.059> and

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
that is what's happened in this case and

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.630 
that is what's happened in this case and
I<00:00:33.390> don't<00:00:33.600> think<00:00:33.750> that's<00:00:33.989> going<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.290> be<00:00:34.380> able

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
I don't think that's going to be able

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.560 
I don't think that's going to be able
there's<00:00:35.640> going<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.790> be<00:00:35.850> anything<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.210> we<00:00:36.390> can

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
there's going to be anything that we can

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.470 
there's going to be anything that we can
do<00:00:36.780> another<00:00:37.680> reason<00:00:37.980> for<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:39.000> because<00:00:39.059> of

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
do another reason for that is because of

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.420 
do another reason for that is because of
the<00:00:39.570> type<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.780> fire<00:00:40.140> drive<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.620> computer<00:00:41.190> has

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
the type of fire drive this computer has

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.330 
the type of fire drive this computer has
it's<00:00:42.210> what's<00:00:42.390> called<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.780> SSD<00:00:43.290> drive<00:00:44.070> our

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
it's what's called a SSD drive our

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.510 
it's what's called a SSD drive our
solid-state<00:00:45.030> drive<00:00:45.450> it's<00:00:46.350> hard<00:00:47.160> drive<00:00:47.370> the

to<00:00:58.530> do<00:00:58.649> with<00:00:58.800> this<00:00:58.890> now<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.340> just<00:00:59.489> take<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.960> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
to do with this now is just take it the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.799 
to do with this now is just take it the
PCs<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.469> make<00:01:01.620> sure<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:03.030> sort<00:01:03.750> of

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
PCs to make sure that that sort of

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.830 
PCs to make sure that that sort of
circuit<00:01:04.260> board<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.650> it'll<00:01:04.769> be<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.519> okay<00:01:06.000> if

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
circuit board and it'll be is okay if

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.380 
circuit board and it'll be is okay if
the<00:01:06.900> netbook<00:01:07.799> for<00:01:08.220> example<00:01:08.670> has<00:01:08.760> been<00:01:08.790> dropped

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
the netbook for example has been dropped

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.660 
the netbook for example has been dropped
it<00:01:09.600> could<00:01:09.720> have<00:01:09.810> become<00:01:09.930> dislodged<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.890> there

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
it could have become dislodged and there

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.670 
it could have become dislodged and there
the<00:01:11.760> contact<00:01:12.180> being<00:01:12.360> lost<00:01:12.570> so<00:01:13.320> I'm<00:01:13.500> going<00:01:13.650> to

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
the contact being lost so I'm going to

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.410 
the contact being lost so I'm going to
be<00:01:13.770> doing<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.100> next<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.640> see<00:01:14.850> what<00:01:15.000> we<00:01:15.090> find

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
be doing that next to see what we find

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.030 
be doing that next to see what we find
ok<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.689> we've<00:01:15.900> got<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.140> netbook<00:01:16.530> here<00:01:16.830> and

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
ok so we've got the netbook here and

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.770 
ok so we've got the netbook here and
when<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.580> just<00:01:17.880> pick<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.210> up<00:01:18.299> now<00:01:18.509> I'm<00:01:18.630> just

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
when I just pick it up now I'm just

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.710 
when I just pick it up now I'm just
taking<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.140> bottom<00:01:19.500> cover<00:01:19.740> off<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:21.150> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
taking this bottom cover off this is the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.940 
taking this bottom cover off this is the
RAM<00:01:22.229> there<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.689> the<00:01:24.689> hard<00:01:25.200> drive<00:01:25.320> shall<00:01:25.860> we

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
RAM there and the hard drive shall we

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.800 
RAM there and the hard drive shall we
say<00:01:26.130> there<00:01:26.460> will<00:01:27.450> be<00:01:27.479> taking<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.049> out

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
say there will be taking that out

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.230 
say there will be taking that out
not<00:01:30.320> really<00:01:30.470> going<00:01:30.650> to<00:01:30.740> be<00:01:30.799> able<00:01:30.860> to<00:01:31.210> deal<00:01:32.210> with

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
not really going to be able to deal with

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.820 
not really going to be able to deal with
with<00:01:32.510> it<00:01:32.600> apart<00:01:32.780> from<00:01:32.900> maybe<00:01:33.110> have<00:01:33.320> a<00:01:33.350> look<00:01:33.590> and

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
with it apart from maybe have a look and

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.850 
with it apart from maybe have a look and
then<00:01:34.130> put<00:01:34.340> it<00:01:34.430> back<00:01:34.460> to<00:01:35.260> effectively<00:01:36.260> receipt

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
then put it back to effectively receipt

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.270 
then put it back to effectively receipt
it<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:38.270> see<00:01:38.479> if<00:01:38.750> anything<00:01:39.440> happens<00:01:39.770> okay<00:01:39.830> here

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
it to see if anything happens okay here

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.270 
it to see if anything happens okay here
we<00:01:40.430> are<00:01:40.460> this<00:01:40.759> is<00:01:40.820> the<00:01:41.270> hard<00:01:41.900> drive<00:01:42.259> SSD<00:01:42.979> solid

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
we are this is the hard drive SSD solid

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.480 
we are this is the hard drive SSD solid
state<00:01:43.790> hard<00:01:43.820> drive<00:01:44.770> he<00:01:45.770> got<00:01:45.950> two<00:01:46.190> chips

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
state hard drive he got two chips

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.200 
state hard drive he got two chips
they're<00:01:46.790> quite<00:01:47.149> big<00:01:47.330> ones<00:01:47.509> obviously<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:49.210> two

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
they're quite big ones obviously and two

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.080 
they're quite big ones obviously and two
more<00:01:50.630> their<00:01:51.170> same<00:01:51.530> size<00:01:51.890> that's<00:01:52.460> smaller<00:01:52.850> one

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
more their same size that's smaller one

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.719 
more their same size that's smaller one
that's<00:01:53.450> probably<00:01:53.690> the<00:01:54.409> controller<00:01:55.130> for<00:01:55.520> it

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
that's probably the controller for it

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.780 
that's probably the controller for it
but<00:01:56.659> yeah<00:01:57.110> that's<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:57.619> whole<00:01:58.070> thing<00:01:58.430> really

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
but yeah that's the whole thing really

eight gig of her drive for the computer

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.850 
eight gig of her drive for the computer
that<00:02:04.490> is<00:02:04.670> looking<00:02:04.850> at<00:02:05.030> it<00:02:05.300> there's<00:02:05.570> no<00:02:06.170> visible

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
that is looking at it there's no visible

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.620 
that is looking at it there's no visible
signs<00:02:07.190> whatsoever<00:02:07.460> that<00:02:08.060> there's<00:02:08.239> problems

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
signs whatsoever that there's problems

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.610 
signs whatsoever that there's problems
with<00:02:08.720> it<00:02:09.250> and<00:02:10.250> there<00:02:10.399> won't<00:02:10.489> be<00:02:10.640> really<00:02:11.620> when

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
with it and there won't be really when

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.270 
with it and there won't be really when
it<00:02:12.739> comes<00:02:12.890> to<00:02:13.720> items<00:02:14.720> like<00:02:14.930> this<00:02:15.280> there's

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
it comes to items like this there's

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.250 
it comes to items like this there's
absolutely<00:02:16.700> no<00:02:17.060> moving<00:02:17.540> past<00:02:17.810> there<00:02:18.050> whatever

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
absolutely no moving past there whatever

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.870 
absolutely no moving past there whatever
so<00:02:18.739> there's<00:02:19.700> no<00:02:19.850> way<00:02:20.090> really<00:02:20.390> that<00:02:20.569> it<00:02:20.959> can

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
so there's no way really that it can

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.830 
so there's no way really that it can
sort<00:02:22.880> of<00:02:22.940> physically<00:02:23.390> fail<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:24.890> sort<00:02:25.700> of<00:02:25.840> move

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
sort of physically fail to sort of move

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.630 
sort of physically fail to sort of move
in<00:02:27.050> power<00:02:27.380> wise<00:02:27.709> because<00:02:27.920> there<00:02:28.100> aren't<00:02:28.250> any

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
in power wise because there aren't any

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.120 
in power wise because there aren't any
so<00:02:29.569> what's<00:02:30.019> going<00:02:30.170> to<00:02:30.200> be<00:02:30.290> happening<00:02:30.410> I<00:02:30.830> think

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
so what's going to be happening I think

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.460 
so what's going to be happening I think
is<00:02:31.610> maybe<00:02:31.819> this<00:02:31.970> control<00:02:32.480> chip<00:02:33.170> if<00:02:33.290> that's

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
is maybe this control chip if that's

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.080 
is maybe this control chip if that's
what<00:02:33.620> it<00:02:33.709> is

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
what it is

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.130 
what it is
or<00:02:35.090> maybe<00:02:35.269> something<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.750> do<00:02:35.930> with<00:02:36.019> the

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
or maybe something to do with the

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.050 
or maybe something to do with the
connection<00:02:36.350> weather<00:02:36.769> come<00:02:37.010> into<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:37.549> and<00:02:37.670> sort

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
connection weather come into it and sort

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.780 
connection weather come into it and sort
of<00:02:38.120> why<00:02:38.239> they<00:02:38.450> go<00:02:38.630> off<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:39.079> either<00:02:39.769> side<00:02:39.980> of<00:02:40.519> a

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
of why they go off to either side of a

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.759 
of why they go off to either side of a
circuit<00:02:41.239> board<00:02:41.450> is<00:02:42.079> what's<00:02:42.530> going<00:02:42.650> to<00:02:42.709> be

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
circuit board is what's going to be

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.610 
circuit board is what's going to be
falling<00:02:43.160> down<00:02:43.340> because<00:02:43.760> really<00:02:44.079> the<00:02:45.079> computer

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
falling down because really the computer

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.710 
falling down because really the computer
can't<00:02:46.090> sort<00:02:47.090> of<00:02:47.120> access<00:02:47.510> there<00:02:47.750> at<00:02:48.440> least<00:02:48.680> so

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
can't sort of access there at least so

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.729 
can't sort of access there at least so
that's<00:02:50.720> pretty<00:02:50.870> much<00:02:51.049> it<00:02:51.260> I'm<00:02:51.380> afraid

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
that's pretty much it I'm afraid

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.580 
that's pretty much it I'm afraid
I<00:02:51.890> just<00:02:52.160> moving<00:02:52.489> on<00:02:52.640> with<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:54.140> netbook

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
I just moving on with the the netbook

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.620 
I just moving on with the the netbook
now<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.310> I'll<00:02:55.400> do<00:02:55.640> hard<00:02:55.940> drive<00:02:56.150> is<00:02:56.269> back<00:02:56.420> in

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
now and I'll do hard drive is back in

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.380 
now and I'll do hard drive is back in
it's<00:02:57.340> just<00:02:58.340> which<00:02:58.519> you<00:02:58.700> know<00:02:58.850> and<00:02:59.000> see<00:02:59.150> what<00:02:59.299> we

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
it's just which you know and see what we

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.990 
it's just which you know and see what we
get

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.830 

say<00:03:03.420> I'm<00:03:03.540> screen<00:03:04.010> okay<00:03:05.010> Sam<00:03:05.370> again<00:03:05.670> right<00:03:06.510> so

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
say I'm screen okay Sam again right so

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.390 
say I'm screen okay Sam again right so
just<00:03:07.410> taking<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.710> hard<00:03:07.890> drive<00:03:08.130> out<00:03:08.160> and

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
just taking the hard drive out and

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.460 
just taking the hard drive out and
putting<00:03:08.520> it<00:03:08.670> back<00:03:08.760> in<00:03:09.120> effectively<00:03:10.020> reseat

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
putting it back in effectively reseat

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.490 
putting it back in effectively reseat
and<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:10.740> wasn't<00:03:11.190> what<00:03:11.670> it<00:03:11.790> needed<00:03:12.230> this<00:03:13.230> is

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
and it wasn't what it needed this is

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.710 
and it wasn't what it needed this is
going<00:03:13.740> to<00:03:13.890> need<00:03:14.040> a<00:03:14.070> new<00:03:14.520> hard<00:03:14.880> drive<00:03:15.180> now<00:03:15.450> and

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
going to need a new hard drive now and

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.220 
going to need a new hard drive now and
so<00:03:16.590> that's<00:03:17.190> pretty<00:03:17.340> much<00:03:17.460> it<00:03:17.550> I'm<00:03:17.760> afraid<00:03:17.880> for

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
so that's pretty much it I'm afraid for

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.060 
so that's pretty much it I'm afraid for
this<00:03:20.180> netbook<00:03:21.180> itself<00:03:21.750> quite<00:03:22.350> unfortunate

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
this netbook itself quite unfortunate

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.500 
this netbook itself quite unfortunate
but<00:03:23.720> unfortunately<00:03:24.720> it<00:03:24.960> does<00:03:25.140> happen<00:03:25.640> so<00:03:26.640> yeah

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
but unfortunately it does happen so yeah

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.750 
but unfortunately it does happen so yeah
that's<00:03:27.900> that<00:03:28.020> but<00:03:28.320> if<00:03:28.440> you've<00:03:28.620> got<00:03:28.830> any<00:03:29.340> issues

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
that's that but if you've got any issues

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.410 
that's that but if you've got any issues
with<00:03:30.660> your<00:03:30.690> own<00:03:31.250> netbook<00:03:32.250> that<00:03:32.610> you'd<00:03:33.120> like<00:03:33.270> us

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
with your own netbook that you'd like us

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.610 
with your own netbook that you'd like us
to<00:03:33.450> take<00:03:33.690> a<00:03:33.720> look<00:03:33.930> at<00:03:34.050> oh<00:03:34.140> you've<00:03:34.320> got<00:03:34.470> any

to take a look at oh you've got any

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.660
