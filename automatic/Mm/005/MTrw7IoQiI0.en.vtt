wanted to check one of those out and

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.979 
wanted to check one of those out and
then<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.040> was<00:00:32.130> also<00:00:32.309> looking<00:00:32.520> for<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> case<00:00:33.210> for

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
then I was also looking for a case for

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.729 
then I was also looking for a case for
my<00:00:34.020> panasonic<00:00:34.730> zs3<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:36.600> these<00:00:37.170> are<00:00:37.500> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
my panasonic zs3 and so these are the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.619 
my panasonic zs3 and so these are the
three<00:00:37.980> cases<00:00:38.550> they<00:00:38.640> sent<00:00:38.879> me<00:00:38.969> they<00:00:39.270> did<00:00:39.450> send

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
three cases they sent me they did send

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.690 
three cases they sent me they did send
me<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> fourth<00:00:40.079> case<00:00:40.320> but<00:00:41.250> as<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.489> right<00:00:41.550> now

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
me a fourth case but as of right now

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.580 
me a fourth case but as of right now
that<00:00:42.030> case<00:00:42.239> has<00:00:42.390> actually<00:00:42.719> been<00:00:42.809> discontinued

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
that case has actually been discontinued

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.080 
that case has actually been discontinued
and<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:43.950> can't<00:00:44.399> actually<00:00:44.579> review<00:00:45.000> it

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
and so I can't actually review it

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.000 
and so I can't actually review it
because<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.329> can't<00:00:45.539> actually<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:46.710> know<00:00:46.829> show

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010

you guys would it give you guys the
price<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.280> can't<00:00:50.460> actually<00:00:50.579> buy<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.879> so

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.730 
see the case is pretty ballsy so not not
a<00:01:43.020> real<00:01:43.320> good<00:01:43.590> fit<00:01:43.920> for<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.399> zed<00:01:44.670> s<00:01:44.850> 3<00:01:45.740> like

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
a real good fit for the zed s 3 like

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.410 
a real good fit for the zed s 3 like
they<00:01:46.890> said<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.189> was<00:01:47.280> going<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.579> be<00:01:47.700> however<00:01:47.939> if

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
they said it was going to be however if

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.480 
they said it was going to be however if
i<00:01:48.689> will<00:01:49.020> go<00:01:49.170> with<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.439> camera<00:01:49.979> that's<00:01:50.369> a

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
i will go with the camera that's a

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.960 
i will go with the camera that's a
little<00:01:50.610> bit<00:01:50.820> smaller<00:01:51.149> like<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.399> my<00:01:53.399> older<00:01:53.790> a

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
little bit smaller like this my older a

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.069 
little bit smaller like this my older a
canon<00:01:54.479> powershot<00:01:55.790> sd780<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.450> camera<00:01:57.899> will

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
canon powershot sd780 the camera will

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.789 
canon powershot sd780 the camera will
actually<00:01:58.500> fit<00:01:58.909> underneath<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.469> elastic<00:02:01.469> here

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
actually fit underneath the elastic here

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.539 
actually fit underneath the elastic here
and<00:02:02.119> it<00:02:03.119> fits<00:02:03.540> in<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:04.020> fits<00:02:04.409> in<00:02:04.619> no<00:02:04.950> problem<00:02:05.340> and

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
and it fits in it fits in no problem and

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.800 
and it fits in it fits in no problem and
there<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.820> there<00:02:05.909> isn't<00:02:06.210> nearly<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.630> same

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
there and there isn't nearly the same

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.290 
there and there isn't nearly the same
tension<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:07.920> basically<00:02:08.340> for<00:02:08.550> smaller<00:02:08.819> cameras

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
tension so basically for smaller cameras

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.999 
tension so basically for smaller cameras
this<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.629> nice<00:02:09.840> case<00:02:10.170> there's<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.800> little

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
this is a nice case there's a little

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.840 
this is a nice case there's a little
mesh

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
mesh

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.490 
mesh
pouch<00:02:12.120> over<00:02:12.600> here<00:02:12.840> if<00:02:12.960> you<00:02:13.080> want<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.290> store

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
pouch over here if you want to store

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.470 
pouch over here if you want to store
memory<00:02:13.830> cards<00:02:14.280> or<00:02:14.400> even<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.670> second<00:02:15.060> battery

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
memory cards or even a second battery

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.020 
memory cards or even a second battery
there<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:16.230> yeah<00:02:16.380> overall<00:02:16.770> you<00:02:17.070> know<00:02:17.130> for<00:02:17.490> under

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
there so yeah overall you know for under

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.590 
there so yeah overall you know for under
ten<00:02:18.300> dollars<00:02:18.750> pretty<00:02:19.470> tough<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:20.040> beat<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:21.000> case

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
ten dollars pretty tough to beat a case

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.510 
ten dollars pretty tough to beat a case
brown<00:02:21.840> case<00:02:22.140> like<00:02:22.410> this<00:02:22.620> but<00:02:23.130> just<00:02:23.340> make<00:02:23.490> sure

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
brown case like this but just make sure

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.660 
brown case like this but just make sure
that<00:02:23.790> your<00:02:24.120> camera<00:02:24.450> is<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:25.710> sort<00:02:26.220> of<00:02:26.280> on<00:02:26.490> the

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
that your camera is a sort of on the

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.450 
that your camera is a sort of on the
smaller<00:02:27.150> slimmer<00:02:27.780> side<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:28.680> isn't<00:02:29.040> a

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
smaller slimmer side and it isn't a

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.070 
smaller slimmer side and it isn't a
camera<00:02:30.030> like<00:02:30.180> this<00:02:30.240> that<00:02:30.660> tends<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:30.930> be<00:02:30.990> a

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
camera like this that tends to be a

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.330 
camera like this that tends to be a
little<00:02:31.200> bit<00:02:31.410> thicker<00:02:31.650> one<00:02:31.920> of<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.070> reasons

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
little bit thicker one of the reasons

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.770 
little bit thicker one of the reasons
why<00:02:32.430> this<00:02:32.490> is<00:02:32.760> thicker<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:33.090> course<00:02:33.300> as<00:02:33.450> good<00:02:33.600> as

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
why this is thicker of course as good as

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.960 
why this is thicker of course as good as
this<00:02:33.900> lens<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.380> kind<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:34.560> pops<00:02:34.680> out<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.130> the

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
this lens it kind of pops out and the

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.730 
this lens it kind of pops out and the
grip<00:02:36.210> also<00:02:36.570> pops<00:02:36.780> out<00:02:36.960> a<00:02:36.990> little<00:02:37.140> bit<00:02:37.260> there<00:02:37.470> so

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
grip also pops out a little bit there so

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.870 
grip also pops out a little bit there so
that<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:39.740> case<00:02:40.740> crown<00:02:41.070> camera<00:02:41.670> case

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
that is the the case crown camera case

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.180 
that is the the case crown camera case

cents now the second thing I want to
look<00:02:46.050> at<00:02:46.200> here<00:02:46.410> this<00:02:46.620> is<00:02:46.860> their<00:02:47.040> hard<00:02:47.220> drive

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
look at here this is their hard drive

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.490 
look at here this is their hard drive
case<00:02:47.640> you'll<00:02:48.180> notice<00:02:48.480> it's<00:02:49.080> pretty<00:02:49.350> much<00:02:49.440> just

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
case you'll notice it's pretty much just

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.310 
case you'll notice it's pretty much just
a<00:02:49.980> bigger<00:02:50.310> case<00:02:50.670> a<00:02:51.060> bigger<00:02:51.540> version<00:02:51.840> than<00:02:52.290> the

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
a bigger case a bigger version than the

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.010 
a bigger case a bigger version than the
last<00:02:52.560> case<00:02:52.800> now<00:02:53.010> this<00:02:53.190> is<00:02:53.460> in<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:54.390> checkered

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
last case now this is in a checkered

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.480 
last case now this is in a checkered
pattern<00:02:55.230> they<00:02:55.470> offer<00:02:55.620> it<00:02:55.800> in<00:02:55.890> black<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:56.160> I

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
pattern they offer it in black and I

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.390 
pattern they offer it in black and I
think<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.760> couple<00:02:56.970> other<00:02:57.360> colors<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.530> its

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
think a couple other colors and its

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.160 
think a couple other colors and its
really<00:02:59.730> simple<00:03:00.060> on<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.390> inside<00:03:00.690> so<00:03:00.990> what<00:03:01.110> I

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
really simple on the inside so what I

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.470 
really simple on the inside so what I
have<00:03:01.350> here<00:03:01.380> is<00:03:01.590> a<00:03:01.740> western<00:03:02.280> digital<00:03:02.480> passport

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
have here is a western digital passport

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.500 
have here is a western digital passport
hard<00:03:04.080> drive<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:04.710> as<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.430> can<00:03:05.580> see<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:06.360> hard

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
hard drive and as you can see the hard

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.940 
hard drive and as you can see the hard
drive<00:03:06.690> fits<00:03:06.900> in<00:03:07.080> you<00:03:07.320> know<00:03:07.410> really<00:03:07.620> really

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
drive fits in you know really really

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.180 
drive fits in you know really really
nicely<00:03:08.540> it's<00:03:09.540> snug<00:03:10.050> but<00:03:10.320> not<00:03:10.350> too<00:03:10.680> snug<00:03:10.950> and

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
nicely it's snug but not too snug and

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.510 
nicely it's snug but not too snug and
then<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.850> USB<00:03:12.360> cable<00:03:12.390> can<00:03:13.230> go<00:03:13.440> in<00:03:13.770> the<00:03:14.310> side

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
then the USB cable can go in the side

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.750 
then the USB cable can go in the side
here<00:03:14.850> so<00:03:15.330> really<00:03:15.780> simple<00:03:16.320> you<00:03:17.190> can<00:03:17.340> zipper<00:03:17.670> it

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
here so really simple you can zipper it

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.030 
here so really simple you can zipper it
close<00:03:18.060> it<00:03:18.390> is<00:03:18.630> a<00:03:18.660> little<00:03:19.110> bit<00:03:19.230> of<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.410> tight<00:03:19.650> fit

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
close it is a little bit of a tight fit

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.460 
close it is a little bit of a tight fit
but<00:03:20.280> overall<00:03:20.940> it's<00:03:21.270> not<00:03:21.450> too<00:03:21.600> bad<00:03:21.810> you<00:03:22.170> can<00:03:22.320> see

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
but overall it's not too bad you can see

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.590 
but overall it's not too bad you can see
there's<00:03:22.650> a<00:03:22.710> bit<00:03:23.070> of<00:03:23.100> a<00:03:23.220> lump<00:03:23.520> there<00:03:23.820> where<00:03:24.390> the

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
there's a bit of a lump there where the

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.630 
there's a bit of a lump there where the
case<00:03:25.110> is<00:03:25.140> but<00:03:25.770> it<00:03:25.890> definitely<00:03:26.070> works<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:26.580> this

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
case is but it definitely works and this

hold it but then look how high it holds
it<00:05:13.870> so<00:05:15.180> this<00:05:16.180> case<00:05:16.570> as<00:05:16.750> far<00:05:16.900> as<00:05:16.990> I'm<00:05:17.110> concerned

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
it so this case as far as I'm concerned

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.320 
it so this case as far as I'm concerned
is<00:05:17.650> pretty<00:05:17.830> much<00:05:17.920> a<00:05:17.980> complete<00:05:18.190> failure<00:05:18.730> um<00:05:19.150> it

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
is pretty much a complete failure um it

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.110 
is pretty much a complete failure um it
looks<00:05:19.360> like<00:05:19.720> it<00:05:19.900> was<00:05:20.050> built<00:05:20.110> for<00:05:21.120> larger

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
looks like it was built for larger

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.650 
looks like it was built for larger
netbooks<00:05:22.690> like<00:05:22.870> maybe<00:05:23.110> something<00:05:23.650> in<00:05:23.890> the<00:05:24.660> 11

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
netbooks like maybe something in the 11

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.840 
netbooks like maybe something in the 11
inch<00:05:25.840> screen<00:05:26.590> range<00:05:26.860> you<00:05:27.250> see<00:05:27.400> there's<00:05:27.580> about

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
inch screen range you see there's about

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.300 
inch screen range you see there's about
an<00:05:28.060> inch<00:05:28.300> about<00:05:28.840> an<00:05:28.930> inch<00:05:29.050> of<00:05:29.260> space<00:05:29.380> here<00:05:29.830> so<00:05:30.280> I

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
an inch about an inch of space here so I

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.420 
an inch about an inch of space here so I
yeah<00:05:31.300> I<00:05:31.330> I<00:05:31.840> truly<00:05:32.260> don't<00:05:32.530> get<00:05:32.740> this<00:05:32.920> case<00:05:33.190> i

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
yeah I I truly don't get this case i

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.620 
yeah I I truly don't get this case i
don't<00:05:33.610> i<00:05:33.760> don't<00:05:33.820> really<00:05:34.030> get<00:05:34.270> what<00:05:34.420> these

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
don't i don't really get what these

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.300 
don't i don't really get what these
things<00:05:34.660> are<00:05:35.140> I<00:05:35.200> mean<00:05:35.500> maybe<00:05:35.890> they're<00:05:36.100> supposed

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
things are I mean maybe they're supposed

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.220 
things are I mean maybe they're supposed
to<00:05:36.370> go<00:05:36.460> around<00:05:36.730> the<00:05:37.090> base<00:05:37.300> of<00:05:37.330> the<00:05:37.750> unit<00:05:37.930> but

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.230 
to go around the base of the unit but

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.880 
to go around the base of the unit but
you'd<00:05:38.650> have<00:05:38.830> to<00:05:38.890> have<00:05:39.220> a<00:05:39.520> netbook<00:05:40.210> that<00:05:40.450> was

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
you'd have to have a netbook that was

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.710 
you'd have to have a netbook that was
really<00:05:41.890> held<00:05:42.520> a<00:05:42.610> lot<00:05:42.730> bigger<00:05:43.000> frankly<00:05:43.540> in

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
really held a lot bigger frankly in

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.180 
really held a lot bigger frankly in
order<00:05:43.930> to<00:05:44.020> get<00:05:44.140> the<00:05:44.230> chassis<00:05:44.650> to<00:05:44.770> come<00:05:44.980> down

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
order to get the chassis to come down

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.610 
order to get the chassis to come down
here<00:05:45.220> which<00:05:46.000> again<00:05:46.270> I<00:05:46.420> I<00:05:46.570> totally<00:05:47.290> don't<00:05:47.380> get

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
here which again I I totally don't get

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.770 
here which again I I totally don't get
so<00:05:47.980> I<00:05:48.220> would<00:05:48.490> call<00:05:48.700> this<00:05:48.730> case<00:05:49.060> a<00:05:49.330> complete

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
so I would call this case a complete

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.140 
so I would call this case a complete
failure<00:05:50.050> if<00:05:50.860> you<00:05:51.070> do<00:05:51.280> want<00:05:51.490> to<00:05:51.610> buy<00:05:51.730> one<00:05:51.760> you're

of<00:06:27.100> sense<00:06:27.190> you<00:06:27.580> know<00:06:27.640> so<00:06:27.850> if<00:06:27.940> i<00:06:28.060> if<00:06:28.210> i<00:06:28.300> put<00:06:28.540> the

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:28.690 
of sense you know so if i if i put the

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.760 
of sense you know so if i if i put the
to<00:06:29.650> put<00:06:29.830> the<00:06:29.890> plastic<00:06:30.130> edges<00:06:30.850> around<00:06:31.090> the

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
to put the plastic edges around the

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.350 
to put the plastic edges around the
keyboard<00:06:32.770> here<00:06:33.280> so<00:06:33.580> down<00:06:33.730> at<00:06:33.820> the<00:06:33.910> bottom<00:06:34.090> i'm

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
keyboard here so down at the bottom i'm

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.180 
keyboard here so down at the bottom i'm
holding<00:06:34.720> it<00:06:34.840> in

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190 
holding it in

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.320 
holding it in
right<00:06:35.660> but<00:06:36.660> as<00:06:36.780> you<00:06:36.930> can<00:06:37.050> see<00:06:37.320> up<00:06:37.620> top<00:06:38.250> here

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330 
right but as you can see up top here

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.490 
right but as you can see up top here
again<00:06:39.330> yeah<00:06:39.510> this<00:06:39.660> is<00:06:39.810> a<00:06:39.840> little<00:06:39.930> bit<00:06:40.230> tricky

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 
again yeah this is a little bit tricky

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.830 
again yeah this is a little bit tricky
up<00:06:40.980> top<00:06:41.280> the<00:06:42.000> netbook<00:06:42.270> doesn't<00:06:42.540> even<00:06:42.630> reach

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 
up top the netbook doesn't even reach

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.680 
up top the netbook doesn't even reach
these<00:06:42.990> elastic<00:06:43.440> bands<00:06:43.680> so<00:06:43.980> yeah<00:06:44.250> again<00:06:44.520> I<00:06:45.180> have

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:45.690 
these elastic bands so yeah again I have

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:47.660 
these elastic bands so yeah again I have
no<00:06:45.870> idea<00:06:45.960> why<00:06:46.140> casecrown<00:06:46.710> says<00:06:47.040> this<00:06:47.280> is<00:06:47.430> for<00:06:47.640> a

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:47.670 
no idea why casecrown says this is for a

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.880 
no idea why casecrown says this is for a
10<00:06:48.030> inch<00:06:48.210> netbook<00:06:48.450> it<00:06:48.840> clearly<00:06:49.260> is<00:06:49.470> not<00:06:49.530> for<00:06:49.860> a

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:49.890 
10 inch netbook it clearly is not for a
