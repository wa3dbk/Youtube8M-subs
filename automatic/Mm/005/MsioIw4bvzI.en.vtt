real shock to the scientists came was in
2007<00:01:00.460> when<00:01:00.850> this<00:01:01.570> happened<00:01:02.050> and<00:01:03.539> their<00:01:04.539> phrase

2007 when this happened and their phrase
was<00:01:05.110> it<00:01:05.350> fell<00:01:05.619> off<00:01:05.800> a<00:01:05.830> cliff<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:08.080> then<00:01:08.440> the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
was it fell off a cliff and then the

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.330 
was it fell off a cliff and then the
extra<00:01:08.979> amount<00:01:09.100> that<00:01:09.550> melted<00:01:10.149> was<00:01:10.330> this<00:01:10.509> much
