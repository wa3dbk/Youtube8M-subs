00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 Welcome to Kassel from 12 and 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.850
 it looks like april the month 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.069
 the cpu cooler for me would be already 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.450
 the third merkel this time we'll see each other 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.040
 but no water cool 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.070
 today we will see each other's colleague 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.839
 Eat 2 to get some air 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.090
 this stands briefly flagship air cooler 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.410
 the apparently with big monsters the 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.359
 competition should compete 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.619
 but also cool with water as well 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.750
 this cooler is really and how 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.970
 It says that if we are in today 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.460
 this report out that is 1 2 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.500
 currently costs are the 83 euros what 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.870
 definitely not a low price though 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.820
 but very competing thanks a lot 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.050
 the conference together this beast of 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.050
 Air cooler for testing 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.410
 First of all, I have to say that is 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.300
 a really nice box inside 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.430
 this is the cpu cooler with 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.110
 the already pre-assembled fans 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.210
 so he is almost finished 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.739
 assembled for operation in the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.960
 did very nicely there of course all that 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.660
 screw directly plate and so on 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.190
 By the way, everything from metal the colleague 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.040
 also has its well-known fan 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.650
 plus a tube of thermal compound one 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.900
 tape a cable tie and 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.330
 a stickers last but not least the 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.430
 instructions this is the pools reprint 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.140
 the hot chiller has the original 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.210
 It looked similar but it was 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.560
 2 measure in fact 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.000
 made changes 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.040
 unfortunately I could not do the original 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.240
 I can not test against that 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.310
 compare each other 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.080
 but we can still do it against 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.520
 powerful water keel compare 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.090
 Immediately I 'll just have you 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.920
 say that the s2 is ethical to me 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.600
 I really like that here 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.030
 in my videos so often but 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.159
 then you have to handle me 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.530
 the design was somehow a behavior 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.329
 paired with the great look of this red 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.250
 the poster and because this cool so 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.780
 it is also huge 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.310
 mighty impression i like that 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.930
 fact that both fans for one 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.490
 right out of the box already 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.290
 I should only preassemble you 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.600
 let know that the middle fan 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.590
 between these two towers 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.540
 must be taken out of the 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.829
 radiator system incorporates 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.240
 However, no problems 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:08.810
 now you want the dimensions 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.830
 that cool know or 143 x 158 x 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.629
 167 mm 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.060
 this is a really big high cpu 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.489
 cooler 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.010
 So before you buy make sure 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.870
 that he is safe in your housing 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.420
 that fits in two makes of one 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.790
 asymmetrical break its use what 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.280
 cool and looks like it only means 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.380
 that you do not have an additional fan anymore 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.510
 but can attach to the left tower 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.040
 to remain realistic as many of us 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.599
 buy a third 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.160
 Lifter for such a cooler 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.470
 Thus, the cooling power through the 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.090
 little extra aluminum certainly still 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.319
 a little bit improves the fan 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.209
 with these standard 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.459
 Metal clamps attached to the towers 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.290
 no anti-vibration 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.940
 upholstery or similar needed there 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.959
 should be good anyway 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:56.709
 the right one is the pools gf 21 120 mm 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:59.440
 fan and in the middle of the gf100 40 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.150
 140 mm fan what so special about this 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.549
 fan and thus also on which it is called 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.290
 Two is that the fans are able 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.440
 are a minimum air 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.120
 rotation speed of 300 rpm 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.880
 thus achieving this would mean actually 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.670
 that one of the quietest pcs with 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.650
 his high end cpu cooler would have the 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.980
 gf100 20 white fans and rain 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.380
 speeds of around 300 to 1400 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:29.590
 inherit to a maximum airflow of 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:32.709
 68 06 10 and a level from 17 8 to 27 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.959
 3d image of gf100 40 white fan and 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.720
 Training speeds of around 300 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:41.350
 up to 1200 to a maximum 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:45.609
 Air flow of 70.0 18 and one 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:47.200
 noise level from 17 8 to 26 5 decibels 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:49.150
 you probably already know that 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.980
 this fan from fdp storage use 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.989
 make as a rear dynamic 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.120
 sliding bearing and the fan wing wheels 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.280
 can be removed with the 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.930
 possibility to catch up with the fans 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.470
 the life expectancy still further 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.269
 increase 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.220
 they are indeed high quality fans 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.709
 as expected, this is cool as well 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.269
 very heavy with its 1400 79 grams 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.250
 that means two is one 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:12.250
 Nickel plated suitcase contact surface and 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.609
 with a total of eight yes eight heatpipes 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.120
 equipped very very impressive 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:20.410
 Of course, all important 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:26.350
 socket supports intel lga 2011 11 50 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:32.680
 11 51 11 55 11 56 13 66 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:36.160
 775 amd am3 plus 1 3 1 2 plus 1 2 m 2 + 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.570
 11 2 and 11 1 1 this cpu cooler in 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.910
 my system has to be integrated 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.620
 sort of effortless except 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.120
 just that I only have two of my high 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.110
 profile memory module 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.300
 could install 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.030
 that's the case with most of them 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.920
 high end cpu coolers lowepro case should 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.630
 but they fit perfectly though you can 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:56.920
 Say goodbye black money of my msi 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.720
 time 97 xpc mainboards and msg xcs 770 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.700
 lightning is not quite up to it 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.260
 ie two match sees the 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.510
 still great in a case and 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.870
 huge now but overclock me 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.730
 my hot running inter read the same 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.800
 4770 k to determine how the 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:16.290
 he might strike second 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.290
 water cooler fascinate out of me 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.170
 So of course, not surprisingly 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.120
 the cooler well that it is quite 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.950
 able with the top models of the 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.920
 to keep up with all-in-one water coolers 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.150
 even member Kohl's own 360 cards 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.370
 I have not been here too long 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.750
 So all of them have been tested 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.590
 other coolers in my tables 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.630
 blown away 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.640
 well maybe not blown away 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.530
 Let's say it is indeed a little 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.840
 better so no doubt this cpu 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.460
 cooler has a good price performance 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.540
 ratio up at a price of around 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.460
 83 euros 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.490
 and it will be almost the same performance as 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.410
 Cool with heiko water 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.270
 That's impressive when idling 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.800
 this cool very very quiet you can 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.330
 almost the rotating fan blades 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.840
 look at the naked eye 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.410
 because of the low number of 300 in 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.320
 Neutral 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:27.720
 That means a very quiet PC operation 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.120
 is not guaranteed here, so to speak 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.650
 to sophisticated stuff on course 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.540
 full load the two fans then drive 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.160
 of course already high and will be too 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.440
 something loud water cooler like 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.570
 for example, the captain 360 though 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.100
 still loud I want that for a long time 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:43.200
 But we should not call one 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.700
 do not forget theme and that would be that 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.650
 dealers therefore per case 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.150
 memory storage we ourselves have seen 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.770
 I could only do two of my high profile 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.510
 I'm not installing my RAM modules 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.610
 sure if all four would fit in 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:55.200
 you would install the cooler the other way round 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.270
 On the other hand, I do not have that 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.340
 tried that's just also what 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:01.320
 Unfortunately we are at this big hai 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.030
 to expect air bracelets 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.770
 lowepro much Operative memory should 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:07.080
 but do not cause any problems 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.070
 and yes the installation was easy and 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.410
 was without problems 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:12.450
 wma at the wood cooler and you notice 

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:14.070
 Shut up that in two 

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:16.770
 Ranks on maximum cooling performance 

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:19.290
 built up is a great candidate 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:21.210
 for the high end e book reader market i 

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:23.190
 Then the cabbage would say two 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:25.680
 cpu cooler definitely recommend 

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:27.450
 really a bit cooler 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.310
