00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.409
 we went to see her the letter the goal 

00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:11.439
 as we can see that it is equivalent to the number 

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:14.299
 we remember that apart from the york that is coming 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:16.869
 they go in 10% increments 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.589
 enke thirty forty 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:21.890
 lalanne corresponds to 30 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.489
 we have writings 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:25.050
 in temple that 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.289
 and writing in 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:28.009
 italics 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:29.649
 let's see some examples 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:32.010
 for example 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.200
 corresponding with 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.670
 becky say 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.780
 heart 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.010
 if this country the sales at the end of the word is pronounced commune 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.010
 v 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.060
 we have here 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.060
 the region the people want to say 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.720
 and is formed by the goal 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.649
 the insufficient 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.269
 the measure in the end squeeze your card the station is mel 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.310
 and with this final 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.110
 estimate 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.120
 we will see later 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.880
 the goal 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.120
 message 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.690
 not to be confused with ala jala is another kind of details 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.110
 the actress 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.090
 franz kafka practice 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.670
 must leave we are standing after another foot we are saying goodbye people are 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.670
 down 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.460
 finally they would be 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.370
 in this sense 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:37.900
 the bad British law 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.600
 bad is wrong 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.630
 we had seen the letter t that the letter t will also lend malaysia to us 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.890
 before the French was alive when in fact the layout 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.020
 start down 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.360
 to the met as we are observing is also wrong the stroke begins 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.500
 from below and above 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.620
 we feel we are not alone photocopy 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.620
 the original stroke this down 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.360
 then we tactic in always from bottom to top to bottom to top 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.839
 right 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:15.819
 mansilla 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.620
 we practice two examples 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.449
 they are worth we have the word but 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:24.099
 the word what I said no and tails the mind 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.450
 what lo pallo with the commandments the tables simple view the nosequien and 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.819
 how many do not know what 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.789
 rye will not do it in vain and it has done in all the mobile sites 

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.849
 so 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.329
 half 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.069
 valentino 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.469
 we are doing 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:50.829
 these practices is worth the difference is that in the bread 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.079
 what is lamy 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.469
 the insufficient madrid 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:56.759
 and amplify 

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:59.249
 inside 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:01.039
 it is not practicable 

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:04.749
 saab then go down on that web page that are more information on 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:05.629
 line 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:10.060
 there that was not divided favor to avoid the drop in practices and 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.850
 Explanation 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.150
 olimpo tell directly the source of origin that this class 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:23.919
 as we have seen before in the mind has a writing error n in a 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:28.079
 conclave then it is always good to follow the guidelines of the same site 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:28.780
 why 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.229
 We can 7 neighborhood 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:34.659
 senators who are basic shekels we learn and it's also more 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.689
 elementals and they have internalized that afterwards they are harder to run 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:40.389
 then calamita 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:41.279
 remember 

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:44.279
 what is below 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:47.469
 down 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:48.670
 above 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.670
 just like here 

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:55.979
 down 

00:03:58.899 --> 00:04:01.959
 so much to do some works with the letter the uit 

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:04.659
 the ONU 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:07.549
 the goal 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:11.819
 There are people who like to excel very little and are people who do not 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.209
 valenzuela stopped let's go all 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.939
 then in the same practice of skiing in the 33rd minute 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.519
 ballet the 33 why out of Christ 

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:26.520
 then how we wrote the number 30 

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:29.759
 madrid the number three 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:33.189
 and this thing that is undocumented is the one that we have learned rambla lamented 

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:37.929
 more that I am not surprised is that it is the first and transparent beth guynn 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:41.129
 would this combination be the goal 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:43.969
 trenton rather 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:47.349
 and since we do not write, we remember that 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:49.229
 we wrote the 30 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.070
 i write pilots quotes and we write the train 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.400
 when these quotes are put forward the last number to admit that 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.969
 we are forming number in a word 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:04.090
 states quotes are special keys that the virgin has already 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.770
 in the Balearic Hebrew alphabet have contracts start 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.610
 with excellent experience level min how to use a little on the keyboard 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:16.389
 so 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:17.490
 two communes 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.169
 ing no less 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:20.060
 33
