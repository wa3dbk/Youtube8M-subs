 jatami with line here is put back 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.759
 with double because they only carry the car 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.299
 chromed at a traffic light and the traffic light 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.500
 it gave 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.189
 you just have to be caught with 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:27.140
 screws the size of my thumb 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:27.140
 it seems like you're going to give it because it's easy 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.079
 the truth I did not remember I did not remember 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.399
 of level braking we endorse because 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.960
 ok we give ourselves but to all more lines 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.340
 semaphore to take by sack very well very 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.840
 well we are starting to play here this 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.000
 Uncle takes out the shotgun eye that if the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.620
 Reckless writer subscriber a lot 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.420
 ojito with that writer is to say to all 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.190
 turbos effectively sticks it out of the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.969
 speed that takes me shit on everything 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.190
 let it be 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.940
 I really needed to push myself 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:01.910
 it was necessary more companion 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:04.790
 the game is the big trap for the eyes 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.740
 because I'm going kings like now it's worth 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.030
 staff as we have rectified in that 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.130
 last time the turn should I should 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.840
 have saved but good is worth then what 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.950
 well it's worth no no no less bad that I've 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.479
 thrown away because if you do not have to do a 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.180
 building something is worth fine guys well 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.460

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.640
 desperate companions to take for sack 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.470
 but good but good but good 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.720
 quiet is a was waiting for me 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.890
 4 something god I feel that this has to 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.050
 be full of proximity mines and 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.580
 things about them so let's put 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.840

 Christmas gift plan we cut them 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.550
 now just in case and we burst 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.620
 nobody because obviously it was very difficult 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.030
 oh my god par evo and fourth is very 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.850

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.650
 I think back who wants to 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.840
 explode brings me 21 eyes that is almost what 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.430
 last one that I almost give them more of me is that 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.770
 take this distance gave and I called 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.030
 I say goodbye to gt5 attacked the play and the 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.970

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.890
 Ok, I'm going fourth and it's okay, they're not so 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.720
 away the first and the second and the 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.910
 third and the fifth I have it already enough 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.490
 pegadito is so many milestones a lot 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.140
 Ojito with that partner 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.660
 that explodes for her is all mine 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.360
 proximity uncle mother we leave by 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.340
 here in gift plan and 321 bom here 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.080
 site almost almost practical increase 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.760
 you have to burst that man because we 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.830
 Pilla ask us the mines of 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.880
 partner proximity the mines of 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.820
 proximity that is eating us from 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.120
 miracle of several vouchers there is a 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.740
 determined in one or if we are not given 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.060
 okay still quiet guys we can 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.519
 a towel is worth a worth, let's go to that 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.640
 home 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.640
 let's go 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.849
 the key is in doctoral in exploiting the 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.290
 eye on not exploding 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.329
 perfect perfect vale that is all 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.370
 perfect mania and that I think sir what 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.409
 I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.510
 career things are foreign 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:30.400
 vale vale vale vale eye because it does not 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.040
 we can third eye that we put on 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.230
 third we have here in front of the second 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.299
 mate do not go out there danny vale 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.519
 the first one taught ko football was going to google 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.099
 we go super away the lord cobo soccer 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.810
 he's doing the race he does not even paint 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.129
 this partner is going to catch this 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.930
 partner to catch that I at least 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.489
 I want the second position to be and 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.780
 with minimal distance because you can 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.359
 it also dominates in proximity of four and 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:56.220
 things of this let's leave it a little 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:56.220
 distance from the fifth of him 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.880
 4 3 2 1 in the conchinchina 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.880
 God what overtaking a like for s 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.560
 is that after something impressive 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.730
 comes something super pathetic guys are the 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.380
 things Christmas is something superior and 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.450
 awesome then after there is that 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.400
 do something a super hyper pathetic alone 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.180
 with the attic everything is balanced or the 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.380
 able to make that man the 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.910
 more epic overtaking take life 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.220
 between two palm trees a lamp post and 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.740
 an uncle say to another beautiful and skidding 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:34.090
 at the same time and spare data at 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.090
 mechanical win 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.960
 the goal is therefore we go from the 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.910
 removed because he has to have put 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.050
 around here 300,000 4 effectively what 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.780
 has come with a pike 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.030
 each and that gave me muddying 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.760
 but I do not know if you give him and of each one 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.790
 to see the marker and if we do not see 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.410
 intro my mother to thousandths of a second 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.600
 I have monte among subscribers worth not 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.610
 has won but for nothing is one hundred 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.870
 of thousands of very young seconds because the 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.980
 planned to attack and talavera is a war 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.570
 very cool they have still known of 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.440
 favorites and total creation and see you 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.440
 approximate areas
