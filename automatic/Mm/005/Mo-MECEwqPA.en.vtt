00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:12.320
 snapping snapping is in this place 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:17.070
 1 binding move 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:20.960
 2 binding rotation 3 binding 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:24.570
 scaling disassemble the bandage 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.660
 moving first needs binding 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.760
 configure right click 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:34.640
 juice and click on the binding 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:38.239
 and we have options for jumps out 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:43.050
 the most active binding is vertex 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:49.559
 sometimes you need a grid grid 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:52.340
 to become attached to the studio grid we make sure 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:57.739
 that we have a checkbox on vertex and 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:01:01.820
 close build in the window 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.820
 top box 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:09.689
 turn on binding 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:13.439
 We are building another box next to ours 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.710
 by boxing we move our cursor to the corner 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.830
 mouse and see that the cross is illuminated 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:29.220
 means the construction will start exactly 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:33.990
 from this angle we build further if us 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:36.259
 you need to tie this angle to this we 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.140
 we take let the mouse down 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.380
 first the yellow cross lights up 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.240
 we bring closer the black cross lights up 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:51.090
 so at this moment we can take our 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:58.500
 box and move to this corner or to 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:02:01.280
 this way we want to open the window top on 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.280
 full screen and 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:12.970
 than the line also 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:20.840
 binding helps to build 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:26.500
 line at the corners turns building 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.500
 very fine line we got 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:40.970
 open the perspective window and turn it on 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:44.330
 rotation when we start to rotate 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:48.380
 then we see that here in this place to us 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:54.670
 the display shows that the rotation is 5 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:03:00.200
 degrees it is very convenient if needed 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:06.860
 rotated 90 degrees exactly 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:09.340
 45 very fast and convenient and as a result 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.580
 it turns out without cracks because 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:16.989
 binds very precisely to the joint 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:20.780
 this is very important and can also be included 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.130
 Scale bindings include 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.550
 binding and take the tool 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:29.930
 scaling and our object will be 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:32.840
 scale to 10 percent in this 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.470
 lesson we looked at binding for 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.470
 accurate building
