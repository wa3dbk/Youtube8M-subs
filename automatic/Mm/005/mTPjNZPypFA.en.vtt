00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.060
 hello I will teach you to 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.830
 use the series hd is hutch a 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.710
 little trick to have the mode on 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.059
 scans other than changing it to 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.769
 every time because you can 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.480
 actually take it with the 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.850
 structure by changing the view down and 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.470
 you actually have the structure that 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.390
 becomes a dome scan that's a little worry 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.519
 is when you want it 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.200
 for example on another page of 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:37.440
 structure with the sounder you go 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.410
 have the scan given with the 2d because you 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.239
 have selected the vulbas if you put 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.579
 on the left right it'll do them on 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.530
 all the pages ie on the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.059
 structure will become straight structure again 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.950
 left 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:54.719
 and the same for the one you just 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.120
 so manufactures the structure and the 2d so 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:01.559
 there is a little trick for that all 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.670
 simple simply add it 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.290
 a new tab that is the dome scan 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.659
 that if you want it's like that 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.979
 know the principle you have the 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.590
 structure the dome scan it 2d but 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:22.860
 some people need to have 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:24.960
 that the 2d and the dome scan so these two 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.369
 Well there you only just 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.240
 take over the structure and remove it 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.110
 automatically have you give it this 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.680
 call who stay and the 2d henceforth 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.970
 without changing anything at the views level me 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:45.420
 saw base for the dome scan and my view 2d 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:48.210
 I stay with my structure so here 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.680
 so now you can manufacture 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.270
 as many pages as you want by 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.570
 example also holds with the card 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.810
 that's it but I do not want a structure because 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.820
 I want the map the 2 the 2d and the 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.710
 dome scan 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:08.660
 this is you simply 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.550
 removed and keep that gives scan 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.360
 sailboats and here I like we give this case 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:20.000
 and I have my structure available in 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.000
