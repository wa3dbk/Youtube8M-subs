got<00:01:48.720> pretty<00:01:48.990> excited<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.770> when<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.310> dug<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.700> up

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
got pretty excited and when I dug it up

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.550 
got pretty excited and when I dug it up
it<00:01:51.090> was<00:01:51.210> down<00:01:51.420> about<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.689> half<00:01:51.960> inch<00:01:52.200> three

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
it was down about a half inch three

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.130 
it was down about a half inch three
quarters<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:52.979> an<00:01:53.220> inch<00:01:53.310> deep<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.180> held<00:01:54.840> this

fell over when he saw the information
the<00:02:50.320> ratios<00:02:50.830> were<00:02:51.100> off<00:02:51.280> and<00:02:51.610> as<00:02:52.090> he<00:02:52.360> puts<00:02:52.660> it

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
the ratios were off and as he puts it

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.870 
the ratios were off and as he puts it
there<00:02:53.050> were<00:02:53.200> only<00:02:53.410> two<00:02:53.769> answers<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.310> explain

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
from Earth he's taken something that's

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.900 
from Earth he's taken something that's
an<00:03:01.870> aluminum<00:03:02.590> and<00:03:02.800> he's<00:03:02.950> able<00:03:03.130> to<00:03:03.400> explain

an aluminum and he's able to explain
that<00:03:04.290> aluminum<00:03:05.290> isn't<00:03:05.739> bound<00:03:06.209> naturally<00:03:07.209> it

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
that aluminum isn't bound naturally it

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.150 
that aluminum isn't bound naturally it
is<00:03:07.540> something<00:03:07.810> that<00:03:07.989> is<00:03:08.230> synthesized<00:03:08.769> it<00:03:08.950> has

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
is something that is synthesized it has

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.550 
is something that is synthesized it has
to<00:03:09.400> be<00:03:09.519> manufactured<00:03:10.420> he's<00:03:11.019> taken<00:03:11.410> that<00:03:11.530> a

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
to be manufactured he's taken that a

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.860 
to be manufactured he's taken that a

research<00:03:14.319> the<00:03:15.100> isotope<00:03:16.140> work<00:03:17.140> is<00:03:17.380> a<00:03:17.410> little

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
research the isotope work is a little

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.710 
research the isotope work is a little

difficult to understand and I guess what

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.160 
difficult to understand and I guess what
