00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:15.299
 I think that I do not want to thank the attentive invitation of the people and the government of 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.599

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.630
 Of all Mexicans, Asia is a neighboring nation and that area 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.160
 I want to thank the words and posterity 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.410
 President Obama 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.450
 united states and mexico 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.860
 we are nations 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.250
 who trade 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.570
 who talk 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.340
 that complement each other 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.579
 nations that have a political understanding of the highest level 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.040
 and we are also 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.380
 a countries with a dynamic 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.890
 and very fruitful link between people between communities between 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.180
 public and private institutions along three thousand kilometers of 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.100
 border 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.520
 Our relationship is characterized by open and frank dialogue 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.460
 which is based on trust in respect and co-responsibility 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.940
 as the president obama has said 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.240
 this morning we had a very profitable afternoon conversation 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.860
 we review our bilateral relationship 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.120
 your problems the challenges 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.120
 and also the many copur with anger is that we have opposite 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.730
 We analyze different proposals and visions of Mexico and other states 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:35.640
 United 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.700
 to strengthen North America as a region 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.340
 we talked about the importance of solving our differences and 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.900
 commercial disputes 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.180
 in the fairest and fastest way possible 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.540
 we tackle the issues fonte and sos 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.850
 safety 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.750
 the migration 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.740
 and we also examine initiatives to consolidate our cooperation in 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.990
 matters of global interest 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.430
 and in multilateral arenas 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.090
 I can not confirm that you are not concises they are much bigger than 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.889
 our differences 

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.959
 that there is a broad convergence of interest 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.989
 and this is not only due to the fact that we have common values ​​and objectives 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:20.059
 but also that there is a will in both 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:23.009
 to make our neighborhood and association 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:26.009
 one of the shared development lever 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:28.489
 Fortunately 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.489
 the serious global economic crisis is already beginning to recede 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:34.949
 it opens a window of opportunity for Canada 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:36.939
 united states and mexico 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:39.469
 replenishment we have north america 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:41.950
 as a vigorous competitive region 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.039
 to flourish 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:46.209
 able to generate more and better jobs 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.749
 the attractive region for investments 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:51.389
 for trade and tourism 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:54.409
 with great prospects for the future 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:58.249
 together we will have to increase our export capacity 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:03.149
 in a context of increasing competition between different regions of the world 

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:07.319
 we talked about the obstacles that exist 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.699
 to the fulfillment of obligations in the matter of motor transport that have been 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:12.809
 established 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:15.869
 by the North American Free Trade Agreement 

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:21.479
 This situation affects both companies and consumers in Mexico and other 

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:23.149
 the United States itself 

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:24.829
 and we will have to work 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.909
 to achieve a quick solution 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:31.129
 with a constructive and long-term vision in this one in other topics 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:33.819
 as the president has said 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.819
 we saw special attention to border issues 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:41.029
 the border is not only an important meeting place between our 

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:42.059
 nations 

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:46.899
 if not also opportunity for our shared aspiration of development 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.209
 we will press more resources to strengthen the border infrastructure 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.389
 so that it meets the needs of our economies and 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:57.549
 societies 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:02.219
 and benefit with employment and economic growth between both sides of the 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:03.669
 border 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:07.089
 We will strengthen coordination between the authorities on both sides of the 

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:09.879
 border to reinforce security 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:11.139
 that is very clear 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:12.489
 both countries 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.679
 we want a safe border 

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:18.069
 a safe border for our people 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:21.160
 consider the hydrangea to reinforce actions to stop 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.420
 the flow of drugs 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.330
 of weapons 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.689
 and of money 

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:29.179
 and for this we will work with full respect to the jurisdictions of each 

00:04:29.179 --> 00:04:32.580
 country and in a co-responsible way 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.559
 with regard to the immigration issue 

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:36.819
 I recognize the sensitivity 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:40.310
 and President Obama's commitment to find a solution 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.400
 Comprehensive comprehensive 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.779
 that respects the rights of people and that fits 

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:49.620
 Realistically the situation that exists in both countries 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.080
 we speak with sincerity of this one and of all the temples 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.889
 we see that the economies of our countries are 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.409
 clearly complementary 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:05.779
 when they complement each other with disintegrate they are a powerful tool 

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:09.369
 to bring the productivity and competitiveness of the entire region 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:14.220
 more competitiveness in North America means more jobs 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.830
 and better living conditions 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.830
 both for Americans and for the Mexican 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.529
 in Mexico 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:26.989
 We are respectful and will continue to be respectful of the internal politics of 

00:05:26.989 --> 00:05:28.189
 U.S 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:31.959
 and of its legitimate right to establish according to its constitution 

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:34.580
 the laws you consider 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.979
 convenient 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:38.789
 but we will maintain our firm rejection 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:41.460
 to criminalize migration 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.100
 and there are people who work and contribute to this great nation to be treated 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.379
 as a criminal 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:49.219
 and we strongly oppose the law 

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:51.849
 st 10 70 arizona 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:54.430
 because part of unfair principles 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.450
 partial 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.689
 and discriminatory 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:00.689
 this and other topics were addressed in this meeting 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:04.680
 which I would dare say is historical by the level of understanding 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.080
 and of reciprocal trust reached 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.509
 for now I want to highlight only this open dialogue 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:14.020
 frank and constructive 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.479
 that we maintain with the government of president obama 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:19.220
 which has been of great benefit 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.749
 for both countries 

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:23.009
 and that allows me to verify 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:28.239
 the strength and leadership of the president of the united states thank you very much 

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:32.259
 president obama for your hospitality thank you very much for your 

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:32.419
 Attention
