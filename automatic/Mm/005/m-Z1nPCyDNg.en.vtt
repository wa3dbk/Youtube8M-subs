the<00:00:17.550> first<00:00:17.789> thing<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.029> be<00:00:18.060> aware<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.420> when

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
the first thing to be aware of when

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.029 
the first thing to be aware of when
we're<00:00:18.779> thinking<00:00:18.900> about<00:00:19.140> blood<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.619> that<00:00:19.859> it's

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
we're thinking about blood is that it's

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.099 
we're thinking about blood is that it's
a<00:00:20.189> tissue<00:00:20.520> this<00:00:21.330> may<00:00:21.510> seem<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.779> little<00:00:21.900> bit

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
a tissue this may seem a little bit

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.540 
a tissue this may seem a little bit
unusual<00:00:22.590> when<00:00:22.740> we<00:00:22.859> think<00:00:23.010> about<00:00:23.130> other

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
unusual when we think about other

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.910 
unusual when we think about other
tissues<00:00:24.000> in<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.210> body<00:00:24.420> such<00:00:25.019> as<00:00:25.050> muscle<00:00:25.710> or

tissues in the body such as muscle or

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.700 
tissues in the body such as muscle or
bone<00:00:26.300> but<00:00:27.300> remember<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.840> definition<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.619> a

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
bone but remember the definition of a

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.560 
bone but remember the definition of a
tissue<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.220> load<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.580> similar<00:00:29.970> cells<00:00:30.240> all

working together to do the same job and
blood<00:00:33.540> fits<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:33.960> definition<00:00:34.640> blood<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.760> made

blood fits that definition blood is made
of<00:00:36.120> four<00:00:36.480> key<00:00:36.980> components<00:00:37.980> firstly<00:00:38.670> there<00:00:38.879> is

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
of four key components firstly there is

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
are in our blood you see a red blood

are in our blood you see a red blood
cell<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.829> one<00:00:58.980> which<00:00:59.129> looks<00:00:59.370> kind<00:00:59.579> of

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
cell this is the one which looks kind of

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.099 
cell this is the one which looks kind of
like<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.820> doughnut<00:01:00.270> where<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> hole<00:01:00.719> hasn't

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
like a doughnut where the hole hasn't

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.560 
like a doughnut where the hole hasn't
gone<00:01:01.199> all<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> way<00:01:01.469> through<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.090> then<00:01:03.090> this

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
gone all the way through and then this

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.080 
gone all the way through and then this
small<00:01:03.750> spiky<00:01:04.379> thing<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.769> platelet<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.939> is

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
small spiky thing is a platelet this is

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.030 
small spiky thing is a platelet this is
a<00:01:06.119> little<00:01:06.450> bit<00:01:06.570> unusual<00:01:06.720> generally<00:01:07.619> speaking

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
a little bit unusual generally speaking

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.620 
a little bit unusual generally speaking
they<00:01:08.310> tend<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.610> be<00:01:08.700> more<00:01:08.880> plate<00:01:09.180> shaped<00:01:09.479> they

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
they tend to be more plate shaped they

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.840 
they tend to be more plate shaped they
tend<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.900> be<00:01:10.049> sort<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.320> more<00:01:10.500> flat<00:01:10.860> disks<00:01:11.610> hence

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
tend to be sort of more flat disks hence

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.140 
tend to be sort of more flat disks hence
the<00:01:12.030> name<00:01:12.270> platelet<00:01:13.250> but<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.490> am<00:01:14.610> assured<00:01:14.939> this

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
the name platelet but I am assured this

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.109 
the name platelet but I am assured this
is<00:01:15.360> genuinely<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:16.020> platelet<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.740> then<00:01:17.549> finally

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
is genuinely a platelet and then finally

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.820 
is genuinely a platelet and then finally
we<00:01:18.299> have<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.509> white<00:01:18.840> blood<00:01:19.110> cell<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.619> one

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
we have a white blood cell this one

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.200 
we have a white blood cell this one
that's<00:01:20.040> all<00:01:20.159> kind<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.460> lumpy<00:01:20.820> at<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.030> end

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
that's all kind of lumpy at the end

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.570 
that's all kind of lumpy at the end
those<00:01:22.080> are<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.350> four<00:01:22.619> key<00:01:22.650> components<00:01:23.460> of

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
those are the four key components of

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.490 
those are the four key components of
blood<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.299> let's<00:01:24.540> run<00:01:24.720> through<00:01:24.930> what<00:01:25.140> each<00:01:25.290> of

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
blood so let's run through what each of

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.140 
blood so let's run through what each of
them<00:01:25.590> do<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:25.920> turn<00:01:26.159> starting<00:01:26.700> with<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.909> plasma

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
them do in turn starting with the plasma

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.740 
them do in turn starting with the plasma
the<00:01:27.570> plasma<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.500> mainly<00:01:29.100> water<00:01:29.450> it's<00:01:30.450> got<00:01:30.720> a

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
the plasma is mainly water it's got a

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.780 
the plasma is mainly water it's got a
few<00:01:31.140> other<00:01:31.290> things<00:01:31.380> dissolved<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.520> though

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
few other things dissolved in it though

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.240 
few other things dissolved in it though
and<00:01:33.060> it's<00:01:33.299> job<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.840> carry<00:01:34.320> those<00:01:34.710> dissolved

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
and it's job is to carry those dissolved

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.090 
and it's job is to carry those dissolved
substances<00:01:35.850> around<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.479> body<00:01:36.890> one<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:37.920> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
substances around the body one of the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.950 
substances around the body one of the
key<00:01:38.310> ones<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.150> carries<00:01:39.540> carbon

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
key ones is that it carries carbon

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.260 
key ones is that it carries carbon
dioxide<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.250> will<00:01:41.340> become<00:01:41.460> dioxide

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
dioxide so that will become dioxide

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.730 
dioxide so that will become dioxide
which<00:01:42.450> has<00:01:42.600> been<00:01:42.780> produced<00:01:43.229> through

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
which has been produced through

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.190 
which has been produced through
respiration<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.360> muscle<00:01:45.689> tissues<00:01:46.020> and

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
respiration in the muscle tissues and

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.630

all<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.409> other<00:01:46.530> tissues<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.100> body<00:01:47.369> where

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
all the other tissues of the body where

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.969 
all the other tissues of the body where
cells<00:01:47.970> are<00:01:48.119> respiring<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.590> dissolves

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
cells are respiring and that dissolves

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.880 
cells are respiring and that dissolves
back<00:01:50.399> into<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.180> water<00:01:51.479> in<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.259> plasma<00:01:52.470> and

back into that water in the plasma and

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.740 
back into that water in the plasma and
it's<00:01:53.220> carried<00:01:53.490> back<00:01:53.729> towards<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.210> lungs<00:01:54.390> and

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
it's carried back towards the lungs and

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.749 
it's carried back towards the lungs and
then<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.530> diffuse<00:01:55.860> back<00:01:56.189> out<00:01:56.399> into<00:01:56.610> the

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
then it can diffuse back out into the

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.330 
then it can diffuse back out into the
lungs<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.240> we<00:01:57.329> can<00:01:57.479> exhale<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:59.100> also

substances<00:02:02.250> which<00:02:02.759> we've<00:02:02.969> got<00:02:03.000> from

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
substances which we've got from

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.590 
substances which we've got from

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
once it's broken down things like

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.940 
once it's broken down things like
glucose<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.119> amino<00:02:09.149> acids<00:02:09.840> they<00:02:10.349> all<00:02:10.560> pass

glucose and amino acids they all pass

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.100 
glucose and amino acids they all pass
into<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.670> bloodstream<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.360> into<00:02:12.720> the

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
into the bloodstream and into the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.960 
into the bloodstream and into the
plasma<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:13.770> they're<00:02:14.160> carried<00:02:14.520> around<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.880> the

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
plasma and they're carried around to the

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.930 
plasma and they're carried around to the
various<00:02:15.330> places<00:02:15.510> that<00:02:15.840> need<00:02:16.110> them<00:02:16.460> the<00:02:17.460> final

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
various places that need them the final

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.700 
various places that need them the final
thing<00:02:18.180> which<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.570> blood<00:02:18.750> is<00:02:18.870> carrying<00:02:19.110> in<00:02:19.470> the

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
thing which the blood is carrying in the

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.580 
thing which the blood is carrying in the
plasma<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.760> urea<00:02:21.540> which<00:02:22.050> has<00:02:22.230> been<00:02:22.410> produced

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
plasma is urea which has been produced

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.650 
plasma is urea which has been produced
by<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.160> liver<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:23.580> is<00:02:23.820> being<00:02:24.030> passed<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.540> the

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
by the liver and is being passed to the

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.810 
by the liver and is being passed to the
kidneys<00:02:25.050> so<00:02:25.560> that<00:02:25.680> we<00:02:25.800> can<00:02:25.950> then<00:02:26.070> excrete<00:02:26.610> it

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
kidneys so that we can then excrete it

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.510 
kidneys so that we can then excrete it
so<00:02:27.660> three<00:02:28.050> things<00:02:28.380> which<00:02:28.590> are<00:02:28.740> carried<00:02:29.070> in<00:02:29.220> the

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
so three things which are carried in the

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.160 
so three things which are carried in the
plasma<00:02:29.730> remember<00:02:30.300> it's<00:02:30.420> just<00:02:30.450> our<00:02:30.690> watery

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
plasma remember it's just our watery

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.900 
plasma remember it's just our watery
fluid<00:02:31.320> and<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:32.130> three<00:02:32.340> things<00:02:32.520> which<00:02:32.700> is

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
fluid and the three things which is

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.930 
fluid and the three things which is
carrying<00:02:33.300> our<00:02:33.540> carbon<00:02:34.170> dioxide<00:02:34.940> substances

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
carrying our carbon dioxide substances

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.199 
carrying our carbon dioxide substances
from<00:02:36.090> digestion<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:37.280> urea<00:02:38.280> from<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:39.000> liver

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
from digestion and urea from the liver

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.020 
from digestion and urea from the liver
heading<00:02:39.630> towards<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.080> kidneys<00:02:40.730> next<00:02:41.730> red

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
heading towards the kidneys next red

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.030 
heading towards the kidneys next red
blood<00:02:42.240> cells<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.780> these<00:02:43.140> are<00:02:43.290> unusual<00:02:43.530> cells

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
blood cells and these are unusual cells

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.470 
blood cells and these are unusual cells
because<00:02:44.370> they<00:02:44.520> don't<00:02:44.730> actually<00:02:44.910> contain<00:02:45.450> a

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
because they don't actually contain a

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.540 
because they don't actually contain a
nucleus<00:02:46.050> that's<00:02:46.680> because<00:02:47.040> they've<00:02:47.220> just<00:02:47.250> got

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
nucleus that's because they've just got

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.790 
nucleus that's because they've just got
one<00:02:47.910> job<00:02:48.270> and<00:02:48.480> that<00:02:48.959> is<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.290> carry<00:02:49.560> oxygen

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
one job and that is to carry oxygen

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.140 
one job and that is to carry oxygen
around<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.760> body

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
around the body

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.000 
around the body
they<00:02:51.959> contain<00:02:52.350> a<00:02:52.380> substance<00:02:52.830> called

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
they contain a substance called

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.010 
they contain a substance called
hemoglobin<00:02:53.940> which<00:02:54.360> gives<00:02:54.660> them<00:02:54.870> their

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
hemoglobin which gives them their

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.479 
hemoglobin which gives them their
distinctive<00:02:55.530> red<00:02:55.739> color<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.220> gives<00:02:56.370> your

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
distinctive red color and gives your

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.180 
distinctive red color and gives your
blood<00:02:56.730> its<00:02:56.910> distinctive<00:02:57.390> red<00:02:57.570> color<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.190> as

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
blood its distinctive red color and as

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.310 
blood its distinctive red color and as
they<00:02:59.520> get<00:02:59.730> towards<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.390> lungs<00:03:00.600> that

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
they get towards the lungs that

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.100 
they get towards the lungs that
hemoglobin<00:03:02.160> combines<00:03:02.910> with<00:03:03.120> oxygen<00:03:03.239> which<00:03:03.930> is

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
hemoglobin combines with oxygen which is

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.620 
hemoglobin combines with oxygen which is
diffused<00:03:04.620> into<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.370> bloodstream<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:06.090> form

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
diffused into the bloodstream to form

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.520 
diffused into the bloodstream to form
oxyhemoglobin<00:03:08.000> that<00:03:09.000> oxyhemoglobin<00:03:09.570> is<00:03:10.290> then

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
oxyhemoglobin that oxyhemoglobin is then

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.380 
oxyhemoglobin that oxyhemoglobin is then
carried<00:03:10.920> around<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.280> circulatory<00:03:11.760> system<00:03:11.940> to

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
carried around the circulatory system to

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.690 
carried around the circulatory system to
the<00:03:12.600> various<00:03:13.020> organs<00:03:13.350> which<00:03:13.530> needed<00:03:13.950> muscles

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
the various organs which needed muscles

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.640 
the various organs which needed muscles
and<00:03:15.060> your<00:03:15.180> brain<00:03:15.510> all<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:15.989> different<00:03:16.380> organs

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
and your brain all the different organs

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.699 
and your brain all the different organs
like<00:03:16.770> that<00:03:17.010> and<00:03:17.310> as<00:03:18.030> those<00:03:18.630> organs<00:03:19.140> use<00:03:19.470> it

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
like that and as those organs use it

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.370 
like that and as those organs use it
they<00:03:20.130> separate<00:03:20.820> out<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.299> oxygen<00:03:21.870> from<00:03:22.320> the

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
they separate out the oxygen from the

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.229 
they separate out the oxygen from the
hemoglobin<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.400> so<00:03:23.580> the<00:03:23.730> oxyhemoglobin

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
hemoglobin and so the oxyhemoglobin

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.920 
hemoglobin and so the oxyhemoglobin
becomes<00:03:25.230> oxygen<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:26.040> hemoglobin<00:03:27.000> again<00:03:27.269> that

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
becomes oxygen and hemoglobin again that

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.990 
becomes oxygen and hemoglobin again that
hemoglobin<00:03:28.620> is<00:03:28.739> then<00:03:28.950> carried<00:03:29.280> back<00:03:29.610> by<00:03:29.640> the

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
hemoglobin is then carried back by the

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.870 
hemoglobin is then carried back by the
red<00:03:30.269> blood<00:03:30.450> cells<00:03:30.750> towards<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:32.250> lungs<00:03:32.489> to<00:03:32.760> get

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
red blood cells towards the lungs to get

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.880 
red blood cells towards the lungs to get
more<00:03:33.120> oxygen<00:03:33.330> and<00:03:33.840> of<00:03:34.140> course<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.470> oxygen

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
more oxygen and of course the oxygen

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.710 
more oxygen and of course the oxygen
which<00:03:35.040> has<00:03:35.190> been<00:03:35.340> separated<00:03:35.549> out<00:03:36.120> by<00:03:36.330> those

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
which has been separated out by those

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.740 
which has been separated out by those
organs<00:03:37.140> is<00:03:37.350> then<00:03:37.650> used<00:03:37.890> for<00:03:37.980> respiration

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
organs is then used for respiration

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.150

platelets are not cells at all they're

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.400 
platelets are not cells at all they're
fragments<00:03:41.850> of<00:03:41.970> cells<00:03:42.299> then<00:03:42.959> normally<00:03:43.320> the

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.979 
down and all they do is help clot wounds
they<00:03:50.130> form<00:03:50.489> a<00:03:50.670> blood<00:03:50.940> clot<00:03:51.269> when<00:03:51.690> you've<00:03:51.810> got<00:03:51.959> a

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
they form a blood clot when you've got a

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.840 
they form a blood clot when you've got a
scab<00:03:52.350> it's<00:03:52.709> mainly<00:03:52.950> made<00:03:53.220> of<00:03:53.340> things<00:03:53.610> like

scab it's mainly made of things like

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.610 
scab it's mainly made of things like
platelets<00:03:54.480> and<00:03:54.660> they're<00:03:55.170> there<00:03:55.410> to<00:03:55.590> help

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
platelets and they're there to help

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.979 
platelets and they're there to help
block<00:03:56.100> any<00:03:56.430> wounds<00:03:57.000> this<00:03:57.390> can<00:03:57.660> of<00:03:57.750> course

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
block any wounds this can of course

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.350 
block any wounds this can of course
become<00:03:58.320> a<00:03:58.350> problem<00:03:58.769> in<00:03:58.890> some<00:03:59.130> cases<00:03:59.489> if<00:03:59.850> you

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
become a problem in some cases if you

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.270 
become a problem in some cases if you
get<00:04:00.600> blood<00:04:00.959> clot<00:04:01.200> taking<00:04:01.590> place<00:04:01.799> inside<00:04:02.040> a

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
get blood clot taking place inside a

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.800 
get blood clot taking place inside a
vein<00:04:02.640> because<00:04:03.150> someone's<00:04:03.450> been<00:04:03.600> sitting

still for a very long period of time

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.640 
still for a very long period of time
then<00:04:06.239> that<00:04:06.269> can<00:04:06.780> cause<00:04:07.049> all<00:04:07.260> sorts<00:04:07.290> of

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
then that can cause all sorts of

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.340 
then that can cause all sorts of
problems<00:04:07.709> like<00:04:08.130> deep<00:04:08.400> vein<00:04:08.670> thrombosis<00:04:09.350> but

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
problems like deep vein thrombosis but

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.870 
problems like deep vein thrombosis but
all<00:04:10.530> that<00:04:10.860> you<00:04:10.920> really<00:04:11.280> need<00:04:11.489> to<00:04:11.640> know<00:04:11.850> about

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
all that you really need to know about

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.180 
all that you really need to know about
those<00:04:12.209> platelets<00:04:12.690> is<00:04:12.810> that<00:04:13.230> they<00:04:13.350> cause<00:04:13.680> blood

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
those platelets is that they cause blood

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.610 
those platelets is that they cause blood
clots<00:04:14.519> and<00:04:14.730> then<00:04:15.450> not<00:04:15.720> full<00:04:16.019> cells<00:04:16.320> they're

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
clots and then not full cells they're

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.460 
clots and then not full cells they're
just<00:04:16.829> parts<00:04:17.310> of<00:04:17.459> cells<00:04:17.930> finally<00:04:18.930> white<00:04:19.200> blood

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
just parts of cells finally white blood

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.409 
just parts of cells finally white blood
cells<00:04:19.769> I'll<00:04:20.220> discuss<00:04:20.609> their<00:04:20.820> role<00:04:21.030> in<00:04:21.239> more

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
cells I'll discuss their role in more

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.420 
cells I'll discuss their role in more
detail<00:04:21.840> when<00:04:22.109> I<00:04:22.140> cover<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.620> immune<00:04:22.979> system

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
detail when I cover the immune system

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.610 
detail when I cover the immune system
for<00:04:23.970> now<00:04:24.180> all<00:04:24.450> you<00:04:24.510> need<00:04:24.870> to<00:04:24.960> be<00:04:25.080> aware<00:04:25.320> of<00:04:25.380> is

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
for now all you need to be aware of is

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.540 
for now all you need to be aware of is
that<00:04:25.650> they<00:04:25.919> are<00:04:26.039> part<00:04:26.340> of

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
that they are part of

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.610 
that they are part of
the<00:04:26.639> immune<00:04:26.909> system<00:04:27.389> and<00:04:27.569> they<00:04:28.050> help<00:04:28.289> fight

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
the immune system and they help fight

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.790 
the immune system and they help fight
infections<00:04:29.310> from<00:04:29.550> microorganisms<00:04:30.770> finally<00:04:31.770> I

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
infections from microorganisms finally I

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.619 
infections from microorganisms finally I
just<00:04:31.949> want<00:04:32.310> to<00:04:32.400> quickly<00:04:32.610> dispel<00:04:33.120> a<00:04:33.150> myth<00:04:33.240> and

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:33.629 
just want to quickly dispel a myth and

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:35.659 
just want to quickly dispel a myth and
that<00:04:33.690> is<00:04:34.050> the<00:04:34.199> idea<00:04:34.530> that<00:04:34.590> deoxygenated<00:04:35.490> blood

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
that is the idea that deoxygenated blood

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.480 
that is the idea that deoxygenated blood
is<00:04:36.030> blue<00:04:36.360> it's<00:04:36.629> not<00:04:36.960> it's<00:04:37.500> often<00:04:37.860> represented

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
is blue it's not it's often represented

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.279 
is blue it's not it's often represented
that<00:04:38.610> way<00:04:38.819> on<00:04:38.940> diagrams<00:04:39.449> just<00:04:39.629> to<00:04:40.020> make<00:04:40.169> it

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289 
that way on diagrams just to make it

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:41.899 
that way on diagrams just to make it
easier<00:04:40.680> to<00:04:40.710> track<00:04:41.099> which<00:04:41.400> bits<00:04:41.699> of<00:04:41.849> the

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:41.909 
easier to track which bits of the

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:43.790 
easier to track which bits of the
oxygenated<00:04:42.599> blood<00:04:42.810> and<00:04:43.080> which<00:04:43.319> bits<00:04:43.590> of<00:04:43.710> the

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
oxygenated blood and which bits of the

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.920 
oxygenated blood and which bits of the
deoxygenated<00:04:44.370> blood<00:04:44.819> and<00:04:45.210> when<00:04:45.539> I<00:04:45.569> talk<00:04:45.780> about

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
deoxygenated blood and when I talk about

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.719 
deoxygenated blood and when I talk about
the<00:04:46.110> circulatory<00:04:46.530> system<00:04:46.710> you'll<00:04:47.460> see<00:04:47.639> an

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
the circulatory system you'll see an

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:49.999 
the circulatory system you'll see an
example<00:04:48.060> of<00:04:48.300> these<00:04:48.419> diagrams<00:04:48.870> but<00:04:49.560> really

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009 
example of these diagrams but really

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.719 
example of these diagrams but really
deoxygenated<00:04:51.000> blood<00:04:51.180> is<00:04:51.599> this<00:04:52.110> color<00:04:52.520> this<00:04:53.520> is

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
deoxygenated blood is this color this is

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.580 
deoxygenated blood is this color this is
blood<00:04:53.970> from<00:04:54.360> blood<00:04:54.629> donors<00:04:55.080> which<00:04:55.289> has<00:04:55.440> been

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
blood from blood donors which has been

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.430 
blood from blood donors which has been
taken<00:04:56.009> from<00:04:56.280> a<00:04:56.400> vein<00:04:56.759> and<00:04:57.060> you<00:04:57.870> can<00:04:58.050> see<00:04:58.289> that

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
taken from a vein and you can see that

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.320 
taken from a vein and you can see that
although<00:04:58.620> it's<00:04:58.979> darker<00:04:59.580> than<00:04:59.729> we'd<00:04:59.879> expect

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
although it's darker than we'd expect

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.350 
although it's darker than we'd expect
blood<00:05:00.509> to<00:05:00.659> be<00:05:00.840> it's<00:05:01.680> not<00:05:02.190> actually<00:05:02.940> blue<00:05:03.180> at

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
blood to be it's not actually blue at

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.659 
blood to be it's not actually blue at
all<00:05:03.569> it's<00:05:03.840> a<00:05:03.990> darker<00:05:04.440> red<00:05:04.620> a<00:05:04.680> slightly<00:05:05.159> darker

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
all it's a darker red a slightly darker

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.469 
all it's a darker red a slightly darker
red<00:05:05.879> but<00:05:06.690> it's<00:05:06.840> certainly<00:05:07.199> not<00:05:07.289> blue<00:05:07.879> so<00:05:08.879> next

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 
red but it's certainly not blue so next

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:11.240 
red but it's certainly not blue so next
time<00:05:09.690> someone<00:05:09.750> tells<00:05:10.289> you<00:05:10.409> that<00:05:10.469> deoxygenated

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
time someone tells you that deoxygenated

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.010 
time someone tells you that deoxygenated
blood<00:05:11.400> is<00:05:11.669> blue<00:05:11.849> you'll<00:05:12.270> be<00:05:12.389> able<00:05:12.479> to<00:05:12.690> correct

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
blood is blue you'll be able to correct

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.499 
blood is blue you'll be able to correct
them<00:05:13.229> I<00:05:13.379> hope<00:05:14.340> that<00:05:14.520> video<00:05:14.669> really<00:05:15.120> helps<00:05:15.419> you
