 past an exercise that is very good because he likes to play here. 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.400
 to have the right 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.010
 it's very simple 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.859
 Let's keep in the know with floods. 

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:13.219
 with a break for every two are concepts 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:14.580
 will be to understand when I 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.219
 without collapsing 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.219

 a little faster the last shake a concert 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.490
 chamber 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.610
 However 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.150
 we have many trombone waves 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.320
 now I'll post some 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.320
 that's where I actually here because that's what I've prepared 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.870
 once a true 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.170
