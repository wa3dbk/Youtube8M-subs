master weapon guide weapon crafting a
builder's<00:00:55.469> guide<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.739> guess<00:00:56.010> if<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.460> want<00:00:56.610> to

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
builder's guide I guess if you want to

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.299 
builder's guide I guess if you want to
call<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.590> what<00:00:58.590> I've<00:00:58.680> been<00:00:58.829> doing<00:00:59.010> is

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
call it that and what I've been doing is

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.060 
call it that and what I've been doing is
trying<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.180> create<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.570> lot<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.840> different

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
trying to create a lot of different

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.740 
trying to create a lot of different
variations<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.190> weapons<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:03.390> know<00:01:03.480> we<00:01:03.600> offer

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
variations of weapons you know we offer

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.080 
variations of weapons you know we offer
a<00:01:03.899> lot<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.260> different<00:01:04.290> combinations<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.460> I'm

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
a lot of different combinations and I'm

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.219 
a lot of different combinations and I'm
trying<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.450> figure<00:01:06.570> out<00:01:06.689> different<00:01:06.930> play

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
trying to figure out different play

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.340 
trying to figure out different play
styles<00:01:07.549> that<00:01:08.549> maximize<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.930> effectiveness

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
styles that maximize the effectiveness

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.859 
styles that maximize the effectiveness
of<00:01:10.590> those<00:01:11.130> weapons<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:12.360> in<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:12.659> particular

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
of those weapons so in this particular

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.670 
of those weapons so in this particular
game<00:01:13.580> this<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:15.210> heavy<00:01:15.600> defense<00:01:16.140> game<00:01:16.350> again

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
game this is a heavy defense game again

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.590 
game this is a heavy defense game again

it's we're playing jackhammer which is a

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.179 
it's we're playing jackhammer which is a
the<00:01:21.600> equivalent<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.560> capture<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.100> flag

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189

the equivalent of a capture the flag
game<00:01:23.580> type<00:01:23.820> but<00:01:24.270> there's<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.540> little<00:01:24.750> twist<00:01:25.080> on

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
game type but there's a little twist on

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.090 
game type but there's a little twist on

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
it the flag actually is lethal you can

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.450 
it the flag actually is lethal you can
smash<00:01:29.520> people<00:01:30.030> with<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.960> flagger<00:01:31.350> hammer<00:01:31.650> in

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
pretty heavy defense while I've been in

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.429 
pretty heavy defense while I've been in
this<00:01:44.610> mode<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:44.909> figuring<00:01:45.420> out<00:01:45.540> different

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
this mode of figuring out different

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.530 
this mode of figuring out different
variations<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.670> play<00:01:47.880> styles<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.390> could

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
variations and play styles that I could

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.740 
variations and play styles that I could
utilize<00:01:49.610> across<00:01:50.610> all<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.060> various<00:01:51.509> game

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
types that we have and I've starting to

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.499 
types that we have and I've starting to
get<00:01:55.890> into<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.159> groove<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.640> find<00:01:56.909> different<00:01:57.149> ones

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
could be very good in those situations

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.580 
could be very good in those situations
but<00:02:51.080> it<00:02:51.350> is<00:02:51.680> also<00:02:52.570> it<00:02:53.570> also<00:02:53.600> offers<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.230> damage

over<00:02:54.800> time<00:02:54.830> so<00:02:55.190> if<00:02:55.280> they're<00:02:55.460> on<00:02:55.640> fire<00:02:55.940> and<00:02:56.350> uh

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
over time so if they're on fire and uh

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.590 
over time so if they're on fire and uh
you<00:02:58.310> know<00:02:58.430> they're<00:02:59.060> kind<00:02:59.210> of<00:02:59.270> running<00:02:59.510> around

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
I found that to be pretty effective when

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.450 
I found that to be pretty effective when
I<00:03:04.730> was<00:03:04.970> on<00:03:05.000> defense<00:03:05.830> again<00:03:06.830> get<00:03:07.160> that<00:03:07.250> ten

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
of be panicking maybe missing I don't

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.180 
of be panicking maybe missing I don't
know<00:03:20.360> but<00:03:20.900> I<00:03:21.170> thought<00:03:21.440> it<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:21.680> be<00:03:21.710> rather

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
know but I thought it to be rather

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.440 
know but I thought it to be rather
useful<00:03:22.840> now<00:03:24.340> what<00:03:25.340> pulls<00:03:25.850> this<00:03:26.090> all<00:03:26.300> together

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
useful now what pulls this all together

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.030 
useful now what pulls this all together
and<00:03:26.780> what<00:03:26.870> allows<00:03:27.080> me<00:03:27.290> to<00:03:27.380> play<00:03:27.530> defense<00:03:27.740> so

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
and what allows me to play defense so

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.210 
and what allows me to play defense so
effectively<00:03:28.550> is<00:03:28.850> that<00:03:29.810> I<00:03:30.110> have<00:03:30.740> the<00:03:30.920> turd

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
effectively is that I have the turd

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.750 
effectively is that I have the turd
equipped<00:03:31.730> for<00:03:32.570> this<00:03:32.990> particular<00:03:33.680> load<00:03:34.610> out

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
equipped for this particular load out

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.570 
equipped for this particular load out
and<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.900> turret<00:03:36.260> what<00:03:36.770> it<00:03:36.860> does<00:03:37.040> is<00:03:37.280> that<00:03:37.520> it

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
and the turret what it does is that it

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.750 
and the turret what it does is that it
mimics<00:03:37.940> the<00:03:38.830> identical<00:03:39.830> build<00:03:40.070> of<00:03:40.370> whatever

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
mimics the identical build of whatever

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.280 
weapon you have out at the time that you
place<00:03:43.160> it<00:03:43.310> down<00:03:43.490> so<00:03:43.850> I<00:03:44.120> switch<00:03:44.660> weapons<00:03:44.870> there

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
place it down so I switch weapons there

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.790 
place it down so I switch weapons there
to<00:03:45.590> my<00:03:45.910> cannonball<00:03:46.910> pulse<00:03:47.600> weapon<00:03:48.080> so<00:03:48.500> it<00:03:48.680> is

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
to my cannonball pulse weapon so it is

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.410 
to my cannonball pulse weapon so it is
going<00:03:48.920> to<00:03:49.160> mimic<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.459> pulse<00:03:49.760> as<00:03:49.970> you<00:03:50.060> guys<00:03:50.209> can

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
going to mimic the pulse as you guys can

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.330 
going to mimic the pulse as you guys can
see<00:03:50.480> it's<00:03:50.720> firing<00:03:50.959> on<00:03:51.170> that<00:03:51.200> guy<00:03:51.470> I<00:03:51.770> switched

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
see it's firing on that guy I switched

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.840 
see it's firing on that guy I switched
to<00:03:52.459> my<00:03:52.580> fire<00:03:52.880> so<00:03:53.800> effectively<00:03:54.800> I<00:03:55.100> am<00:03:55.550> getting

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
to my fire so effectively I am getting

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.420 
to my fire so effectively I am getting
the<00:03:56.000> ten<00:03:56.240> percent<00:03:56.630> damage<00:03:56.930> bonus<00:03:57.350> for<00:03:58.220> my

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
the ten percent damage bonus for my

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.760 
the ten percent damage bonus for my
turret<00:03:58.940> because<00:03:59.510> the<00:03:59.660> turret<00:04:00.020> has<00:04:00.290> the<00:04:00.530> pulse

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
turret because the turret has the pulse

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.580 
turret because the turret has the pulse
out<00:04:01.010> that<00:04:01.640> was<00:04:01.790> the<00:04:01.970> mentality<00:04:02.810> that<00:04:02.900> I<00:04:03.050> had<00:04:03.320> on

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
out that was the mentality that I had on

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.410 
out that was the mentality that I had on
my<00:04:03.650> set<00:04:04.250> and<00:04:04.280> strategy<00:04:04.790> that<00:04:04.940> I<00:04:04.970> had<00:04:05.180> behind

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
my set and strategy that I had behind

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.090 
my set and strategy that I had behind
that<00:04:05.600> I<00:04:05.690> was<00:04:05.780> like<00:04:05.900> okay<00:04:06.230> I'm<00:04:06.709> going<00:04:06.890> to<00:04:06.950> use

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
that I was like okay I'm going to use

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.610 
that I was like okay I'm going to use
and<00:04:07.910> it<00:04:08.300> works<00:04:08.510> both<00:04:08.690> ways<00:04:08.959> so<00:04:08.990> I<00:04:09.230> could<00:04:09.470> have

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
and it works both ways so I could have

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.420 
and it works both ways so I could have
it<00:04:09.650> my<00:04:10.040> fire<00:04:10.690> equipped<00:04:11.690> on<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:11.930> the<00:04:12.430> turret

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
it my fire equipped on the the turret

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.090 
it my fire equipped on the the turret
and<00:04:14.300> then<00:04:14.780> I<00:04:14.870> could<00:04:15.020> switch<00:04:15.200> to<00:04:15.350> my<00:04:15.470> pulse<00:04:15.770> and

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
and then I could switch to my pulse and

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.250 
and then I could switch to my pulse and
if<00:04:16.340> my<00:04:16.790> turret<00:04:17.090> sets<00:04:17.299> them<00:04:17.420> on<00:04:17.510> fire<00:04:17.570> I'm<00:04:18.049> going

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
if my turret sets them on fire I'm going

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.590 
if my turret sets them on fire I'm going
to<00:04:18.320> get<00:04:18.440> a<00:04:18.500> ten<00:04:18.739> percent<00:04:18.980> damage<00:04:19.370> bonus<00:04:19.790> with

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
to get a ten percent damage bonus with

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.310 
to get a ten percent damage bonus with
my<00:04:21.310> pulse<00:04:22.310> weapon<00:04:22.729> that<00:04:23.000> I'm<00:04:23.180> firing<00:04:23.479> so<00:04:24.200> it

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
my pulse weapon that I'm firing so it

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.870 
my pulse weapon that I'm firing so it
works<00:04:24.530> both<00:04:24.620> ways<00:04:25.070> with<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.460> turret<00:04:25.760> so

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
works both ways with the turret so

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.670 
works both ways with the turret so
that's<00:04:26.060> why<00:04:26.210> I<00:04:26.240> found<00:04:26.479> it<00:04:26.660> so<00:04:26.810> effective<00:04:27.260> on

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
that's why I found it so effective on

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.499 
that's why I found it so effective on
now<00:04:28.009> the<00:04:28.520> other<00:04:28.610> thing<00:04:28.729> you<00:04:28.910> want<00:04:29.180> to<00:04:29.240> notice

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:29.509 
now the other thing you want to notice

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:31.029 
now the other thing you want to notice
is<00:04:29.660> that<00:04:29.690> I<00:04:29.840> have<00:04:30.080> it<00:04:30.229> sitting<00:04:30.500> there<00:04:30.710> on<00:04:30.919> the

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 
is that I have it sitting there on the

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:33.040 
is that I have it sitting there on the
left<00:04:31.310> side<00:04:31.520> of<00:04:31.580> the<00:04:31.759> map<00:04:32.060> up<00:04:32.330> on<00:04:32.900> this

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.450 
left side of the map up on this
particular<00:04:33.350> side<00:04:33.710> i'm<00:04:33.860> going<00:04:33.979> to<00:04:34.039> call<00:04:34.160> it<00:04:34.190> red

reference so i have it covering the left
side<00:04:47.870> and<00:04:48.199> for<00:04:48.500> the<00:04:48.620> majority<00:04:48.889> of<00:04:49.039> the<00:04:49.250> time

side and for the majority of the time

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.860 
side and for the majority of the time
that<00:04:49.820> i'm<00:04:49.910> playing<00:04:50.030> defense<00:04:50.509> on<00:04:50.660> this

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
that i'm playing defense on this

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.409 
that i'm playing defense on this
particular<00:04:51.050> map<00:04:51.650> I<00:04:51.889> like<00:04:52.460> to<00:04:52.669> play<00:04:52.820> the<00:04:53.090> middle

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
particular map I like to play the middle

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.170 
particular map I like to play the middle
area<00:04:53.690> on<00:04:53.990> that<00:04:54.169> that<00:04:54.530> top<00:04:54.800> trailer<00:04:55.280> there<00:04:56.030> that

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
area on that that top trailer there that

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.510 
area on that that top trailer there that
you<00:04:56.270> guys<00:04:56.419> see<00:04:56.720> so<00:04:57.350> I<00:04:57.380> can<00:04:57.650> cover<00:04:57.830> the<00:04:58.220> middle

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
you guys see so I can cover the middle

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.540 
you guys see so I can cover the middle
lane<00:04:58.729> and<00:04:59.000> the<00:04:59.690> right<00:04:59.930> lane<00:05:00.169> so<00:05:00.500> the<00:05:01.190> turret<00:05:01.460> is

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
lane and the right lane so the turret is

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.370 
lane and the right lane so the turret is
covering<00:05:01.910> the<00:05:02.000> left<00:05:02.210> it<00:05:02.570> occasionally<00:05:03.139> get

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
covering the left it occasionally get

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.870 
covering the left it occasionally get
skills<00:05:03.680> I<00:05:03.919> get<00:05:04.220> to<00:05:04.310> see<00:05:04.460> when<00:05:04.610> it<00:05:04.699> blows<00:05:04.820> up

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
skills I get to see when it blows up

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.870 
skills I get to see when it blows up
because<00:05:05.479> of<00:05:05.750> the<00:05:05.990> the<00:05:06.020> red<00:05:06.530> icon<00:05:07.009> that<00:05:07.729> you

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
because of the the red icon that you

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.520 
because of the the red icon that you
guys<00:05:08.030> see<00:05:08.210> that<00:05:08.240> I<00:05:08.389> pointed<00:05:08.780> right<00:05:09.110> there<00:05:09.320> to

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
guys see that I pointed right there to

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.499 
guys see that I pointed right there to
it<00:05:09.680> that's<00:05:10.130> underneath<00:05:10.490> the<00:05:10.820> health<00:05:11.030> bar<00:05:11.240> when

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:11.509 
it that's underneath the health bar when

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:14.980 
it that's underneath the health bar when
that<00:05:11.660> thing<00:05:11.690> goes<00:05:12.610> gray<00:05:13.610> and<00:05:13.880> it'll<00:05:14.630> show<00:05:14.660> that

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
that thing goes gray and it'll show that

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.450 
that thing goes gray and it'll show that
it's<00:05:15.139> destroyed<00:05:15.530> that's<00:05:15.770> when<00:05:15.979> I<00:05:16.009> know<00:05:16.099> that

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
it's destroyed that's when I know that

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.180 
it's destroyed that's when I know that
that<00:05:17.030> turret<00:05:17.330> has<00:05:17.419> been<00:05:17.570> taken<00:05:17.930> out<00:05:18.050> so<00:05:18.440> I<00:05:18.710> know

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
that turret has been taken out so I know

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.850 
that turret has been taken out so I know
that<00:05:19.310> people<00:05:19.610> are<00:05:20.110> incoming<00:05:21.110> on<00:05:21.349> that<00:05:21.500> area

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
that people are incoming on that area

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.260 
that people are incoming on that area
and<00:05:22.009> that<00:05:22.580> I<00:05:22.639> should<00:05:22.880> be<00:05:22.910> paying<00:05:23.120> attention

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
and that I should be paying attention

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.749 
and that I should be paying attention
over<00:05:23.780> there<00:05:23.930> so<00:05:24.770> I'll<00:05:24.889> turn<00:05:25.190> and<00:05:25.220> look<00:05:25.520> and

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 
over there so I'll turn and look and

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.909 
over there so I'll turn and look and
possibly<00:05:26.139> get<00:05:27.139> some<00:05:27.259> fire<00:05:27.440> now<00:05:27.590> this<00:05:27.770> is

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
possibly get some fire now this is

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:29.830 
possibly get some fire now this is
actually<00:05:28.070> the<00:05:28.370> first<00:05:28.400> flag<00:05:28.880> touch<00:05:29.389> that<00:05:29.720> they

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
actually the first flag touch that they

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.320 
actually the first flag touch that they
got<00:05:30.050> you<00:05:31.039> guys<00:05:31.160> are<00:05:31.370> going<00:05:31.520> to<00:05:31.760> see<00:05:31.880> this<00:05:32.150> guy's

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
got you guys are going to see this guy's

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.120 
got you guys are going to see this guy's
has<00:05:32.539> jump<00:05:32.930> boots<00:05:33.139> which<00:05:33.349> is<00:05:33.470> actually<00:05:33.650> really

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
has jump boots which is actually really

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.730 
has jump boots which is actually really
good<00:05:34.460> equipment<00:05:35.240> piece<00:05:35.659> to<00:05:35.900> have<00:05:36.080> if<00:05:36.380> you're<00:05:36.650> a

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
good equipment piece to have if you're a

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.830 
good equipment piece to have if you're a
flag<00:05:37.010> carrier<00:05:37.490> so<00:05:38.240> what<00:05:38.360> I'm<00:05:38.449> trying<00:05:38.659> to<00:05:38.690> do<00:05:38.810> is

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
flag carrier so what I'm trying to do is

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.740 
flag carrier so what I'm trying to do is
create<00:05:38.960> space<00:05:39.590> because<00:05:39.919> I<00:05:39.949> don't<00:05:40.190> want<00:05:40.250> him<00:05:40.490> to

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
create space because I don't want him to

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.270 
create space because I don't want him to
basically<00:05:41.750> loft<00:05:42.139> too<00:05:42.470> far<00:05:42.710> ahead<00:05:42.830> of<00:05:42.949> me<00:05:43.130> my

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
basically loft too far ahead of me my

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.070 
basically loft too far ahead of me my
teammate<00:05:43.639> is<00:05:43.760> on<00:05:43.909> him<00:05:44.090> he<00:05:44.510> is<00:05:44.659> getting<00:05:44.930> really

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
teammate is on him he is getting really

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.080 
teammate is on him he is getting really
close<00:05:45.320> i'm<00:05:45.620> like<00:05:45.710> i<00:05:45.979> need<00:05:46.190> to<00:05:46.280> run<00:05:46.490> misses<00:05:47.060> a

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
close i'm like i need to run misses a

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.270 
close i'm like i need to run misses a
smash<00:05:47.479> there<00:05:47.900> and<00:05:48.110> i'm<00:05:48.530> just<00:05:48.680> backing<00:05:49.039> up<00:05:49.130> with

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
smash there and i'm just backing up with

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.360 
smash there and i'm just backing up with
my<00:05:49.430> pulse<00:05:49.760> as<00:05:50.060> I<00:05:50.780> kill<00:05:50.990> him<00:05:51.080> now<00:05:51.289> both<00:05:52.070> of<00:05:52.250> those

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
my pulse as I kill him now both of those

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.390 
my pulse as I kill him now both of those
weapons<00:05:52.669> that<00:05:52.970> I<00:05:53.030> have<00:05:53.270> the<00:05:53.690> pulse<00:05:54.400> gattling

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
weapons that I have the pulse gattling

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.029 
weapons that I have the pulse gattling
and<00:05:55.580> the<00:05:55.760> fire<00:05:56.090> gattling<00:05:56.720> weapon<00:05:57.080> are<00:05:57.229> pretty

00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:58.039 
and the fire gattling weapon are pretty

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:00.550 
and the fire gattling weapon are pretty
much<00:05:58.220> good<00:05:58.520> mid<00:05:59.030> to<00:05:59.479> close<00:05:59.750> range<00:06:00.110> now<00:06:00.500> the

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
much good mid to close range now the

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.399 
much good mid to close range now the
gattling<00:06:01.430> is<00:06:01.610> particularly<00:06:02.389> a<00:06:02.870> less

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:03.409 
gattling is particularly a less

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:05.800 
gattling is particularly a less
effective<00:06:03.949> at<00:06:04.099> mid<00:06:04.310> range<00:06:04.550> than<00:06:05.000> the<00:06:05.030> rifle

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
effective at mid range than the rifle

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
effective at mid range than the rifle
because<00:06:06.590> it<00:06:06.949> has<00:06:07.340> projectile<00:06:08.090> speed

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
because it has projectile speed

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.980 
because it has projectile speed
basically<00:06:09.830> it's<00:06:09.979> not<00:06:10.190> hits<00:06:10.430> can<00:06:10.729> therefore<00:06:11.389> i

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
basically it's not hits can therefore i

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.499 
basically it's not hits can therefore i
have<00:06:12.740> to<00:06:13.130> leave<00:06:13.280> my<00:06:13.490> shot<00:06:13.789> at<00:06:14.000> time<00:06:14.180> so<00:06:14.389> it's

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:14.509 
have to leave my shot at time so it's

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:16.540 
have to leave my shot at time so it's
definitely<00:06:14.870> a<00:06:14.960> lot<00:06:15.110> more<00:06:15.169> difficult<00:06:16.039> to<00:06:16.280> use

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
definitely a lot more difficult to use

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.510 
definitely a lot more difficult to use
the<00:06:16.820> pulse<00:06:17.090> versus<00:06:18.080> a<00:06:18.110> rifle<00:06:18.650> because<00:06:19.430> you

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
the pulse versus a rifle because you

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.029 
the pulse versus a rifle because you
don't<00:06:19.699> have<00:06:19.729> that<00:06:19.970> instantaneous<00:06:20.840> hits<00:06:21.710> can

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:22.039 
don't have that instantaneous hits can

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:26.080 
don't have that instantaneous hits can
damage<00:06:22.639> indicator<00:06:23.180> that<00:06:24.550> that<00:06:25.550> rifles<00:06:25.940> would

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
damage indicator that that rifles would

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.800 
damage indicator that that rifles would
have<00:06:26.240> so<00:06:26.979> the<00:06:27.979> again<00:06:28.909> the<00:06:28.940> fire<00:06:29.240> weapon<00:06:29.659> is

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810 
have so the again the fire weapon is

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.110 
have so the again the fire weapon is
definitely<00:06:30.500> one<00:06:31.159> that<00:06:31.310> I<00:06:31.400> think<00:06:31.639> can<00:06:31.759> be<00:06:31.880> used

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
definitely one that I think can be used

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.810 
definitely one that I think can be used
at<00:06:32.419> a<00:06:32.479> little<00:06:32.960> bit<00:06:33.139> longer<00:06:33.889> range<00:06:34.310> but<00:06:34.550> because

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:34.820 
at a little bit longer range but because

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:35.920 
at a little bit longer range but because
it's<00:06:35.000> gattling<00:06:35.360> it's<00:06:35.509> not<00:06:35.630> going<00:06:35.750> to<00:06:35.840> be

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
it's gattling it's not going to be

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.589 
it's gattling it's not going to be
accurate<00:06:36.250> super<00:06:37.250> long<00:06:37.550> distances<00:06:38.180> so<00:06:38.389> don't

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:38.599 
accurate super long distances so don't

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:39.790 
accurate super long distances so don't
expect<00:06:38.779> to

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 
expect to

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.920 
expect to
have<00:06:40.069> much<00:06:40.340> success<00:06:40.580> there<00:06:41.150> that<00:06:41.780> was

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:41.930 
have much success there that was

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.260 
have much success there that was
actually<00:06:42.110> my<00:06:42.409> first<00:06:42.620> death<00:06:43.039> but<00:06:43.940> that<00:06:44.030> pretty

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270 
actually my first death but that pretty

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.540 
actually my first death but that pretty
much<00:06:44.449> wraps<00:06:44.690> up<00:06:44.960> this<00:06:45.139> gameplay<00:06:45.409> we<00:06:46.340> pretty

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.550 
much wraps up this gameplay we pretty

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.040 
much wraps up this gameplay we pretty
much<00:06:46.639> shut<00:06:46.970> them<00:06:47.150> down<00:06:47.330> again<00:06:47.569> I<00:06:47.780> played

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.050 
much shut them down again I played

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.719 
much shut them down again I played
mostly<00:06:48.409> d<00:06:48.650> we<00:06:48.830> had<00:06:48.949> a<00:06:48.979> pretty<00:06:49.280> good<00:06:49.400> flag

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:49.729 
mostly d we had a pretty good flag

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:52.360 
mostly d we had a pretty good flag
carrier<00:06:50.210> I<00:06:50.560> think<00:06:51.560> I'm<00:06:51.710> actually<00:06:51.949> going<00:06:52.280> to

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.370 
carrier I think I'm actually going to

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.790 
carrier I think I'm actually going to
get<00:06:52.490> smashed<00:06:52.849> here<00:06:53.270> but<00:06:54.020> I<00:06:54.349> did<00:06:54.560> enough<00:06:54.770> damage

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 
get smashed here but I did enough damage

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.649 
get smashed here but I did enough damage
that<00:06:55.190> my<00:06:55.280> teammate<00:06:55.550> was<00:06:55.699> able<00:06:55.909> to<00:06:56.000> clean<00:06:56.210> clean

00:06:56.649 --> 00:06:56.659 
that my teammate was able to clean clean

00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:59.320 
that my teammate was able to clean clean
them<00:06:56.810> up<00:06:56.900> and<00:06:57.550> yeah<00:06:58.550> that's<00:06:58.669> pretty<00:06:58.819> much<00:06:59.090> how

00:06:59.320 --> 00:06:59.330 
them up and yeah that's pretty much how

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.640 
them up and yeah that's pretty much how
I<00:06:59.569> utilize<00:07:00.229> of<00:07:00.590> the<00:07:01.599> turret<00:07:02.599> and<00:07:02.870> those<00:07:03.440> two

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:03.650 
I utilize of the turret and those two

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:04.869
