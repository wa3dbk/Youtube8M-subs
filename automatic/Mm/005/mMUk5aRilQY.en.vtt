 singer 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.620
 my arm no longer block yours and then he will cut me 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:15.599
 for this reason I always accompanied the movement of his arm always until the 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.640
 final 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.180
 until I'm sure I'm in a correct and safe position 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:30.710
 2 here and now let pass the arm double cut and then enter with the 

00:00:30.709 --> 00:00:32.420
 angle one 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.250
 again 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.240
 two 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.380
 court cut to the court and re-enter city and also the distance and 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.220
 then the web or extend the maximum efe without exceeding always with a small

 reaction tochÃ© 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.980
 6 we should not increase the rhythm of the exercise either 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.770
 this kind of thing does not make much sense 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.460
 because we are training 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.590
 one 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:04.910
 two 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.050
 the cut 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.050
 to cut and volvo enter 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.470
 Cut the cut court and restart our partner will do the same 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.980
 with caranta vicent before arm and restart 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.050
 cut ante brasil fingers the same mate 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.270
 the same cut cut and then enter

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.130
 aznar 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.820
 doing the brics 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.260
 efe 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.720
 in that year 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.940
 actinver 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.080
 we apply the astonished program 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.360
 belt 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.610
 and from here it happened to the Cubans

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.140
 a foot this is a small example of our program of ims of exercises 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.829
 and we're only working with angle one 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:12.329
 mud 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:15.759
 from here we could do 2 

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:20.319
 2 attacked with angle 2 3 attack at angle 4 

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:26.909
 As you can see, Estella is a more advanced program, this was just a sample 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:30.679
