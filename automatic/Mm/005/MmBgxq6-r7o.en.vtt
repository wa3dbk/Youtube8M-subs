at all I usually just put one layer
foundation<00:02:48.760> on<00:02:48.850> because<00:02:49.239> I<00:02:49.830> never<00:02:50.830> really

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
foundation on because I never really

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.820 
foundation on because I never really
felt<00:02:52.270> the<00:02:52.450> need<00:02:52.600> to<00:02:52.870> go<00:02:53.020> for<00:02:53.290> more<00:02:53.440> than<00:02:53.590> one

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
think it does a really nice job

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.630 
think it does a really nice job
controlling<00:03:13.570> the<00:03:13.900> shine<00:03:14.200> so<00:03:14.709> far<00:03:14.950> without<00:03:15.160> the

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
controlling the shine so far without the

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:23.340 
controlling the shine so far without the
press<00:03:15.880> powder<00:03:16.980> so<00:03:19.140> right<00:03:20.140> now<00:03:22.170> there's<00:03:23.170> not<00:03:23.290> a

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
press powder so right now there's not a

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:30.600 
press powder so right now there's not a
CMS<00:03:24.840> so<00:03:25.840> I<00:03:26.170> suggest<00:03:27.100> wearing<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:29.610> little

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
CMS so I suggest wearing a little

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.180 
CMS so I suggest wearing a little
sunscreen<00:03:31.000> or<00:03:31.360> moisturizer<00:03:32.049> with<00:03:32.320> SPF<00:03:32.620> in<00:03:33.070> it

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
sunscreen or moisturizer with SPF in it

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.780 
sunscreen or moisturizer with SPF in it
so<00:03:34.000> it<00:03:34.060> really<00:03:34.269> helps<00:03:35.130> protect<00:03:36.130> your<00:03:36.400> face
