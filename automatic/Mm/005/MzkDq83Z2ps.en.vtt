coach of swimming Australia looking
forward<00:00:08.240> to<00:00:08.360> trials<00:00:08.840> and<00:00:09.110> a<00:00:09.170> good<00:00:09.320> start<00:00:09.620> of

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:09.769 
forward to trials and a good start of

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.090 
forward to trials and a good start of
the<00:00:09.920> year<00:00:09.950> a<00:00:10.420> good<00:00:11.420> start<00:00:11.780> starts<00:00:12.680> with<00:00:12.830> a<00:00:12.890> good

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:13.100 
the year a good start starts with a good

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.280 
the year a good start starts with a good
position<00:00:13.490> on<00:00:13.910> the<00:00:14.150> block<00:00:14.360> from<00:00:14.930> making<00:00:15.260> sure

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:15.290 
position on the block from making sure

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.950 
position on the block from making sure
that<00:00:15.890> you're<00:00:16.279> able<00:00:16.609> to<00:00:17.060> leave<00:00:17.240> the<00:00:17.270> block<00:00:17.630> very

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
that you're able to leave the block very

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.540 
that you're able to leave the block very
fast<00:00:18.320> this<00:00:18.619> is<00:00:18.769> what<00:00:18.919> we<00:00:19.009> call<00:00:19.189> the<00:00:19.310> block

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
fast this is what we call the block

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.390 
fast this is what we call the block
times<00:00:19.849> of<00:00:20.210> course<00:00:20.990> also<00:00:21.349> the<00:00:21.619> good<00:00:21.800> position

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
times of course also the good position

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.159 
times of course also the good position
on<00:00:22.519> the<00:00:22.609> block<00:00:22.820> allows<00:00:23.150> you<00:00:23.419> to<00:00:23.630> push<00:00:23.900> off

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:24.169 
on the block allows you to push off

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:26.710 
on the block allows you to push off
really<00:00:25.130> hard<00:00:25.369> which<00:00:25.669> makes<00:00:25.699> the<00:00:26.119> long<00:00:26.329> flight

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
really hard which makes the long flight

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.220 
really hard which makes the long flight
time<00:00:27.050> so<00:00:27.769> you<00:00:27.829> enter<00:00:28.369> the<00:00:28.519> water<00:00:28.699> as<00:00:29.089> far<00:00:29.929> as

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
time so you enter the water as far as

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.250 
time so you enter the water as far as
possible<00:00:30.619> and<00:00:31.130> then<00:00:31.880> it<00:00:32.029> comes<00:00:32.239> to<00:00:32.599> a<00:00:32.870> good

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
possible and then it comes to a good

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.770 
possible and then it comes to a good
streamline<00:00:33.860> position<00:00:34.100> make<00:00:35.030> a<00:00:35.059> good<00:00:35.390> what<00:00:35.750> we

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
streamline position make a good what we

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.680 
streamline position make a good what we
call<00:00:36.140> dive<00:00:36.559> in<00:00:36.800> one<00:00:36.980> hole<00:00:37.190> a<00:00:37.550> good<00:00:37.820> streamline

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
call dive in one hole a good streamline

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.229 
call dive in one hole a good streamline
and<00:00:38.960> of<00:00:39.469> course<00:00:39.739> the<00:00:39.980> underwater<00:00:40.399> chick<00:00:40.699> which

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
and of course the underwater chick which

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.349 
and of course the underwater chick which
is<00:00:41.449> really<00:00:41.840> important<00:00:42.730> fly<00:00:43.730> kicks<00:00:44.059> on<00:00:44.269> the

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:44.359 
is really important fly kicks on the

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:46.509 
is really important fly kicks on the
water<00:00:44.539> so<00:00:44.989> I<00:00:45.289> would<00:00:45.649> advise<00:00:46.010> anyone<00:00:46.340> to

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
water so I would advise anyone to

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:48.459 
water so I would advise anyone to
practice<00:00:47.030> that<00:00:47.059> well<00:00:47.690> it's<00:00:47.899> quite<00:00:48.079> a<00:00:48.170> while

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
practice that well it's quite a while

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.500 
practice that well it's quite a while
ago<00:00:48.800> that<00:00:49.039> we<00:00:49.250> changed<00:00:49.699> position<00:00:50.269> on<00:00:50.390> the

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
ago that we changed position on the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.779 
ago that we changed position on the
block<00:00:50.719> from<00:00:50.960> the<00:00:51.050> two-footed<00:00:51.890> position<00:00:52.609> up

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
block from the two-footed position up

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.360 
block from the two-footed position up
front<00:00:53.210> in<00:00:53.420> the<00:00:53.539> block<00:00:53.750> there's<00:00:54.469> a<00:00:54.559> track<00:00:55.070> start

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
front in the block there's a track start

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.369 
front in the block there's a track start
position<00:00:55.940> everybody<00:00:56.539> is<00:00:56.719> doing<00:00:56.989> that<00:00:57.140> now

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
position everybody is doing that now

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.639 
position everybody is doing that now
what<00:00:58.190> is<00:00:58.309> really<00:00:58.640> important<00:00:59.420> on<00:00:59.600> that<00:00:59.839> is<00:01:00.019> that

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
what is really important on that is that

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.479 
what is really important on that is that
when<00:01:00.920> you're<00:01:01.699> backwards<00:01:02.390> foot<00:01:03.050> leaves<00:01:03.829> the

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
when you're backwards foot leaves the

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.630 
when you're backwards foot leaves the
block<00:01:04.760> your<00:01:05.420> your<00:01:05.810> front<00:01:06.260> knee<00:01:06.530> your<00:01:07.400> front

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
block your your front knee your front

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.120 
block your your front knee your front
leg<00:01:07.939> is<00:01:08.270> taking<00:01:08.810> over<00:01:08.930> so<00:01:09.290> the<00:01:09.439> momentum<00:01:10.009> of

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
leg is taking over so the momentum of

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.580 
leg is taking over so the momentum of
that<00:01:10.390> creating<00:01:11.390> that<00:01:11.540> momentum<00:01:12.140> is<00:01:12.259> really

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
that creating that momentum is really

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.030 
that creating that momentum is really
important<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:14.090> entry<00:01:14.659> should<00:01:15.320> be<00:01:15.500> nuts<00:01:15.799> to

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
important the entry should be nuts to

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.130 
important the entry should be nuts to
sleep<00:01:16.549> because<00:01:17.150> we<00:01:17.329> want<00:01:17.509> the<00:01:17.600> forward

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
sleep because we want the forward

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.069 
sleep because we want the forward
direction<00:01:18.979> so<00:01:19.579> it's<00:01:19.759> important<00:01:20.360> if<00:01:20.479> you<00:01:20.869> want

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079 
direction so it's important if you want

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:23.139 
direction so it's important if you want
to<00:01:21.170> move<00:01:21.290> forward<00:01:21.649> to<00:01:22.460> go<00:01:22.640> as<00:01:22.820> straightforward

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
to move forward to go as straightforward

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.440 
to move forward to go as straightforward
as<00:01:23.600> possible<00:01:24.280> with<00:01:25.280> this<00:01:25.490> entry<00:01:26.030> it<00:01:26.270> is

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
as possible with this entry it is

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.630 
as possible with this entry it is
important<00:01:27.049> that<00:01:27.229> you<00:01:27.259> have<00:01:27.640> maximum

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
important that you have maximum

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.660 
important that you have maximum
streamline<00:01:29.270> so<00:01:29.930> that<00:01:30.110> means<00:01:30.409> straight<00:01:31.219> arms

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
streamline so that means straight arms

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.510 
streamline so that means straight arms
your<00:01:32.270> hands<00:01:32.509> release<00:01:33.079> together<00:01:33.500> your<00:01:34.250> head

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
your hands release together your head

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.660 
your hands release together your head
between<00:01:34.969> your<00:01:35.240> arms<00:01:35.420> and<00:01:35.960> making<00:01:36.560> your<00:01:37.399> whole

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
between your arms and making your whole

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.389 
between your arms and making your whole
line<00:01:38.509> through<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.170> water<00:01:39.380> as<00:01:39.680> smooth<00:01:40.159> as

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
line through the water as smooth as

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.300 
line through the water as smooth as
possible<00:01:40.869> other<00:01:41.869> breakout<00:01:42.619> is<00:01:42.829> really

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
possible other breakout is really

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.819 
possible other breakout is really
important<00:01:43.880> because<00:01:43.939> the<00:01:44.810> highest<00:01:45.320> peak<00:01:45.619> you

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
important because the highest peak you

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.209 
important because the highest peak you
will<00:01:45.979> get<00:01:46.189> in<00:01:46.460> a<00:01:46.610> race<00:01:46.820> is<00:01:47.119> about<00:01:48.020> water<00:01:48.649> after

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
will get in a race is about water after

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:51.490 
will get in a race is about water after
the<00:01:49.340> start<00:01:49.670> and<00:01:49.939> underwater<00:01:50.570> during<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.170> fly

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
the start and underwater during the fly

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.969 
the start and underwater during the fly
kicks<00:01:51.939> nothing<00:01:52.939> can<00:01:53.210> match<00:01:53.390> that<00:01:53.689> speed<00:01:54.079> so

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
kicks nothing can match that speed so

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.219 
kicks nothing can match that speed so
when<00:01:55.640> you're<00:01:55.820> in<00:01:56.000> streamline<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:56.899> making

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
when you're in streamline and making

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.859 
when you're in streamline and making
your<00:01:57.409> first<00:01:57.619> stroke<00:01:58.039> it<00:01:58.399> is<00:01:58.820> really<00:01:59.329> important

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
your first stroke it is really important

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.440 
your first stroke it is really important
you<00:01:59.930> hold<00:02:00.320> your<00:02:00.619> streamline<00:02:01.219> you<00:02:01.850> stay<00:02:02.180> in<00:02:02.359> a

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
you hold your streamline you stay in a

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.690 
you hold your streamline you stay in a
flexed<00:02:02.780> position<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:03.590> you'll<00:02:04.039> benefit<00:02:04.640> from

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
flexed position and you'll benefit from

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.490 
flexed position and you'll benefit from
that<00:02:05.479> speed<00:02:05.990> you<00:02:06.200> get

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
that speed you get
