00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:08.060
 and how 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:12.980
 the 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:14.190
 a young hill activates the law as you 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.780
 want to call 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.730
 today we will be 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:23.689
 giving this accessory for what 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.750
 come out spectacular or change that look 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.849
 at the last minute that they can 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.320
 do what's important and what's best here 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:34.790
 is that I for example 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.160
 extensions that we have recycled 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:41.360
 we talk about the ucm remove them and which 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:45.260
 usually which in this case already 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.809
 mine are already made 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.410
 the end such a look is that such packaging 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:54.260
 as you can see, absolutely nothing is seen 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.440
 true in this case is that you can 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:01.520
 use like this all if you're when you 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.350
 passes the blower with athens control or what 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.940
 that is usually propaganda 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.660
 annoying truth 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.830
 and they are not what I do is that I put it 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.830
 below here 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.310
 then for 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:19.350
 cut them I really used a holder 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.049
 razor that use it 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.170
 the barbers I love using this 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.750
 per dollar 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.890
 never scissors because I do not like 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.080
 use it 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.080
 now let's proceed to mickeal candle 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.930
 the pollina 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.990
 As I told you, I already have it on 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.180
 would have that is the other suburb opened 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.640
 then explain to you 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.280
 scratch how is that it gets first that 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.840
 everything you make a score candle and 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.770
 industrially I use it on the side 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.310
 left on the water here you m 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.310
 the score 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.240
 I know how you are going to have your hair fly 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.870
 loose here what he does is that you make him 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.980
 a score I usually advise 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.980
 to make it finite 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.039
 so here 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.030
 exceptions already supposedly have glue 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.360
 and the glue 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.240
 from the shore there is air from the 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.250
 shore will see how it gets stuck 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.890
 and from there 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.620
 from here 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.620
 that is what they are going to do 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.620
 consecutively 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.120
 on the other hand it lasts longer and another party 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.270
 can never exponent 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:46.090
 to four sections as 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:49.520
 usually because now I have four 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.390
 with the t4 you can put between three to your 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.460
 taste 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.780
 you want them with the loaded pieces of 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.080
 front 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.520
 Then you put it on her and tell her 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.780
 every time I lay I only 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:06.530
 I wear 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:08.530
 because they stay like this in a row 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.380
 after he finished 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:17.060
 until the super long 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:19.250
 what I do is that as you will find low 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.470
 as well directly and I start from 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.820
 here since my arrival 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.820
 and cutting it 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.659
 diagonal 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:40.159
 so it's already going down as if it were 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.159
 and you will have this shot 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.770
 As I told you, I use a candle 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.569
 and that from here we are going to cut the 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.510
 fabric here nothing because I like it 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:55.130
 You can also do it with people 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.800
 have the 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:01.120
 the fringe on something the long skirt 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:04.760
 you can also make it look something else 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.890
 and you put your hair over here 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.380
 full 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.600
 a pinche or whatever to put up with 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.860
 tonight's evening and proceed to 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.270
 stick on the fringes 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.280
 and what it does is that then the 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.959
 fourth but what you touched stupor and 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.290
 nothing has being the same degree of 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.290
 to know 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.950
 I love 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:31.000
 the me for having 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:33.300
 just like I told them and then that's why it's 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.300
 that always 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:42.210
 it's something quick to remove and very useful 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:45.380
 at the time of leaving and seeing you differently 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.380
 It looks spectacular 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.670
 so I hope you enjoyed it 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.670
 if they have any question 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.320
 write here 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.210
 because then I would have liked to see it from 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:03.190
 the beginning 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:05.490
 unfortunately, I already bet and I 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.490
 they had told 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.240
 here 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.449
 well, you know 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.849
 use it the rest 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:18.009
 without functions 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:18.009
 then vote so 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:26.380
 ok thanks but what 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.380
 good for
