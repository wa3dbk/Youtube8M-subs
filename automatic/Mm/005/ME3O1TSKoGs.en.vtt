00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
While no two plasma TVs are the exact same, there are some fundamental pieces needed to make a plasma TV.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Lets remove the back cover and bezel and take a look inside of a few.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:42.000
With the cover removed you can see that a plasma TV is basically a series of fuse glass display panels with a sheet of chemically treated protective glass in the front and printed circuit boards in the back.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The fuse glass portion makes up the plasma display panel or PDP assembly, and the area where the circuit boards are arranged on the backside of the panel is typically the chassis.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The PDP assembly is a system of millions of cells filled with a small amount of mercury and various gases and phosphors.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.000
When excited by an electrical charge, the mercury gives off UV photons which hit the phosphors and give off visible colored light creating the mosaic of colored pixels that make up the images on your screen.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The screen is connected to the chassis PCBs via copper and gold ribbon cables.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
These ribbon cables are permanently fused within the screen and can only be repaired by replacing the entire PDP assembly.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000
While plasma display technology may seem complicated, replacing plasma TV parts only requires a screwdriver and some patience.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Finding a replacement screen requires both the panel information found on the identification labels on the chassis side of the PDP assembly, and the model information found on the back and or sides of the TV cover.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Replacement panels are typically high in price and hard to find.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
In most cases a cracked or defective screen means that it's time to purchase a new TV.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
The backside of the PDP assembly is typically referred to as the chassis.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
This is where the fundamental circuit boards are mounted.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
While plasma boards vary in appearance and location, a plasma TV needs the following items in order to function.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
The power supply takes in and distributes power throughout the TV.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
This board is either directly connected to your AC power cord or is connected to the AC adapter.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The main board typically manages your accessory inputs and outputs and houses the TV tuner.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The Y-Sustain or YSUS board is located on the left hand side of the chassis.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Some manufacturers also refer to this board as the Y-Main or SC board.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The Y-Sustain connects to the PDP assembly through a buffer system most commonly called a Y-Buffer or a scan drive.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
This buffer system can be comprised of one or two boards, or can be built directly into the Y-Sustain.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
On the right hand side of the chassis is another sustain board.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Depending on manufacturer this sustain board is called the X-Sustain, X-Main, Z-Sustain, or SS board.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Running along the bottom of the chassis is a system of skinny boards known as address buffers.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
In some older and larger plasma TVs there can be another line of address buffers along the top of the chassis.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Some manufacturers call these boards logic buffers while others may give each buffer a different identification letter typically starting with the letter C.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
The logic board is connected to the main board and address buffers via flat ribbon cables and can sometimes be hidden underneath the main board.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000
ShopJimmy always suggests searching for replacement TV parts by part number, but sometimes more information is required to select the correct part for the TV.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Before beginning the search for replacement plasma TV parts it is best to take a look at the labels on the back and or sides of your TV and write down the brand, model, serial number, and model code if available.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Some replacement boards are chassis or panel specific so be sure to look for labels on the back of the panel and write down the brand, model number, and serial number as well.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
