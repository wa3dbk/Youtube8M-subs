he does have this web type of thing that
has<00:00:21.030> well<00:00:21.240> has<00:00:21.270> we<00:00:21.570> used<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:22.130> many<00:00:23.130> times<00:00:23.490> on

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:23.790 
has well has we used this many times on

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.220 
has well has we used this many times on
different<00:00:23.820> spider-man<00:00:24.510> action<00:00:24.900> for<00:00:25.050> years

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
different spider-man action for years

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.110 
different spider-man action for years
and<00:00:25.950> we'll<00:00:26.070> probably<00:00:26.220> use<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.820> future

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:27.120 
and we'll probably use it in the future

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.180 
and we'll probably use it in the future
again<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.630> really<00:00:28.470> don't<00:00:28.620> like<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.920> too<00:00:29.040> much

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:29.190 
again I really don't like it too much

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.630 
again I really don't like it too much
you<00:00:29.760> could<00:00:29.880> probably<00:00:30.090> make<00:00:30.270> something<00:00:30.780> better

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
you could probably make something better

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.680 
you could probably make something better
yourself<00:00:32.640> okay<00:00:33.450> that's<00:00:33.890> all<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.040> has<00:00:35.250> but<00:00:35.820> look

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
yourself okay that's all it has but look

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.650 
yourself okay that's all it has but look
at<00:00:36.780> than<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.250> they<00:00:38.250> do<00:00:38.310> have<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.880> future

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
at than that they do have a future

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.560 
at than that they do have a future
foundation<00:00:40.350> Fantastic<00:00:41.100> Four<00:00:41.310> set<00:00:41.550> up<00:00:41.700> it's<00:00:42.420> a

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
foundation Fantastic Four set up it's a

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.750 
foundation Fantastic Four set up it's a
three<00:00:42.780> pack<00:00:43.020> if<00:00:43.380> you<00:00:43.590> get<00:00:43.740> that<00:00:43.950> three<00:00:44.520> pack

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
three pack if you get that three pack

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.850 
three pack if you get that three pack
and<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.090> get<00:00:45.210> this<00:00:45.360> spider-man<00:00:45.990> it'll<00:00:46.739> be

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
and you get this spider-man it'll be

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.990 
and you get this spider-man it'll be
matching<00:00:47.630> and<00:00:48.860> really<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.890> wonder<00:00:50.340> why<00:00:50.790> they

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
matching and really I wonder why they

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.910 
matching and really I wonder why they
didn't<00:00:51.360> just<00:00:51.390> include<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.110> Spider<00:00:52.410> Man<00:00:52.650> in

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
didn't just include the Spider Man in

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.450 
didn't just include the Spider Man in
the<00:00:53.070> Future<00:00:53.340> Foundation<00:00:53.460> box<00:00:54.060> set<00:00:55.250> one<00:00:56.250> thing

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
the Future Foundation box set one thing

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.370 
the Future Foundation box set one thing
you'll<00:00:56.610> notice<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.600> don't<00:00:57.750> like<00:00:57.960> too<00:00:58.200> much

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380 
you'll notice that I don't like too much

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.670 
you'll notice that I don't like too much
is<00:00:58.680> they<00:00:59.160> use<00:00:59.460> too<00:00:59.700> much<00:00:59.880> shading<00:01:00.440> look<00:01:01.440> just

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
is they use too much shading look just

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.189 
is they use too much shading look just
hold<00:01:01.829> area<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.430> mask<00:01:02.730> what<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.079> got

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
hold area to mask what is it you got

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.050 
hold area to mask what is it you got
like<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.559> beard<00:01:04.949> or<00:01:05.100> something<00:01:05.129> it's<00:01:05.909> all

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
like the beard or something it's all

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.469 
like the beard or something it's all
shaded<00:01:06.569> and<00:01:07.069> the<00:01:08.069> shading<00:01:08.369> here<00:01:08.579> is<00:01:08.729> like<00:01:08.939> gray

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
shaded and the shading here is like gray

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.069 
shaded and the shading here is like gray
almost<00:01:10.020> too<00:01:10.560> black<00:01:10.859> and<00:01:11.270> they<00:01:12.270> put<00:01:12.509> it<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:13.020> a

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:13.079 
almost too black and they put it on a

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:14.989 
almost too black and they put it on a
lot<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.649> body<00:01:13.889> parts<00:01:14.310> here<00:01:14.579> I<00:01:14.670> don't<00:01:14.789> know

00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:14.999 
lot of the body parts here I don't know

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:17.149 
lot of the body parts here I don't know
why<00:01:15.259> because<00:01:16.259> if<00:01:16.469> you<00:01:16.560> look<00:01:16.710> at<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.859> Marvel

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
why because if you look at the Marvel

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.480 
why because if you look at the Marvel
Legends<00:01:17.579> I<00:01:18.439> like<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.649> one<00:01:19.799> better<00:01:20.069> because

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
Legends I like that one better because

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.580 
Legends I like that one better because
it<00:01:20.639> was<00:01:20.729> just<00:01:20.789> white<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.840> black<00:01:22.139> and<00:01:22.439> they

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
it was just white and black and they

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.410 
it was just white and black and they
didn't<00:01:22.799> put<00:01:23.009> shading<00:01:23.249> on<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.240> really

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
didn't put shading on it and it really

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.050 
didn't put shading on it and it really
isn't<00:01:25.350> needed<00:01:25.740> for<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.340> type<00:01:26.579> of<00:01:26.609> figure<00:01:26.909> I

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
isn't needed for this type of figure I

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.629 
isn't needed for this type of figure I
think<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.630> think<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.530> shading<00:01:28.889> actually<00:01:29.310> hurt

00:01:29.629 --> 00:01:29.639 
think I think the shading actually hurt

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:32.569 
think I think the shading actually hurt
the<00:01:29.850> overall<00:01:29.969> impression<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:32.100> figure

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
the overall impression of the figure

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.510 
the overall impression of the figure
then<00:01:32.969> if<00:01:33.149> it<00:01:33.270> didn't<00:01:33.630> have<00:01:33.749> the<00:01:33.779> shading<00:01:34.520> one

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
then if it didn't have the shading one

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.580 
then if it didn't have the shading one
of<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.880> odd<00:01:36.240> things<00:01:36.270> about<00:01:36.929> the<00:01:37.109> spider-man

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
of the odd things about the spider-man

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.219 
of the odd things about the spider-man
figure<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:38.729> he<00:01:39.119> seems<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.420> little<00:01:39.509> more<00:01:39.689> bulky

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
figure is he seems a little more bulky

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.249 
figure is he seems a little more bulky
than<00:01:40.709> previous<00:01:41.399> spider-man<00:01:41.969> figures<00:01:42.899> at<00:01:43.200> the

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
than previous spider-man figures at the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.440 
than previous spider-man figures at the
upper<00:01:43.529> body<00:01:43.740> seems<00:01:44.130> kind<00:01:44.459> of<00:01:44.579> wider<00:01:45.029> than

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
upper body seems kind of wider than

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.449 
upper body seems kind of wider than
usual<00:01:46.039> especially<00:01:47.039> for<00:01:47.159> this<00:01:47.219> type<00:01:47.429> of

00:01:47.449 --> 00:01:47.459 
usual especially for this type of

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:50.300 
usual especially for this type of
character<00:01:47.969> and<00:01:48.920> that<00:01:49.920> was<00:01:50.039> kind<00:01:50.219> of

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
character and that was kind of

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.260 
character and that was kind of
surprising<00:01:51.409> also<00:01:52.409> he<00:01:52.529> has<00:01:52.700> really<00:01:53.700> two<00:01:53.909> closed

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
surprising also he has really two closed

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.859 
surprising also he has really two closed
hands<00:01:54.840> almost<00:01:55.490> no<00:01:56.490> spider-man<00:01:57.029> type<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.630> hand

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
hands almost no spider-man type of hand

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.709 
hands almost no spider-man type of hand
pose<00:01:58.169> which<00:01:58.799> usually<00:01:59.579> that's<00:01:59.939> what<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.359> get

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
pose which usually that's what you get

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.230 
pose which usually that's what you get
on<00:02:00.869> spider-man<00:02:01.259> figure<00:02:01.529> by<00:02:01.829> Hasbro<00:02:02.310> but<00:02:03.090> not

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
on spider-man figure by Hasbro but not

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.529 
on spider-man figure by Hasbro but not
in<00:02:03.359> this<00:02:03.509> case<00:02:04.759> it's<00:02:05.759> not<00:02:05.939> as<00:02:06.090> good<00:02:06.270> as<00:02:06.389> the

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
in this case it's not as good as the

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.359 
in this case it's not as good as the
Marvel<00:02:06.810> Legends<00:02:07.229> one<00:02:07.499> because<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:07.979> think<00:02:08.130> the

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
Marvel Legends one because I think the

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.969 
Marvel Legends one because I think the

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
shading and overusing it like this

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.720 
shading and overusing it like this
really<00:02:11.640> hurt<00:02:12.269> the<00:02:12.420> overall<00:02:12.840> impression<00:02:13.730> but

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
the bottom of the feet look at that so

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:48.770 
the bottom of the feet look at that so
he<00:02:42.510> has<00:02:42.780> this<00:02:43.620> whole<00:02:46.189> detailed<00:02:47.780> paint
