00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.770
 hello to all and besides this new episode but everything will depend 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.770
 today some tips to make a success of his father 

00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:12.649
 even if we find less and less wood last on modern boats 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.449
 some of you are probably thinking of what to do for the long 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:17.919
 winter evenings 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:21.059
 but before the last one must find the beautiful varnish 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.289
 this will be determined by weight and will allow 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.810
 and I dream maybe wanted to remember 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.919
 classic 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.399
 that idea 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.720
 can you present the range proposed by the international 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.490
 its range of products which for years they are based on 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:38.730
 polyurethane 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.730
 which would allow a better finish and a better durability 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.510
 the original is a classic friend 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.070
 almost transparent 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.100
 it is rather suitable for convoys clear its use the hotel will not be 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.920
 lower for outdoor 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.510
 you then prepare him his share 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.940
 it was indicated that the finish and satin 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.320
 rather recommended for indoor use 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.320
 and we're leaving you have the scooter gold 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.500
 a lot more shading at the finish 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.549
 the latter are enough as well there one accelerates as inside 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.190
 These are leaner than bono components 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.500
 comments on 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.730
 there are friends that ten components does it small components 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.390
 to finish a better finish 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.700
 better product durability 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.090
 a better resistance you follow 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.240
 If international the product offered enppi components and perfection more 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.800
 concerning the involvement of others 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.830
 it's generally the same way for all guys 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.990
 indeed the stooges first prepare its surface it will take by the p all 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.480
 the causes of the accident the hand 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.510
 for that it will have to think 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.070
 then deglaze the season 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.210
 then you will be able to apply your first layer of varnish 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.630
 to rise to about 10% which will penetrate varnish properly 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.360
 then begins a long work 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.140
 sanding and varnishing I recommend sanding between each 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.480
 layer or at least all and layers 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.969
 knowing that for realized 

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:10.349
 very beautiful varnish 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.749
 it takes five to six layers 

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:15.129
 I also advise you for the application used detention 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:19.329
 sparkling or exceed the users an older brush and will therefore tend to 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:20.850
 Paris we try to hairs 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:21.889
 on the term 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:23.600
 what he will do a little later 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.600
 the team is proud of all that has been mentioned 

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:31.599
 I advise you to apply it another product in well ventilated places 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:34.269
 to avoid all these inconveniences 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.570
 eventually this creates the compass 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.800
 last fall fast-drying 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.960
 who does not tolerate for wise children every two or three layers 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:46.099
 here you have all the keys in hand to make beautiful the mythical 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:47.839
 producer at your boat 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:50.570
 this episode ends if you have questions 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.740
 I invite you to leave me a bitter taste 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.199

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:56.099

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.419
