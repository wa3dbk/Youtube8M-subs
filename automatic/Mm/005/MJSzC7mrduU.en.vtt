next<00:03:53.359> alright<00:03:53.690> so<00:03:53.959> here<00:03:54.229> is<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:54.709> wireless

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
next alright so here is the wireless

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.740 
next alright so here is the wireless
receiver<00:03:55.579> and<00:03:55.699> you'll<00:03:55.879> see<00:03:56.060> there's<00:03:56.269> like<00:03:56.449> a

little green LED on there and it's solid

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.649 
little green LED on there and it's solid
right<00:04:00.139> now<00:04:00.169> now<00:04:00.470> there's<00:04:00.769> a<00:04:00.829> button<00:04:01.659> right

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:02.659 
right now now there's a button right

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.439 
right now now there's a button right
here<00:04:02.690> that<00:04:03.620> you<00:04:03.739> can<00:04:03.919> press<00:04:04.220> and<00:04:05.060> it<00:04:05.209> will<00:04:05.329> make

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:05.449 
here that you can press and it will make

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:08.170 
here that you can press and it will make
that<00:04:05.479> flash<00:04:06.250> and<00:04:07.250> when<00:04:07.340> that's<00:04:07.549> flashing<00:04:07.849> it's

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
that flash and when that's flashing it's

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.809 
that flash and when that's flashing it's
looking<00:04:08.569> to<00:04:08.810> sync<00:04:09.139> up<00:04:09.290> a<00:04:09.560> controller<00:04:10.370> with<00:04:10.669> it

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
looking to sync up a controller with it

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:12.430 
looking to sync up a controller with it
and<00:04:11.000> so<00:04:11.510> the<00:04:11.599> first<00:04:11.780> time<00:04:11.989> you<00:04:12.109> use<00:04:12.260> it<00:04:12.290> you

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
and so the first time you use it you

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.110 
and so the first time you use it you
need<00:04:12.650> to<00:04:12.680> kind<00:04:12.919> of<00:04:12.979> sync<00:04:13.190> it<00:04:13.310> up<00:04:13.400> so<00:04:13.699> that<00:04:13.729> they

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
need to kind of sync it up so that they

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.599 
need to kind of sync it up so that they
know<00:04:14.659> each<00:04:14.840> other<00:04:14.989> exists<00:04:15.739> it's<00:04:16.190> kind<00:04:16.400> of<00:04:16.430> like

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
know each other exists it's kind of like

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.050 
know each other exists it's kind of like

going to press that and when we press
that<00:04:43.580> it<00:04:44.580> tells<00:04:44.850> the<00:04:45.240> controller<00:04:45.690> to<00:04:46.020> send<00:04:46.260> out

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
that it tells the controller to send out

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.620 
that it tells the controller to send out
a<00:04:46.410> signal<00:04:46.650> to<00:04:46.979> sync<00:04:47.250> with<00:04:47.639> a<00:04:47.669> receiver<00:04:48.090> when<00:04:48.479> we

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
a signal to sync with a receiver when we

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.939 
a signal to sync with a receiver when we
do<00:04:48.780> that<00:04:48.930> it<00:04:49.139> will<00:04:49.199> look<00:04:49.380> they'll<00:04:49.650> look<00:04:49.889> for

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
do that it will look they'll look for

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:51.439 
do that it will look they'll look for
each<00:04:50.250> other<00:04:50.490> and<00:04:50.760> then<00:04:51.030> they'll<00:04:51.180> sync

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
each other and then they'll sync

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:53.960 
each other and then they'll sync
together<00:04:51.600> and<00:04:52.220> once<00:04:53.220> they're<00:04:53.430> done<00:04:53.550> syncing

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
together and once they're done syncing

together and once they're done syncing
together<00:04:54.270> they<00:04:54.510> should<00:04:54.720> should<00:04:55.289> work<00:04:55.500> okay<00:04:55.620> so

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
together they should should work okay so

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.680 
together they should should work okay so
what<00:04:56.160> we'll<00:04:56.250> do<00:04:56.400> is<00:04:56.550> we'll<00:04:56.669> test<00:04:56.910> it<00:04:57.150> all<00:04:57.419> right

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
what we'll do is we'll test it all right

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.219 
what we'll do is we'll test it all right
we're<00:04:57.780> going<00:04:57.900> to<00:04:57.930> use<00:04:58.139> a<00:04:58.760> program<00:04:59.760> called<00:05:00.229> game

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
we're going to use a program called game

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.760 
we're going to use a program called game
booster<00:05:01.500> by<00:05:02.039> Razer<00:05:02.340> and<00:05:03.350> it's<00:05:04.350> supposed<00:05:04.650> to

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
booster by Razer and it's supposed to

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.310 
booster by Razer and it's supposed to
actually<00:05:05.510> adjust<00:05:06.510> your<00:05:06.660> computer<00:05:07.139> for

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
actually adjust your computer for

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.770 
actually adjust your computer for
different<00:05:07.729> video<00:05:08.729> games<00:05:09.060> so<00:05:09.389> that<00:05:09.419> they<00:05:09.600> run

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
different video games so that they run

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.050 
different video games so that they run
more<00:05:10.020> efficiently<00:05:10.560> but<00:05:10.830> it<00:05:11.070> just<00:05:11.550> so<00:05:11.699> happens

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
more efficiently but it just so happens

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.870 
more efficiently but it just so happens
that<00:05:12.120> it's<00:05:12.360> compatible<00:05:12.780> with<00:05:13.289> an<00:05:13.560> Xbox<00:05:14.340> 360

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
that it's compatible with an Xbox 360

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.240 
that it's compatible with an Xbox 360
controller<00:05:15.240> so<00:05:15.930> it's<00:05:16.080> a<00:05:16.139> good<00:05:16.320> way<00:05:16.560> to<00:05:16.590> test<00:05:16.979> it

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
controller so it's a good way to test it

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.189 
controller so it's a good way to test it
and<00:05:17.400> it's<00:05:17.820> available<00:05:18.030> for<00:05:18.449> free<00:05:18.510> so<00:05:18.930> I'll<00:05:19.050> put

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 
and it's available for free so I'll put

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.860 
and it's available for free so I'll put
a<00:05:19.229> link<00:05:19.470> to<00:05:19.760> that<00:05:20.760> in<00:05:21.030> the<00:05:21.060> video<00:05:21.389> below<00:05:21.630> as

well if you want to use that if you
already<00:05:23.669> have<00:05:23.970> a<00:05:24.000> program<00:05:24.419> that<00:05:24.630> you<00:05:24.720> know

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
already have a program that you know

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.159 
already have a program that you know
will<00:05:25.200> work<00:05:25.380> with<00:05:25.710> the<00:05:25.860> Xbox<00:05:25.970> 360<00:05:26.970> controller

will work with the Xbox 360 controller
you<00:05:28.169> could<00:05:28.320> use<00:05:28.500> that<00:05:28.740> as<00:05:28.979> well<00:05:29.330> not<00:05:30.330> all<00:05:30.660> games

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
you could use that as well not all games

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.560 
you could use that as well not all games
are<00:05:31.560> designed<00:05:31.740> to<00:05:32.070> run<00:05:32.220> with<00:05:32.400> the<00:05:32.490> Xbox<00:05:32.910> 360

work<00:05:38.970> out<00:05:39.210> whether<00:05:39.510> it<00:05:39.900> works<00:05:40.169> with<00:05:40.410> different

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
work out whether it works with different
