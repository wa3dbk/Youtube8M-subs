want out of the three I chose the last

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.999 
want out of the three I chose the last
one<00:01:27.750> but<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.049> can<00:01:28.170> choose<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.680> first<00:01:28.799> or

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
one but you can choose the first or

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.980 
one but you can choose the first or
second<00:01:29.369> personally<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.210> think<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.600> first<00:01:30.810> one

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
second personally I think the first one

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.780 
second personally I think the first one
is<00:01:31.229> better<00:01:31.619> than<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.860> second<00:01:32.220> one<00:01:32.310> but<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.549> like

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
is better than the second one but I like

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.550 
is better than the second one but I like
the<00:01:32.820> third<00:01:33.150> one<00:01:33.329> better<00:01:33.540> than<00:01:33.659> them<00:01:33.780> all<00:01:33.930> but

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
the third one better than them all but

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.649 
the third one better than them all but
people<00:01:35.189> have<00:01:35.280> different<00:01:35.579> tastes<00:01:35.970> here's<00:01:36.570> the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
people have different tastes here's the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.859 
people have different tastes here's the
tunes<00:01:36.990> tune<00:01:37.590> itself<00:01:38.210> I'm<00:01:39.210> i<00:01:39.329> think<00:01:39.570> when<00:01:39.659> i<00:01:39.720> had

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
tunes tune itself I'm i think when i had

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.679 
tunes tune itself I'm i think when i had
its<00:01:40.079> talk<00:01:40.470> like<00:01:41.460> with<00:01:41.670> without<00:01:42.119> tuning<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.659> up

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
its talk like with without tuning it up

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.910 
its talk like with without tuning it up

205<00:01:55.740> when<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.670> upgrade<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.540> all<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:58.290> once<00:01:58.530> you

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
205 when you upgrade it all and once you

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.109 
205 when you upgrade it all and once you
tune<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.100> if<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.430> know<00:01:59.579> right<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.880> can<00:02:00.000> get

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
tune it if you to know right you can get

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.090 
tune it if you to know right you can get
it<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.360> this<00:02:00.479> feat<00:02:00.719> which<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.020> got<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.320> 240<00:02:01.890> point

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
it to this feat which I got to 240 point

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.940 
it to this feat which I got to 240 point
five<00:02:02.340> miles<00:02:03.060> per<00:02:03.210> hour<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.689> on<00:02:04.439> this<00:02:04.560> track

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
five miles per hour and on this track

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.819 
five miles per hour and on this track
for<00:02:05.610> about<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.030> split<00:02:06.390> second<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.840> got<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.110> 238

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
for about a split second I got to 238

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:08.930 
for about a split second I got to 238
miles<00:02:08.190> per<00:02:08.399> hour

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
miles per hour

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.380 
miles per hour
which<00:02:09.600> is<00:02:09.750> pretty<00:02:09.900> fast<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.970> yeah<00:02:11.970> well<00:02:12.270> it's<00:02:12.360> a

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
which is pretty fast so yeah well it's a

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.390 
which is pretty fast so yeah well it's a
good<00:02:12.510> car<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.260> design<00:02:13.620> i<00:02:13.980> made<00:02:14.040> myself

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
good car and the design i made myself

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.910 
good car and the design i made myself
it's<00:02:14.820> pretty<00:02:15.030> simple<00:02:15.270> all<00:02:15.780> it<00:02:16.080> is<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.260> carbon

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
it's pretty simple all it is a carbon

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.600 
it's pretty simple all it is a carbon
fiber<00:02:17.220> strike<00:02:17.790> I<00:02:18.030> mean<00:02:18.330> carbon<00:02:19.170> fiber<00:02:19.770> stripe

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
fiber strike I mean carbon fiber stripe

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.370 
fiber strike I mean carbon fiber stripe
through<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.330> center<00:02:21.570> of<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.750> car<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.200> then

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
through the center of the car and then

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.340 
through the center of the car and then
just<00:02:22.650> an<00:02:22.800> orange<00:02:23.070> paint<00:02:23.280> job<00:02:23.520> metallic<00:02:24.420> with

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
just an orange paint job metallic with

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.950 
just an orange paint job metallic with
black<00:02:25.650> tinted<00:02:25.980> windows<00:02:26.340> I<00:02:26.580> would<00:02:27.450> I<00:02:27.480> was<00:02:27.780> gonna

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
black tinted windows I would I was gonna

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.690 
black tinted windows I would I was gonna
go<00:02:28.170> fancy<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.890> actually<00:02:29.220> add<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.340> bunch<00:02:29.610> of

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
go fancy and actually add a bunch of

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.810 
go fancy and actually add a bunch of
other<00:02:29.820> stuff<00:02:29.910> but<00:02:30.390> I<00:02:30.420> was<00:02:30.600> just<00:02:30.630> too<00:02:30.870> lazy<00:02:31.820> so

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
other stuff but I was just too lazy so

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.840 
other stuff but I was just too lazy so
but<00:02:33.480> hopefully<00:02:33.900> in<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.200> future<00:02:34.350> I<00:02:34.560> will<00:02:34.850> maybe

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
but hopefully in the future I will maybe

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.760 
but hopefully in the future I will maybe
start<00:02:36.120> doing<00:02:36.150> some<00:02:36.480> designs<00:02:36.810> because<00:02:37.080> it's

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
start doing some designs because it's

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:38.900 
start doing some designs because it's
not<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:38.100> actually<00:02:38.460> it's<00:02:38.640> not<00:02:38.730> that

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
not that actually it's not that

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.850 
not that actually it's not that
difficult<00:02:39.150> actually<00:02:39.510> I<00:02:39.900> thought<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:40.620> was<00:02:40.710> more

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
difficult actually I thought it was more

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.650 
difficult actually I thought it was more
difficult<00:02:40.950> but<00:02:41.490> it<00:02:41.610> actually<00:02:41.790> isn't<00:02:42.090> so<00:02:42.420> I

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
difficult but it actually isn't so I

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.890 
difficult but it actually isn't so I
might<00:02:43.020> do<00:02:43.170> that<00:02:43.200> I<00:02:43.560> don't<00:02:43.740> know<00:02:43.970> but<00:02:44.970> yeah<00:02:45.510> so

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
might do that I don't know but yeah so

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.680 
might do that I don't know but yeah so
