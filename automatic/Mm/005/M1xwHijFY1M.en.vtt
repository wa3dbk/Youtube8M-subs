00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.130
 love predator phishing 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.880
 Welcome to the 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.880
 fox 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.480
 Left 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.880
 here are some news for you though 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.890
 did you relish accompanied me in times 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.590
 Water tank and I would also have a few 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.079
 show really nice new things 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.579
 one of the novelties is the rap child the 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.390
 small person you already know from 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.090
 this season 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.500
 that we have in 14 centimeters and 55 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.480
 gram in two versions have once 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.100
 doubly so with the hammer back Spanz 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.230
 turn and then the trial with the 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.809
 big twister black also very much 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.239
 Demand of you we have two 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.090
 bigger brothers of the double version 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.460
 it was launched in december in 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.260
 There are also angeles shops to buy 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.090
 new colors and I want you 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.110
 like to show in the test now how 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:02.710
 the 18 cm and 90 grams and the 23 cm 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.710
 long in 165 grams best swimmer 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.729
 Above all, we have the redskins 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.649
 pay attention that the build 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.289
 slimming remains very many 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:16.030
 so-called swim bates so a rubber 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:17.560
 bait for a lead weight in it 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.479
 located and where the rates already tuned 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.429
 So in the end they are 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.689
 often very bullish that means 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:24.459
 These baits really really 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:26.049
 Run slowly even if you have them 

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:27.459
 faster pulls for example in tow 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.439
 angel or if you have the strong current 

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:31.240
 Ficht often come out of the lane was 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.829
 it's just too much pressure on water 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.200
 the cologne on the front 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:36.369
 part of it has expanded in this case 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.020
 we made her very slim 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.549
 accordingly , it does not stretch that way either 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.200
 a lot of water pressure on you can 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.549
 so cut through the water and that 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.409
 most important thing you have to do to them 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.270
 is working with the tail and there time 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.069
 you can still do it with your head and 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.500
 with the corresponding frank movement 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:52.709
 and that makes the big robbers right 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.709
 Near 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.530
 I can kill the baits quite normally 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.720
 so I just blink it 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.090
 pull through the water already sown 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.250
 How to look for the head in front and to the left 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.740
 dives right 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.149
 below the training hooks with for all 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.910
 also a very important one 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.730
 title no matter which he is fishing 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.350
 never hook the hooks in the rubber 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.240
 engage the fish 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.190
 let him float free through it 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.900
 must be missing much less so 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.880
 Can you lead quietly when I enter 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.709
 would lead the most faster 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.780
 spam mails now completely to the left 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.370
 crowned or swim away to the right 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.800
 no longer exercise control 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.870
 he still remains fully in 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.790
 work is even that small 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.350
 fins on the sides very thin and 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.209
 rubber material are also still there 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.380
 and move here 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.510
 interesting is this size and 18 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.310
 centimeter to the hero between to check 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.709
 wonderful for everyone too 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.459
 interesting and we have some today 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.680
 guests had 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.720
 that said that's exactly what 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.010
 right thing to fish high so 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.330
 18 inches an absolute bang but 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.730
 you know big fish on your own 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.030
 Great appetite and there we have the 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.770
 23er on the accountant here 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.330
 but even a grain is presented 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.250
 blown away said human sees you 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.739
 Above all, the big toe only guess 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.390
 on it and the hefty frame what 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.980
 The thing is also incorporated 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.440
 interesting to marine fish so for 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.420
 flat fish at 20 to 25 meters deep 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.400
 sandbanks for halibut fishing for the 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.080
 Great German and and work done 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.180
 of course the thing is right for you 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.019
 fat pike for the wallach and for 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.570
 the big book 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.940
 I have this whitefish version here 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.830
 once assembled and the great thing about it 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.330
 if you have very clear water that way 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.810
 like here in this case in the test 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.220
 basin down and probably 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.140
 natural look as far as the squad is concerned 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.030
 they are fishing very slowly and the 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.190
 Imagine you were just rowing the 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.510
 We are now here at about 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.070
 two and a half hours slow 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.959
 pull behind your boat then you have 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.480
 such a nice rocked back and forth 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.900
 you also see this long fin and how 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.000
 yourself 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.680
 and move perfect thing when I am 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.629
 now faster fish synonymous no problem 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.060
 or a strong current he will not 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:02.019
 run away but he stays 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.640
 always in the track 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.829
 Of course he will be beautiful on the left and on the right 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.450
 work with the plants and have extreme 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.280
 high water displace that one now 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.700
 up here on the surface long she 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.950
 then you'll see how they feel 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.690
 Waves move up here whoever is strong 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.250
 So this vibration is very, very much 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.250
 good bait times as 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.920
 stage for fishing 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.540
 quite angling the following days if the 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.640
 Do not fish so well white 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.710
 These strong pressure waves make thieves 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.900
 Robber ever gives new to everyone 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.190
 curious the harsh all over again 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.770
 importantly pointed out 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.900
 Here is the same map mix as 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.760
 so with the q cells a really rubber 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.620
 material there you can find some robbers 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.710
 catch disassembled without you the thing 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.710
 becomes 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:03.699
 need 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:11.879
 These are my success colors 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.969
 rainbow trout far fischinger center 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:17.789
 down the pearc and silt that there is one 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:19.710
 the colors are used by the right anglers 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:22.379
 especially the slick like this green one 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:25.199
 should imitate a tug and that is 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:27.590
 absolutely deadly for the big esox 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:27.590
 Ladies
