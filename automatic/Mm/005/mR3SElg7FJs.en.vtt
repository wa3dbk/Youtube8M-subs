00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.429
 I propose here to study vo2 max 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.379
 so I wrote the vo2 max maybe 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.990
 than in your textbooks or in 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:19.210
 course you saw the vo2max both said to himself 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.910
 a little bit more rigorously 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.640
 party and talk about a vo2 max i'm going 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.009
 explain to you why I remind you that 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.349
 your muscles to contract requires 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.720
 the energy provided by the reactions 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.539
 metabolic of breathing that 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.730
 consume dioxygen and glucose get 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:39.699
 says oxygen is brought via the meaning put 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.489
 in circulation by the choir is this 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:46.180
 this oxygenation of blood is allowed to 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:48.430
 talk lung there is a limit to the 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.370
 oxygen consumption is what we 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:01:01.379
 call the vo2 max so the vo2 max and 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:01:05.710
 a limit to water consumption 2 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:10.270
 where does this limit come from vo2max v 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:13.689
 points to both max's it's finally a 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:17.020
 debit and I remind you that a debit these 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:20.229
 are liters per minute - 1 x minutes 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.220
 - it is a volume of water to consume in 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:27.250
 a given time 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:29.320
 so this is the cardiac output times a 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:37.450
 variation what's called a 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:40.780
 vein arteri difference in o2 I 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.869
 explain to me your art makes sense 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.210
 rich in water 2 to the muscles that are used 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.240
 in oxygen ekir the sequel to the 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.670
 breathing carbon dioxide the 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.100
 difference in oxygen between the artery 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.400
 and the vein you see here I had a 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.170
 high concentration our two witnesses 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.940
 in circle here I have a weak 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.190
 co2 concentration since the blood that 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.650
 muscle recovery has become depleted in o2 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.350
 it is calculated it is a difference a 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.800
 subtraction of amount of oxygen 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.560
 between the artery and the vein 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.890
 for information we've already talked about it in 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.620
 another video a vo2 max will be all 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.960
 stronger than the cardiac output will be 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.120
 important and this cardiac output I tell you 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.130
 recalls that it is a frequency 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.960
 cardiac times an ejection volume 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.120
 Systolic when you make 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.220
 the training you will increase the volume 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.320
 systolic ejection your heart it was 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.380
 if the wall of the myocardium thickens so 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.400
 the ejected volume larger and so 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.690
 the training will increase vo2 max 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.730
 you may have seen in class the 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.090
 parameters that explains the variations 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:51.770
 of vo2max then these parameters so I 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:57.420
 will put vo2max variations 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:03:00.750
 variations of the vo2 max it depends on the age 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.420
 of the subject by this city of mac are 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.000
 often went maximum to 20 years and then 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.470
 when we get older and well she 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.780
 decreases it depends on the sex of the subject a 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.330
 man has a view a vo of max plus 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.190
 important that a woman and then she is going 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.090
 also depend on what is called the rate 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.920
 hematocrit 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.239
 then basically the volume of globules 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.890
 red that you have dancing the number of 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.709
 red blood cells so I put for example 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.080
 red bill 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:31.230
 yes, the more red blood cells you have 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.880
 the more you will bring oxygen and a 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.860
 little note the steps 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.769
 the erythropoietin that you synthesize 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.239
 naturally at the level of the kidneys allows 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.610
 to increase the number of red blood cells 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.380
 and therefore allows to increase the oxygen 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.360
 which is brought to the muscles 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.640
 it is therefore a doping product to inject 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.950
 the country increases the rate of blood cells 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.930
 red in the blood therefore increases the 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.820
 body the amount of oxygen brought to the 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.340
 muscle tissue so increases the 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.530
 arterial venous difference and so 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.750
 t increases performance since the VO2 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.590
 max sellali 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:07.300
 and the consumption of dioxygen 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.300
 the vo2 max
