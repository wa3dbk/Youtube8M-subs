00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
I'm gonna assume it's like up there like

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.649 
I'm gonna assume it's like up there like
at<00:01:46.409> least<00:01:46.619> sixty<00:01:47.100> dollars<00:01:47.490> I'm<00:01:47.700> just<00:01:48.240> assuming

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
at least sixty dollars I'm just assuming

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.679 
at least sixty dollars I'm just assuming
they'll<00:01:48.990> probably<00:01:49.290> like<00:01:49.649> 50<00:01:50.070> um<00:01:50.310> anyway<00:01:51.090> it's

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
they'll probably like 50 um anyway it's

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.270 
they'll probably like 50 um anyway it's
nars<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.170> it's<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.470> brush<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:52.979> it's<00:01:53.070> probably

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
nars and it's a brush so it's probably

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.550 
nars and it's a brush so it's probably
expensive<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:54.060> wanted<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:54.990> do<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.140> review<00:01:55.500> on

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
expensive I wanted to do a review on

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.940 
expensive I wanted to do a review on
this<00:01:55.799> because<00:01:56.420> I<00:01:57.420> saw<00:01:57.990> someone<00:01:58.320> tweeting<00:01:58.829> it

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
this because I saw someone tweeting it

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.410 
this because I saw someone tweeting it
saying<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.460> they<00:01:59.549> finally<00:01:59.969> found<00:02:00.180> it

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
saying that they finally found it

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.590 
saying that they finally found it
available<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.770> like<00:02:02.159> book<00:02:02.640> jumped<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.570> my

remember what it's called but it will be
linked<00:03:14.230> down<00:03:14.260> below<00:03:14.400> because<00:03:15.400> it<00:03:15.760> said<00:03:15.910> there

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
linked down below because it said there

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.850 
linked down below because it said there
was<00:03:16.180> five<00:03:16.510> left<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:17.200> when<00:03:17.320> I<00:03:17.350> bought<00:03:17.560> it<00:03:17.620> there

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
was five left and when I bought it there

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.830 
was five left and when I bought it there
was<00:03:17.950> like<00:03:18.100> two<00:03:18.310> left<00:03:18.610> and<00:03:18.850> then<00:03:19.000> an<00:03:19.390> hour<00:03:19.690> later

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
was like two left and then an hour later

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.160 
was like two left and then an hour later
there<00:03:20.350> was<00:03:20.470> five<00:03:20.739> left<00:03:21.070> so<00:03:21.489> I<00:03:21.519> think<00:03:21.730> they're

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
there was five left so I think they're

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.660 
there was five left so I think they're
updating<00:03:23.170> their<00:03:23.470> website<00:03:23.860> anyway<00:03:24.220> there's

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
updating their website anyway there's

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.430 
updating their website anyway there's
probably<00:03:25.000> someone<00:03:25.660> there<00:03:25.959> i'm<00:03:26.079> not<00:03:26.290> really

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
probably someone there i'm not really

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.770
