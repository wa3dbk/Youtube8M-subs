reason<00:05:40.520> why<00:05:40.610> I<00:05:40.640> got<00:05:40.850> is<00:05:41.090> because<00:05:41.240> it's<00:05:41.540> like<00:05:41.750> I

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
reason why I got is because it's like I

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.770 
reason why I got is because it's like I
like<00:05:42.110> the<00:05:42.290> size<00:05:42.920> of<00:05:43.070> it<00:05:43.190> and<00:05:43.370> the<00:05:43.510> way<00:05:44.510> it<00:05:44.600> looks

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
like the size of it and the way it looks

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.030 
like the size of it and the way it looks
like<00:05:44.930> the<00:05:45.050> white<00:05:45.230> and<00:05:45.380> shit<00:05:45.530> like<00:05:45.560> that<00:05:45.710> that's

like the white and shit like that that's

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.560 
like the white and shit like that that's
why<00:05:46.220> I<00:05:46.250> got<00:05:46.430> more<00:05:46.730> white<00:05:46.940> cuz<00:05:47.150> I<00:05:47.240> figured<00:05:47.480> it'd

why I got more white cuz I figured it'd

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.120 
why I got more white cuz I figured it'd
be<00:05:47.690> better<00:05:48.200> on<00:05:48.470> this<00:05:48.650> instead<00:05:49.010> of<00:05:49.070> the
