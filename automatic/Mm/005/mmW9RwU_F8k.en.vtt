00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.190 

and<00:02:18.739> it<00:02:18.980> had<00:02:19.219> the<00:02:19.430> towing<00:02:19.819> package<00:02:20.019> but<00:02:21.019> the

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
and it had the towing package but the

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.849 
and it had the towing package but the

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:24.859 
owner did away with that so we could do

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:42.820 
owner did away with that so we could do
a<00:02:24.890> mental<00:02:25.489> exit<00:02:26.000> dual-exhaust
