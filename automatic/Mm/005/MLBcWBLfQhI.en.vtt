00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.070 
you can have we feel proud us that's
what<00:03:56.790> that's<00:03:57.300> what<00:03:57.420> I<00:03:57.450> really<00:03:57.780> feel<00:03:57.900> because

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
what that's what I really feel because

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.440 
what that's what I really feel because
the<00:03:58.590> kids<00:03:58.830> look<00:03:59.010> up<00:03:59.130> to<00:03:59.280> you<00:03:59.340> it's<00:03:59.520> it's

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
the kids look up to you it's it's

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.300 
the kids look up to you it's it's
pushing<00:04:00.900> you<00:04:01.050> to<00:04:02.010> do<00:04:02.130> your<00:04:02.250> best<00:04:02.340> I<00:04:03.920> think<00:04:04.920> for

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
pushing you to do your best I think for

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.800 
pushing you to do your best I think for
the<00:04:05.430> little<00:04:05.670> kids<00:04:05.880> to<00:04:06.060> see<00:04:06.270> that<00:04:06.300> you<00:04:06.690> know

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
the little kids to see that you know

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.900 
the little kids to see that you know
sitting<00:04:07.050> on<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.320> sidelines<00:04:07.770> they<00:04:08.340> see<00:04:08.400> and

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
sitting on the sidelines they see and

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.060 
sitting on the sidelines they see and
they<00:04:09.030> learn<00:04:09.540> and<00:04:09.900> they<00:04:09.990> they<00:04:10.350> hear<00:04:10.620> all<00:04:10.770> of<00:04:10.800> the

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
they learn and they they hear all of the

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.100 
they learn and they they hear all of the
cheering<00:04:11.580> and<00:04:11.790> so<00:04:11.910> I<00:04:11.940> think<00:04:12.090> for<00:04:12.420> for<00:04:12.990> the

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
cheering and so I think for for the

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.220 
cheering and so I think for for the
small<00:04:13.380> ones<00:04:13.590> it's<00:04:13.950> pretty<00:04:14.280> good<00:04:14.520> because<00:04:14.850> it

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
small ones it's pretty good because it

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.660 
small ones it's pretty good because it
boosts<00:04:16.230> him<00:04:16.380> up<00:04:16.530> in<00:04:16.680> it<00:04:16.799> and<00:04:17.070> it<00:04:17.160> shows<00:04:17.430> them

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
boosts him up in it and it shows them

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.640 
boosts him up in it and it shows them
that<00:04:17.700> they<00:04:18.000> could<00:04:18.239> do<00:04:18.480> they<00:04:19.230> could<00:04:19.260> play

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
that they could do they could play

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.170 
that they could do they could play
football<00:04:19.830> and<00:04:20.130> they<00:04:20.250> could<00:04:20.459> do<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:20.970> things
