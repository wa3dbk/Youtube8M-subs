00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
which are played because demos such a

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.560

good<00:00:40.230> melee<00:00:40.649> because<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.370> his<00:00:42.239> shield

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
good melee because of this his shield

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.900 
good melee because of this his shield
and<00:00:42.960> his<00:00:43.110> as<00:00:43.559> long<00:00:44.070> reaching<00:00:44.309> his<00:00:44.520> sword<00:00:44.760> not

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
and his as long reaching his sword not

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.970 
and his as long reaching his sword not
so<00:00:45.149> he's<00:00:45.360> quite<00:00:45.539> quick<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.110> then<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.710> sniper

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
so he's quite quick and then the sniper

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.250 
so he's quite quick and then the sniper
is<00:00:47.190> able<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.460> have<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.700> range<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.510> basically

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
is able to have the range so basically

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.750 
is able to have the range so basically
the<00:00:49.379> reason<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.739> upload<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.219> video<00:00:50.460> though<00:00:50.640> is

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.880 
the reason I upload this video though is
because<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.449> probably<00:00:52.289> one<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.469> my<00:00:52.559> best

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890

player<00:02:02.380> so<00:02:02.620> you<00:02:02.680> get<00:02:02.860> ahead<00:02:03.310> and<00:02:03.610> it<00:02:03.970> goes<00:02:04.090> all

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
player so you get ahead and it goes all

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.610 
player so you get ahead and it goes all
the<00:02:04.270> way<00:02:04.420> up<00:02:04.480> to<00:02:04.510> five<00:02:05.050> heads<00:02:05.350> and<00:02:05.500> then<00:02:05.590> I

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
the way up to five heads and then I

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.130 
the way up to five heads and then I
peaks<00:02:06.160> or<00:02:06.370> forehead<00:02:06.880> to<00:02:07.150> depends<00:02:07.540> on<00:02:07.660> the<00:02:07.810> I'm

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
peaks or forehead to depends on the I'm

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.630 
peaks or forehead to depends on the I'm
thinking<00:02:08.500> of<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.679> alley<00:02:08.830> web<00:02:09.040> as<00:02:09.190> we<00:02:09.340> boot<00:02:09.550> you

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
thinking of the alley web as we boot you

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.660 
thinking of the alley web as we boot you
see<00:02:09.790> it's<00:02:09.880> only<00:02:10.060> four<00:02:10.300> but<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:11.440> so<00:02:12.280> in<00:02:12.430> the

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
see it's only four but and so in the

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.560 
see it's only four but and so in the
bottom<00:02:12.880> right<00:02:12.970> hand<00:02:13.000> corner<00:02:13.120> you<00:02:13.330> can<00:02:13.390> see<00:02:13.450> a

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
bottom right hand corner you can see a

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.610 
bottom right hand corner you can see a
little<00:02:13.750> ticker<00:02:14.530> which<00:02:14.860> says<00:02:16.140> I've<00:02:17.140> got<00:02:17.200> six

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
little ticker which says I've got six

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.070 
little ticker which says I've got six
heads<00:02:17.800> at<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.070> moment<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:18.720> normally<00:02:19.720> in<00:02:20.020> a

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
heads at the moment and normally in a

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.840 
heads at the moment and normally in a
normal<00:02:20.380> life<00:02:20.500> I<00:02:20.590> don't<00:02:20.620> get<00:02:20.890> one<00:02:21.130> or<00:02:21.250> two<00:02:21.280> or

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
normal life I don't get one or two or

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.810 
normal life I don't get one or two or
three<00:02:22.480> maybe<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:24.190> you'll<00:02:24.430> find<00:02:24.610> out<00:02:24.730> what

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
three maybe and and you'll find out what

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:25.710 
three maybe and and you'll find out what
I<00:02:24.850> getting<00:02:25.090> this<00:02:25.180> which<00:02:25.390> is<00:02:25.570> actually

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
I getting this which is actually

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.330 
I getting this which is actually
probably<00:02:26.080> one<00:02:26.200> of<00:02:26.320> the<00:02:26.410> best<00:02:26.590> i<00:02:26.740> get<00:02:26.920> i<00:02:27.040> got<00:02:27.190> on

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
probably one of the best i get i got on

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.750 
probably one of the best i get i got on
the<00:02:27.550> on<00:02:27.850> the<00:02:28.020> scoreboard<00:02:29.020> as<00:02:29.140> well<00:02:29.320> and

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
the on the scoreboard as well and

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.460 
the on the scoreboard as well and
basically<00:02:30.760> what<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.780> idea<00:02:32.020> of<00:02:32.080> this<00:02:32.230> map<00:02:32.440> is

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
basically what the idea of this map is

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.949 
basically what the idea of this map is
is<00:02:32.860> it's<00:02:33.070> it's<00:02:33.700> completely<00:02:34.510> different<00:02:34.600> 2<00:02:34.870> i'll

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
is it's it's completely different 2 i'll

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.340 
is it's it's completely different 2 i'll
do<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.170> maps<00:02:35.380> because<00:02:35.530> it's<00:02:35.980> more<00:02:36.190> and

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
do the maps because it's more and

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.920 
do the maps because it's more and
everybody<00:02:38.350> sort<00:02:38.590> of<00:02:38.709> like<00:02:38.950> it's<00:02:39.610> been<00:02:39.940> quite

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
everybody sort of like it's been quite

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.050 
everybody sort of like it's been quite
hectic<00:02:41.530> almost<00:02:42.130> there's<00:02:42.340> a<00:02:42.400> lot<00:02:42.520> of<00:02:42.550> mayhem

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
hectic almost there's a lot of mayhem

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.990 
hectic almost there's a lot of mayhem
going<00:02:43.300> on<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:43.660> people<00:02:44.350> are<00:02:44.950> dying<00:02:45.640> quickly

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
going on and people are dying quickly

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.470 
going on and people are dying quickly
there's<00:02:46.239> a<00:02:46.300> lot<00:02:46.450> of<00:02:46.480> debts<00:02:46.780> you<00:02:47.380> do<00:02:47.770> dialogue

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
there's a lot of debts you do dialogue

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.020 
there's a lot of debts you do dialogue
but<00:02:49.480> most<00:02:49.690> importantly<00:02:50.200> is<00:02:50.410> how<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.640> control

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
but most importantly is how the control

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.060 
but most importantly is how the control
points<00:02:52.300> work<00:02:52.420> normally<00:02:52.780> when<00:02:52.930> I<00:02:52.959> control<00:02:53.380> in<00:02:53.590> a

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
points work normally when I control in a

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.449 
points work normally when I control in a
control<00:02:54.700> point<00:02:54.820> game<00:02:55.030> with<00:02:55.180> this<00:02:56.400> once<00:02:57.400> you

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
control point game with this once you

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:58.920 
control point game with this once you
capture<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.910> point<00:02:58.120> you<00:02:58.209> get<00:02:58.360> time<00:02:58.630> but<00:02:58.840> the

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
capture the point you get time but the

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.750 
capture the point you get time but the
idea<00:02:59.110> of<00:02:59.140> this<00:02:59.290> is<00:02:59.500> that<00:02:59.680> you<00:03:00.100> capture<00:03:00.519> the<00:03:00.610> two

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
idea of this is that you capture the two

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.370 
idea of this is that you capture the two
outside<00:03:01.090> points<00:03:01.450> which<00:03:01.810> gives<00:03:02.019> you<00:03:02.110> time<00:03:02.350> to

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
outside points which gives you time to

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.720 
outside points which gives you time to
capture<00:03:02.739> the<00:03:02.950> inside<00:03:03.220> point<00:03:03.459> which<00:03:03.580> is<00:03:03.610> that

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
capture the inside point which is that

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.540 
capture the inside point which is that
one<00:03:04.000> right<00:03:04.150> there<00:03:04.390> on<00:03:04.570> the<00:03:04.660> left<00:03:04.870> and

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
one right there on the left and

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.640 
one right there on the left and
generally<00:03:06.550> it's<00:03:06.670> a<00:03:06.880> big<00:03:07.300> squirrel<00:03:08.290> mom<00:03:08.470> was

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
generally it's a big squirrel mom was

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.710 
generally it's a big squirrel mom was
the<00:03:08.799> ropes<00:03:08.980> and<00:03:09.190> it<00:03:09.880> can<00:03:10.030> be<00:03:10.060> quite<00:03:10.330> lucky<00:03:10.600> to

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
the ropes and it can be quite lucky to

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.390 
the ropes and it can be quite lucky to
survive<00:03:10.870> but<00:03:11.350> as<00:03:11.769> you<00:03:11.860> can<00:03:11.920> see<00:03:12.040> right<00:03:12.070> now<00:03:12.280> I'm
