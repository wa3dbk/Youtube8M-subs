00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
then I put a bobby pin at the roots like

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.780 
then I put a bobby pin at the roots like
this<00:02:47.939> can<00:02:48.939> you<00:02:49.030> see<00:02:49.799> so<00:02:50.799> all<00:02:51.099> my<00:02:51.280> twists<00:02:51.639> right

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790

now<00:02:52.060> actually<00:02:52.359> have<00:02:52.720> a<00:02:52.750> bobby<00:02:53.079> pin<00:02:53.489> securing

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
now actually have a bobby pin securing

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.449 
now actually have a bobby pin securing
the<00:02:54.760> roots<00:02:55.139> securing<00:02:56.139> the<00:02:56.230> roots<00:02:56.470> down<00:02:56.739> what

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
the roots securing the roots down what

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.699 
the roots securing the roots down what
that<00:02:57.639> does<00:02:57.879> is<00:02:58.150> it<00:02:58.329> keeps<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.780> twists<00:02:59.530> from

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
that does is it keeps the twists from

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.339 
that does is it keeps the twists from
unraveling<00:03:00.609> and<00:03:00.879> therefore<00:03:01.750> it<00:03:01.840> keeps<00:03:02.139> it

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
unraveling and therefore it keeps it

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.649 
unraveling and therefore it keeps it
from<00:03:02.620> having<00:03:02.859> this<00:03:03.220> effect<00:03:03.700> going<00:03:03.879> on<00:03:04.150> where

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:04.659 
from having this effect going on where

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:06.509 
from having this effect going on where
you<00:03:04.750> have<00:03:04.930> this<00:03:05.079> whole<00:03:05.439> bunch<00:03:05.859> of<00:03:06.010> hair<00:03:06.310> and

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
you have this whole bunch of hair and

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.729 
you have this whole bunch of hair and
then<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.209> twist<00:03:07.480> hanging<00:03:07.959> afterwards<00:03:08.500> so

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
then the twist hanging afterwards so

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.309 
then the twist hanging afterwards so
that's<00:03:08.950> gonna<00:03:09.159> help<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.639> give<00:03:10.180> your<00:03:10.450> on<00:03:10.780> your

going<00:03:26.109> for<00:03:26.409> is<00:03:26.859> I<00:03:27.129> just<00:03:27.400> need<00:03:27.639> the<00:03:27.790> ends<00:03:28.329> to<00:03:28.510> be

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
going for is I just need the ends to be

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.780 
going for is I just need the ends to be
cutesy<00:03:28.930> curl<00:03:29.260> like<00:03:29.889> this<00:03:30.159> to<00:03:30.430> have<00:03:30.579> that

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
cutesy curl like this to have that

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.240 
cutesy curl like this to have that
effect<00:03:31.120> so<00:03:31.359> what<00:03:31.900> you<00:03:32.019> do<00:03:32.260> and<00:03:32.590> these<00:03:32.949> also

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
effect so what you do and these also

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.649 
effect so what you do and these also
really<00:03:33.729> good<00:03:33.879> because<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.269> way<00:03:34.389> we're<00:03:34.599> gonna

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:34.659 
really good because the way we're gonna

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.020 
really good because the way we're gonna
wrap<00:03:34.959> them<00:03:35.229> makes<00:03:35.799> them<00:03:35.889> work<00:03:36.190> as<00:03:36.400> weights<00:03:36.669> to

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
wrap them makes them work as weights to

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.949 
wrap them makes them work as weights to
weigh<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.359> hair<00:03:37.389> down<00:03:37.750> so<00:03:39.269> you<00:03:40.269> just<00:03:40.449> fold<00:03:40.750> it

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
weigh the hair down so you just fold it

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.300 
weigh the hair down so you just fold it
i<00:03:41.139> usually<00:03:41.409> go<00:03:41.680> in<00:03:41.799> the<00:03:41.859> middle

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
i usually go in the middle

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.879 
i usually go in the middle
wrap<00:03:43.209> it<00:03:43.389> around<00:03:43.449> when<00:03:44.079> the<00:03:44.169> hair<00:03:44.379> is<00:03:44.409> wet<00:03:44.739> with

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
wrap it around when the hair is wet with

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.069 
wrap it around when the hair is wet with
that<00:03:45.069> lemongrass<00:03:45.400> it's<00:03:46.060> gonna<00:03:46.209> be<00:03:46.419> silky<00:03:46.870> so

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
that lemongrass it's gonna be silky so

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.539 
that lemongrass it's gonna be silky so
