3 tablespoons of oil which I will be

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.429 
3 tablespoons of oil which I will be
browning<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.159> peaches<00:02:03.729> in<00:02:03.999> here<00:02:04.899> I<00:02:04.990> have<00:02:05.170> to

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
browning the peaches in here I have to

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.139 
browning the peaches in here I have to
underwrite<00:02:05.950> peaches<00:02:06.369> and<00:02:06.579> I've<00:02:06.789> cut<00:02:06.999> them

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
underwrite peaches and I've cut them

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.450 
underwrite peaches and I've cut them
into<00:02:07.299> half<00:02:07.689> inch<00:02:07.929> wedges<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:08.619> you<00:02:09.100> want<00:02:09.310> to

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
into half inch wedges and you want to

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.400 
into half inch wedges and you want to
cook<00:02:09.670> with<00:02:09.700> hard<00:02:10.119> peaches<00:02:10.600> the<00:02:10.899> reason<00:02:11.230> being

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
cook with hard peaches the reason being

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.080 
cook with hard peaches the reason being
is<00:02:11.620> because<00:02:11.830> if<00:02:12.100> we<00:02:12.190> cook<00:02:12.340> with<00:02:12.490> soft<00:02:12.730> peaches

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
is because if we cook with soft peaches

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.520 
is because if we cook with soft peaches
they<00:02:13.240> will<00:02:13.420> just<00:02:13.600> disintegrate<00:02:14.200> into<00:02:14.350> the

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
they will just disintegrate into the

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.470 
they will just disintegrate into the
dish<00:02:14.680> so<00:02:15.190> you<00:02:15.250> want<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.640> peaches<00:02:15.819> to<00:02:16.090> hold<00:02:16.300> up

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
dish so you want the peaches to hold up

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.150 
dish so you want the peaches to hold up
to<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.810> browning<00:02:17.200> and<00:02:17.380> also<00:02:17.860> to<00:02:17.920> the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
to the browning and also to the

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.190 
to the browning and also to the
