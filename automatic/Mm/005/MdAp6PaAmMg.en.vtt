00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
that allows you to grip your skin so you

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.290 
that allows you to grip your skin so you
want<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.099> make<00:00:32.250> sure<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.730> whatever<00:00:33.059> tool

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
want to make sure that whatever tool

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.290 
want to make sure that whatever tool
you're<00:00:33.480> using<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.309> supernova<00:00:35.309> by

you're using this is the supernova by
mobility<00:00:36.809> wand<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.320> want<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.920> make<00:00:38.070> sure<00:00:38.219> that

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
mobility wand you want to make sure that

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.930 
mobility wand you want to make sure that
that<00:00:38.610> tool<00:00:39.000> can<00:00:39.690> grab<00:00:40.260> onto<00:00:41.010> your<00:00:41.430> tissue<00:00:41.700> and

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
that tool can grab onto your tissue and

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.540 
that tool can grab onto your tissue and
you<00:00:42.000> can<00:00:42.120> see<00:00:42.329> my<00:00:42.480> skin<00:00:42.870> move<00:00:43.190> when<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.219> grab

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
you can see my skin move when I grab

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.010 
you can see my skin move when I grab
that<00:00:44.579> because<00:00:45.030> what<00:00:45.180> we're<00:00:45.300> trying<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.600> do<00:00:45.840> is

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
that because what we're trying to do is

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.170 
that because what we're trying to do is
improve<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:46.950> slide<00:00:47.219> ability<00:00:47.700> between<00:00:47.879> the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
improve this slide ability between the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.510 
improve this slide ability between the
layers<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.510> tissue<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:49.289> lot<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.039> us<00:00:50.160> just<00:00:50.370> like

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
layers of tissue a lot of us just like

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.729 
layers of tissue a lot of us just like
to<00:00:50.579> roll<00:00:51.059> around<00:00:51.270> which<00:00:51.930> feels<00:00:52.289> really<00:00:52.620> nice

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
to roll around which feels really nice

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.680 
to roll around which feels really nice
and<00:00:53.070> if<00:00:53.520> your<00:00:53.640> only<00:00:53.789> goal<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.149> just<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.390> feel

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
and if your only goal is just to feel

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.959 
and if your only goal is just to feel
really<00:00:54.989> nice<00:00:55.199> then<00:00:55.530> great<00:00:55.949> do<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.399> but<00:00:56.879> if

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
really nice then great do that but if

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.060 
really nice then great do that but if
you're<00:00:57.090> actually<00:00:57.270> trying<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.690> improve<00:00:58.140> your

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
you're actually trying to improve your

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.459 
you're actually trying to improve your
tissue<00:00:59.309> movement<00:01:00.239> quality<00:01:00.480> then<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.320> need

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
tissue movement quality then you need

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.720 
tissue movement quality then you need
something<00:01:01.710> that's<00:01:01.890> gonna<00:01:01.980> get<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.219> good<00:01:02.489> bite

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
something that's gonna get a good bite

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.880 
something that's gonna get a good bite
on<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.149> tissue<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.780> create<00:01:04.769> better

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
on the tissue and create better

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.789 
on the tissue and create better
relationships<00:01:05.820> between<00:01:06.799> adjacent

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
relationships between adjacent

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.330 
relationships between adjacent
structures<00:01:08.280> okay<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.920> we're<00:01:10.920> gonna<00:01:11.010> go<00:01:11.189> over

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
structures okay so we're gonna go over

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.070 
structures okay so we're gonna go over
the<00:01:11.490> again<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.060> pressure<00:01:12.270> wave<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.840> tack

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
the again the pressure wave and the tack

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.200 
the again the pressure wave and the tack
and<00:01:13.290> floss<00:01:13.670> another<00:01:14.670> thing<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.909> keep<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.150> mind

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
and floss another thing to keep in mind

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.700 
and floss another thing to keep in mind
is<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.540> when<00:01:15.840> you're<00:01:16.020> doing<00:01:16.229> self

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
is that when you're doing self

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.950 
is that when you're doing self
myofascial<00:01:17.189> release<00:01:17.340> it's<00:01:17.850> really<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.390> waiting

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
myofascial release it's really a waiting

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.289 
myofascial release it's really a waiting
game<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.740> being<00:01:20.009> patient<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.729> gonna<00:01:21.000> yield

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
game so being patient is gonna yield

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.719 
game so being patient is gonna yield
much<00:01:22.110> better<00:01:22.350> results<00:01:22.890> than<00:01:23.070> just<00:01:23.369> kind<00:01:23.640> of

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
much better results than just kind of

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.490 
much better results than just kind of
like<00:01:23.909> whipping<00:01:24.360> around<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.840> there<00:01:25.049> for<00:01:25.229> 30

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
like whipping around on there for 30

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.440 
like whipping around on there for 30
seconds<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.159> then<00:01:26.280> hoping<00:01:27.060> something's

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
seconds and then hoping something's

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.340 
seconds and then hoping something's
different<00:01:27.689> okay<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:28.860> for<00:01:29.400> today's<00:01:29.640> purposes

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
different okay so for today's purposes

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.380 
different okay so for today's purposes
we're<00:01:31.350> gonna<00:01:31.439> do<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.560> little<00:01:31.710> demo<00:01:32.159> on<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:33.060> quad

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
we're gonna do a little demo on the quad

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.130 
we're gonna do a little demo on the quad
a<00:01:33.750> lot<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.470> times<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:35.750> middle<00:01:36.750> part<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.049> the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
a lot of times the middle part of the

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.260 
a lot of times the middle part of the
quad<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.710> inside<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.460> vastus<00:01:38.970> medialis

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
quad and the inside that vastus medialis

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.719 
quad and the inside that vastus medialis
get<00:01:40.110> stuck<00:01:40.350> together<00:01:40.530> it's<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> really<00:01:41.340> common

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
get stuck together it's a really common

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.080 
get stuck together it's a really common
area<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.799> athletes<00:01:43.799> work<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.640> we're<00:01:45.000> gonna

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
area that athletes work so we're gonna

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.600 
area that athletes work so we're gonna
do<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.390> take<00:01:45.540> our<00:01:45.720> super<00:01:46.020> nova<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:49.460> I'm<00:01:50.460> gonna

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
do is take our super nova and I'm gonna

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.160 
do is take our super nova and I'm gonna
put<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:50.970> next<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.360> area<00:01:51.600> I'm<00:01:51.750> trying<00:01:52.079> to

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
put it next to the area I'm trying to

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.960 
put it next to the area I'm trying to
work<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.649> then<00:01:53.130> for<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> pressure<00:01:53.670> wave

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
work and then for a pressure wave

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.999 
work and then for a pressure wave
technique<00:01:54.420> all<00:01:54.630> we're<00:01:54.750> doing<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.200> using<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
technique all we're doing is using the

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.450 
technique all we're doing is using the
weight<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.729> leg<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:58.530> get<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.710> grip<00:01:59.070> on<00:01:59.280> the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
weight of the leg to get a grip on the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.740 
weight of the leg to get a grip on the
