okay having got the center mark they're

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.620 
okay having got the center mark they're
going<00:00:05.609> to<00:00:06.140> drill<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.500> holes<00:00:07.740> in<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.639> piece<00:00:09.510> of

going to drill the holes in the piece of

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.539 
going to drill the holes in the piece of
brass<00:00:09.780> with<00:00:11.059> just<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.090> little<00:00:12.210> pin<00:00:12.480> vise<00:00:12.690> and

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:13.549 
brass with just a little pin vise and

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:15.829 
brass with just a little pin vise and
just<00:00:14.549> put<00:00:14.910> it<00:00:15.000> in<00:00:15.030> by<00:00:15.179> hand<00:00:15.210> using<00:00:15.540> their

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
just put it in by hand using their

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.560 
just put it in by hand using their
technical<00:00:16.350> Peck<00:00:16.680> drilling<00:00:17.369> which<00:00:17.760> just<00:00:18.420> means

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
technical Peck drilling which just means

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.359 
technical Peck drilling which just means
you<00:00:18.690> just<00:00:19.170> push<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.560> trillian<00:00:19.890> pull<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.220> out

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
you just push the trillian pull it out

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.370 
you just push the trillian pull it out
again<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:21.240> doesn't<00:00:21.449> have<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.689> be<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:22.109> sort

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
again it doesn't have to be a sort

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.089 
again it doesn't have to be a sort
series<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.740> quick<00:00:22.949> little<00:00:23.480> bursts<00:00:24.890> push<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.010> in

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
series of quick little bursts push it in

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.880 
series of quick little bursts push it in
for<00:00:26.220> about<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.400> second<00:00:26.760> or<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.300> then<00:00:27.359> just

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
for about a second or so and then just

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.490 
for about a second or so and then just
tug<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.039> out<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.730> chips<00:00:30.720> clear<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.969> again

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
tug it out so the chips clear and again

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.979 
tug it out so the chips clear and again
it's<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.649> good<00:00:34.800> idea<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.100> keep<00:00:35.190> your<00:00:35.370> fingers

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
it's a good idea to keep your fingers

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.270 
it's a good idea to keep your fingers

earlier<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.980> method<00:00:43.980> will<00:00:44.129> actually<00:00:44.520> pull

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
earlier this method will actually pull

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.799 
earlier this method will actually pull
the<00:00:46.309> drill<00:00:47.309> bit<00:00:47.460> into<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.450> center<00:00:48.750> of

rotation if it tends to wander out so

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.779 
rotation if it tends to wander out so
you<00:00:51.090> don't<00:00:51.120> need<00:00:51.360> any<00:00:51.539> sort<00:00:51.809> precision

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789

this<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.870> matching<00:00:58.260> on<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.530> middle<00:00:58.770> speed

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
this is a matching on the middle speed
