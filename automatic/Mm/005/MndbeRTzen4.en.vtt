00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:03.649
 All acquired friends saipa Kiev we 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:06.700
 continue heading Umm al Mutlak Sapian 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.510
 Today we will consider bad 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:13.450
 he is in the world every five club 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.369
 Nobody corrected OMON 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:18.359
 that is, razvoroshila we did 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.169
 we need one position we respect 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:23.980
 pulse generators 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.980
 now all suffered 7 5 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.970
 also forgot we will need growth 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.970
 the torch is all clear then find it quickly 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.180
 So it feeds 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.430
 Here we all earned 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.460
 now we have to hurry this port 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.420
 defaulting immediately let's do everything 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.290
 still off and 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.060
 sell for example at a distance 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.060
 put several blocks 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.460
 And here it was necessary to Davos further as 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.790
 now we connect all this 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.890
 like yours but furious 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.180
 just ride 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.180
 and let's put the rails fast 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.810
 here, as you see, they start like this 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.810
 Here in a very strange way to resist flights 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.680
 here besides we can not walk but here they are 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.050
 somehow survive and 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.710
 actually without blocks if we even remove 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.690
 walking tractor will not break anything is not easy 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.390
 lick the air by themselves 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.700
 I do not know what this is connected with in my opinion 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.729
 work with all the press pass 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:37.900
 check 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.170
 here you see 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.170
 with all the rails it works 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.610
 here's a tank it's pretty already become if its him 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.580
 he did not know that many sat down 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.020
 on moto and you like it 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.420
 it is useful I do not know how this further 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.200
 it may come in handy 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.760
 be you find this 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.760
 application 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.970
 the processor was to go subscribe to 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.159
 channel Sergey Chernov banks 

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:10.269
 and 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:11.019
 bye everyone
