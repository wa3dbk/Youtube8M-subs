 3 hours have passed 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.050
 Here is such a mass we got from 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:12.080

 take another 50 grams with the next pack 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:04.189
 so about 250 grams of tomato paste 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.950
 brainwave for this recipe and generally for 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.160
 closing something up again is better 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:25.349

 see we have a liquid again 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.680
 and it needs to be slightly smoothed out and all this 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:50.640
 simmer together for half an hour after 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:56.060

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.060
 add two tablespoons of vinegar 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:07.500
