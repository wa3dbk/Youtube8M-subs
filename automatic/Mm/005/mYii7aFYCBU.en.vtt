00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:07.330
 as together in this video i want 

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:10.070
 you the antifreeze inspector of gv 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.259
 show and that is a very good value 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.420
 an indicator with the temperature in there 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.250
 and it is not such a simple part 5 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.100
 but costs a little more 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.140
 is about 15 euro at amazon link 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.640
 I'll pack you down in the infobox and 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.119
 Then we will join together 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.580
 my bmw z4 test 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:31.070
 Let's take a look at the part now 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.570
 we have a hose you need 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.870
 Of course, then to introduce 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:39.190
 in the container and a bit 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:43.280
 rauszuholen Coolant antifreeze 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.730
 better on the floor so with one hand 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.250
 into the gate 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:51.670
 to difficult so look now 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.770
 then here we have the examiner himself 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:58.070
 only now and in here we have 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.900
 also still ne instructions while hopefully 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.790
 you should know how it works 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.000
 the child already somehow on the line 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.350
 So the part looks to tie down 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.290
 settle the hose connect 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.190
 always the quasi air or water points 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.120
 he said to pump up and 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.870
 Accordingly, we can then here the 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.870
 number of degrees for the frost protection or for 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.540
 read off the helplessness means so 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.970
 now with one hand here the ball 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.490
 what do we do a little differently? 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.420
 Simply reschedule the hose again 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.750
 position 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.630
 okay that's it on it and now 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.630
 Let's take a look at the car 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.650
 always pay attention here 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.820
 When opening open now so step wise 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.350
 because it can be 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.200
 right now with me I'm still full 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.780
 drove with the car that the 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.540
 Liquid still relatively warm is hot 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.460
 he said and so you do not inject 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.049
 or end you see 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.700
 I hope you could see that I have 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.220
 me a bit scared maybe 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.000
 of course, there is a rule 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.990
 an enormous pressure and clearly heat like that 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.880
 as you can see it is 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.900
 Coolant was not absolutely in 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.930
 order and clicks we look at that 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.930
 on 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:21.140
 So, I think the rc purely down 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.780
 well that of course you are wrong first 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.130
 points in the air out of the now 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.800
 can see completely compressed 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.440
 Now I'll keep him in and leave 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.290
 just go slow and we could see 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.340
 that I sucked completely 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.990
 it dripped a bit down here 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.150
 can see in the hose that the 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.170
 sleep now completely empty and 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.030
 then drips nothing more then 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.270
 Now we have the opportunity 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.700
 temperature read and that one 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:51.800
 bit and that is the liquid 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.700
 to about minus 35 40 degrees resistant 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.490
 I say 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.569
 So yes , I'm on everyone for the winter 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.000
 case well equipped 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:03.520
 It goes and pumps all the time 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.510
 back here a little after 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:11.120
 you can not get it all right now 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:13.880
 out ok so that's definitely 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.430
 a good and equally important 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.080
 thing to do when bathing with man 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.349
 just know if everything is in 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.310
 Trim is with the coolant too 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.090
 really for the winter too 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.160
 secured is yes as I said the device 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.319
 is quite cool link to this I pack you 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.319
 in the infobox and have fun with it
