00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
is a very treatable tattoo for us the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.140 
is a very treatable tattoo for us the
shading<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.130> line<00:00:53.489> work<00:00:53.700> that's<00:00:53.940> going<00:00:54.090> to

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
shading and line work that's going to

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.300 
shading and line work that's going to
come<00:00:54.300> right<00:00:54.600> out<00:00:54.630> probably<00:00:55.350> with<00:00:55.620> one<00:00:55.890> maybe

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.310 
come right out probably with one maybe

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.340 
come right out probably with one maybe
two<00:00:56.640> treatments<00:00:57.090> where<00:00:57.540> it's<00:00:57.660> more<00:00:57.840> dense<00:00:58.110> and

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
two treatments where it's more dense and

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.780 
two treatments where it's more dense and
black<00:00:58.590> here<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:58.980> middle<00:00:59.220> obviously

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
black here in the middle obviously

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:00.830 
black here in the middle obviously
that's<00:00:59.970> going<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.210> take<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.360> couple<00:01:00.630> more

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
that's going to take a couple more

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.780 
that's going to take a couple more
treatments<00:01:01.230> but<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.410> think<00:01:01.710> very<00:01:02.160> quickly<00:01:02.399> it's

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
treatments but I think very quickly it's

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.670 
treatments but I think very quickly it's
going<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.000> look<00:01:03.120> smaller<00:01:03.480> just<00:01:03.810> because<00:01:04.110> all

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
going to look smaller just because all

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.950 
going to look smaller just because all
the<00:01:04.920> shade<00:01:05.129> knows<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.369> peripheral<00:01:05.909> yes<00:01:06.509> all<00:01:06.840> the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
the shade knows a peripheral yes all the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.120 
the shade knows a peripheral yes all the
background<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:07.530> that's<00:01:07.649> going<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.950> make<00:01:08.100> it

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
background so that's going to make it

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.130 
background so that's going to make it
sort<00:01:08.579> of<00:01:08.640> shrink<00:01:09.119> up<00:01:09.299> what<00:01:09.840> else<00:01:09.990> are<00:01:10.110> we

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
sort of shrink up what else are we

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.050 
sort of shrink up what else are we
