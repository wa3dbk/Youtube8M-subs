00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.450
 but undoubtedly week but here 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.410
 the consumer here there are no solutions for the producer to produce 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.300
 cuts 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.639
 type of meat but neither is the table of the Argentines 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.249
 and that is why the agricultural sector proposed by a national 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:23.179
 once and for all and in the face of the demand 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:27.519
 not only of the internal market is to the internal demand no longer finds out that 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:29.069
 have the Argentines 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:33.420
 that is given once and for all take seriously the bull by the horns desirable to 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.120
 and work on a national agricultural plan 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.510
 fundamentally that includes the meat of the serials 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.060
 so and having Argentina the possibility in this world 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.440
 Which ones are being sued? 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.550
 throughout the world market and fundamentally the asia 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.550
 both of tame and of cereals 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.370
 we are in a moment where the 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.750
 the livestock the game 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.570
 is first in the chain of all link dv marketing and 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.400
 meat production is going through a good time with fair prices and 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.610
 with reasonable price to be able to think about a future 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.680
 think of a future when 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.290
 in the other part of the chain the marketing link and the 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.110
 refrigerators 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.060
 they are not sure what to do 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.060
 it is quite complex trance 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.560
 There is also a very special circumstance with rains 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.640
 grazing 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.960
 there is going to be a better prevention ie the calf factory 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.439
 it will not work and that there are possibilities but what there is not 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:34.260
 future 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.960
 is the possibility of sustainable production because there is no 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.470
 sustainable policy and what is specifically being asked of the government 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.299
 national 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.590
 the futurmoda president to continue producing 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.359
 percent we are as some politician said 

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:54.159
 the condemned to success but it seems that politics does not allow 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.990
 Argentines fight the indigence as tamara proeza who seek greater 

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:00.150
 education and health 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.370
 this board mentally passed in the first primary school of the 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.929
 production that is the field 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.209
 the following by the food chain and continuing through the metalworking chain 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.710
 that this has generated 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.269
 of production but also of work 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.459
 and as we said Argentine exports of cannes 

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:23.039
 of closed today is practically no boarding can leave 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:26.929
 only 11 thousand tons of clinton fee have been sent to the food 

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:30.749
 European economy of the 28 thousand that the country can send 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:34.649
 to date closes on June 30 

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:38.429
 every deadline of June 30 has to send the 28 thousand is very difficult 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:42.729
 that this happens despite the fact that 8 thousand tons are found 

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:46.109
 possibility of blinding the European economic community in a short time 

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:50.789
 connected alternative to the refrigerators are thinking more about 

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:53.789
 close kelsey cruz 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.480
 if the vine mentally so it the national government says that 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.680
 export in our closed mass idol and indirectly so 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.069
 closed because you are not giving the skip record but you have 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.199
 contributions 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:10.940
 despite the fact 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.900
 the world is demanding it and last week 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.770
 the Russian premier to the president herself demands that they are willing Russia to be 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.770
 large investments in Argentine nuclear energy 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.420
 and demanded that he also urged us and that we comply that we comply 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.150
 the commitments made that we have not fulfilled knowing that the meat of Russia 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.270
 that he was a Russian inhabitant 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.990
 consumer is on the labaka blanket or the cow keeps that we do not consume 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.880
 Argentines 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.060
 that really 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.370
 there is possibility of large productions that there is a great demand that not only 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.669
 Argentine will be able to 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:48.779
 the eaves offer but you need Brazil receives Paraguay in this place 

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:49.939
 for all this 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:51.270
 undoubtedly 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:57.290
 in a memo at a juncture that there would be no problem if there were no solutions and vii 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.220
 Really 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.609
 again dark goal in the knowledge that there is no other 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:05.129
 that a prince several the one of agriculture happened by the way by not 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.019
 to have fulfilled his intention is to see 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.370
 It is eco to fix or accommodate the Argentine economy fundamentally the 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.340
 agricultural 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.510
 idea of ​​the metal-mechanic agro-food chain in Argentina 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.489
 how can javier de urquiza to check 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.560
 as fon minister as mourning 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.229
 a cabinet chief like alberto forma andes 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.440
 and unfortunately it is moving me 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.030
 that in spite of the announced by the minister of culture domínguez 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.720
 st as it has limits on the fact may now be made the opening of 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.060
 way you are doing you will be able to increase everything that productivity 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.189
 primary is not being 

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:44.630
 I'm afraid that all this does not materialize 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.850
 0 - Rome what happens in this management of this or that the minister passes very 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:49.410
 bad 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.140
 we need stability not only the economic level in the social but 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.120
 politician 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.710
 and really what the infatuation or the national government through the 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.450
 presidential marriage 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:03.850
 undoubtedly 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.130
 it has to end we have to end up looking back at the past 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.150
 Plra in choirs or 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.750
 ideally look at the present towards the future 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.409
 and I say it with all authority 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:20.149
 they desert seventies like it the circ with moral authority that happens is 

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:23.759
 appropriate that I go without grudges but that we are also thinking about is the 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:25.819
 future and what you have to do 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:31.009
 percent the national executive I gave her and her husband at this time that 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:32.620
 really once and for all 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.620
 let's see power for the common good of all Argentines 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.979
 and these days he has denounced 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:42.590
 or the productive sector and the meat sector would be seeing 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:48.210
 e no hacienda marketing for next Thursday and Friday now makes 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.020
 instants it has been known that this would not encompass hacienda blocks for 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.300
 Wintering in order this is the situation that exists today in the sector 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:05.520
 at this time the markets percent to 9 2% and hacienda standing are going down 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.809
 that is to logically deny his razor in the consumption 

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:13.229
 but undoubtedly treta instabilities was not only 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:18.019
 climatological that for time can not reach the hacienda village but because 

00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:23.459
 is more than 15 thousand or 20 thousand jobs are in doubt that is are all 

00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:26.499
 the people who work and the bull who work in the industry 

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:28.470
 refrigerating 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:33.599
 It is from our country where our province is imbued &amp; between rivers 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:38.080
 this is in danger and not sustainable that this activity therefore 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.650
 ede I think there have to be clear and sound policies with regard to the 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.339
 sector to effect that 

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:48.979
 You can give work is worked production and 100 productions is going to 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:51.210
 see a better welfare for all Argentines 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.690
 this square is thinking about suspending some kind of activities in what 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:56.499
 refers to the entire commercial livestock chain 

00:06:56.499 --> 00:07:01.520
 so percent the next twenty nine 29 and 30 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.590
 on request or from 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:08.140
 province of buenos aires concretely cold and good interdependence 

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:10.069
 airs we would be this 

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:14.930
 is making or an agricultural stoppage of marketing in the field market 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.930
 that's why it means not to send what 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:24.050
 to auctions this means a total stoppage of 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.779
 attaches to the opponent's exit 

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:28.030
 a measure that 

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:31.450
 I've been trying to avoid wanted to have a lot of impact but the 

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:35.430
 situation is what has pushed this situation so fundamentally 

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:40.080
 because not only of tn I do not know what is not being fulfilled with everything 

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.999
 committed and fundamentally because 

00:07:42.999 --> 00:07:48.479
 by not having the source of work the presea to be able to export the meat contribution 

00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:50.360
 released internal consumption 

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.270
 many refrigerators including some that come from foreign capital the 

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:54.990
 Argentina 

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.939
 and other nationals and the provincials 

00:07:57.939 --> 00:07:59.949
 because of export like ours 

00:07:59.949 --> 00:08:03.289
 they had to close their factory as they say in the refrigerator 

00:08:03.289 --> 00:08:06.949
 because they can not complement their economic activity and are in a situation of 

00:08:06.949 --> 00:08:08.989
 important financial and economic crisis
