and the reason I can tell that is

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.460 
and the reason I can tell that is
because<00:01:17.520> it's<00:01:17.700> riding<00:01:17.940> up<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.720> needs<00:01:19.050> to<00:01:19.260> sit

horizontally across the back I mean if

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.750 
horizontally across the back I mean if
you<00:01:22.410> think<00:01:22.440> about<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:23.130> your<00:01:23.310> back<00:01:23.460> gets

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
you think about it your back gets

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.720

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
band is slipping up the back it means

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.320

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
try a 34g and we'll see how that goes

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.420 
try a 34g and we'll see how that goes
another<00:04:56.990> thing<00:04:57.260> to<00:04:57.410> remember<00:04:57.440> is<00:04:58.070> that<00:04:58.280> your

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
another thing to remember is that your

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.000 
another thing to remember is that your
size<00:04:58.669> can<00:04:59.120> vary<00:04:59.260> some<00:05:00.260> women<00:05:00.560> find<00:05:00.800> that<00:05:00.889> it

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
size can vary some women find that it

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.490 
size can vary some women find that it
alters<00:05:01.370> during<00:05:01.699> the<00:05:01.789> cycle<00:05:02.110> others<00:05:03.110> find<00:05:03.440> that

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
alters during the cycle others find that

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.110 
alters during the cycle others find that
it<00:05:03.620> changes<00:05:04.130> if<00:05:04.340> they<00:05:04.520> put<00:05:04.729> on<00:05:04.850> a<00:05:04.880> bit<00:05:05.090> of

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
it changes if they put on a bit of

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.510 
it changes if they put on a bit of
weight<00:05:05.210> or<00:05:05.600> lose<00:05:05.870> a<00:05:05.900> bit<00:05:06.110> of<00:05:06.139> weight<00:05:06.260> so<00:05:07.010> you

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
weight or lose a bit of weight so you

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.950 
weight or lose a bit of weight so you
need<00:05:07.669> to<00:05:07.789> bear<00:05:08.000> these<00:05:08.180> things<00:05:08.479> in<00:05:08.630> mind<00:05:08.840> when
