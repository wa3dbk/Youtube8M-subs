00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
our manual it's a stupidly complicated

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.660 
our manual it's a stupidly complicated
like<00:02:10.550> the

like the

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.790 
like the
dropping<00:02:13.630> it<00:02:13.720> down<00:02:13.750> in<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.140> first<00:02:14.319> year<00:02:14.680> is

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
dropping it down in the first year is

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.080 
dropping it down in the first year is
pointless<00:02:15.280> and

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
pointless and

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.500 
pointless and
popping<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:17.930> brake<00:02:18.170> is<00:02:19.180> pointless<00:02:20.180> but<00:02:20.450> I

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
popping the brake is pointless but I

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.720 
popping the brake is pointless but I
think<00:02:20.750> they<00:02:20.840> do<00:02:20.900> that<00:02:21.230> just<00:02:21.590> to<00:02:21.680> ensure<00:02:22.010> you

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
think they do that just to ensure you

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.760 
think they do that just to ensure you
can't<00:02:23.000> do<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.209> Hollywood<00:02:23.750> stop<00:02:24.050> and<00:02:24.380> not<00:02:24.500> really

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
can't do a Hollywood stop and not really

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.770 
can't do a Hollywood stop and not really
stop<00:02:24.830> you<00:02:25.790> know<00:02:25.910> I<00:02:25.940> think<00:02:26.180> it<00:02:26.330> forces<00:02:26.540> people

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
stop you know I think it forces people

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.330 
stop you know I think it forces people
actually<00:02:27.200> come<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:27.680> a<00:02:27.709> complete<00:02:28.100> stop<00:02:30.850> anyway

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
actually come to a complete stop anyway
