 mission we just review like this and 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.480
 we appear already in scene so we are going to 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.640
 start to fight and we see that they appear 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.260
 different enemies that there are simply 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.460

 attack this slid towards the enemy 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.660
 we see that he will immediately go there 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.220
 with his attacks like this in this way 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.960
 this way forgiveness and we see that it's going 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.070
 approaching we also have super power 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.240
 specials here at the top 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.880
 left we went to make different 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.860
 combat techniques we see what ends 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.560
 of doing with this way so this 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.700
 way is we pass our hero we are going to 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.860
 place them in different parts of the 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.600

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.040
 special 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.750

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.700
 different missions new that true 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.170
 it's worth downloading so if you 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.700

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.150

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.709
 android phone and we continue with toast

 down rose is a game that is 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.150
 acclimated to American football style 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.950
 with characters dressed in this style 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.750
 so we give him play and then put 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.669
 wretched so we start playing we see 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.750
 that the game is running like now 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.650
 formerly for his pretty game 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.770
 fun so it's worth it 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.820
 publish it you know already we already know that 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.710
 we have to dodge all kinds of 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.850
 obstacles and from people who have 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.240
 appearing on the screen then it's 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.699
 quite fun 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.380
 and truth that entertains a lot the idea 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:39.750
 It is trying to make a record 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.370
 rather superior and thus better ourselves 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.630
 once and twice we see that we 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.190
 we become football pelotica 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.449
 American and so we are going to move forward 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.699
 this game because the graphics are 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:50.340
 good and requires android 2.3 so that 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:52.590
 can be installed on the phone 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.780
 it requires many requirements but true 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.650
 what if it requires or will give you a lot 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.330
 fun 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.210
 download enjoy it if you like 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.310

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.410
 and enjoy this game on your android 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.990
 now we move on to a defense game 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.120
 pretty cute pretty original attractive 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.130
 and it's called pirates, we're going to give it to you 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.330
 start here we see the world where we have 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.160
 that participating is a broad world 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.570
 We have different missions to solve 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.570
 in this case I select is here 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.650
 and we press him here where he says to fight 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.129
 so we're going to start participating in 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.020
 this level 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:28.879
 before we start we can create 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.559
 our basic strategy come out 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:32.179
 arrows here also other arrows come out 

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:33.649
 this means that these sides are going to 

00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:34.909
 come our enemies 

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:36.199
 in these red spots that we see in the 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:37.909
 sea let's place our towers 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:39.289
 we see the street placed some like that 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:40.759
 is for example to place a tower 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:43.129
 attack here we see that there are different 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:44.749
 models of towers for example this we are going 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:46.879
 to place this one that shoots cannons 

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:49.249
 I will accept and we see that it is going to 

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:51.949
 build our tower let's put another 

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:54.050
 less aggressive and now we are going to 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:55.339
 start with the action of the tower 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.499
 it costs money that we're going to 

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:58.519
 collect when we attack each 

00:05:57.499 --> 00:06:00.499
 enemy so we press here in 

00:05:58.519 --> 00:06:03.800
 start, we will accelerate and we see that 

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:05.889
 the different enemies appear 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.360
 to attack us 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:10.379
 so the turas begin to work 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.379
 do his job 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.160
 and we see that I do not have enough money 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.570
 to create a tower so emulate here 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.010
 let's say the boat can also 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.440
 attack launch different powers 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:22.480
 skills is a true enough 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.070
 entertaining 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.070
 so it's expensive what you enjoyed if you 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.860
 they like these games 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:30.389
 kind of defense 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.340
 good finish with was that 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:33.930
 flame skyline a platform game 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.580
 with a mix as well as running but 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.830
 pretty funny and entertaining so 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.969
 here is when we are going to use we see that we 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.830
 they give the different missions that we have 

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:43.110
