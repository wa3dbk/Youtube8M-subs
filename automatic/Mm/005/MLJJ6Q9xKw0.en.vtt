playoff<00:03:00.400> run<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:00.760> everything<00:03:01.300> doesn't<00:03:01.510> it

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
playoff run and everything doesn't it

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.750 
playoff run and everything doesn't it
feel<00:03:01.870> like<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.140> summer<00:03:02.500> just<00:03:02.740> started<00:03:02.890> it

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
feel like the summer just started it

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.600 
feel like the summer just started it
does<00:03:04.030> that's<00:03:04.390> I<00:03:04.900> guess<00:03:05.140> a<00:03:05.290> sacrifice<00:03:05.920> you<00:03:06.190> that

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
does that's I guess a sacrifice you that

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.070 
does that's I guess a sacrifice you that
you<00:03:06.910> pay<00:03:07.120> for<00:03:07.360> going<00:03:07.570> deep<00:03:07.750> in<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:07.959> playoffs

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
you pay for going deep in the playoffs

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.810 
you pay for going deep in the playoffs
and<00:03:08.500> I<00:03:08.620> think<00:03:08.860> anyone<00:03:09.220> would<00:03:09.340> trade<00:03:09.580> that<00:03:09.790> in

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
and I think anyone would trade that in

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.000 
and I think anyone would trade that in
for<00:03:09.970> for<00:03:10.450> a<00:03:10.480> shorter<00:03:10.810> summer<00:03:11.080> but<00:03:11.380> you're

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
for for a shorter summer but you're

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.350 
for for a shorter summer but you're
right<00:03:12.130> you<00:03:12.310> don't<00:03:12.340> get<00:03:12.580> a<00:03:12.610> lot<00:03:12.730> of<00:03:12.790> time<00:03:13.060> to

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
right you don't get a lot of time to

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.449 
right you don't get a lot of time to
back<00:03:13.750> into<00:03:14.019> things<00:03:14.230> but<00:03:14.410> that's<00:03:15.040> why<00:03:15.220> we<00:03:15.370> have

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
back into things but that's why we have

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.430 
back into things but that's why we have
this<00:03:15.580> camp<00:03:15.880> its<00:03:16.420> kind<00:03:16.510> of<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.840> camp<00:03:17.230> before
