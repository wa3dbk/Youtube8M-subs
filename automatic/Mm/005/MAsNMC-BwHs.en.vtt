00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.670
 quite difficult to create something 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.500
 truly outstanding but more difficult 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.080
 repeat it again 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.690
 excellent example is pk 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.989
 in 2012 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:35.940
 the long awaited third part of the diablo series 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.370
 developed already in 2000 game 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.410
 got pretty mixed reviews 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.050
 many fans resented because 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.230
 innovations greatly simplifying gameplay 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.460
 while the press is more 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.920
 related to an increase in potential 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.110
 the audience positively debate 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.870
 lasted a long time while blizzard 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.940
 not released the first addition to the game with 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.370
 him the third part of the demonic saga 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.129
 gained integrity and recognition of big 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.780
 parts of the adepts of the old school however 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.300
 overshadow their popularity 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.140
 predecessor she could not 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:13.260
 but let's take the series itself in order 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.870
 beginning in 1996 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.470
 it was then that the light saw the first part 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.870
 diablo 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.840
 developed and unknown to anyone 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.119
 company moment condor renamed to 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.530
 blizzard nose after she bought it 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.289
 blizzard entertainment 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.030
 the game was accepted more than positively 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:33.509
 and work on the sequel began to boil 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.119
 instantly and in the summer of 2000 the sovereign 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.920
 horror again returned to the world of people in 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.920
 guise diablo 2 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:10.349
 diablo 2 was different from its predecessor in 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.330
 first scale given 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.580
 addition lord of destruction 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.040
 the second part offered players to visit 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.040
 five cities in the vicinity of which 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.500
 passed the main part of the game number 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.459
 playable characters also grew from 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.019
 three to seven 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:30.140
 and of course the bosses also increased 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:32.430
 One of the most important advantages of diablo 2 was 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.799
 replayability almost all aspects 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.319
 the games were aimed at the player 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:41.340
 returned to the world sanctuary again and 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:43.590
 again 7 heroes on three branches of development 30 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.349
 unique skills and random generation 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.200
 levels did each game session 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.060
 different from the previous one and open 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.920
 herd point distribution system and 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.440
 a wide range of skills allowed 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.340
 implement completely different builds 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.610
 heroes particularly appreciated the gloomy atmosphere 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.849
 games almost all color palette 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.470
 consisted of dull and dark tones 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:10.170
 the only exception is humans 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.000
 Galina using desert style 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.130
 which by the way some players 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.190
 criticized for breaking common 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.290
 directional diablo style beyond that 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.660
 panic diablo 2 was sent to 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.880
 realism in contrast to the third part 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.389
 cartoony that was also booed 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.239
 and many fans, contrary to opinion 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.859
 some diablo 2 is two dimensional 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.359
 play 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.669
 common misconception about 3d 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.919
 The game gear was called special 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:38.930
 video mode settings called 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:41.790
 perspective 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.040
 data clever mode and bonded 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.329
 game space so it was created 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.230
 I feel my sense of three-dimensional surroundings 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.720
 snag was implemented by 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.930
 use of changing texture fragments 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.579
 whatever it was in 2000 it looked 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.620
 very impressive 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.850
 and if you also understand how it is 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.570
 everything was realized that level 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.910
 not even to the developers just rolls over 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.710
 the sound in the game is also excellent however 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.540
 really deserves a separate 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.090
 attention so this is musical 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.300
 accompaniment performed by the composer 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.670
 Matty mind us each location possesses 

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:21.700
 own unique sound range 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:24.270
 which any fan will know from the first notes 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.270
 of the universe 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.970
 the plot of diablo 2 continues the story of the first 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.310
 parts after imprisoning the diablo entity 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.320
 your body with the stone of the soul 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.690
 the hero of the first game takes shape 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.960
 dark wanderer disappears into the unknown 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.350
 direction shortly after this world 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.940
 sanctuary and again envelop the forces of darkness 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.590
 the hero who has arrived from the far countries is called 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.510
 from the suit and the dark wanderer and 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.070
 prevent reunion 3 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:01.270
 primeval evil diablo mephisto ebalo 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.980
 the story is served not only through 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.500
 direct research game 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:08.110
 of the world but also through the screensavers before each 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.300
 an act of telling the way of the dark 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.880
 wanderer and his unwitting companion 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.520
 Marius on whose behalf and goes 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.860
 the narrative despite its simplicity 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.560
 and the plot is pretty exciting and 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.669
 interesting and on its motives published a series 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.190
 of books 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:25.860
 despite all its gloom in the game 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.330
 there was a place for humor 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.760
 famous easter cow 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.850
 level was born from legend among fans 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.680
 the first part was believed that the calls 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.110
 cows in tristram will lead to the discovery 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.390
 portal to the secret level 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:43.270
 bike was so popular that 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.070
 developers implemented it in diablo 2 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.020
 upon completion of the game at a normal level 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.330
 difficulties with the help of simple 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.940
 manipulations you can open the portal on so 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.160
 called mumu level filled 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.669
 crowds of erect walking cows from which 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.560
 good loot drops to the word similar 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:06.090
 level present in the third part 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:08.890
 however, it looks much more strange 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.510
 along with the original diablo 2 received 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.640
