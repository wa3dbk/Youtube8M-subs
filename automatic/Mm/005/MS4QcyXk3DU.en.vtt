up<00:03:31.920> and<00:03:32.130> then<00:03:32.220> sync<00:03:32.430> with<00:03:32.580> her<00:03:32.700> so<00:03:33.120> that's<00:03:33.269> also

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
up and then sync with her so that's also

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.940 
up and then sync with her so that's also
something<00:03:33.660> else<00:03:33.930> you<00:03:34.170> can<00:03:34.320> do<00:03:34.440> but<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:34.709> allows

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
something else you can do but it allows

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.900 
something else you can do but it allows
you<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.340> protect<00:03:35.790> this<00:03:36.120> here<00:03:36.920> so<00:03:37.920> basically<00:03:38.700> if

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
you to protect this here so basically if

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.520 
you to protect this here so basically if
you<00:03:39.030> feel<00:03:39.300> this<00:03:39.480> is<00:03:39.630> gonna<00:03:39.810> get<00:03:40.019> take<00:03:40.260> it<00:03:40.410> out

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
you feel this is gonna get take it out

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.830 
you feel this is gonna get take it out
really<00:03:40.860> bad<00:03:41.070> you<00:03:41.610> can<00:03:41.760> flip<00:03:42.000> their<00:03:42.239> faced

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
really bad you can flip their faced

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.710 
really bad you can flip their faced
down<00:03:43.080> they<00:03:43.410> can't<00:03:43.650> use<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:44.010> effect<00:03:44.570> keep<00:03:45.570> that

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
down they can't use the effect keep that

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.630 
down they can't use the effect keep that
in<00:03:45.810> mind<00:03:45.959> so<00:03:46.769> it's<00:03:46.920> definitely<00:03:47.250> something<00:03:47.489> you

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
more time so use made in more as a

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.750 
more time so use made in more as a
defense<00:05:32.350> tool<00:05:32.620> than<00:05:32.800> you<00:05:32.890> do<00:05:33.040> in<00:05:33.160> typical<00:05:33.550> blue

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
defense tool than you do in typical blue

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.360 
defense tool than you do in typical blue
eyes<00:05:33.990> so<00:05:34.990> basically<00:05:35.410> you<00:05:35.500> play<00:05:35.710> her<00:05:35.920> they're

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
eyes so basically you play her they're

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.680 
eyes so basically you play her they're
not<00:05:36.550> going<00:05:36.700> to<00:05:36.760> swing<00:05:37.000> into<00:05:37.150> her<00:05:37.360> unless<00:05:37.540> they

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
not going to swing into her unless they

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:38.880 
not going to swing into her unless they
have<00:05:37.840> a<00:05:37.870> way<00:05:38.020> to<00:05:38.080> get<00:05:38.230> blue<00:05:38.410> eyes<00:05:38.590> out<00:05:38.740> of<00:05:38.830> the

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
have a way to get blue eyes out of the

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.600 
have a way to get blue eyes out of the
game<00:05:39.070> so<00:05:39.850> if<00:05:40.150> blue<00:05:40.420> eyes<00:05:40.600> comes<00:05:40.900> out<00:05:41.490> it's<00:05:42.490> a

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
game so if blue eyes comes out it's a

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.370 
game so if blue eyes comes out it's a
3000<00:05:43.270> threat<00:05:43.630> that<00:05:43.870> they're<00:05:43.960> gonna<00:05:44.080> have<00:05:44.230> to

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
3000 threat that they're gonna have to

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.600 
3000 threat that they're gonna have to
deal<00:05:44.560> with<00:05:44.740> now<00:05:44.950> some<00:05:45.190> of<00:05:45.280> you<00:05:45.340> were<00:05:45.430> probably

eyes<00:05:55.240> your<00:05:55.480> eyes<00:05:55.540> play<00:05:55.900> and<00:05:56.200> defense<00:05:56.620> and<00:05:56.860> then

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
eyes your eyes play and defense and then

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.250 
eyes your eyes play and defense and then
you<00:05:57.400> have<00:05:57.550> defense<00:05:57.970> and<00:05:58.180> offense<00:05:58.630> so

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
you have defense and offense so
