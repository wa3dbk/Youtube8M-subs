whatnot those kind of weapons earlier in

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.810 
whatnot those kind of weapons earlier in
the<00:01:19.409> game<00:01:19.470> but<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.100> would<00:01:20.280> be<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.430> little<00:01:20.700> bit

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
the game but it would be a little bit

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.719 
the game but it would be a little bit
rare<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.509> on<00:01:21.750> screen<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:23.159> chart<00:01:23.430> that

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
rare so on screen is on the chart that

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.460 
rare so on screen is on the chart that
you<00:01:23.759> can<00:01:24.030> see<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.240> percentages<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.810> each<00:01:25.290> you

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
you can see the percentages of each you

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.020 
you can see the percentages of each you
know<00:01:25.530> different<00:01:25.710> level<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.310> acts<00:01:26.580> and

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
know different level and acts and

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.999 
know different level and acts and
whatnot<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:28.140> really<00:01:28.290> does<00:01:28.590> show<00:01:28.979> that

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
whatnot so this really does show that

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.760 
whatnot so this really does show that
Blizzard<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.939> really<00:01:30.540> leaning<00:01:31.170> toward<00:01:31.500> action

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770

coop and again guys this stems from a

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.370 
coop and again guys this stems from a
pattern<00:03:09.270> that<00:03:09.300> Blizzard<00:03:09.810> is<00:03:09.900> seen<00:03:10.170> through

first<00:04:35.830> so<00:04:36.100> they're<00:04:36.280> thinking<00:04:36.640> about<00:04:36.700> four

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
first so they're thinking about four

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.850 
first so they're thinking about four
times<00:04:37.360> the<00:04:37.630> current<00:04:37.810> price<00:04:38.110> or<00:04:38.440> even<00:04:38.650> six

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
times the current price or even six

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.710 
times the current price or even six
times<00:04:39.070> the<00:04:39.190> current<00:04:39.310> price<00:04:39.580> so<00:04:40.180> being<00:04:40.660> a

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
times the current price so being a

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.760 
times the current price so being a
lookout<00:04:40.930> for<00:04:40.990> that<00:04:41.170> because<00:04:41.410> that's<00:04:41.560> gonna

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
lookout for that because that's gonna

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.520 
lookout for that because that's gonna
cost<00:04:42.040> you<00:04:42.310> some<00:04:42.520> cash<00:04:42.940> money<00:04:43.300> let's<00:04:44.140> move<00:04:44.350> on
