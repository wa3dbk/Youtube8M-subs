those<00:00:36.320> I've<00:00:37.320> gotten<00:00:37.649> tired<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:38.129> w/e<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:39.440> really

I colleague NIST spark you guys probably
called<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.530> spark<00:00:46.860> my<00:00:47.219> goodness<00:00:49.160> but<00:00:50.160> um<00:00:51.289> it's

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
called a spark my goodness but um it's

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.290 
called a spark my goodness but um it's
been<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.559> lot<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.739> years<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.960> started<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.199> 2009

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
been a lot of years I started in 2009

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.160 
been a lot of years I started in 2009
first<00:00:57.300> ever<00:00:57.629> w/e<00:00:58.140> video<00:00:58.440> was<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.899> Hell<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:00.930> a

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
first ever w/e video was the Hell in a

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.359 
first ever w/e video was the Hell in a
Cell<00:01:01.379> 2009<00:01:02.070> simulation<00:01:03.830> which<00:01:04.830> was<00:01:05.040> basically

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
Cell 2009 simulation which was basically

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.390 
Cell 2009 simulation which was basically
the<00:01:05.729> CPU<00:01:06.150> playing<00:01:06.390> against<00:01:06.720> each<00:01:06.780> other<00:01:06.990> or

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
the CPU playing against each other or

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.330 
the CPU playing against each other or
playing<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.549> CPU<00:01:09.590> while<00:01:10.590> having<00:01:10.890> game<00:01:11.040> volume

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
playing a CPU while having game volume

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.700 
playing a CPU while having game volume
in<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.460> background<00:01:11.850> no<00:01:12.720> commentary<00:01:13.790> and<00:01:15.710> it's

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
in the background no commentary and it's

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.789 
in the background no commentary and it's
it's<00:01:17.100> just<00:01:17.400> hard<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.850> think<00:01:17.970> about<00:01:18.680> this<00:01:19.680> is

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
it's just hard to think about this is

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.520 
it's just hard to think about this is
where<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:20.070> are<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.400> then<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.869> hope<00:01:22.080> somebody

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
where we are and then we hope somebody

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.469 
where we are and then we hope somebody
else<00:01:22.710> starts<00:01:23.250> doing<00:01:23.549> simulation<00:01:24.060> on<00:01:24.119> YouTube

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
else starts doing simulation on YouTube

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.539 
else starts doing simulation on YouTube
yes<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:26.180> really<00:01:27.180> want<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:28.439> help<00:01:28.650> them<00:01:28.890> out<00:01:28.979> like

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
yes I really want to help them out like

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.149 
yes I really want to help them out like
I'd<00:01:30.180> still<00:01:30.509> have<00:01:30.600> fan<00:01:30.869> base<00:01:31.110> on<00:01:31.470> YouTube<00:01:31.890> I

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
I'd still have fan base on YouTube I

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.429 
I'd still have fan base on YouTube I
know<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.240> I'm<00:01:33.600> gonna<00:01:33.869> still<00:01:34.020> be<00:01:34.049> on<00:01:34.200> stream

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
know that I'm gonna still be on stream

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.330 
know that I'm gonna still be on stream
w/e<00:01:34.770> every<00:01:35.520> week<00:01:36.079> but<00:01:37.079> I'm<00:01:37.229> just<00:01:37.439> I'm<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.159> I'm

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
w/e every week but I'm just I'm so I'm

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.280 
w/e every week but I'm just I'm so I'm
done<00:01:38.520> with<00:01:38.759> making<00:01:38.939> videos<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.509> have<00:01:39.810> had<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:39.990> lot

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
done with making videos I have had a lot

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.440 
done with making videos I have had a lot
of<00:01:40.320> problems<00:01:40.799> up<00:01:41.100> theirs<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:42.210> I've<00:01:42.270> never

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
of problems up theirs that I've never

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.710 
of problems up theirs that I've never
told<00:01:42.630> anyone<00:01:42.869> about<00:01:42.990> I've<00:01:43.700> had<00:01:44.700> lot<00:01:45.689> of

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
told anyone about I've had lot of

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.950 
told anyone about I've had lot of
depressions<00:01:46.290> like<00:01:47.090> when<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.180> didn't<00:01:48.479> do<00:01:48.689> make

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
depressions like when I didn't do make

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.929 
depressions like when I didn't do make
think<00:01:49.950> about<00:01:50.070> Survivor<00:01:50.430> Series<00:01:50.640> some

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
think about Survivor Series some

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.219 
think about Survivor Series some
Survivor<00:01:51.240> Series<00:01:51.450> simulations<00:01:51.990> all

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
Survivor Series simulations all

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.920 
Survivor Series simulations all
simulations<00:01:52.740> I've<00:01:52.920> not<00:01:53.130> made<00:01:53.659> always<00:01:54.659> come

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
simulations I've not made always come

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.289 
simulations I've not made always come
with<00:01:55.079> an<00:01:55.170> excuse<00:01:55.619> but<00:01:55.950> excuses<00:01:56.520> really<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:56.850> how

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
with an excuse but excuses really is how

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.190 
with an excuse but excuses really is how
hard<00:01:57.689> I've<00:01:57.869> had<00:01:58.020> at<00:01:58.170> home<00:01:59.600> I'm<00:02:00.600> trying<00:02:00.990> not<00:02:01.140> to

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
hard I've had at home I'm trying not to

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.020 
hard I've had at home I'm trying not to
cry<00:02:02.210> but<00:02:03.210> um<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:04.040> really<00:02:05.040> had<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.460> really<00:02:05.790> bad

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
cry but um I really had a really bad

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.930 
cry but um I really had a really bad
growing<00:02:06.659> up<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.190> used<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.450> mmm

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
growing up and used to mmm

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:18.670 
growing up and used to mmm
YouTube<00:02:11.940> was<00:02:12.210> my<00:02:12.860> place<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:14.010> go<00:02:15.860> but<00:02:16.860> I<00:02:16.890> didn't

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
YouTube was my place to go but I didn't

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:26.020 
YouTube was my place to go but I didn't
have<00:02:19.680> anyone<00:02:20.010> right<00:02:20.280> now

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.260 

I'm<00:02:27.030> quitting<00:02:27.240> YouTube<00:02:27.480> with<00:02:28.200> which<00:02:29.120> which<00:02:30.120> is

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
I'm quitting YouTube with which which is

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.050 
I'm quitting YouTube with which which is
concert<00:02:30.720> but<00:02:31.290> I<00:02:31.320> just<00:02:31.800> that's<00:02:32.310> what<00:02:32.640> I<00:02:32.670> want<00:02:32.910> to

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
concert but I just that's what I want to

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.900 
concert but I just that's what I want to
do<00:02:33.500> it's<00:02:34.500> also<00:02:34.650> gonna<00:02:34.860> give<00:02:35.070> me<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.220> lot<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.400> time

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910

told anyone I have told people that
we're<00:02:56.940> never<00:02:57.030> told<00:02:57.300> that<00:02:57.390> on<00:02:57.660> YouTube<00:02:58.080> before

I've<00:02:59.250> always<00:02:59.550> kept<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.940> series<00:03:00.240> going

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
I've always kept the series going

I've always kept the series going
everyone<00:03:01.950> but<00:03:02.820> like<00:03:03.210> you<00:03:03.900> will<00:03:04.020> not

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
everyone but like you will not

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.570 
everyone but like you will not
understand<00:03:04.620> how<00:03:04.740> hard<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.190> is<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.340> actually

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
understand how hard it is to actually

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.540 
understand how hard it is to actually
keep<00:03:05.970> a<00:03:06.180> child<00:03:06.360> going<00:03:06.660> for<00:03:07.080> a<00:03:07.110> while

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
keep a child going for a while

WrestleMania 22 I'm just gonna talk a
little<00:03:53.520> bit<00:03:53.640> about<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.940> channel<00:03:54.239> because<00:03:54.420> I

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
little bit about the channel because I

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.290 
little bit about the channel because I
need<00:03:56.310> to<00:03:56.340> talk<00:03:56.550> about<00:03:56.670> something<00:03:56.910> so<00:03:57.150> I<00:03:57.180> don't

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
simulation that was I think was the

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.270 
simulation that was I think was the
resume<00:04:04.860> at<00:04:04.980> 26

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
resume at 26

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.680 
resume at 26
or<00:04:07.790> 25<00:04:08.300> I<00:04:08.510> did<00:04:08.690> at<00:04:08.750> 25<00:04:09.170> adele<00:04:09.530> 26<00:04:10.130> I<00:04:10.280> smell<00:04:11.120> 27

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
or 25 I did at 25 adele 26 I smell 27

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.650 
or 25 I did at 25 adele 26 I smell 27
simulation<00:04:12.170> after<00:04:13.130> I<00:04:13.160> was<00:04:13.430> in<00:04:13.580> after<00:04:14.420> I<00:04:14.450> watch

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
simulation after I was in after I watch

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.949 
simulation after I was in after I watch
first<00:04:14.870> met<00:04:15.020> 27<00:04:16.150> that<00:04:17.150> was<00:04:17.299> the<00:04:17.450> first<00:04:17.690> one

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
first met 27 that was the first one

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.170 
first met 27 that was the first one
where<00:04:18.170> I<00:04:18.230> did<00:04:18.470> like<00:04:18.680> real<00:04:19.010> highlights<00:04:20.000> I<00:04:20.150> think

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
where I did like real highlights I think

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.840 
where I did like real highlights I think
maybe<00:04:21.049> I<00:04:21.320> think<00:04:21.440> was<00:04:21.709> maybe<00:04:22.040> Royal<00:04:22.430> Rumble

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
maybe I think was maybe Royal Rumble

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.570 
maybe I think was maybe Royal Rumble
2011<00:04:23.510> you<00:04:24.410> guys<00:04:24.560> may<00:04:24.800> be<00:04:24.830> no<00:04:25.100> better<00:04:25.250> than<00:04:25.370> me

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
2011 you guys may be no better than me

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.020 
2011 you guys may be no better than me
but<00:04:26.420> I<00:04:27.130> have<00:04:28.130> a<00:04:28.160> silver<00:04:28.490> rock<00:04:28.580> channel<00:04:28.880> first

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
but I have a silver rock channel first

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.850 
but I have a silver rock channel first
that<00:04:29.360> I<00:04:29.390> made<00:04:29.570> this<00:04:29.960> militia<00:04:30.290> song<00:04:30.470> mental

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
that I made this militia song mental

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.490 
that I made this militia song mental
