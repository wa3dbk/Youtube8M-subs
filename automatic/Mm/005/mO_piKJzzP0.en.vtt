00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
spend humanity it's gonna increase the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.229 
spend humanity it's gonna increase the
150<00:00:45.110> I'm<00:00:46.110> gonna<00:00:46.260> do<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.469> one<00:00:46.530> more<00:00:46.590> time<00:00:47.239> that's

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
150 I'm gonna do it one more time that's

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.779 
150 I'm gonna do it one more time that's
gonna<00:00:48.420> increase<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.750> 158<00:00:49.309> so<00:00:50.309> it's<00:00:50.460> not<00:00:50.610> as

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
gonna increase to 158 so it's not as

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.360 
gonna increase to 158 so it's not as
great<00:00:51.270> as<00:00:51.449> an<00:00:51.690> incremental<00:00:52.260> as<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.649> first<00:00:52.890> so

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
great as an incremental as the first so

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.560 
great as an incremental as the first so
100<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.390> like<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.719> base<00:00:55.789> item<00:00:56.789> discovery<00:00:57.390> that

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
100 is like the base item discovery that

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.200 
100 is like the base item discovery that
you<00:00:57.690> have<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.289> your<00:00:59.039> drop<00:00:59.280> rate<00:00:59.520> goes<00:00:59.879> off<00:01:00.059> of

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
you have so your drop rate goes off of

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.330 
you have so your drop rate goes off of
that<00:01:00.359> number<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:01.350> more<00:01:01.500> humanity<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.039> spend

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
that number the more humanity you spend

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.270 
that number the more humanity you spend
believe<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:03.300> up<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.600> 10<00:01:04.199> or<00:01:04.350> 20<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.830> think<00:01:05.159> it's

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
believe it's up to 10 or 20 I think it's

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.390 
believe it's up to 10 or 20 I think it's
10<00:01:06.740> you<00:01:07.740> actually<00:01:08.070> get<00:01:08.220> more<00:01:09.979> more<00:01:10.979> item<00:01:11.189> drop

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
10 you actually get more more item drop

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.190 
10 you actually get more more item drop
rate<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.210> could<00:01:12.420> use<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.750> for<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.020> Black

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
rate so you could use that for the Black

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.920 
rate so you could use that for the Black
Knight<00:01:13.409> hybrid<00:01:13.920> as<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:15.030> stated<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.600> one<00:01:15.630> video

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
Knight hybrid as I stated in one video

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.460 
Knight hybrid as I stated in one video
to<00:01:16.890> increase<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.400> chance<00:01:18.140> now<00:01:19.140> right<00:01:19.290> here<00:01:19.439> I

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
to increase that chance now right here I

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.649 
to increase that chance now right here I
have<00:01:19.619> 4<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.490> get<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.640> humanity<00:01:21.090> from<00:01:21.240> beating

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
large club from or at least hope to I

did<00:01:40.770> not

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
did not

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.149 
did not
they're<00:01:42.689> not<00:01:42.869> exactly<00:01:43.049> easy<00:01:43.500> especially<00:01:43.770> this

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
they're not exactly easy especially this

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.830 
they're not exactly easy especially this
first<00:01:44.369> batch<00:01:44.759> there's<00:01:45.149> three<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.420> them<00:01:45.600> in

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
first batch there's three of them in

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.870 
first batch there's three of them in
this<00:01:46.110> hallway<00:01:46.320> these<00:01:47.159> are<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.369> first<00:01:47.640> two

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
this hallway these are the first two

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.270 
this hallway these are the first two
they're<00:01:48.540> actually<00:01:48.930> really<00:01:49.530> slow<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.189> can

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
they're actually really slow so you can

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.370 
they're actually really slow so you can
sneak<00:01:50.579> up<00:01:50.729> behind<00:01:50.759> them<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.420> just<00:01:52.079> get<00:01:52.200> really

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
sneak up behind them and just get really

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.929 
sneak up behind them and just get really
cheesy<00:01:52.799> with<00:01:53.100> some<00:01:53.250> backstabs

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
cheesy with some backstabs

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.420 
cheesy with some backstabs
so<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:54.960> can<00:01:55.079> split<00:01:55.409> them<00:01:55.500> up<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.950> can<00:01:55.979> just

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
so you can split them up you can just

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.850 
so you can split them up you can just
hit<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.820> run<00:01:56.969> tactics<00:01:57.180> like<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:57.810> but<00:01:58.680> I'm

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:50.430 
these things are absolutely easy to
cheese<00:03:49.150> and<00:03:49.479> I<00:03:49.720> don't<00:03:49.780> know<00:03:49.959> why<00:03:50.109> I<00:03:50.139> didn't<00:03:50.319> get

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
cheese and I don't know why I didn't get

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.569 
cheese and I don't know why I didn't get
hit<00:03:50.530> with<00:03:50.620> that<00:03:50.680> one<00:03:50.949> attack<00:03:51.190> right<00:03:51.340> there<00:03:51.400> I

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
hit with that one attack right there I

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.399 
hit with that one attack right there I
was<00:03:51.729> a<00:03:51.760> little<00:03:51.819> what<00:03:52.659> the<00:03:52.750> F<00:03:52.870> right<00:03:53.109> there

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:53.409 
was a little what the F right there

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:57.390 
was a little what the F right there
but<00:03:54.099> um<00:03:55.090> didn't<00:03:55.690> drop<00:03:55.840> but<00:03:56.530> they<00:03:57.250> are

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
but um didn't drop but they are

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.250 
but um didn't drop but they are
recyclable<00:03:57.760> I<00:03:58.209> guess<00:03:58.750> I'm<00:03:58.900> gonna<00:03:59.019> call<00:03:59.199> it

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
recyclable I guess I'm gonna call it

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.990 
recyclable I guess I'm gonna call it
that<00:03:59.379> this<00:03:59.560> so<00:03:59.979> if<00:04:00.129> you<00:04:00.250> reset<00:04:00.639> them<00:04:00.790> at<00:04:00.909> the

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
that this so if you reset them at the

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.250 
that this so if you reset them at the
Firelink<00:04:01.329> shrine<00:04:01.359> you<00:04:01.510> can<00:04:01.659> go<00:04:01.720> back<00:04:01.870> and<00:04:02.049> try

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
Firelink shrine you can go back and try

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.069 
Firelink shrine you can go back and try
again<00:04:02.909> now<00:04:03.909> this<00:04:04.090> is<00:04:04.209> what<00:04:04.359> it<00:04:04.449> looks<00:04:04.629> like<00:04:04.840> a

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
again now this is what it looks like a

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.759 
again now this is what it looks like a
nice<00:04:05.680> big<00:04:06.549> heavy<00:04:07.269> weapon<00:04:08.199> this<00:04:08.379> thing<00:04:08.650> is

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
nice big heavy weapon this thing is

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.280
