it<00:00:47.879> will<00:00:48.000> actually<00:00:48.120> reduce<00:00:48.420> trolling<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.350> don't

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
it will actually reduce trolling I don't

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.340 
it will actually reduce trolling I don't
know<00:00:49.980> about<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.550> but<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.360> be<00:00:51.480> honest<00:00:51.780> if<00:00:52.050> I

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
know about that but to be honest if I

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.709 
know about that but to be honest if I
think<00:00:53.010> people<00:00:53.370> if<00:00:53.610> they<00:00:53.760> do<00:00:53.820> display<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.510> real

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
think people if they do display the real

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.250 
think people if they do display the real
names<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.440> think<00:00:56.129> there<00:00:56.340> will<00:00:56.550> be<00:00:56.610> some<00:00:57.390> mutual

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
names I think there will be some mutual

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.930 
names I think there will be some mutual
respect<00:00:58.770> when<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.129> play<00:00:59.309> with<00:00:59.520> someone<00:00:59.910> just

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
respect when you play with someone just

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.540 
respect when you play with someone just
because<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.660> can<00:01:00.809> easily<00:01:01.190> look<00:01:02.190> them<00:01:02.399> up

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
because you can easily look them up

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.729 
because you can easily look them up
online<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.420> find<00:01:03.690> out<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.080> know<00:01:04.199> where<00:01:04.500> they

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
online and find out you know where they

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.370 
online and find out you know where they
live<00:01:05.010> perhaps<00:01:05.970> but<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.630> don't<00:01:06.810> know<00:01:07.080> if<00:01:07.260> it's

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
live perhaps but I don't know if it's
