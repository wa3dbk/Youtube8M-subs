way I found to do that is to start with

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.010 
way I found to do that is to start with
a<00:00:28.660> old<00:00:29.500> filter<00:00:31.050> now<00:00:32.050> I'm<00:00:32.320> going<00:00:32.529> to<00:00:32.590> pull<00:00:32.890> out

water change on fill this thing up the
rest<00:01:17.320> of<00:01:17.409> the<00:01:17.620> way<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:21.460> as<00:01:21.700> you<00:01:21.820> can<00:01:22.090> see<00:01:22.360> it<00:01:22.479> I

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
rest of the way and as you can see it I

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.170 
rest of the way and as you can see it I
felt<00:01:22.810> it<00:01:22.930> was<00:01:23.080> pretty<00:01:23.290> dirty<00:01:23.590> and<00:01:23.920> I'm<00:01:24.820> willing

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.300 
felt it was pretty dirty and I'm willing
to<00:01:25.330> bet<00:01:25.659> that<00:01:25.990> there<00:01:26.440> was<00:01:26.619> an<00:01:26.770> assortment

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
to bet that there was an assortment

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.180 
to bet that there was an assortment
different<00:01:28.210> bacteria<00:01:28.869> in<00:01:29.409> feast<00:01:29.799> or<00:01:30.040> eeeh

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
different bacteria in feast or eeeh

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.000 
different bacteria in feast or eeeh
inside<00:01:30.940> that<00:01:31.240> filter<00:01:31.750> I<00:01:31.990> mean<00:01:32.710> that's<00:01:32.890> the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
inside that filter I mean that's the

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.800 
inside that filter I mean that's the
whole<00:01:33.159> reason<00:01:33.189> we<00:01:33.670> set<00:01:33.880> filters<00:01:34.299> up<00:01:34.450> that<00:01:34.659> way

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
whole reason we set filters up that way

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:35.969 
whole reason we set filters up that way
right<00:01:35.049> we're<00:01:35.260> supposed<00:01:35.500> to<00:01:35.560> be<00:01:35.680> getting<00:01:35.950> some

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
right we're supposed to be getting some

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.600 
right we're supposed to be getting some
biological<00:01:36.909> action<00:01:37.200> well<00:01:38.200> what<00:01:38.710> I<00:01:38.740> want<00:01:39.159> is<00:01:39.340> to

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
biological action well what I want is to

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.260 
biological action well what I want is to
sort<00:01:39.970> out<00:01:40.180> some<00:01:40.479> of<00:01:40.689> that<00:01:40.860> biological<00:01:41.860> action

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
sort out some of that biological action

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.179

we'll<00:02:33.910> see<00:02:34.180> what<00:02:34.420> this<00:02:34.630> becomes<00:02:35.200> in<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:35.500> week<00:02:35.709> or

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
we'll see what this becomes in a week or

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.890 
we'll see what this becomes in a week or
so<00:02:37.290> what<00:02:38.290> kind<00:02:38.620> of<00:02:38.709> stuff<00:02:38.980> that<00:02:39.220> will<00:02:39.400> grow

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
so what kind of stuff that will grow

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.309 
so what kind of stuff that will grow
certainly<00:02:40.900> is<00:02:41.019> a<00:02:41.049> rich<00:02:43.019> disgusting<00:02:44.019> looking

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
certainly is a rich disgusting looking

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.380 
certainly is a rich disgusting looking
mixture<00:02:44.769> of<00:02:44.860> water<00:02:45.040> there<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.519> start<00:02:45.790> with<00:02:45.879> so

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
mixture of water there to start with so

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.420 
mixture of water there to start with so
we'll<00:02:47.140> see<00:02:47.290> what<00:02:47.440> kind<00:02:47.620> of<00:02:47.680> in<00:02:47.799> feast<00:02:47.980> are<00:02:48.160> we

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
we'll see what kind of in feast are we

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.979 
we'll see what kind of in feast are we
get<00:02:48.610> this<00:02:48.910> is<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.090> one<00:02:49.299> that<00:02:49.510> I<00:02:49.540> showed<00:02:49.810> you

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
get this is the one that I showed you

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.619 
get this is the one that I showed you
how<00:02:50.079> to<00:02:50.110> start<00:02:50.560> had<00:02:51.400> really<00:02:51.819> all<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.150> grungy

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
how to start had really all the grungy

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.440 
how to start had really all the grungy
stuff<00:02:52.900> out<00:02:53.110> of<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.349> filter<00:02:53.739> and<00:02:54.010> this<00:02:55.000> is<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.209> no

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
stuff out of the filter and this is a no

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.449 
stuff out of the filter and this is a no
I<00:02:55.480> started<00:02:56.170> at<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.380> same<00:02:56.590> time<00:02:56.950> with<00:02:57.250> some

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
I started at the same time with some

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.879 
I started at the same time with some
more<00:02:57.489> filter<00:02:58.000> material<00:02:58.180> it's<00:02:59.139> not<00:02:59.380> nearly<00:02:59.739> as

00:02:59.879 --> 00:02:59.889 
more filter material it's not nearly as

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.129 
more filter material it's not nearly as
grungy<00:03:00.489> both<00:03:01.329> of<00:03:01.540> these<00:03:01.660> are<00:03:01.930> just

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:02.139 
grungy both of these are just

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:04.410 
grungy both of these are just
overflowing<00:03:02.920> with<00:03:03.310> Paramecium<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.239> other

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
overflowing with Paramecium and other

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.629 
overflowing with Paramecium and other
little<00:03:04.780> really<00:03:05.739> tiny<00:03:05.980> things<00:03:06.340> crawling

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:06.639 
little really tiny things crawling

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:09.059 
little really tiny things crawling
around<00:03:06.880> and<00:03:07.299> I'm<00:03:08.049> going<00:03:08.500> to<00:03:08.530> turn<00:03:08.739> the<00:03:08.889> light

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
around and I'm going to turn the light

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.800 
around and I'm going to turn the light
out<00:03:09.099> and<00:03:09.250> use<00:03:09.519> a<00:03:09.549> flashlight<00:03:09.940> and<00:03:10.389> see<00:03:10.569> if<00:03:10.690> the

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
out and use a flashlight and see if the

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.250 
out and use a flashlight and see if the
camera<00:03:11.019> here<00:03:11.319> will<00:03:11.440> pick<00:03:11.650> some<00:03:11.889> of<00:03:12.069> it<00:03:12.190> up<00:03:13.260> so

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
camera here will pick some of it up so

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:21.540 
camera here will pick some of it up so
here<00:03:14.530> goes

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.150 

yep<00:03:22.210> that's<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.720> Paramecium<00:03:23.470> you<00:03:23.650> can<00:03:23.830> see<00:03:24.010> in

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
yep that's the Paramecium you can see in

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.590 
yep that's the Paramecium you can see in
your<00:03:24.280> swimming<00:03:24.640> around<00:03:24.940> all<00:03:25.210> those<00:03:25.360> little

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
your swimming around all those little

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.360 
your swimming around all those little
dots<00:03:25.960> that<00:03:26.730> it's<00:03:27.730> hard<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.210> see<00:03:28.480> through<00:03:28.840> the

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
dots that it's hard to see through the

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.280 
dots that it's hard to see through the
through<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.520> glass<00:03:30.850> well<00:03:31.630> there<00:03:31.840> you<00:03:31.990> get<00:03:32.140> an

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
through the glass well there you get an

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.050 
through the glass well there you get an
idea<00:03:32.740> of<00:03:32.830> how<00:03:33.100> many<00:03:33.160> there<00:03:33.460> are<00:03:33.610> swimming

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
idea of how many there are swimming

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.930 
idea of how many there are swimming
around<00:03:34.440> this<00:03:35.440> one's<00:03:35.710> just<00:03:35.830> so<00:03:36.190> dark<00:03:36.520> and<00:03:36.730> so

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
around this one's just so dark and so

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.340 
around this one's just so dark and so
full<00:03:37.360> it's<00:03:37.660> hard<00:03:37.930> to<00:03:38.110> to<00:03:39.070> see<00:03:39.370> it<00:03:40.050> what<00:03:41.050> you<00:03:41.200> may

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
full it's hard to to see it what you may

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.620 
full it's hard to to see it what you may
not<00:03:41.500> know<00:03:41.560> about<00:03:41.980> Paramecium<00:03:42.970> and<00:03:43.180> most<00:03:43.450> of

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
not know about Paramecium and most of

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.790 
not know about Paramecium and most of
the<00:03:43.720> little<00:03:43.930> critters<00:03:44.320> you<00:03:44.380> can<00:03:44.500> grow<00:03:44.650> in

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
the little critters you can grow in

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.040 
the little critters you can grow in
these<00:03:44.920> jars<00:03:45.310> is<00:03:45.970> they're<00:03:46.210> light<00:03:46.420> sensitive

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
these jars is they're light sensitive

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.430 
these jars is they're light sensitive
they<00:03:47.230> are<00:03:47.260> attracted<00:03:48.070> to<00:03:48.190> the<00:03:48.310> light<00:03:48.600> so<00:03:49.600> what

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
they are attracted to the light so what

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.240 
they are attracted to the light so what
I've<00:03:50.620> done<00:03:50.860> is<00:03:51.070> put<00:03:51.100> a<00:03:51.310> light<00:03:51.580> on<00:03:51.790> this<00:03:51.970> jar<00:03:53.250> and

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
I've done is put a light on this jar and

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.360
