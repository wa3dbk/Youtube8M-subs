it's<00:00:00.780> probably<00:00:00.960> thinking<00:00:01.350> to<00:00:01.410> go<00:00:01.500> down<00:00:01.680> is<00:00:01.860> one

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
it's probably thinking to go down is one

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.510 
it's probably thinking to go down is one
of<00:00:02.100> my<00:00:02.220> best<00:00:02.790> ideas<00:00:02.939> but<00:00:03.510> I<00:00:03.780> had<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.740> I<00:00:04.980> got<00:00:05.430> to

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
of my best ideas but I had to I got to

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.690 
of my best ideas but I had to I got to
give<00:00:05.640> this<00:00:05.759> a<00:00:05.819> go<00:00:06.120> so<00:00:06.540> we're<00:00:06.720> in<00:00:07.460> Austin<00:00:08.460> Texas

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
give this a go so we're in Austin Texas

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.169 
give this a go so we're in Austin Texas
with<00:00:09.420> like<00:00:09.660> 30<00:00:09.929> mile-an-hour<00:00:10.610> guys<00:00:11.610> probably

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
with like 30 mile-an-hour guys probably

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.810 
with like 30 mile-an-hour guys probably
see<00:00:12.570> you're<00:00:12.780> here<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.320> I'm<00:00:14.280> going<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.460> take

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.450 
see you're here and I'm going to take
the<00:00:14.969> Naza<00:00:15.150> up<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:16.340> stabilized<00:00:17.340> but<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:19.430> lot<00:00:20.430> of

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
the Naza up and stabilized but a lot of

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.609 
the Naza up and stabilized but a lot of
battery<00:00:20.670> left<00:00:20.970> hover<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.260> just<00:00:22.410> see<00:00:22.590> how

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
battery left hover it and just see how

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.590 
battery left hover it and just see how
it<00:00:22.769> holds<00:00:23.039> up<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.640> stabilize<00:00:24.029> mode<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:24.300> won't

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
it holds up and stabilize mode I won't

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.460 
it holds up and stabilize mode I won't
dare<00:00:25.410> go<00:00:25.619> into<00:00:25.859> manual<00:00:26.130> mode<00:00:26.250> but<00:00:26.730> here<00:00:27.300> we<00:00:27.420> go

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
dare go into manual mode but here we go

00:00:27.470 --> 00:01:01.150 
dare go into manual mode but here we go
here<00:00:28.470> we<00:00:28.500> go<00:00:29.300> whoa<00:00:32.270> Oh<00:00:38.629> God

there we go and like you there I got it
stuck<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:07.980> the<00:01:08.190> tree<00:01:08.460> hey<00:01:09.120> now<00:01:12.080> so<00:01:13.080> like<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.440> said

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
stuck in the tree hey now so like I said

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.680 
stuck in the tree hey now so like I said
not<00:01:13.860> one<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.070> my<00:01:14.250> smartest<00:01:14.640> moves<00:01:17.570> check<00:01:18.570> it

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
not one of my smartest moves check it

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:26.360 
not one of my smartest moves check it
out<00:01:20.180> and<00:01:21.180> there<00:01:21.570> she<00:01:23.390> like<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.810> don't<00:01:25.620> know<00:01:25.800> 15

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
out and there she like I don't know 15

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.650 
out and there she like I don't know 15
feet<00:01:26.610> up<00:01:28.310> okay<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.729> was<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:29.880> Louie

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
feet up okay so that was just Louie

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
feet up okay so that was just Louie
idiot<00:01:31.410> move<00:01:31.650> but<00:01:32.630> everything<00:01:33.680> everything

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
idiot move but everything everything

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
looks pretty good you can see that thing

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:51.530 
looks pretty good you can see that thing
is<00:01:37.080> just<00:01:37.200> hanging<00:01:37.680> by<00:01:37.830> the<00:01:37.890> prop<00:01:50.180> try<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.240> scoop

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
is just hanging by the prop try to scoop

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.850 
is just hanging by the prop try to scoop
it<00:01:51.630> up<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:51.900> this<00:01:52.050> pull<00:01:52.290> net<00:01:52.850> so<00:01:54.500> got<00:01:55.500> her<00:01:55.530> down

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
it up in this pull net so got her down

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.040 
it up in this pull net so got her down
with<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.670> pull<00:01:56.910> net<00:01:57.200> and<00:01:58.280> looks<00:01:59.280> like<00:02:00.050> you

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
with the pull net and looks like you

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.070 
with the pull net and looks like you
just<00:02:01.110> see<00:02:01.350> if<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.500> can<00:02:01.620> get<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:01.860> thing<00:02:02.159> to

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
just see if I can get this thing to

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.070 
just see if I can get this thing to
engage

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.610 

so<00:02:11.210> electronics<00:02:12.210> are<00:02:12.360> good<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.690> totally<00:02:13.590> just

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
so electronics are good it totally just

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:22.610 
so electronics are good it totally just
looks<00:02:13.980> like<00:02:16.400> my<00:02:19.460> these<00:02:20.460> were<00:02:20.610> test<00:02:21.150> my<00:02:21.870> test<00:02:22.170> 3d

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
looks like my these were test my test 3d

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.120 
looks like my these were test my test 3d
printed<00:02:22.920> legs<00:02:23.160> I<00:02:23.660> just<00:02:24.660> lost<00:02:24.900> that<00:02:25.170> set<00:02:25.560> that

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
printed legs I just lost that set that

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.000 
printed legs I just lost that set that
was<00:02:26.250> definitely<00:02:26.370> not<00:02:26.610> my<00:02:26.850> intent<00:02:27.270> I<00:02:27.860> mean<00:02:28.860> the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
was definitely not my intent I mean the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.480 
was definitely not my intent I mean the
the<00:02:29.730> Naza<00:02:29.940> held<00:02:30.390> up<00:02:30.600> well<00:02:31.560> in<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.920> wind<00:02:32.160> it<00:02:32.370> was

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
the Naza held up well in the wind it was

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.699 
the Naza held up well in the wind it was
just<00:02:32.790> kind<00:02:33.630> of<00:02:33.690> blew<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:34.020> over<00:02:34.230> near<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.410> tree

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
just kind of blew it over near the tree

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.830 
just kind of blew it over near the tree
and<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:34.890> lost<00:02:35.160> sight<00:02:35.459> so<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:35.850> just<00:02:36.060> cut<00:02:36.270> power<00:02:36.540> and

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
and I lost sight so I just cut power and

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.910 
and I lost sight so I just cut power and
it<00:02:36.930> dropped<00:02:37.260> down<00:02:37.350> that<00:02:38.190> was<00:02:38.400> my<00:02:39.530> flight<00:02:40.530> test

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
it dropped down that was my flight test

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.860 
it dropped down that was my flight test
in<00:02:41.160> 30<00:02:41.310> mile<00:02:41.580> an<00:02:41.610> hour<00:02:41.820> winds<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.360> think<00:02:42.630> next

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
in 30 mile an hour winds I think next

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.680 
in 30 mile an hour winds I think next
time<00:02:43.160> maybe<00:02:44.160> I'll<00:02:44.340> just<00:02:44.520> fly<00:02:44.760> away<00:02:45.030> from<00:02:45.390> trees

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
time maybe I'll just fly away from trees

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.729 
time maybe I'll just fly away from trees
but<00:02:46.050> you<00:02:46.410> can<00:02:46.560> definitely<00:02:46.739> see<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:48.620> you<00:02:49.620> know

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
but you can definitely see the you know

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.190 
but you can definitely see the you know
turbulence<00:02:50.550> if<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:50.850> will<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.840> qua<00:02:52.050> was

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
turbulence if you will the qua was

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.620 
turbulence if you will the qua was
definitely<00:02:52.560> trying<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.770> keep<00:02:52.950> level<00:02:53.370> but<00:02:53.630> it

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
definitely trying to keep level but it

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.500 
definitely trying to keep level but it
just<00:02:54.870> shifted<00:02:55.260> out<00:02:55.560> of<00:02:55.770> sight<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.450> ended<00:02:57.450> up

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
just shifted out of sight and ended up

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.010 
just shifted out of sight and ended up
in<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.750> tree<00:02:58.459> so<00:02:59.570> that's<00:03:00.570> it<00:03:00.720> for<00:03:00.750> now<00:03:00.989> thanks

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
in the tree so that's it for now thanks

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.150 
in the tree so that's it for now thanks
for<00:03:01.440> watching<00:03:03.620> let's<00:03:04.620> just<00:03:04.800> show<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:04.980> guys

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
for watching let's just show you guys

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.780 
for watching let's just show you guys
what<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.610> not<00:03:05.790> that<00:03:06.030> was<00:03:06.150> up<00:03:06.300> against<00:03:07.790> we're

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
what the not that was up against we're

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.940 
what the not that was up against we're
ultimately<00:03:09.170> ended<00:03:10.170> up<00:03:10.290> in<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.470> tree<00:03:10.680> over

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
ultimately ended up in the tree over

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:29.120 
ultimately ended up in the tree over
there<00:03:25.820> pretty<00:03:26.820> crazy
