 Obama US President Barrack Obama promised 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.950
 quotes the partial lifting of sanctions in 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.200
 exchange for suspension by iran 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.880
 nuclear program amid relief 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.530
 defrost a small amount 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.230
 Iranian accounts abroad 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:22.320
 and the weakening of some trading 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:25.500
 US limited our allies and friends 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.630
 agreed to partially lift the sanctions though 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.730
 with most of them continue 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.250
 act we will not introduce new 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.590
 sanctions and give the wound the opportunity 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.879
 get some profit he 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.340
 abel sanchez was deprived in general 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.320
 the sanction system will continue to operate we 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.989
 continue to watch closely 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.120
 their execution if iran fails 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.899
 fully their obligations over 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.600
 half a year 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:57.030
 we will cancel the accepted relief and will strengthen 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.739
 pressure and so according to obama us so far 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.750
 refrain from introducing new 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.390
 restrictions because it will undermine 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.619
 the success of this agreement is known that 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.240
 congress was going to take 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.229
 additional package of sanctions but 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.640
 the president urged him not to do that 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.619
 the obama administration says what exactly 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.970
 tough measures against iran helped 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.520
 reach an agreement 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.560
 however, there is another opinion that 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.659
 sanctions between countries established 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.360
 such hostile relations that 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.460
 for many years prevented to agree and although 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.470
 interim agreement reached country 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.930
 have already come up with various 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.930
 interpretations of the main question has 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.060
 whether tehran the right to enrich uranium we 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.700
 quite his growth and still in which 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.979
 you war baby doom care and egripment 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.890
 we believe that in two places of this 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.200
 agreements or as we call it a plan 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.450
 action 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.720
 it is clearly stated that Iran will continue 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.360
 its program of uranium enrichment m 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.210
 and programs bern n 2 new and it will be 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.750
 condition of any agreement now and in 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.270
 the future on the Wendy feature even about headquarters 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.579
 let me explain this first step not 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.220
 means that Iran now has the right 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.410
 on uranium enrichment how would it be who 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.230
 interpreted it in this 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.879
 the document is not talking 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.769
 according to the non-proliferation treaty 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:18.620
 nuclear weapons 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:22.670
 uranium enrichment is prohibited and it is 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.549
 the agreement also does not give such a right n 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.010
 33 hayden obama barrack obama in his 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:30.260
 turn declared that at the tiger she should 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.629
 be access to peaceful atomic energy 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.519
 however due to past violations of his 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.069
 nuclear program must be strictly 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.019
 limited worth considering that on 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.659
 obama administration has had a strong 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.310
 congress pressure which is unlikely to become 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:45.769
 welcome whatever you are 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.569
 agreement with Iran against 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.030
 agreements were allied usa 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.099
 Israel and a number of Arab states 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.430
 Persian Gulf who do not want 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.840
 Iran to be lifted sanctions 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.150
 President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.849
 had to be very careful about 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.950
 formulations they tried to convey to 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.430
 Israel and its Persian allies 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.590
 bay 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.730
 that this agreement will contribute 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.730
 universal security
