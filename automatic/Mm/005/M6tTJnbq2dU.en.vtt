00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
amping 40 and I think one thing that i

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.910 
amping 40 and I think one thing that i
missed<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.430> show<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.670> on<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:26.970> map<00:01:27.150> was<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
missed to show you on this map was the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.609 
missed to show you on this map was the
Fox<00:01:28.920> which<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.759> show<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.060> right<00:01:30.180> now<00:01:30.240> actually

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
Fox which I show you right now actually

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.620 
Fox which I show you right now actually
not<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.220> box<00:01:32.430> if<00:01:32.670> when<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.030> moves<00:01:33.270> it's

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
not so the box if when it moves it's

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.030 
not so the box if when it moves it's
gone<00:01:33.900> forever<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.700> we<00:01:35.700> look<00:01:35.939> at<00:01:36.030> BP<00:01:36.270> station

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
gone forever and we look at BP station

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.990 
gone forever and we look at BP station
so<00:01:38.040> that's<00:01:38.250> why<00:01:38.369> there's<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:38.700> many<00:01:38.759> weapons

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
so that's why there's so many weapons

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.789 
so that's why there's so many weapons
like<00:01:39.329> on<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.540> walls<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.229> super

it's called the m3 hydro thrower I think
and<00:01:50.490> it's<00:01:50.759> like<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:50.970> super<00:01:51.390> over<00:01:52.079> powered

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
and it's like a super over powered

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.110 
and it's like a super over powered
blender<00:01:52.979> and

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
blender and

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.950 
blender and
yay<00:01:54.720> look<00:01:55.260> it's<00:01:55.410> lucky<00:01:55.820> so<00:01:56.820> yeah<00:01:57.510> a<00:01:57.630> bunch<00:01:57.840> of

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.360 
yay look it's lucky so yeah a bunch of
zombies<00:01:58.080> get<00:01:58.410> stuck<00:01:58.650> outside<00:01:58.830> the<00:01:59.070> map<00:01:59.220> also

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
zombies get stuck outside the map also

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.160 
zombies get stuck outside the map also
which<00:01:59.790> is<00:02:00.060> really<00:02:00.330> annoying<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.870> whenever

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
which is really annoying and whenever

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.070 
which is really annoying and whenever
you<00:02:01.380> kill<00:02:01.650> your<00:02:02.010> group<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.490> zombies<00:02:02.930> just<00:02:03.930> like

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
you kill your group of zombies just like

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.200 
you kill your group of zombies just like
regular<00:02:04.380> fruit<00:02:05.010> the<00:02:05.340> zombies<00:02:05.700> decide<00:02:05.940> to<00:02:06.060> come

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
regular fruit the zombies decide to come

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.630 
regular fruit the zombies decide to come
in<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:07.140> don't<00:02:07.740> think<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.040> show<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.430> because

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
in so I don't think I show that because

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.000 
in so I don't think I show that because
what<00:02:08.910> I've<00:02:09.030> been<00:02:09.180> doing<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.740> going<00:02:10.740> to<00:02:10.830> trap

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
what I've been doing is going to trap

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.490 
what I've been doing is going to trap
like<00:02:11.220> this<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:12.480> turning<00:02:12.870> on<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:13.050> other<00:02:13.200> trap

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
like this and turning on the other trap

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.600 
like this and turning on the other trap
because<00:02:13.860> they<00:02:14.040> can<00:02:14.190> come<00:02:14.370> through<00:02:14.520> the

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
because they can come through the

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.110 
because they can come through the
windows<00:02:14.850> also<00:02:15.060> you'll<00:02:16.050> see<00:02:16.260> right<00:02:16.650> now<00:02:17.120> right

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
windows also you'll see right now right

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.690 
windows also you'll see right now right
yep<00:02:18.390> there's<00:02:18.630> one<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.050> so<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:19.980> can<00:02:20.310> also<00:02:20.490> just

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
yep there's one and so you can also just

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.940 
yep there's one and so you can also just
crawl<00:02:21.630> right<00:02:21.810> out<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:21.990> this<00:02:22.200> area<00:02:22.530> where<00:02:22.860> the

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
crawl right out of this area where the

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.280 
crawl right out of this area where the
mg<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.340> but<00:02:23.580> I<00:02:23.670> like<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.850> spray<00:02:24.300> add<00:02:24.780> them<00:02:25.020> for

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
mg is but I like to spray add them for

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.400 
mg is but I like to spray add them for
no<00:02:25.380> reason<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:25.920> mean<00:02:26.400> why<00:02:27.240> not<00:02:27.450> it's<00:02:28.140> not<00:02:28.260> going

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
no reason I mean why not it's not going

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.040 
no reason I mean why not it's not going
to<00:02:28.500> hurt<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.740> zombies<00:02:29.070> because<00:02:30.050> bullets

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
to hurt the zombies because bullets

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.490 
to hurt the zombies because bullets
bullets<00:02:31.950> are<00:02:32.070> nice<00:02:32.280> of<00:02:32.940> course<00:02:33.240> and<00:02:34.170> so<00:02:34.320> you

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
bullets are nice of course and so you

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.230 
bullets are nice of course and so you
can<00:02:34.650> just<00:02:34.710> outfit<00:02:35.190> through<00:02:35.340> here<00:02:35.490> and<00:02:35.970> fall

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
can just outfit through here and fall

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.570 
can just outfit through here and fall
right<00:02:36.450> out<00:02:36.570> once<00:02:36.960> a<00:02:37.110> traps<00:02:37.350> are<00:02:37.500> done<00:02:37.620> that's

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
right out once a traps are done that's

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.820 
right out once a traps are done that's
it<00:02:38.730> could<00:02:38.850> tell<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.450> they<00:02:39.720> keep<00:02:39.930> they<00:02:40.590> just
