more<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.180> realized<00:01:09.540> putting<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.869> on<00:01:09.990> 3ds<00:01:10.350> first

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
more I realized putting it on 3ds first

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.280 
more I realized putting it on 3ds first
and<00:01:11.159> then<00:01:11.549> making<00:01:12.000> people<00:01:12.479> eager<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.990> play<00:01:13.170> it

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
and then making people eager to play it

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.160 
and then making people eager to play it
on<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.710> Wii<00:01:13.890> U<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.939> same<00:01:15.150> room<00:01:15.420> or<00:01:15.630> online
