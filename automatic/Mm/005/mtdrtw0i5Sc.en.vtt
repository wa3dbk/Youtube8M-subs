00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.140 

just<00:00:51.170> like<00:00:51.379> that<00:00:51.620> let<00:00:52.309> the<00:00:52.460> excess<00:00:52.760> drip<00:00:52.820> off

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
put it on some wax paper now I noticed

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.470 
put it on some wax paper now I noticed
once<00:00:58.100> I<00:00:58.309> put<00:00:58.489> them<00:00:58.640> on<00:00:58.730> the<00:00:58.850> wax<00:00:59.000> paper<00:00:59.210> they

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
once I put them on the wax paper they

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.939 
once I put them on the wax paper they
were<00:00:59.540> making<00:00:59.780> that<00:01:00.050> big<00:01:00.230> puddle<00:01:00.530> underneath

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
were making that big puddle underneath

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:02.500 
were making that big puddle underneath
so<00:01:01.370> what<00:01:01.550> I<00:01:01.580> did<00:01:01.760> is<00:01:01.879> I<00:01:01.940> just<00:01:02.120> picked<00:01:02.300> them<00:01:02.420> up

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
so what I did is I just picked them up

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.270 
so what I did is I just picked them up
and<00:01:02.660> move<00:01:02.870> them<00:01:02.900> to<00:01:03.410> get<00:01:03.680> rid<00:01:03.830> of<00:01:03.890> some<00:01:04.129> of<00:01:04.250> that

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
and move them to get rid of some of that

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.850 
and move them to get rid of some of that
excess<00:01:04.369> I<00:01:04.910> didn't<00:01:05.269> want<00:01:05.479> a<00:01:05.600> big<00:01:05.750> disc<00:01:06.050> kind<00:01:06.800> of

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
excess I didn't want a big disc kind of

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.320 
excess I didn't want a big disc kind of
stuck<00:01:07.100> underneath<00:01:07.340> it<00:01:07.580> one<00:01:07.700> they<00:01:07.880> hardened

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
stuck underneath it one they hardened

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.260 
stuck underneath it one they hardened
and<00:01:09.200> I<00:01:09.290> also<00:01:09.410> noticed<00:01:10.040> that<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:10.729> strawberry

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
and I also noticed that the strawberry

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.580 
and I also noticed that the strawberry
color<00:01:11.540> was<00:01:11.750> coming<00:01:12.110> through

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
color was coming through

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.670 
color was coming through
so<00:01:12.710> I<00:01:12.890> double-dip<00:01:13.610> these<00:01:14.050> just<00:01:15.050> get<00:01:15.320> a<00:01:15.350> nice

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
so I double-dip these just get a nice

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.050 
so I double-dip these just get a nice
white<00:01:16.220> color<00:01:16.250> on<00:01:16.759> them<00:01:16.990> and<00:01:18.520> then<00:01:19.520> I<00:01:19.550> pop<00:01:19.820> them

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
white color on them and then I pop them

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.120 
white color on them and then I pop them
in<00:01:20.149> the<00:01:20.240> refrigerator<00:01:20.530> just<00:01:21.530> to<00:01:21.680> let<00:01:21.830> allow

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
in the refrigerator just to let allow

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.090 
in the refrigerator just to let allow
them<00:01:22.310> to<00:01:22.399> solidify<00:01:22.640> and<00:01:23.300> I<00:01:24.050> found<00:01:24.289> it<00:01:24.590> helps<00:01:24.950> if

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
them to solidify and I found it helps if

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.340 
them to solidify and I found it helps if
you<00:01:25.220> just<00:01:25.250> scrape<00:01:25.820> the<00:01:26.119> bottom<00:01:27.020> of<00:01:27.259> the

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
you just scrape the bottom of the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.100 
you just scrape the bottom of the

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
strawberry on the edge of your bowl if

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.670 
strawberry on the edge of your bowl if
you<00:01:30.320> get<00:01:30.470> rid<00:01:30.619> of<00:01:30.649> the<00:01:30.740> excess

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.260

simply draw on a bow tie with a little
bit<00:03:00.640> more<00:03:00.820> chocolate<00:03:01.300> in<00:03:01.480> this<00:03:01.750> case<00:03:01.960> I<00:03:02.080> put<00:03:02.260> it

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
bit more chocolate in this case I put it

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.110 
bit more chocolate in this case I put it
in<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.650> blog<00:03:02.860> bag<00:03:03.100> with<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.520> corner<00:03:03.670> cut<00:03:03.970> off

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
in the blog bag with the corner cut off

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.920 
in the blog bag with the corner cut off

and then draw on some buttons and I find

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.810

that<00:03:08.080> if<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:08.680> chocolate<00:03:09.130> has<00:03:09.310> cooled<00:03:09.550> it<00:03:09.730> a

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
that if the chocolate has cooled it a

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.640 
that if the chocolate has cooled it a
little<00:03:10.030> bit<00:03:10.180> it's<00:03:10.540> easier<00:03:10.990> to<00:03:11.170> draw<00:03:11.410> the<00:03:11.470> bow

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
little bit it's easier to draw the bow

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.070 
little bit it's easier to draw the bow
tie<00:03:11.860> with<00:03:12.100> because<00:03:12.580> it's<00:03:12.820> had<00:03:12.940> a<00:03:12.970> chance<00:03:13.090> to<00:03:13.990> be
