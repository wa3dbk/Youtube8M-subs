it actually was but still being able to

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.479 
it actually was but still being able to
create<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.470> beautiful<00:01:04.890> connection<00:01:05.189> and

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
create that beautiful connection and

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.250

emotion that them that the images show
so<00:01:07.619> that's<00:01:08.280> another<00:01:08.520> skill<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.119> know<00:01:09.240> getting

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
so that's another skill you know getting

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.690 
so that's another skill you know getting
people<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.840> think<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.799> they're<00:01:11.310> not<00:01:11.400> really

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
people to think that they're not really

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.910 
people to think that they're not really
there<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:11.939> think<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.450> places<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.409> where<00:01:13.710> they

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
there and think of places of where they

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.010 
there and think of places of where they
might<00:01:13.950> want<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.580> be<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.970> feeling<00:01:15.630> things<00:01:15.840> that

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
might want to be and feeling things that

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.109 
might want to be and feeling things that
they<00:01:16.200> might<00:01:16.380> might<00:01:16.710> want<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:16.979> feel<00:01:17.189> because<00:01:17.430> as

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
they might might want to feel because as

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.580 
they might might want to feel because as
soon<00:01:18.240> as<00:01:18.360> we<00:01:18.479> take<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.780> human<00:01:18.900> mind<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.409> that

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
soon as we take the human mind to that

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.469 
soon as we take the human mind to that
place<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.189> body<00:01:20.369> believes<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.240> shows

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
place the body believes it and it shows

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.660 
place the body believes it and it shows
it<00:01:21.659> through<00:01:22.229> into<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.710> into<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.159> image<00:01:23.280> so

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
it through into the into the image so

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.399 
it through into the into the image so
that<00:01:24.090> was<00:01:24.540> probably<00:01:24.689> one<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.320> most

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
that was probably one of the most
