00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.889 

okay<00:00:04.650> doing<00:00:05.220> a<00:00:05.370> little<00:00:05.549> bit<00:00:05.730> of<00:00:05.759> testing<00:00:06.660> with

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
okay doing a little bit of testing with

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:14.240 
okay doing a little bit of testing with
a<00:00:07.370> new<00:00:08.370> waist<00:00:08.639> veggie<00:00:08.940> oil<00:00:09.120> burner<00:00:13.250> stripping

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
a new waist veggie oil burner stripping

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.930 
a new waist veggie oil burner stripping
about<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:15.680> don't<00:00:16.680> know<00:00:16.800> three<00:00:17.190> times<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.580> second

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
about I don't know three times a second

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:25.960 
about I don't know three times a second
maybe<00:00:20.000> I've<00:00:21.170> got<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:23.359> three-foot<00:00:24.359> section<00:00:24.630> of

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
maybe I've got a three-foot section of

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.900 
maybe I've got a three-foot section of
stovepipe<00:00:26.970> on<00:00:27.510> here<00:00:28.490> to<00:00:29.490> give<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.789> little

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
stovepipe on here to give it a little

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.229 
stovepipe on here to give it a little
more<00:00:30.150> rise<00:00:31.340> that<00:00:32.340> was<00:00:32.520> why<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.759> was<00:00:32.910> failing

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
more rise that was why it was failing

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.840 
more rise that was why it was failing
before<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.870> chimney<00:00:34.260> was<00:00:35.070> not<00:00:35.250> long<00:00:35.579> enough

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
before the chimney was not long enough

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.420 
before the chimney was not long enough
so<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.360> could<00:00:36.570> never<00:00:36.780> pull<00:00:37.710> enough<00:00:38.040> air<00:00:38.280> in

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
so it could never pull enough air in

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.450 
so it could never pull enough air in
through<00:00:38.640> those<00:00:38.820> holes<00:00:39.469> to<00:00:40.469> give<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.920> complete

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
through those holes to give the complete

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
through those holes to give the complete
secondary<00:00:42.079> burn<00:00:43.100> so<00:00:44.100> now<00:00:45.170> it's<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:47.390> little<00:00:48.390> bit

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
secondary burn so now it's a little bit

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.910 
secondary burn so now it's a little bit
tough<00:00:48.660> for<00:00:48.899> me<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.110> tell<00:00:49.289> because<00:00:49.469> it's<00:00:49.739> so

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
tough for me to tell because it's so

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.510 
tough for me to tell because it's so
dark<00:00:50.219> but<00:00:51.500> it<00:00:52.500> looks<00:00:52.710> pretty<00:00:52.980> darn<00:00:53.219> clean

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
dark but it looks pretty darn clean

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.130 
dark but it looks pretty darn clean
coming<00:00:53.789> off<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.030> there<00:00:54.270> now<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.449> do<00:00:54.600> have<00:00:54.899> some

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
coming off of there now I do have some

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.869 
coming off of there now I do have some
smoke<00:00:55.469> burning<00:00:55.739> off<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:56.340> piece<00:00:56.670> of

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
smoke burning off of this piece of

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.569 
smoke burning off of this piece of
stovepipe<00:00:57.149> since<00:00:57.719> it's<00:00:58.399> it's<00:00:59.399> new<00:00:59.809> but<00:01:01.579> yeah

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
stovepipe since it's it's new but yeah

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.690 
stovepipe since it's it's new but yeah
I'm<00:01:02.850> pretty<00:01:03.090> sure<00:01:03.769> this<00:01:04.769> idea<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.250> gonna<00:01:05.400> work

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
I'm pretty sure this idea is gonna work

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.090 
I'm pretty sure this idea is gonna work
now<00:01:06.420> I'd<00:01:06.630> like<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.840> try<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.380> retrofit<00:01:07.920> this

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
now I'd like to try and retrofit this

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.810 
now I'd like to try and retrofit this
tomorrow<00:01:09.560> well<00:01:10.560> probably<00:01:11.250> won't<00:01:11.670> have<00:01:11.790> time

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
tomorrow well probably won't have time

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.969 
tomorrow well probably won't have time
tomorrow<00:01:12.180> but<00:01:12.600> I'd<00:01:13.260> like<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.530> try<00:01:13.830> and

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
tomorrow but I'd like to try and

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.440 
tomorrow but I'd like to try and
retrofit<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:15.080> for<00:01:16.080> another<00:01:16.320> idea<00:01:17.270> take<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.390> a

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
retrofit this for another idea take it a

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:30.450 
retrofit this for another idea take it a
step<00:01:18.630> further<00:01:23.270> it's<00:01:24.270> very<00:01:24.570> quiet

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:39.120 

and<00:01:30.970> man<00:01:31.300> is<00:01:31.450> it<00:01:31.600> kicking<00:01:31.780> out<00:01:32.020> heat<00:01:37.980> that<00:01:38.980> is

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
and man is it kicking out heat that is

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.219 
and man is it kicking out heat that is
awesome<00:01:39.660> that's<00:01:40.660> like<00:01:40.930> totally<00:01:41.830> silent<00:01:43.229> no

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
awesome that's like totally silent no

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:52.859 
awesome that's like totally silent no
electricity<00:01:44.710> at<00:01:45.010> all<00:01:45.870> no<00:01:46.870> fans<00:01:51.360> just<00:01:52.360> really

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
electricity at all no fans just really

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:59.100 
electricity at all no fans just really
really<00:01:53.110> clean<00:01:53.550> combustion<00:01:57.810> working<00:01:58.810> on<00:01:58.960> the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
really clean combustion working on the

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.280 
really clean combustion working on the
same<00:01:59.290> principle<00:01:59.800> as<00:01:59.950> would<00:02:00.190> gas<00:02:01.290> primary

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
same principle as would gas primary

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.480 
same principle as would gas primary
combustion<00:02:02.649> in<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:02.979> bottom<00:02:03.250> chamber

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
combustion in the bottom chamber

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:11.330 
combustion in the bottom chamber
secondary<00:02:04.149> combustion<00:02:04.540> in<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:04.869> top<00:02:05.080> chamber

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.060 

very<00:02:12.340> very<00:02:12.670> simple<00:02:13.350> man<00:02:14.350> you<00:02:14.470> could<00:02:14.650> probably

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
very very simple man you could probably

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.590 
very very simple man you could probably
burn<00:02:15.450> anything<00:02:16.450> in<00:02:16.750> that<00:02:16.870> bottom<00:02:17.230> chamber

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
burn anything in that bottom chamber

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.990 
burn anything in that bottom chamber
bacon<00:02:19.600> fat<00:02:22.140> nasty<00:02:23.140> stuff<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:24.010> you'd<00:02:24.730> still

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
bacon fat nasty stuff and you'd still

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.650 
bacon fat nasty stuff and you'd still
get<00:02:25.120> a<00:02:25.180> very<00:02:25.450> very<00:02:25.720> clean<00:02:26.050> burn<00:02:26.290> off<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.680> top

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
get a very very clean burn off the top

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.000 
get a very very clean burn off the top
or<00:02:28.660> at<00:02:28.750> least<00:02:28.930> I<00:02:29.080> believe<00:02:29.380> you<00:02:29.530> would

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
or at least I believe you would

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.770 
or at least I believe you would
okay<00:02:32.370> well<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.520> test<00:02:33.820> is<00:02:34.030> definitely<00:02:34.750> a

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
okay well that test is definitely a

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.989 
okay well that test is definitely a
success
