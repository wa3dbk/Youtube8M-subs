your new batteries in now if we drop of
this<00:01:46.880> in<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.210> tank<00:01:47.390> it<00:01:47.720> should<00:01:48.049> start

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
this in the tank it should start

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.030 
this in the tank it should start
automatically<00:01:49.700> swimming<00:01:50.450> so<00:01:50.900> there<00:01:51.740> you<00:01:51.890> go

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
automatically swimming so there you go

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.760 
automatically swimming so there you go
you<00:01:52.100> can<00:01:52.340> see<00:01:52.369> the<00:01:52.580> tail<00:01:53.119> is<00:01:53.810> flicking

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
you can see the tail is flicking

you can see the tail is flicking
straight<00:01:55.400> away<00:01:56.060> if<00:01:56.960> we<00:01:57.229> flip<00:01:57.830> this<00:01:58.070> to<00:01:58.310> the

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
straight away if we flip this to the

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.969 
straight away if we flip this to the
front<00:01:58.670> we<00:01:59.420> might<00:01:59.689> see<00:01:59.960> a<00:02:00.259> little<00:02:00.530> better

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
front we might see a little better

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.850 
front we might see a little better
it<00:02:01.100> does<00:02:01.250> have<00:02:01.460> different<00:02:01.909> speeds<00:02:02.470> that<00:02:03.470> is

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
it does have different speeds that is

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.139 
it does have different speeds that is
the<00:02:04.340> rapid<00:02:05.330> itself<00:02:05.869> flick<00:02:06.680> you<00:02:07.280> can<00:02:07.610> see<00:02:07.820> doing

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
the rapid itself flick you can see doing

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.990 
the rapid itself flick you can see doing
now<00:02:08.269> and<00:02:08.450> then<00:02:08.569> it<00:02:08.659> does<00:02:08.840> have<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:09.229> slower

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
now and then it does have the slower

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.920 
now and then it does have the slower
tail<00:02:11.000> flick<00:02:11.810> as<00:02:12.099> well<00:02:13.099> but<00:02:14.000> you<00:02:14.420> will<00:02:14.689> have<00:02:14.870> to

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
tail flick as well but you will have to

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.539 
tail flick as well but you will have to
follow<00:02:15.200> it<00:02:15.439> round<00:02:15.680> there<00:02:15.829> you<00:02:15.920> can<00:02:16.099> see<00:02:16.310> let's

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
follow it round there you can see let's
