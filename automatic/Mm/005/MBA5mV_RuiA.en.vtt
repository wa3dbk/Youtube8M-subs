00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:54.069 

is<00:00:27.980> that<00:00:51.880> so<00:00:52.880> all<00:00:53.120> the<00:00:53.300> straight<00:00:53.570> line<00:00:53.780> that<00:00:53.930> is

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
is that so all the straight line that is

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.900 
is that so all the straight line that is
just<00:00:54.260> something<00:00:54.500> like<00:00:54.860> that<00:00:55.160> they<00:00:55.760> move

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
just something like that they move

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.420 
just something like that they move
straight<00:00:56.239> but<00:00:56.690> they're<00:00:56.840> not<00:00:56.930> straight<00:00:57.230> and<00:00:57.559> as

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
straight but they're not straight and as

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.830 
straight but they're not straight and as
we<00:00:58.579> get<00:00:58.730> the<00:00:58.940> straight<00:00:59.180> line<00:00:59.329> method<00:00:59.360> that<00:00:59.750> I

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
we get the straight line method that I

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.780 
we get the straight line method that I
said<00:01:00.110> that<00:01:00.590> become<00:01:00.829> a<00:01:00.860> little<00:01:01.040> more<00:01:01.130> deadly

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
said that become a little more deadly

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:08.880 
said that become a little more deadly
but<00:01:01.969> if<00:01:02.059> they<00:01:02.210> could<00:01:02.270> be<00:01:02.570> deadly

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.790 

so<00:01:09.890> we<00:01:10.040> always<00:01:10.759> work<00:01:11.180> in<00:01:11.540> the<00:01:12.140> most<00:01:12.380> common

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
so we always work in the most common

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:32.400 
so we always work in the most common
type<00:01:13.100> of<00:01:13.130> Street<00:01:13.550> attacks<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.570> first<00:01:22.030> punches

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.260 

the<00:01:33.410> next<00:01:33.650> most<00:01:33.830> common<00:01:33.950> type<00:01:34.430> of<00:01:34.460> attack<00:01:34.670> is

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
the next most common type of attack is

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:53.110 
the next most common type of attack is
just<00:01:49.870> so<00:01:50.870> we<00:01:51.200> have<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:51.440> eyes<00:01:51.970> never<00:01:52.970> that's

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
just so we have the eyes never that's

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.970 
just so we have the eyes never that's
the<00:01:53.390> rule<00:01:53.600> is<00:01:53.840> if<00:01:54.140> you<00:01:54.320> could<00:01:54.440> touch<00:01:54.590> someone

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
the rule is if you could touch someone

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.850 
the rule is if you could touch someone
once<00:01:55.250> when<00:01:55.730> I<00:01:55.760> give<00:01:55.970> you<00:01:56.120> ten<00:01:56.300> times<00:01:56.570> so<00:01:57.500> never

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
once when I give you ten times so never

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:25.690 
once when I give you ten times so never
just<00:01:58.070> pies<00:02:23.560> now<00:02:24.560> that<00:02:24.740> thing<00:02:24.920> I<00:02:25.010> did<00:02:25.130> then<00:02:25.430> you

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
just pies now that thing I did then you

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:38.650 
just pies now that thing I did then you
may<00:02:25.850> have<00:02:26.000> seen<00:02:26.300> it<00:02:26.480> slowly<00:02:27.260> now<00:02:33.790> that's<00:02:37.660> so

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
may have seen it slowly now that's so

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.780 
may have seen it slowly now that's so
this<00:02:38.840> time<00:02:39.140> we're<00:02:39.590> taking<00:02:39.770> in<00:02:40.160> he's<00:02:40.400> come<00:02:40.640> in

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
this time we're taking in he's come in

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.410 
this time we're taking in he's come in
two<00:02:40.970> hands

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.230 

see<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:46.220> wood<00:02:46.370> left<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:46.670> these<00:02:46.819> I<00:02:46.940> have<00:02:47.120> to

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
see the wood left to these I have to

00:02:47.240 --> 00:03:15.550 
see the wood left to these I have to
think<00:02:47.450> about<00:02:49.180> doing<00:02:50.180> this<00:02:51.430> just<00:02:52.430> about<00:03:14.560> that

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
think about doing this just about that

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.470 
think about doing this just about that
way

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.170 

now<00:03:18.900> we<00:03:19.680> see<00:03:19.830> five<00:03:20.220> genes<00:03:20.489> shaking<00:03:20.940> of<00:03:21.060> the

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
now we see five genes shaking of the

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:49.630 
now we see five genes shaking of the
body

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:04:29.750 

let's<00:03:50.640> just<00:03:50.790> get<00:03:50.910> down

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.790 

after<00:04:30.240> a<00:04:30.270> few<00:04:30.480> hours<00:04:30.540> it<00:04:31.440> shouldn't<00:04:31.710> even

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
after a few hours it shouldn't even

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:50.120 
after a few hours it shouldn't even
touch<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:48.140> okay<00:04:49.140> just<00:04:49.650> get<00:04:49.800> the<00:04:49.890> chocolate

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
touch the okay just get the chocolate

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.080 
touch the okay just get the chocolate
the<00:04:50.520> most<00:04:51.080> important
