00:00:00.203 --> 00:00:02.746
Lebron met with many teams like the Nets, Bulls, New York and Cavs

00:00:03.256 --> 00:00:06.522
They had lunch and dinner right here, here, and here...

00:00:07.127 --> 00:00:10.620
Lebron was happy with their presentations, especially with the CAVS.

00:00:11.365 --> 00:00:14.035
We'll just have to wait about his final decision in about 10 seconds...

00:00:16.604 --> 00:00:20.235
So I guess, The King is Staying....

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:27.734
Sir...bad news   ;(

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:32.149
Lebron decided to go to another team...

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.176
Lebron will be playing for Miami...

00:00:49.206 --> 00:00:57.300
Those who have Lebron James Jerseys...burn...them...now...

00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:14.247
WHAT THE HELL?!  LEBRON TO MIAMI?!!!

00:01:15.452 --> 00:01:19.576
I thought you told me, the Cavs had the edge?!!!

00:01:21.822 --> 00:01:24.078
you must be kidding me!!!

00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:27.565
PLEASE tell me it's a joke!

00:01:27.565 --> 00:01:30.002
I can't believe how desperate the KING...kong is!

00:01:30.228 --> 00:01:36.318
I KNOW HE's GOOD, but he will never dethrone the LAKERS!!! MARK MY WORDS!

00:01:36.318 --> 00:01:38.613
But boss, you are talking about BOSH-WADE-JAMES in one team...

00:01:38.613 --> 00:01:41.758
I KNOW WHAT I'M Talking about you piece of SH*T!

00:01:41.758 --> 00:01:43.841
But boss, they can beat the Lakers!

00:01:43.841 --> 00:01:47.273
How dare you say that?! Are you MAD?!!!

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:49.185
Look at the NUMBERS!

00:01:50.851 --> 00:01:58.492
When Phil wins a championship, it always ends with a three peat!!! There's 1 more!

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:02.811
When Phil wins game 1 of the series, he'll end up winning the whole series!

00:02:03.332 --> 00:02:07.974
And remember, he has a record of 48-0!  The Celtics were the latest victim!

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.934
WE STILL HAVE KOBE BRYANT!!!

00:02:11.606 --> 00:02:15.836
KOBE IS THE REAL KING COZ ONLY KINGS HAVE RINGS!!!

00:02:19.961 --> 00:02:23.284
He broke Cleveland's hearts...

00:02:23.284 --> 00:02:25.453
tore them to pieces...

00:02:25.453 --> 00:02:27.463
But we'll do Cleveland a BIG FAVOR!

00:02:27.775 --> 00:02:30.567
We won't allow LEBRON to get a RING!

00:02:34.427 --> 00:02:35.931
The Lakers will do that!!!

00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:40.568
THE LAKERS WILL BREAK LEBRON's HEART in RETURN...BECAUSE THEY WILL BEAT HIM!

00:02:41.706 --> 00:02:46.207
There's no way that PHIL is going to retire without his fourth three peat! 

00:02:46.682 --> 00:02:49.030
Or Kobe not tying MJ with Six RINGS!

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.063
The LAKERS are the TEAM TO BEAT, and I ADMIT THAT MIAMI IS ALREADY A THREAT!

00:02:56.548 --> 00:02:59.641
Don't worry, I'm sure Kobe Byrant is going to do something...

00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:08.983
but I'm still confident...

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.400
The Lakers aren't going to lose...

00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:18.530
You...

00:03:23.051 --> 00:03:25.208
tell Kobe to get his rest

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.985
tell Pau to go to the weight room this early, and Artest to practice shooting consistently....

00:03:36.985 --> 00:03:39.181
we also need DEREK FISHER!!!

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.820
We're going to beat LEBRON...
