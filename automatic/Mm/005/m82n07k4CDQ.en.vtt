00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.040 
pressure mining tire pressure monitoring
systems<00:05:06.700> so<00:05:07.210> everything<00:05:07.630> that<00:05:07.660> you<00:05:07.810> could

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
systems so everything that you could

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.159 
systems so everything that you could
pretty<00:05:08.470> much<00:05:08.590> expect<00:05:09.360> within<00:05:10.360> the<00:05:10.570> vehicle<00:05:10.990> it

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
pretty much expect within the vehicle it

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:12.810 
pretty much expect within the vehicle it
can<00:05:11.350> display<00:05:11.650> which<00:05:12.010> is<00:05:12.130> pretty<00:05:12.310> neat<00:05:12.550> and

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
can display which is pretty neat and

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
can display which is pretty neat and
then<00:05:13.720> we<00:05:13.960> also<00:05:14.139> have<00:05:14.440> the<00:05:14.789> radio<00:05:15.840> tuning

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
then we also have the radio tuning

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.870 
then we also have the radio tuning
system<00:05:17.350> right<00:05:17.440> here<00:05:17.620> it's<00:05:17.770> all<00:05:17.919> controlled<00:05:18.370> by

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
system right here it's all controlled by

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.659 
system right here it's all controlled by
this<00:05:18.940> dial<00:05:19.450> right<00:05:19.780> here<00:05:19.840> in<00:05:20.110> the<00:05:20.229> middle<00:05:20.560> so<00:05:21.460> we

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
this dial right here in the middle so we

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:23.010 
this dial right here in the middle so we

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
have all of our radio presets right

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.400 
have all of our radio presets right
there

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
there
