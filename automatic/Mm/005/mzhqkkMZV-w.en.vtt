see<00:02:07.929> in<00:02:08.050> terms<00:02:08.229> of<00:02:08.440> thickness<00:02:08.740> obviously<00:02:09.700> the

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
see in terms of thickness obviously the

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.619 
see in terms of thickness obviously the
old<00:02:09.940> one<00:02:10.119> is<00:02:10.240> massively<00:02:10.869> thicker<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:13.480> can

old one is massively thicker and you can

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.899 
old one is massively thicker and you can
see<00:02:13.900> that<00:02:14.170> actually<00:02:14.349> if<00:02:14.709> you<00:02:14.799> place<00:02:15.099> them<00:02:15.370> one

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:15.909 
see that actually if you place them one

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:17.850 
see that actually if you place them one
on<00:02:16.090> top<00:02:16.269> of<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.569> other<00:02:16.720> like<00:02:16.900> this

on top of the other like this

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.710 
on top of the other like this
you<00:02:18.220> actually<00:02:18.580> see<00:02:18.910> that<00:02:18.940> they're<00:02:19.360> roughly

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
you actually see that they're roughly

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.000 
you actually see that they're roughly
about<00:02:19.960> the<00:02:20.140> same<00:02:22.290> roughly<00:02:23.290> about<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.620> same

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
comfortably now because it's got a

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.150 
comfortably now because it's got a
three-and-a-half<00:03:06.910> millimeter<00:03:07.510> jack<00:03:07.900> I<00:03:08.170> can
