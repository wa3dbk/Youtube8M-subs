 base 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.669
 fixer clearcoat here is such a 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:27.079

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.690
 coating overlaps nogotochki 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:42.540
 base coat 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:45.150
 This is the first step because the basic 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.700
 the coating protects our nails from 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:51.720
 withering bright shades chapter to 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.690
 from yellowing the nail plate when i 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:58.020
 covered the base blocked the end zone 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:02.670
 I'll wait for the beads to take well 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:06.720
 neon blue varnish is very saturated 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:10.950
 beautiful shade just baldin and start 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.720
 overlap the nails the first layer I'm 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.340
 I cover here with the finest 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.090
 translucent ie first words have 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.310
 we should not be like the main fat 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.820
 overlap zone that we had 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.720
 quickly not tears later 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.210
 that zone of us has been protected now 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.140
 wait for the first layer to dry well 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:42.390
 varnish i put a second coat of varnish 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:45.510
 2 sulak we already go as the main 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.460
 gives brightness to the color of our density 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.910
 manicure I'll wait 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.970

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.610

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:14.459
 getting down to design she goes on sticky 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:17.300
