we've got the hub off the axle is ready

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.829 
we've got the hub off the axle is ready
to<00:01:03.040> be<00:01:03.190> pulled<00:01:03.489> out<00:01:03.610> you<00:01:04.269> can't<00:01:04.479> really<00:01:04.509> pull

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
to be pulled out you can't really pull

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.660 
to be pulled out you can't really pull
it<00:01:04.960> out<00:01:05.079> because<00:01:05.259> it<00:01:05.530> has<00:01:05.680> some<00:01:05.890> give<00:01:06.130> you<00:01:06.579> have

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
it out because it has some give you have

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.190 
it out because it has some give you have
to<00:01:06.790> get<00:01:06.909> underneath<00:01:07.299> the<00:01:07.479> car<00:01:07.689> and<00:01:07.899> you<00:01:08.170> have

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
to get underneath the car and you have

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.249 
to get underneath the car and you have
to<00:01:08.350> use<00:01:08.679> a<00:01:08.950> little<00:01:09.249> pry<00:01:09.579> bar<00:01:10.270> it's<00:01:11.020> kind<00:01:11.229> of

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
to use a little pry bar it's kind of

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:12.899 
to use a little pry bar it's kind of
hard<00:01:11.409> because<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:11.799> shoulder<00:01:12.219> of<00:01:12.310> the<00:01:12.340> axle<00:01:12.819> is

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
hard because the shoulder of the axle is

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.010 
hard because the shoulder of the axle is
rounded<00:01:13.329> so<00:01:14.280> get<00:01:15.280> in<00:01:15.399> there<00:01:15.579> and<00:01:16.020> leverage

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
rounded so get in there and leverage

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.410 
rounded so get in there and leverage
against<00:01:17.469> the<00:01:17.789> transmission<00:01:18.789> where<00:01:18.969> the<00:01:19.060> axle

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
against the transmission where the axle

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
smooth very easy here we're going to

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.059 
smooth very easy here we're going to
stab<00:01:36.399> the<00:01:36.729> axle<00:01:37.569> through<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:38.139> hub<00:01:38.409> hole<00:01:38.770> and

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:39.069 
stab the axle through the hub hole and

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:41.760 
stab the axle through the hub hole and
put<00:01:39.759> the<00:01:39.880> nut<00:01:40.029> on<00:01:40.060> it's<00:01:41.020> helpful<00:01:41.439> to<00:01:41.560> have<00:01:41.649> two

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
put the nut on it's helpful to have two
