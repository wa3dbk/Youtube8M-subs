00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
then you just use this class and you get

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.170 
then you just use this class and you get
to<00:03:59.850> watch<00:04:00.000> it<00:04:00.060> just<00:04:00.660> decide<00:04:00.960> from<00:04:01.080> there<00:04:01.140> um

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
plane I never actually try hard unless

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.840 
plane I never actually try hard unless
it's<00:04:07.650> actually<00:04:07.950> a<00:04:07.980> trihard<00:04:08.400> team<00:04:08.610> under<00:04:08.820> the

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
the plane and that's it and I never get

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.600 
the plane and that's it and I never get
I<00:04:19.170> actually<00:04:19.470> never<00:04:19.799> hit<00:04:20.040> a<00:04:20.070> game<00:04:20.340> winning<00:04:20.520> kill

off the plane and I get on there almost

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.470 
off the plane and I get on there almost
every<00:04:22.740> single<00:04:22.890> time<00:04:23.160> I<00:04:23.190> hate<00:04:23.460> terminal<00:04:23.880> it's

every single time I hate terminal it's

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.500 
every single time I hate terminal it's
ridiculous<00:04:24.960> right<00:04:25.400> but<00:04:26.400> anyways<00:04:26.790> that's
