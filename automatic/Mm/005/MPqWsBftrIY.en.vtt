you<00:00:23.460> can<00:00:23.580> almost<00:00:23.730> get<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.359> power<00:00:24.570> steering

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
you can almost get to the power steering

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.290 
you can almost get to the power steering
lines<00:00:25.170> but<00:00:25.529> for<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:26.279> couple<00:00:26.609> extra<00:00:26.699> minutes<00:00:27.210> of

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
lines but for a couple extra minutes of

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.929 
lines but for a couple extra minutes of
work<00:00:27.740> they'll<00:00:28.740> just<00:00:28.920> have<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.310> much<00:00:29.429> more<00:00:29.699> room

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
work they'll just have so much more room

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.160 
work they'll just have so much more room
to<00:00:29.970> work<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.510> it's<00:00:30.660> going<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.810> make<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.990> lot

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
to work so it's going to make a lot

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.120 
to work so it's going to make a lot
better<00:00:32.239> with<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.270> couple<00:00:33.690> minutes<00:00:33.840> work<00:00:34.320> you

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
better with a couple minutes work you

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.600 
better with a couple minutes work you
can<00:00:35.280> get<00:00:35.550> out<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.790> lines<00:00:36.000> nice<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.600> easy<00:00:36.840> so

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
can get out the lines nice and easy so

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.780 
can get out the lines nice and easy so
that'll<00:00:38.610> make<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.969> lot<00:00:39.149> easier<00:00:39.180> for<00:00:39.629> working

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
that'll make it a lot easier for working

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.049 
that'll make it a lot easier for working
so<00:00:41.790> here's<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.210> line<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.809> there's<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:44.010> fan<00:00:44.700> I

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
so here's the line and there's the fan I

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.880 
so here's the line and there's the fan I
can't<00:00:45.600> even<00:00:45.660> get<00:00:45.840> my<00:00:45.930> finger<00:00:46.260> between<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.710> two

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
can't even get my finger between the two

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.490 
can't even get my finger between the two
of<00:00:47.039> them<00:00:47.190> that's<00:00:47.789> how<00:00:47.940> tight<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.570> an<00:00:48.930> operation

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
of them that's how tight of an operation

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.680 
of them that's how tight of an operation
this<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.760> so<00:00:50.760> that's<00:00:50.879> kind<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.239> poor<00:00:51.480> design

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
this is so that's kind of a poor design

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.250 
this is so that's kind of a poor design
on<00:00:52.050> GM<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:53.430> have<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.820> power<00:00:54.449> steering<00:00:54.750> line<00:00:54.989> so

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
on GM to have the power steering line so

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.400 
on GM to have the power steering line so
close<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.860> fan<00:00:56.360> but<00:00:57.360> anyways<00:01:00.140> the<00:01:01.140> fan

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
close to the fan but anyways the fan

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.950 
close to the fan but anyways the fan
bowled<00:01:02.219> 6<00:01:02.699> months<00:01:02.940> prior<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.840> was

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
bowled 6 months prior to this it was

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.820 
bowled 6 months prior to this it was
replaced<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:06.020> yeah<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.350> know<00:01:07.530> if<00:01:07.680> you're

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
and then the nut the non-pressure side

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.570 
and then the nut the non-pressure side
he<00:04:20.699> goes<00:04:20.820> from<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.060> rack<00:04:21.889> back<00:04:22.889> to<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.190> cooler

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
he goes from the rack back to the cooler

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.400 
he goes from the rack back to the cooler
and<00:04:24.120> that<00:04:24.270> was<00:04:24.389> actually<00:04:24.600> the<00:04:24.810> line<00:04:25.020> that<00:04:25.259> was

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
and that was actually the line that was

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.719 
and that was actually the line that was
leaking<00:04:26.509> so<00:04:27.509> it's<00:04:27.750> one<00:04:27.900> of<00:04:27.960> those<00:04:28.050> things<00:04:28.729> but

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.600 
steering lines I did it turn it all the
way<00:04:54.960> to<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.169> right<00:04:55.320> and<00:04:56.070> then<00:04:56.190> all<00:04:56.340> the<00:04:56.430> way<00:04:56.550> to

the full lock left with it out writing

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.400 
the full lock left with it out writing
that<00:05:00.330> was<00:05:00.449> kind<00:05:00.600> of<00:05:00.660> nice<00:05:00.810> you<00:05:00.990> can<00:05:01.110> hear<00:05:01.260> the

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
that was kind of nice you can hear the

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.900 
that was kind of nice you can hear the

power steering fluid work its way down

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.810 
power steering fluid work its way down
from<00:05:03.449> the<00:05:03.600> pump<00:05:04.260> into<00:05:05.070> the<00:05:05.100> lines<00:05:05.400> but

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
from the pump into the lines but

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.490 
from the pump into the lines but
eventually<00:05:06.030> we'll<00:05:06.419> have<00:05:06.449> to<00:05:06.720> start<00:05:06.990> it<00:05:07.110> up<00:05:07.229> I

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
eventually we'll have to start it up I

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.159 
eventually we'll have to start it up I
heard<00:05:08.130> of<00:05:08.280> a<00:05:08.340> story<00:05:08.580> from<00:05:08.699> mechanic<00:05:09.300> saying

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
heard of a story from mechanic saying

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.370 
heard of a story from mechanic saying
some<00:05:11.070> dealership<00:05:11.460> guy<00:05:11.930> would<00:05:12.930> reach<00:05:13.110> through

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
some dealership guy would reach through

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.070 
some dealership guy would reach through
the<00:05:13.470> window<00:05:13.800> and<00:05:14.479> then<00:05:15.479> you'd<00:05:15.599> fire<00:05:15.840> it<00:05:15.960> up

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
the window and then you'd fire it up

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.129 
the window and then you'd fire it up
well<00:05:17.009> he<00:05:17.430> had<00:05:17.520> the<00:05:17.639> line<00:05:17.820> switched<00:05:18.240> and<00:05:18.479> then

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
well he had the line switched and then

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:20.990 
well he had the line switched and then
it<00:05:19.229> took<00:05:19.349> full<00:05:19.590> lock<00:05:19.860> right<00:05:20.160> because<00:05:20.849> the

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
it took full lock right because the

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.790 
it took full lock right because the
pressure<00:05:21.210> wanted<00:05:21.570> to<00:05:21.630> go<00:05:21.720> somewhere<00:05:22.199> and<00:05:22.380> the

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
pressure wanted to go somewhere and the

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.240 
pressure wanted to go somewhere and the
guy<00:05:22.919> broke<00:05:23.250> his<00:05:23.400> wrist<00:05:23.610> so<00:05:24.830> that's<00:05:25.830> easily<00:05:25.979> can

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
guy broke his wrist so that's easily can

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.680 
guy broke his wrist so that's easily can
be<00:05:26.280> happened<00:05:26.729> that's<00:05:27.120> a<00:05:27.270> little<00:05:27.449> thing<00:05:27.599> to

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
be happened that's a little thing to

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.350 
be happened that's a little thing to
watch<00:05:27.870> out<00:05:28.110> for<00:05:28.370> the<00:05:29.370> Trailblazers<00:05:30.090> it's

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
watch out for the Trailblazers it's

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.070 
watch out for the Trailblazers it's
really<00:05:30.660> hard<00:05:30.900> to<00:05:31.110> switch<00:05:31.349> the<00:05:31.590> lines<00:05:31.800> but<00:05:33.080> it's

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
really hard to switch the lines but it's

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.589 
really hard to switch the lines but it's
possible<00:05:34.620> definitely<00:05:35.159> possible<00:05:35.460> they<00:05:36.449> have<00:05:36.570> a

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:36.599 
possible definitely possible they have a

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:38.990 
possible definitely possible they have a
little<00:05:36.780> tab<00:05:37.110> and<00:05:37.949> on<00:05:38.190> one<00:05:38.430> side<00:05:38.460> of<00:05:38.669> the<00:05:38.789> tab

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
little tab and on one side of the tab

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.520 
little tab and on one side of the tab
they<00:05:39.210> have<00:05:39.330> the<00:05:39.419> pressure<00:05:39.659> line<00:05:39.930> come<00:05:40.139> out<00:05:40.320> and

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
they have the pressure line come out and

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.460 
they have the pressure line come out and
he's<00:05:41.159> welded<00:05:41.669> and<00:05:41.849> then<00:05:42.389> the<00:05:42.630> other<00:05:42.810> side<00:05:43.110> is<00:05:43.169> a

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
he's welded and then the other side is a

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.350 
he's welded and then the other side is a
non<00:05:43.740> pressure<00:05:44.039> line<00:05:44.340> and<00:05:44.580> you<00:05:44.940> got<00:05:45.060> to<00:05:45.150> slide

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
non pressure line and you got to slide

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.500 
non pressure line and you got to slide
the<00:05:45.690> non<00:05:46.050> pressure<00:05:46.380> line<00:05:46.650> in<00:05:47.010> to<00:05:47.699> that<00:05:47.820> tab<00:05:48.180> and

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
the non pressure line in to that tab and

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.270 
the non pressure line in to that tab and
then<00:05:48.960> put<00:05:49.260> it<00:05:49.349> into<00:05:49.590> the<00:05:49.680> back<00:05:49.830> of<00:05:49.860> the<00:05:50.070> rack

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
then put it into the back of the rack

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.260 
then put it into the back of the rack
and<00:05:50.550> then<00:05:51.030> put<00:05:51.270> a<00:05:51.300> bolt<00:05:52.310> so<00:05:53.310> it's<00:05:53.460> really<00:05:53.940> not

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
and then put a bolt so it's really not

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.700 
and then put a bolt so it's really not
an<00:05:54.840> easy<00:05:55.110> fun<00:05:55.710> job<00:05:56.039> to<00:05:56.520> do<00:05:57.380> but<00:05:58.380> you<00:05:58.560> know<00:05:58.680> I

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380 
half a dozen lines for the power so

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.590 
half a dozen lines for the power so
that's<00:06:46.470> a<00:06:46.620> lot<00:06:46.800> of<00:06:47.010> you<00:06:47.760> know<00:06:47.790> moving<00:06:48.390> lines

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:48.600 
that's a lot of you know moving lines

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.270 
that's a lot of you know moving lines
and<00:06:48.840> stuff<00:06:48.960> out<00:06:49.110> of<00:06:49.140> the<00:06:49.290> way<00:06:49.440> that<00:06:49.740> probably

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.280 
and stuff out of the way that probably

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.640 
and stuff out of the way that probably
another<00:06:50.550> hour<00:06:50.790> or<00:06:50.820> two<00:06:51.150> or<00:06:51.330> Thor<00:06:51.510> work<00:06:51.690> but<00:06:52.560> you

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
another hour or two or Thor work but you

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.260 
another hour or two or Thor work but you
know<00:06:52.740> there's<00:06:52.950> no<00:06:53.040> harm<00:06:53.310> going<00:06:53.550> on<00:06:53.640> top<00:06:53.910> and

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:54.270 
know there's no harm going on top and

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.090 
know there's no harm going on top and
then<00:06:54.750> I<00:06:54.780> just<00:06:55.020> zip<00:06:55.230> strip<00:06:55.470> them<00:06:55.620> down<00:06:55.650> so

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:56.100 
then I just zip strip them down so

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.100 
then I just zip strip them down so
you're<00:06:56.250> just<00:06:56.310> not<00:06:56.400> going<00:06:56.580> to<00:06:56.640> go<00:06:56.790> anywhere

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 
you're just not going to go anywhere

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.050 
you're just not going to go anywhere
yeah<00:06:58.110> it's<00:06:58.410> a<00:06:58.500> little<00:06:58.650> bit<00:06:58.950> you<00:06:59.670> know<00:06:59.760> rough

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.060 
yeah it's a little bit you know rough

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:04.100 
yeah it's a little bit you know rough
but<00:07:00.860> it's<00:07:01.860> not<00:07:02.390> it's<00:07:03.390> not<00:07:03.510> like<00:07:03.690> this<00:07:03.810> vehicle

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.110 
but it's not it's not like this vehicle

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:05.540 
but it's not it's not like this vehicle
is<00:07:04.170> gonna<00:07:04.230> be<00:07:04.380> on<00:07:04.470> the<00:07:04.530> road<00:07:04.650> for<00:07:04.680> 10<00:07:05.220> 20<00:07:05.460> years

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:05.550 
is gonna be on the road for 10 20 years

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.130 
is gonna be on the road for 10 20 years
it's<00:07:05.970> just<00:07:06.120> gonna<00:07:06.210> be<00:07:06.360> on<00:07:06.450> the<00:07:06.540> road<00:07:06.690> for<00:07:06.720> two

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:07.140 
it's just gonna be on the road for two

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.840 
it's just gonna be on the road for two
or<00:07:07.470> three<00:07:07.710> and<00:07:07.890> then<00:07:07.980> that<00:07:08.310> would<00:07:08.430> be<00:07:08.460> probably

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:08.850 
or three and then that would be probably

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.150 
or three and then that would be probably
yet<00:07:09.120> because<00:07:09.660> it<00:07:09.750> does<00:07:09.930> have<00:07:10.140> about<00:07:10.380> 260

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.160 
yet because it does have about 260

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.780 
yet because it does have about 260
thousand<00:07:12.060> on<00:07:12.150> it<00:07:12.360> so<00:07:12.570> you<00:07:13.260> can't<00:07:13.470> expect<00:07:13.890> it's

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:14.790 
thousand on it so you can't expect it's

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.580 
thousand on it so you can't expect it's
gonna<00:07:14.910> go<00:07:15.180> six<00:07:15.660> seven<00:07:15.930> hundred<00:07:16.020> thousand

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:16.590 
gonna go six seven hundred thousand

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.760 
gonna go six seven hundred thousand
