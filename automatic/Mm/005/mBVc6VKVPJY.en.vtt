00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
and a half inch handle um let's try the

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.970 
and a half inch handle um let's try the
metric<00:03:41.790> it<00:03:41.970> looks<00:03:42.269> to<00:03:42.480> me<00:03:42.600> like<00:03:42.630> it's<00:03:42.989> nine<00:03:43.709> and

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
metric it looks to me like it's nine and

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.910 
metric it looks to me like it's nine and
a<00:03:44.010> half<00:03:44.040> centimeters<00:03:44.580> on<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.150> blade<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:45.920> the

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
a half centimeters on the blade and the

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.580 
a half centimeters on the blade and the
strong<00:03:47.400> ten<00:03:48.000> centimeters<00:03:48.750> on<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.250> handle

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
strong ten centimeters on the handle

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.479 
strong ten centimeters on the handle
let's<00:03:52.590> look<00:03:52.769> at<00:03:52.830> the<00:03:52.950> centering<00:03:53.840> lock<00:03:54.840> back

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
let's look at the centering lock back

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.390 
let's look at the centering lock back
there<00:03:56.489> is<00:03:56.670> no<00:03:56.850> half<00:03:57.090> stop<00:03:57.590> there<00:03:58.590> is<00:03:58.769> no<00:03:59.070> half

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
there is no half stop there is no half

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.580 
there is no half stop there is no half
stop<00:03:59.730> I<00:04:00.060> like<00:04:00.570> half<00:04:00.810> steps<00:04:01.110> they<00:04:01.290> give<00:04:01.470> you

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
stop I like half steps they give you

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.970 
stop I like half steps they give you
somewhat<00:04:02.550> of<00:04:02.850> a<00:04:03.480> safety<00:04:03.959> thing<00:04:04.260> so<00:04:04.560> it<00:04:04.650> doesn't

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
somewhat of a safety thing so it doesn't

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.740 
somewhat of a safety thing so it doesn't
close<00:04:05.580> on<00:04:05.850> your<00:04:05.970> hands<00:04:06.180> not<00:04:06.390> a<00:04:06.450> lot<00:04:06.720> of

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
close on your hands not a lot of

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.990 
close on your hands not a lot of
protection<00:04:06.989> but<00:04:07.440> something<00:04:07.920> let's<00:04:08.640> check<00:04:08.850> out

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
protection but something let's check out

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.040 
protection but something let's check out
the<00:04:09.150> centering

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.050 

that's<00:04:13.050> looking<00:04:13.290> pretty<00:04:13.410> good<00:04:13.709> to<00:04:14.070> me<00:04:14.280> it's

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
that's looking pretty good to me it's

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.810 
that's looking pretty good to me it's
not<00:04:15.180> a<00:04:15.239> thousand<00:04:15.870> percent<00:04:16.169> perfect<00:04:16.669> but<00:04:17.669> it's

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
not a thousand percent perfect but it's

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.760 
not a thousand percent perfect but it's
down<00:04:18.120> good<00:04:18.540> and<00:04:21.140> I'm<00:04:22.140> wondering<00:04:22.350> if<00:04:22.560> there's

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
down good and I'm wondering if there's

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.310 
down good and I'm wondering if there's
some<00:04:22.979> sort<00:04:23.250> of<00:04:23.370> oil<00:04:24.210> or<00:04:24.630> something<00:04:24.870> I<00:04:25.110> can<00:04:25.289> put

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
some sort of oil or something I can put

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.920 
some sort of oil or something I can put
on<00:04:25.590> this<00:04:25.740> very<00:04:26.039> dry<00:04:26.370> wood<00:04:26.640> that's

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
on this very dry wood that's

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.420 
on this very dry wood that's
anything<00:04:27.139> that's<00:04:27.320> disturbing<00:04:27.650> me<00:04:27.949> about<00:04:28.220> it

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
anything that's disturbing me about it

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.610 
anything that's disturbing me about it
because<00:04:29.300> wood<00:04:29.539> that's<00:04:29.720> dry<00:04:29.990> like<00:04:30.229> this<00:04:30.380> will

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
because wood that's dry like this will

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.159 
because wood that's dry like this will
stain<00:04:31.009> if<00:04:31.759> you<00:04:31.820> put<00:04:32.060> your<00:04:32.210> coffee<00:04:32.419> cup<00:04:32.780> on<00:04:32.930> it

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
stain if you put your coffee cup on it

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.960 
stain if you put your coffee cup on it
ha<00:04:33.470> ha<00:04:33.710> or<00:04:34.130> something<00:04:35.120> like<00:04:35.270> that<00:04:36.729> all<00:04:37.729> right<00:04:37.910> I
