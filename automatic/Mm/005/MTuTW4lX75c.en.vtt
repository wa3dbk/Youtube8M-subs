00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:07.620
 aa guys back and commit 5 now one 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.929
 absolute beginner video wrb this 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.929
 here I'm going to teach and how to install a 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.320
 snoring back up how to do ipp 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.480
 then for those who have doubts there it is well 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.820
 simple here you can install everything 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.390
 here you will make your web apps 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.760
 here you back up you restore 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.640
 fix the problem here you mount a 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.080
 usb device in the external area and 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.530
 show later 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.140
 Here you configure the wfp and here you 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.920
 start the system the other disconnects the cell phone 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.449
 although the first thing has to do 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.579
 something backing up would not be in 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:50.249
 backup the partitions ai system data ash 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.519
 bold and effective 

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:58.289
 I'll explain later what the latter 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:01:01.440
 but then you can check this option here 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.699
 it skips the md5 file it generates if 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.739
 you back up 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.939
 This is here to check after you 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.079
 is restored 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:15.360
 if the file is between that bar and it 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:23.719
 will back up the fs and mobile mail 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:23.719
 so sometimes losing is you connecting 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:33.500
 a cell signal problem 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:33.500
 usually file was damaged then 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.490
 if you're okay with that 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.619
 if you are restoring the system is not 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.500
 need to check the option I'll show 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.390
 then how to restore it by remembering that it is 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.939
 It is always important to back up as 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:53.280
 post anything you end up with 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:55.350
 and return to the home screen. 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.649
 after you back up you come here 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.649
 ipp 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.210
 - you backup and then it will clean 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:12.520
 these conditions 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:15.400
 the new day care center has a date and that 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.860
 You're not going to mark this story alone. 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.770
 You were called directly via usb. 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:29.950
 you can mark the turn no internal 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:32.140
 that leaves everything will come back 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.980
 if you were to upgrade then 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.750
 you come up with 11 and then you want to be in the 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.530
 then you will only do it. 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.080
 that cash system and cash the date and the eternal 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.160
 story of you will not clean and 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.269
 updates with the new ro to excited 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.660
 after that 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:59.820
 now you can install on the page 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.820
 in my case at the root of the system is the 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.459
 work more things 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:14.610
 you can add up to ten files 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:16.540
 install at the same time with pepsi 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.579
 remembering that this procedure is the same 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:34.060
 to any file that you are 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:37.470
 there anything like that 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.470
 these three options 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:55.150
 then start the boat and then take the boat in the 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.680
 clothes if installed in case come back here 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.350
 to start or show now as 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:04.000
 restore from backup I did loop 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:07.810
 ahem're just came in store will go 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.300
 to the backups you have made 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.890
 so I come here at the mercato I did 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.390
 my passions 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:18.239
 as I do not have a problem in the signal 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:21.700
 I'm going to uncheck the fs here 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:24.370
 restore only the system on then if you 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.930
 Do you have any signal problems? 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.100
 lose and mail do not see this 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:33.520
 condition to go which is not my case here 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.560
 hence it is just pulling the bar it will restore 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.620
 a backup cofins at the beginning of the video 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.050
 remembering that this parent pk will vary the 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.150
 the longer the backup 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.500
 Time will take to burst because 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.530
 I have not installed anything 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:51.040
 The whole 87-year denial system will only be 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.810
 faster did not generate much delay 23 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.360
 minutes depending on the account of things me 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.330
 called and you can have multiple backups 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.110
 there and several how different then you 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:05.730
 may be switching between one and 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.730
 You expect him to cry everything. 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:17.229
 I always clean each part are neither the 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:20.090
 you do not have to wipe 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:23.120
 cry a backup with it still determines the 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.870
 option to start the season when I return to 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.970
 home screen was showing things 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:32.889
 so basically you have that option 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.889
 install the clean option 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:06:19.250
 cap schedule and Brazil was at the most 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:22.750
 same thing as with the agreement 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:27.260
 maximum can reduce the intensity of 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:30.050
 Today's advanced system permission has 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:33.490
 a file manager there and has a 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:43.159
 load direct files 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:53.449
 this is it remembering that it installs itself and 

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:57.190
 some problem you can enter the 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:07:03.580
 room where you can go for a system 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:03.580
 and in the case of eleven 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:11.270
 and remembering that any file that 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:13.460
 you have to install via recovery is 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:15.620
 always this same procedure then 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.690
 You pick up the file until the point is 

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:20.389
 to form lippi points 

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:24.830
 you play in the internal memory sit there 

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:28.850
 backs up eps and then you 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:31.780
 installs the zipped file show and 

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:33.830
 It's the same for buying or wrapping something. 

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.600
 remembering that not everything is needed 

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.590
 make haiti will depend on what you 

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.419
 is there 

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.669
 so whenever some tutorial speaks 

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:42.860
 do wipe you already know what it is 

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:45.440
 If you do not speak then you do not need only 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:47.930
 direct and leave for you have tanned 

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:53.020
 the video comes back with more nex videos 

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:53.020
 5 and even she said people
