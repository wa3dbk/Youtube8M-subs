take me like a few kind of games to get
one<00:02:55.720> but<00:02:56.290> this<00:02:56.500> game<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:56.890> only<00:02:57.010> really<00:02:57.430> had<00:02:57.519> one

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
one but this game I only really had one

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.250 
one but this game I only really had one
chance<00:02:58.000> because<00:02:58.269> we<00:02:58.480> weren't<00:02:58.659> really<00:02:59.019> going

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
chance because we weren't really going

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.800 
chance because we weren't really going
to<00:02:59.349> let<00:02:59.470> them<00:02:59.560> get<00:02:59.739> 65<00:03:00.280> kills<00:03:00.579> on<00:03:00.700> us<00:03:00.790> again<00:03:00.970> not

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
to let them get 65 kills on us again not

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.390 
to let them get 65 kills on us again not
that<00:03:01.930> we<00:03:02.019> really<00:03:02.319> care<00:03:02.560> about<00:03:02.620> our<00:03:03.040> kill<00:03:03.250> death

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
that we really care about our kill death

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.240 
that we really care about our kill death
ratio<00:03:03.519> but<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:05.530> know<00:03:05.590> it's<00:03:05.739> not<00:03:05.859> something

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
ratio but you know it's not something

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.039 
ratio but you know it's not something
that<00:03:06.400> you<00:03:06.519> exactly<00:03:06.940> enjoy<00:03:07.120> doing<00:03:07.629> although<00:03:07.959> it

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
that's one thing I often struggle to do

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.199 
that's one thing I often struggle to do
I<00:04:16.750> kind<00:04:17.410> of<00:04:17.530> quickly<00:04:17.889> get<00:04:18.280> into<00:04:18.459> my<00:04:18.760> blackboard

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
I kind of quickly get into my blackboard

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.449

as<00:04:19.299> you<00:04:19.419> saw<00:04:19.599> back<00:04:19.840> then<00:04:20.140> but<00:04:20.769> then<00:04:20.979> it<00:04:21.250> takes

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
as you saw back then but then it takes

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:22.780 
as you saw back then but then it takes
me

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
me

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.230 
me

was<00:04:29.030> just<00:04:29.120> really<00:04:29.750> struggling<00:04:30.050> with<00:04:30.230> the

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
was just really struggling with the

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.680 
was just really struggling with the
silent<00:04:30.980> death<00:04:31.160> and<00:04:31.370> beyond<00:04:31.610> such<00:04:31.820> a<00:04:31.850> huge<00:04:32.330> map

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
silent death and beyond such a huge map

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.280 
silent death and beyond such a huge map
was<00:04:33.560> a<00:04:33.590> really<00:04:33.980> bad<00:04:34.190> operational<00:04:35.120> choice<00:04:35.420> just

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
was a really bad operational choice just

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.470 
was a really bad operational choice just
absolutely<00:04:37.130> blasting<00:04:37.850> that<00:04:38.000> guy<00:04:38.150> in<00:04:38.210> till<00:04:38.420> he

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
absolutely blasting that guy in till he

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.050 
absolutely blasting that guy in till he
died<00:04:38.720> and<00:04:39.050> then<00:04:39.620> come<00:04:40.460> for<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:40.640> tactical

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
died and then come for the tactical

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.820 
died and then come for the tactical
flank<00:04:41.330> here<00:04:41.570> because<00:04:41.840> you<00:04:41.930> never<00:04:42.290> really<00:04:42.680> want

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
flank here because you never really want

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.520 
flank here because you never really want
to<00:04:42.920> run<00:04:43.100> down<00:04:43.310> that<00:04:43.340> hill<00:04:43.760> on<00:04:44.000> array<00:04:44.530> unless

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
to run down that hill on array unless

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.160 
to run down that hill on array unless
you're<00:04:46.130> confident<00:04:46.700> that's<00:04:46.910> known<00:04:47.060> around<00:04:47.240> but

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
you're confident that's known around but

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.020 
you're confident that's known around but
a<00:04:48.200> great<00:04:48.650> way<00:04:48.830> to<00:04:48.890> go<00:04:49.130> it's<00:04:49.250> just<00:04:49.400> always<00:04:49.580> too

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
a great way to go it's just always too

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.690 
a great way to go it's just always too
well<00:04:50.710> if<00:04:51.710> I<00:04:51.830> could<00:04:52.010> ever<00:04:52.130> get<00:04:52.310> around<00:04:52.460> to<00:04:52.610> it

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
well if I could ever get around to it

of<00:05:12.800> the<00:05:12.920> Rings<00:05:13.480> then<00:05:14.480> we'll<00:05:14.810> try<00:05:15.110> and<00:05:15.290> take<00:05:15.680> it

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
of the Rings then we'll try and take it

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.620 
of the Rings then we'll try and take it
to<00:05:15.890> the<00:05:16.010> next<00:05:16.160> level<00:05:16.370> team<00:05:17.000> come<00:05:17.210> back<00:05:17.420> from

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
to the next level team come back from

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.400 
to the next level team come back from
seven<00:05:18.050> thousand<00:05:18.560> and<00:05:18.800> then<00:05:20.110> 7400<00:05:21.110> so<00:05:21.230> that's

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
seven thousand and then 7400 so that's

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.770 
seven thousand and then 7400 so that's
basically<00:05:21.590> team<00:05:22.190> flawless<00:05:22.790> except<00:05:23.600> we<00:05:23.660> have

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
basically team flawless except we have

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.420 
basically team flawless except we have
to<00:05:23.900> let<00:05:24.020> them<00:05:24.170> get<00:05:24.290> seventy<00:05:24.650> four<00:05:24.830> kills<00:05:25.100> first

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
to let them get seventy four kills first

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.030 
to let them get seventy four kills first
that<00:05:26.120> would<00:05:26.270> be<00:05:26.450> the<00:05:26.570> most<00:05:26.750> epic<00:05:27.020> comeback<00:05:27.620> in

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
that would be the most epic comeback in

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.760 
that would be the most epic comeback in
the<00:05:28.070> history<00:05:28.190> of<00:05:28.880> ecology<00:05:29.510> I<00:05:29.780> reckon<00:05:30.170> but

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
the history of ecology I reckon but

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.080 
the history of ecology I reckon but
anyway<00:05:31.990> I'll<00:05:32.990> let<00:05:33.230> you<00:05:33.290> know<00:05:33.410> if<00:05:33.800> we<00:05:33.860> are<00:05:34.790> going
