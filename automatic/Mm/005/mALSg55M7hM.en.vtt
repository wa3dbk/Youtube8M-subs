this<00:00:02.490> is<00:00:02.669> my<00:00:03.710> fpv<00:00:07.639> receiver<00:00:08.639> setup

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:09.830 
this is my fpv receiver setup

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:16.460 
this is my fpv receiver setup
I've<00:00:10.830> got<00:00:13.190> 25.8<00:00:14.330> 500<00:00:15.330> milliwatts<00:00:15.570> receivers

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
I've got 25.8 500 milliwatts receivers

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.310 
I've got 25.8 500 milliwatts receivers
one<00:00:17.070> here<00:00:17.340> one<00:00:17.789> there<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.840> battery<00:00:19.230> to

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
one here one there and a battery to

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.370 
one here one there and a battery to
power<00:00:19.350> one<00:00:20.310> for<00:00:20.550> each<00:00:20.609> kind<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.840> redundancy

power one for each kind of a redundancy

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.220 
power one for each kind of a redundancy
for<00:00:22.769> right<00:00:22.890> now<00:00:23.300> this<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.510> just<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.840> temporary

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
for right now this is just a temporary

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.019 
for right now this is just a temporary
setup<00:00:25.760> until<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:26.789> get<00:00:27.090> my<00:00:27.269> Eagle<00:00:27.810> t3<00:00:28.320> tracker

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
setup until I get my Eagle t3 tracker

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.150 
setup until I get my Eagle t3 tracker
and<00:00:30.029> then<00:00:30.179> it'll<00:00:30.449> be<00:00:30.599> probably<00:00:31.470> my<00:00:31.710> final

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
and then it'll be probably my final

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.389 
and then it'll be probably my final
version<00:00:33.260> anyways<00:00:34.260> from<00:00:34.500> here<00:00:35.010> if<00:00:35.280> we<00:00:35.340> go<00:00:35.640> down

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
version anyways from here if we go down

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:46.790 
version anyways from here if we go down

diversity the tracking telemetry it's

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.800 
diversity the tracking telemetry it's
got<00:01:01.620> two<00:01:01.829> videos<00:01:02.280> in<00:01:03.229> one<00:01:04.229> on<00:01:04.379> each<00:01:04.559> side<00:01:04.589> here

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
got two videos in one on each side here

got two videos in one on each side here
the<00:01:06.810> diversity<00:01:07.290> picks<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:09.090> best<00:01:09.390> signal<00:01:09.960> and

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
the diversity picks the best signal and

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.830 
the diversity picks the best signal and
sends<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.250> out<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.700> four<00:01:12.920> AV<00:01:13.920> outs<00:01:14.630> one<00:01:15.630> is

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
sends it out to the four AV outs one is

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.399 
sends it out to the four AV outs one is
to<00:01:16.200> my<00:01:16.700> DVR<00:01:17.700> recorder<00:01:18.509> which<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.080> on<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.320> other

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
to my DVR recorder which is on the other

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.999 
to my DVR recorder which is on the other
side<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.520> other<00:01:20.720> two<00:01:21.799> sometimes<00:01:22.799> use<00:01:22.979> a

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
side and the other two sometimes use a

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.760 
side and the other two sometimes use a
monitor<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.850> sometimes<00:01:24.810> use<00:01:24.990> goggles<00:01:25.560> just

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
monitor and sometimes use goggles just

depends<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.490> mood<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:28.049> still<00:01:28.380> have<00:01:28.560> a

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
depends on the mood and I still have a

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
depends on the mood and I still have a
an<00:01:29.220> extra<00:01:29.729> set<00:01:30.150> up<00:01:30.299> here<00:01:30.860> so<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.009> requires<00:01:32.490> a

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
an extra set up here so it requires a

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.910 
an extra set up here so it requires a
battery<00:01:33.180> too<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:33.720> I'm<00:01:33.840> running<00:01:34.470> three

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
battery too so I'm running three

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.050 
battery too so I'm running three
batteries<00:01:35.340> right<00:01:35.579> now<00:01:35.820> which<00:01:36.619> I<00:01:37.670> might<00:01:38.670> switch

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
batteries right now which I might switch

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.840 
batteries right now which I might switch
to<00:01:39.329> one<00:01:39.570> larger<00:01:40.290> battery<00:01:40.650> but<00:01:40.890> right<00:01:41.400> now<00:01:41.610> this

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
to one larger battery but right now this

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.850 
to one larger battery but right now this
is<00:01:42.060> working<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.689> think<00:01:42.840> I'll<00:01:43.140> just<00:01:43.170> leave<00:01:43.740> it

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
is working so I think I'll just leave it

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:51.190 
is working so I think I'll just leave it
alone<00:01:44.329> on<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.509> leg<00:01:46.729> is<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:48.000> 12<00:01:48.810> DB<00:01:49.770> I

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
alone on the leg is that 12 DB I

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.630 
alone on the leg is that 12 DB I
directional<00:01:52.200> antenna<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:52.920> just<00:01:53.189> point<00:01:53.490> it

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
directional antenna so I just point it

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.430 
directional antenna so I just point it
and

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
and

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.110 
and
in<00:01:54.800> the<00:01:54.920> direction<00:01:55.130> where<00:01:55.520> I'm<00:01:55.670> going<00:01:55.850> to<00:01:55.940> go

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
in the direction where I'm going to go

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.030 
in the direction where I'm going to go
and<00:01:56.360> and<00:01:57.310> let<00:01:58.310> it<00:01:58.430> do<00:01:58.550> its<00:01:58.730> thing<00:01:59.890> when<00:02:00.890> I<00:02:00.920> get

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
and and let it do its thing when I get

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.660 
and and let it do its thing when I get
the<00:02:01.400> ego<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.420> track<00:02:02.780> or<00:02:03.080> I'll<00:02:03.290> be<00:02:04.190> mounting

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
the ego to track or I'll be mounting

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.380 
the ego to track or I'll be mounting
this<00:02:05.980> so<00:02:06.980> it's<00:02:07.160> actually<00:02:07.370> swiveling<00:02:08.090> around

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
this so it's actually swiveling around

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.920 
this so it's actually swiveling around
and<00:02:08.600> tracking<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.260> air<00:02:09.410> plate<00:02:10.150> for<00:02:11.150> longer

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
and tracking the air plate for longer

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.550 
and tracking the air plate for longer
distances<00:02:12.590> and<00:02:12.830> stuff<00:02:13.130> like<00:02:13.280> that<00:02:14.560> it's

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
distances and stuff like that it's

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.330 
distances and stuff like that it's
pretty<00:02:15.830> light<00:02:16.100> and<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:17.090> legs<00:02:17.330> fold<00:02:17.630> up<00:02:18.340> that

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
pretty light and the legs fold up that

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.560 
pretty light and the legs fold up that
probably<00:02:19.730> goes<00:02:19.910> up<00:02:20.180> another<00:02:22.210> or<00:02:23.210> at<00:02:23.360> least

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
probably goes up another or at least

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:31.290 
probably goes up another or at least
another<00:02:23.840> two<00:02:24.140> feet<00:02:26.050> up<00:02:27.050> to<00:02:27.380> eye<00:02:28.030> level<00:02:29.030> anyways

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
another two feet up to eye level anyways

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.460 
another two feet up to eye level anyways
so<00:02:32.300> this<00:02:33.290> is<00:02:33.500> what<00:02:33.710> I'm<00:02:33.830> using<00:02:34.100> right<00:02:34.430> now<00:02:34.460> I

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
so this is what I'm using right now I

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.680 
so this is what I'm using right now I
thought<00:02:36.470> I'd<00:02:36.650> just<00:02:36.860> make<00:02:37.160> a<00:02:37.190> little<00:02:37.460> clip<00:02:37.820> let

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
thought I'd just make a little clip let

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.560 
thought I'd just make a little clip let
everybody<00:02:38.930> see<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:41.230> that's<00:02:42.230> it
