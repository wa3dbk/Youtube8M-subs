00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.100
 and the subject of today and the Fiocruz sport 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.690
 and to talk about this important accessory but we are here 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.009
 thanks so mobile 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:18.160
 in the 80's with the launch of cars toulouse the sports filters 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.380
 started to make a success 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.830
 its function is the same as the original filters ie suck the air 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:29.210
 to throw it into the engine. 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.900
 retaining the impurities 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.690
 restricting the passage of air 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.320
 but there are details of the installation that need to be respected 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.710
 The first step the person has to report would be to remove it 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.640
 original fairing 'where the vehicle's own original filter is installed 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.040
 from there 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.400
 each driver who will determine the site installation process 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.330
 sporty 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.470
 can be a simple adaptation next to the black box with the original of the 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.470
 vehicle or through the installation of a 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.580
 when the person should carry the sports filter in an area closer to 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.330
 front air intake of the vehicle 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.490
 and why it is important to lose that frontal capture of the vehicle 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.140
 basically the mixture occurring inside the combustion chamber 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.680
 is made by mixing air with the fuel of the vehicle 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.840
 from the moment you provide a greater intake of cold air 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.930
 this mix I will be more enriched 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.930
 rather than when it is done by the traditional system 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.850
 that is, the closer the sports filter has 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.850
 front of the vehicle by picking up cooler air 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.360
 the greater the probability of this mixture becoming richer thus generating one with a 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.140
 little more energy 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.140
 the award automatically improving its performance 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.420
 the purpose of replacing the common filter 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.630
 for the sports filter the engine power tool 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:14.640
 prepared and used in the original vehicles. 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.649
 competition even in periods of low power 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:24.989
 most popular vehicles if fabio carbone's team takes shelter 

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:29.099
 in the case of the adaptation to the chief executive 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.069
 but they do not quite like it said 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.880
 just remove the black box instead 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.509
 from air travel 

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:38.690
 you are there 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.149
 the flu discussed 

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:44.159
 now that you already know 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.349
 one of the sports objectives 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:47.629
 do not waste time 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.260
 arsenal is the automobile to install your
