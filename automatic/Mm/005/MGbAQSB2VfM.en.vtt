00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.140
 hello hello one more package is the same 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.810
 two pairs of metal continuation hours 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.180
 help here plastic they were too 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.960
 on deals two pairs I bought for 5 on 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.449
 device how are they here I rate 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.800
 strange frankly 408 grams 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:39.510
 Well, let's see how it will go by mail 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.260
 again our mail is very cool for 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:47.390
 Completed inspect 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:52.670
 we will get to freeze we will be folding 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.670
 so what is our watch 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:59.160
 from one 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.980
 don't add it yourself this thing on 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.189
 Something they apparently did not reach in this thing 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:10.590
 electronic clock means 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:15.979
 Here is such a plan that we have here 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.789
 so there is 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:23.610
 actually should be the day of the week 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:27.860
 probably or what is it that day 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.569
 the week is just there 67 it turns out closed 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.149
 here 

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:36.509
 Mode of the day that is what that before lunch 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:41.600
 first is after dinner here we go 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:45.209
 the hours and the month here are the minutes and the day 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:49.380
 the setting here is very amber I tell you this 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:51.590
 all show a video review of the data clock then 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.899
 there is a rather interesting position guys 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:58.619
 know what's interesting here 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:02.579
 such a thing is in my opinion not now or 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:05.039
 where is she want to show in my 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.429
 brightness here you see yes foursome 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.769
 what is the brightness here that is 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.239
 This is very cool and even a sensor. 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.609
 when on / off 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.620
 hours that is, after what period 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:21.000
 time that is very cool at the very 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.320
 In fact, here he is a sucker, I see you all this 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.220
 show in more detail 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.720
 harm then you yourself visually at all in all 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.739
 make sure first let's put 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.650
 watch this platform means when 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:38.640
 let's say the clock itself they go metal 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:43.260
 on top of the glass is a protective film 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:46.370
 that on the little glasses that the bag itself was behind 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:50.099
 this silicone is two such 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:53.760
 The pouch holder's world is quite long 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:56.030
 and with a metal clasp and naturally 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.040
 in this inspection how they look on hand 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.019
 from the multicolored in the picture were still 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.370
 I ordered dark blue now for more 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:07.590
 dark blue dark stupid happened that it 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.379
 so lighter so here they are 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.090
 look on hand 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:14.430
 I will say right away that I noticed this 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.459
 the platform itself is very tough now 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.159
 I'll explain what I mean and narrow 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:23.189
 thin hand they will be ugly 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:26.400
 look to anticipate and that's how she is 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:28.109
 bends and do not give more income here 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.659
 Imagine what the diameter of the hand should 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:35.659
 be here such watch 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:35.659
 these let's go to the second part to 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:54.510
 Print I ordered a white color amount 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:58.069
 back in a bag like this 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.069
 parts aha 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:06.370
 she's all going why only creepy very 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:09.610
 you have to press these guys very hard 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:12.610
 we have two buttons for beauty 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.430
 setting also grandfather clock 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:18.310
 there is a defense tidy why kruglik 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.570
 true ' small screen behind there is nothing 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.280
 again the watches themselves in metal 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.350
 glass 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.020
 in my glass judging by the weight seems to me 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.810
 all the same it will be nothing glass for the day 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:35.130
 and the strap is also written silicone and 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:38.380
 so wide bezel see yes that is 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:41.280
 identical to the diameter of the hand should 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:46.960
 to be big the hand should be big . 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:48.910
 let's see how many here's how 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.830
 they can look a little tighter 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.850
 I will press 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:56.919
 Well, in short, a very wide look and 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:02.110
 networks so more beautifully fit those 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:05.320
 but not very well shining bright bright cool 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:08.800
 I like the guys like that 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:12.190
 another package wrapper who liked 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.560
 put the likes on these parts I will do 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.680
 separate review on setting everything for now 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.680
 until
