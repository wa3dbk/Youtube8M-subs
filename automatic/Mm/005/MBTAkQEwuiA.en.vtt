00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.830
 good today I'm in management for 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.700
 explain another level 10 deck I'm going to 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:13.130
 explain the blue warlock I will say that the 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.930
 decks of this deck is made with 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.460
 letters that they give us if we raise the sorcerer 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.050
 bull gamma at level 10 that the truth that 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.310
 it gets pretty fast when in the 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.960
 they practiced against the machines 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.300
 especially against the sorcerer who is very 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.760
 rigid this deck is going to have very little 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.470
 control is saved because we roll letters 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.119
 with skill of the sorcerer 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.250
 this is a way to make the sorcerer 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.140
 basic the other way would be more type 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.660
 magician with more control and with more bugs 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.100
 big but this is zoo type like I've 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.230
 said before that it comes down 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.880
 lots of little bugs and kill 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.130
 before dying the games with this 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.500
 type of decks are very fast in 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.989
 followed it is decided if you are killed or killed 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.090
 you change very little because you do not have much 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.489
 to change and control like that 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.350
 says we have only four letters in the 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.000
 shuffle aside from here I leave you in the 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.160
 description of the video a link to the 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.440
 shuffle also and now I'm going to put a 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.390
 heading trying to explain a bit how 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.850
 use it although in the end to learn 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.889
 well it 's playing with it a bit 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.330
 modify it to our liking and with letters 

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:12.490
 basic the truth is that it is 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.490
 complicated, better cards are needed 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.840
 good in the whole second game for 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:23.250
 try it against surrounds again 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.440
 only the cattle by the hairs 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.670
 and it has become very long it is not going to 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.100
 no control left by hand I want 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.070
 said to lower it from start then I 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.660
 can kill many bugs with the gun 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.740
 has the offshoots that is a bug less 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.740
 normally with this deck 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.159
 to see how this plays 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.750
 before he has not wanted to upload 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.080
 because he has not done a great 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.080
 wonder 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.619
 well do not lower bug person you do not 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:51.619
 I will burn to accumulate 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.650
 alarm 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.730
 Well the next turn will be used 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.280
 to kill mail the white 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.080
 as I said I burn here I already have 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.860
 to kill or big if I get something 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.860
 big at the beginning 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.599
 rafa 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.110
 thank goodness I'm proud void has done 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.110
 two damage 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.840
 does not do anything else for that have you 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.840
 save the coin part 12 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.790
 Well, spend your soul with this or 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.570
 the archer did not keep it for me 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.570
 do more damage after 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.710
 well I said I do not have much more 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.710
 life of what that gives you so 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.310
 I will burn because one of the year 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.959
 do not look 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.959
 Well, I can download the down 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:08.299
 and voodoo or to heal me a little 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.310
 although the ideal would be these letters 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.480
 of cures spend with big bugs 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.769
 to heal the big bugs but 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.680
 I do not have a big bug here 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:20.859
 same I say in another type of deck in 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.859
 this deck of 'enough already' on each one 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:27.060
 I do not think that exact bug is anything 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.060
 ceviche be guard 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.600
 I know it has a pirate in hand 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:37.000
 so much that the damage is added 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.000
 Well, I was going to the artillery 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.319
 I have to make the asteroid be like 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.209
 be 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.209
 work the both the load 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.770
 that you do, I'll be with you 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.830
 town like that kills me 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.680
 how does he do it 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.730
 can be another enough if they have it not 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.620
 This is 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.909
 It is going cargo harder 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.909
 ride you do not have it vision 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.579
 here is the pirate who will use it in the 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.579
 load 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:20.280
 those who do not have a while have 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.280
 plus three use the load surfing air 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.780
 I do not know bigger payment software 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.780
 we want another load 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:32.120
 to the charge 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.120
 and I will eat 3 damage 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.590
 treats gems ine 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.200
 to gaitÃ¡n 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:58.080
 + 4 now 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.080
 that is done after manu dust 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.699
 Well, I do not eat a little more damage 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.699
 think 

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:08.019
 this I will lower 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.460
 with this I sure have to do it 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:12.460
 if so 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.190
 do not ride 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.560
 I will lower the load I will search for 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:23.289
 I have the scarf removed the burden of 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.419
 chan that makes us steal 10 million 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.870
 letters to videos or if I already knew that 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.870
 I was going to go that 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.820
 the next turn can lower the bear 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.960
 snort the 32 so he does not kill me from 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.960
 enough was some nonsense 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:44.280
 that's going to hurt 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:49.520
 I know beforehand I can burn him 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:52.290
 minus 338 perfect under the or outside other 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.870
 and here it is right in the essence of the 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:57.300
 low I have many bugs as you see 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:01.020
 they are not bad they are not brown beasts 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:03.650
 but good and the next turn they killed me 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:07.040
 we put that kill me bread 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:09.430
 will eat at least 3 3 10 damage 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.919
 will be 3 drop a couple more bugs 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:15.310
 because I killed 2 more unless I go 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:15.310
 chest 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.279
 goodbye date 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:29.440
 we have won the horde of bugs what 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:31.060
 win everything, I hope you know that way 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.060
 a little bit what are the decks of zoo 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:37.199
 in the deck you like serve you and inside 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.199
 of a while more until then
