00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
two doggies after being hit and so I got

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.999 
two doggies after being hit and so I got
the<00:01:55.790> higher<00:01:56.000> in<00:01:56.509> attack<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:57.500> here<00:01:57.800> I'm<00:01:57.979> showing

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
the higher in attack so here I'm showing

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.730 
the higher in attack so here I'm showing
you<00:01:58.610> how<00:01:59.030> much<00:01:59.330> you<00:01:59.540> can<00:01:59.780> get<00:02:00.050> on<00:02:00.200> your<00:02:00.410> attack

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
you how much you can get on your attack

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.120 
you how much you can get on your attack
and<00:02:01.310> it's<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:02.000> first<00:02:02.270> hit<00:02:02.540> only<00:02:03.050> but<00:02:03.619> you<00:02:03.650> can

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
and it's the first hit only but you can

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.730 
and it's the first hit only but you can
add<00:02:04.340> quite<00:02:04.610> a<00:02:04.640> lot<00:02:04.940> so<00:02:05.330> when<00:02:05.540> I<00:02:05.570> did<00:02:05.869> six<00:02:06.200> dodges

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
add quite a lot so when I did six dodges

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.070 
add quite a lot so when I did six dodges
it<00:02:06.979> goes<00:02:07.280> up<00:02:07.520> to<00:02:07.700> three<00:02:08.030> nine<00:02:08.300> three<00:02:08.330> six

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
it goes up to three nine three six

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.250 
it goes up to three nine three six
attack<00:02:09.590> and<00:02:10.070> here<00:02:10.820> I'm<00:02:11.030> doing<00:02:11.239> seven<00:02:11.780> doggies

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
attack and here I'm doing seven doggies

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.840 
attack and here I'm doing seven doggies
and<00:02:12.709> that<00:02:13.160> ends<00:02:13.400> up<00:02:13.610> being<00:02:15.100> 1311<00:02:16.100> so<00:02:16.640> that's

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
and that ends up being 1311 so that's

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.010 
and that ends up being 1311 so that's
quite<00:02:17.180> a<00:02:17.239> change<00:02:17.630> from<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:19.510> 1,696<00:02:20.510> that<00:02:20.870> I

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
quite a change from the 1,696 that I

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.740 
quite a change from the 1,696 that I
start<00:02:21.410> with<00:02:21.620> and<00:02:22.610> so<00:02:22.640> you<00:02:23.000> can<00:02:23.270> see<00:02:23.480> that

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
start with and so you can see that

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.430 
start with and so you can see that
breach<00:02:24.080> dodged<00:02:24.500> your<00:02:25.030> action<00:02:26.030> you<00:02:26.630> add<00:02:26.930> an

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
breach dodged your action you add an

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.729
