00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
welcome back settling here what I've

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.230 
welcome back settling here what I've
built<00:00:02.939> today<00:00:03.179> is<00:00:03.830> another<00:00:04.830> portal<00:00:05.250> that<00:00:05.940> looks

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
built today is another portal that looks

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.610 
built today is another portal that looks
like<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.480> normal<00:00:06.600> nether<00:00:06.960> portal<00:00:07.259> and<00:00:07.350> behaves

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
like a normal nether portal and behaves

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.830 
like a normal nether portal and behaves
like<00:00:07.710> a<00:00:07.830> normal<00:00:07.950> one<00:00:08.280> but<00:00:08.630> it<00:00:09.630> actually

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
like a normal one but it actually

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.320 
like a normal one but it actually
doesn't<00:00:10.620> teleport<00:00:11.099> you<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.309> nether<00:00:11.490> it

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
doesn't teleport you to the nether it

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.509 
doesn't teleport you to the nether it
just<00:00:12.540> teleports<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.530> another<00:00:13.710> portal<00:00:14.340> in

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
just teleports you to another portal in

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.919 
just teleports you to another portal in
the<00:00:14.610> overworld<00:00:15.000> so<00:00:15.299> we<00:00:15.389> could<00:00:15.509> see<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.809> red

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
the overworld so we could see the red

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.150 
the overworld so we could see the red
portal<00:00:16.320> over<00:00:16.410> there<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:16.890> came<00:00:17.130> from

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
portal over there that it came from

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.640 
portal over there that it came from
here's<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.150> blue<00:00:18.300> portal<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.869> can<00:00:19.199> go<00:00:19.320> back<00:00:19.560> and

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
here's the blue portal I can go back and

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.580 
here's the blue portal I can go back and
works<00:00:22.650> just<00:00:22.859> like<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:23.010> normal<00:00:23.070> portal<00:00:24.529> you<00:00:25.529> know

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
works just like a normal portal you know

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.070 
works just like a normal portal you know
I<00:00:25.650> can<00:00:25.859> go<00:00:26.039> in<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.699> if<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.240> want<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.599> cancel<00:00:27.750> out

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
I can go in and if I want to cancel out

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.299 
I can go in and if I want to cancel out
I<00:00:28.260> can<00:00:28.769> just<00:00:28.890> back<00:00:29.039> out<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:30.740> of<00:00:31.740> course<00:00:32.009> what's

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
I can just back out and of course what's

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.830 
I can just back out and of course what's
actually<00:00:32.489> going<00:00:32.759> on<00:00:32.940> behind<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.300> scenes<00:00:33.540> is

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
actually going on behind the scenes is

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.110 
actually going on behind the scenes is
there's<00:00:34.559> some<00:00:35.160> command<00:00:35.460> blocks<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.880> want<00:00:36.059> to

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
there's some command blocks I want to

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.450 
there's some command blocks I want to
explain<00:00:36.450> how<00:00:36.660> all<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.140> done<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.559> it's<00:00:38.370> a

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
explain how all this is done so it's a

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.780 
explain how all this is done so it's a
game<00:00:38.730> rule<00:00:38.969> command<00:00:39.570> block<00:00:40.050> output<00:00:40.890> true<00:00:41.520> so

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
game rule command block output true so

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.750 
game rule command block output true so
now<00:00:41.910> we<00:00:41.969> can<00:00:42.149> see<00:00:42.480> when<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.140> go<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:43.680> one<00:00:43.890> and

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
now we can see when I go in this one and

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.670 
now we can see when I go in this one and
I'm<00:00:45.390> just<00:00:45.420> about<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.840> get<00:00:45.989> teleported<00:00:46.260> another

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
I'm just about to get teleported another

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.799 
I'm just about to get teleported another
a<00:00:47.010> command<00:00:47.730> block<00:00:47.850> teleports<00:00:48.480> me<00:00:48.570> out<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
a command block teleports me out of the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.010 
a command block teleports me out of the
portal<00:00:49.140> or<00:00:49.590> two<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.430> know<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.730> other<00:00:51.020> the

portal or two you know the other the
other<00:00:52.110> portal<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:53.370> let<00:00:53.550> me<00:00:53.670> put<00:00:54.090> myself<00:00:54.210> in

other portal so let me put myself in

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.000 
other portal so let me put myself in
creative<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:54.930> can<00:00:55.110> give<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.860> little

underneath<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> portal<00:01:00.000> here<00:01:00.239> there<00:01:00.690> are<00:01:00.899> a

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
underneath the portal here there are a

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.630 
underneath the portal here there are a
couple<00:01:01.170> mob<00:01:01.440> spawners<00:01:01.770> they<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.430> some

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
couple mob spawners they have some

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.549 
couple mob spawners they have some
villagers<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.149> them<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.570> then<00:01:04.199> down<00:01:04.530> here

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
villagers in them and then down here

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.010 
villagers in them and then down here
there's<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.309> tripwire<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.689> bunch<00:01:06.900> of

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
there's a tripwire and a bunch of

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.399 
there's a tripwire and a bunch of
redstone<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:08.090> then<00:01:09.090> those<00:01:09.750> all<00:01:09.990> eat<00:01:10.140> into<00:01:10.290> a

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
redstone and then those all eat into a

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.570 
redstone and then those all eat into a
command<00:01:10.740> block<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:11.100> course<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.549> the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
command block of course this is the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.219 
command block of course this is the
command<00:01:11.909> block<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.299> has<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.659> teleport

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
command block that has the teleport

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.980 
command block that has the teleport
command<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:14.400> looks<00:01:14.670> for<00:01:14.880> people<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.840> are

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
command it looks for people that are

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.190 
command it looks for people that are
standing<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.979> portal<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.689> it<00:01:18.689> heliports

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
standing in the portal and it heliports

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.310 
standing in the portal and it heliports
them<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.619> other<00:01:19.740> portal<00:01:20.299> so<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:22.110> way<00:01:22.290> that

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
them to the other portal so the way that

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.730 
them to the other portal so the way that
this<00:01:22.590> works<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.479> these<00:01:24.479> villager<00:01:25.080> spawners

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
this works is these villager spawners

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.980 
this works is these villager spawners
have<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.490> very<00:01:26.820> short<00:01:27.119> player<00:01:27.479> detection

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
have a very short player detection

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.440 
have a very short player detection
radius<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:29.009> radius<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.430> actually<00:01:29.880> two<00:01:30.150> blocks

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
radius the radius is actually two blocks

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.420 
radius the radius is actually two blocks
so<00:01:30.990> if<00:01:31.200> somebody's<00:01:31.530> standing<00:01:31.740> directly<00:01:32.070> above

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
so if somebody's standing directly above

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.100 
so if somebody's standing directly above
it<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.790> can<00:01:33.090> actually<00:01:33.180> be<00:01:33.570> standing<00:01:33.750> just

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
it you can actually be standing just

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.770 
it you can actually be standing just
outside<00:01:34.310> if<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.610> see<00:01:35.790> like<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.270> redstone<00:01:36.630> has

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
outside if you see like the redstone has

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.999 
outside if you see like the redstone has
started<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.079> get<00:01:37.200> triggered<00:01:37.470> down<00:01:37.619> there<00:01:37.860> and

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
started to get triggered down there and

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.429 
started to get triggered down there and
the<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.670> villager<00:01:39.030> spawns<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.350> you

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
the and the villager spawns and so you

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.469 
the and the villager spawns and so you
can<00:01:40.560> see<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.799> village<00:01:41.009> respond<00:01:41.340> but<00:01:41.549> it's

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
can see that village respond but it's

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.440 
can see that village respond but it's
got<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.659> detection<00:01:43.320> radius<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.829> two<00:01:44.329> so<00:01:45.329> that

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
got that detection radius of two so that

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.760 
got that detection radius of two so that
if<00:01:45.540> you're<00:01:45.720> standing<00:01:46.020> basically<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.680> the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
if you're standing basically in the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.760 
if you're standing basically in the
portal<00:01:47.070> then<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:48.509> will<00:01:48.840> spawn<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.170> villager

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
portal then it will spawn a villager

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.850 
portal then it will spawn a villager
down<00:01:49.950> here<00:01:50.340> now<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:51.360> spawner<00:01:51.689> also<00:01:52.320> has<00:01:52.829> a

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
down here now the spawner also has a

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.069 
down here now the spawner also has a
couple<00:01:53.070> other<00:01:53.310> properties<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.720> spawns<00:01:54.930> a

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
couple other properties so it spawns a

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.950 
couple other properties so it spawns a
villager<00:01:55.530> with<00:01:56.520> zero<00:01:57.210> hit<00:01:57.420> points<00:01:57.780> the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
villager with zero hit points the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.200 
villager with zero hit points the
villager<00:01:58.290> will<00:01:58.439> immediately<00:01:59.040> die<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.640> that's

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
villager will immediately die and that's

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.760 
villager will immediately die and that's
why<00:02:00.390> when<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.810> come<00:02:00.990> in<00:02:01.079> here<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.500> move<00:02:01.619> away

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
why when you come in here and move away

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.649 
why when you come in here and move away
the<00:02:02.100> villager<00:02:02.430> goes<00:02:02.610> away<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.509> that's

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
the villager goes away and that's

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.300 
the villager goes away and that's
important<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.710> if<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:04.890> want<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.130> cancel

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
important so that if you want to cancel

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.119 
important so that if you want to cancel
out<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:06.210> out<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.259> portal<00:02:07.500> thing<00:02:07.740> then

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
out of the out of the portal thing then

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.699 
out of the out of the portal thing then
and<00:02:08.429> also<00:02:08.640> it's<00:02:09.420> useful<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.170> make<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.410> reusable

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
and also it's useful to make it reusable

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.580 
and also it's useful to make it reusable
so<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.670> gives<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.120> villager<00:02:12.720> zero<00:02:12.989> hit<00:02:13.200> points

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
so it gives the villager zero hit points

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.880 
so it gives the villager zero hit points
and<00:02:14.239> it<00:02:15.239> also<00:02:15.480> spawns<00:02:15.959> villagers<00:02:16.440> pretty

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
and it also spawns villagers pretty

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.320 
and it also spawns villagers pretty
quickly<00:02:17.130> because<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:18.090> know<00:02:18.180> they're

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
quickly because you know they're

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.270 
quickly because you know they're
constantly<00:02:18.690> dying<00:02:18.930> down<00:02:19.200> there<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:19.770> we're

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
constantly dying down there so we're

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.350 
constantly dying down there so we're
actually<00:02:20.370> getting<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.819> bunch<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.150> new

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
actually getting a bunch of new

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.710 
actually getting a bunch of new
villagers<00:02:21.900> every<00:02:22.430> every<00:02:23.430> every<00:02:24.420> couple<00:02:24.690> of

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
villagers every every every couple of

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.680 
villagers every every every couple of
ticks<00:02:24.959> so<00:02:25.560> about<00:02:26.430> ten<00:02:26.970> new<00:02:27.209> villagers<00:02:27.660> a

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
ticks so about ten new villagers a

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.009 
ticks so about ten new villagers a
second<00:02:28.200> are<00:02:28.560> actually<00:02:29.010> spawning<00:02:29.489> in<00:02:29.730> here<00:02:30.019> now

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
second are actually spawning in here now

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.500 
second are actually spawning in here now
this<00:02:31.200> trigger<00:02:31.500> is<00:02:31.530> some<00:02:31.800> tripwire<00:02:32.450> here's<00:02:33.450> a

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
this trigger is some tripwire here's a

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.059 
this trigger is some tripwire here's a
very<00:02:33.720> simple<00:02:34.140> circuit<00:02:34.349> it's<00:02:34.680> just<00:02:34.830> basically

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
very simple circuit it's just basically

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.180 
very simple circuit it's just basically
a<00:02:35.190> bunch<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.459> repeaters<00:02:36.410> coming<00:02:37.410> off<00:02:37.590> of<00:02:37.620> a

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
a bunch of repeaters coming off of a

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.940 
a bunch of repeaters coming off of a
torch<00:02:38.580> so<00:02:39.209> when<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.780> villager<00:02:40.170> comes<00:02:40.410> in<00:02:40.590> here

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
torch so when a villager comes in here

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.580 
torch so when a villager comes in here
it's<00:02:41.160> going<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.849> D<00:02:42.239> power<00:02:42.480> this<00:02:42.840> redstone<00:02:42.930> line

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
it's going to D power this redstone line

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.150 
it's going to D power this redstone line
here<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:45.170> immediately<00:02:46.170> that<00:02:46.560> will<00:02:46.680> start<00:02:46.980> D

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
here and immediately that will start D

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.250 
here and immediately that will start D
powering<00:02:47.640> a<00:02:47.730> bunch<00:02:47.910> of<00:02:48.030> this<00:02:48.150> redstone<00:02:48.569> but

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
powering a bunch of this redstone but

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.080 
powering a bunch of this redstone but
basically<00:02:49.799> until<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.220> signals<00:02:50.549> gotten<00:02:50.880> all

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
basically until the signals gotten all

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.949 
basically until the signals gotten all
the<00:02:51.209> way<00:02:51.239> through<00:02:51.780> this<00:02:52.590> one<00:02:53.010> over<00:02:53.340> here<00:02:53.700> and

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
the way through this one over here and

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.120 
the way through this one over here and
all<00:02:54.959> of<00:02:55.080> these<00:02:55.200> repeaters<00:02:55.620> have<00:02:55.769> turned<00:02:55.950> off

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
all of these repeaters have turned off

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.880 
all of these repeaters have turned off
as<00:02:56.340> well<00:02:56.690> this<00:02:57.690> this<00:02:58.140> block<00:02:58.500> is<00:02:58.680> still<00:02:58.799> going

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
as well this this block is still going

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.949 
as well this this block is still going
to<00:02:58.950> be<00:02:59.040> powered<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.670> the<00:03:00.330> torch<00:03:00.569> won't<00:03:00.720> turn

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
to be powered and the torch won't turn

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.370 
to be powered and the torch won't turn
on<00:03:00.989> so<00:03:02.209> you<00:03:03.209> can<00:03:03.360> kind<00:03:03.569> of<00:03:03.690> play<00:03:04.080> around<00:03:04.200> with

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
on so you can kind of play around with

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.039 
on so you can kind of play around with
it<00:03:04.530> for<00:03:04.650> yourself<00:03:04.980> but<00:03:05.790> basically<00:03:06.750> if<00:03:06.930> you

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
it for yourself but basically if you

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.589 
it for yourself but basically if you
come<00:03:07.410> in<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:07.890> then<00:03:08.310> leave<00:03:08.640> you'll<00:03:09.330> see

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
come in and then leave you'll see

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.660 
come in and then leave you'll see
there's<00:03:10.080> always<00:03:10.319> some<00:03:10.680> redstone<00:03:10.890> powering<00:03:11.549> it

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
there's always some redstone powering it

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.640 
there's always some redstone powering it
and<00:03:11.760> that's<00:03:11.880> what<00:03:12.060> allows<00:03:12.269> you<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.510> cancel<00:03:12.930> but

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
and that's what allows you to cancel but

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.860 
and that's what allows you to cancel but
if<00:03:13.799> you<00:03:13.920> come<00:03:14.220> in<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.519> stay<00:03:14.790> then<00:03:15.390> eventually

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
if you come in and stay then eventually

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.289 
if you come in and stay then eventually
all<00:03:16.140> of<00:03:16.319> the<00:03:16.530> repeaters<00:03:16.890> turn<00:03:17.099> off<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.579> the

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
all of the repeaters turn off and the

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.270 
all of the repeaters turn off and the
block<00:03:18.510> gets<00:03:18.690> powered<00:03:19.019> we<00:03:19.500> teleport<00:03:19.920> over<00:03:20.010> here

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
block gets powered we teleport over here

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.900 
block gets powered we teleport over here
and<00:03:21.470> so<00:03:22.470> this<00:03:22.620> is<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.890> exact<00:03:23.160> same<00:03:23.340> setup<00:03:23.609> over

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
and so this is the exact same setup over

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.300 
and so this is the exact same setup over
here<00:03:24.299> it<00:03:24.720> just<00:03:25.019> all<00:03:25.260> I've<00:03:25.530> done<00:03:25.680> is<00:03:25.739> actually

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
here it just all I've done is actually

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.530 
here it just all I've done is actually
just<00:03:26.459> inverted<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:29.359> where<00:03:30.359> your

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
just inverted the the where your

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.840 
just inverted the the where your
teleporting<00:03:31.049> from<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:31.470> -<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:31.950> of<00:03:32.579> course<00:03:32.760> I

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
teleporting from and - and of course I

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.520 
teleporting from and - and of course I
had<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.000> change<00:03:33.329> the<00:03:33.569> positions<00:03:34.049> on<00:03:34.319> the

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
had to change the positions on the

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.360 
had to change the positions on the
villager<00:03:34.920> spawners<00:03:35.220> here<00:03:35.750> but<00:03:36.750> otherwise

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
villager spawners here but otherwise

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.069 
villager spawners here but otherwise
it's<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.459> exact<00:03:38.670> same<00:03:38.850> thing<00:03:39.120> you<00:03:39.299> can<00:03:39.540> you

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
it's the exact same thing you can you

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.379 
it's the exact same thing you can you
can<00:03:40.230> download<00:03:40.410> all<00:03:40.680> this<00:03:40.829> stuff<00:03:41.130> from<00:03:41.579> the

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
can download all this stuff from the

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.400 
can download all this stuff from the
link<00:03:42.569> in<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:42.720> video<00:03:42.780> description<00:03:42.930> if<00:03:43.319> you'd

like<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:44.359> I<00:03:45.359> think<00:03:46.230> it<00:03:46.290> would<00:03:46.380> be<00:03:46.440> really<00:03:46.590> cool

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
like and I think it would be really cool

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.090 
like and I think it would be really cool
to<00:03:46.859> add<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.579> some<00:03:47.850> adventure<00:03:48.269> maps<00:03:48.450> or<00:03:49.100> maybe

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
to add to some adventure maps or maybe

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.280 
to add to some adventure maps or maybe
even<00:03:50.430> for<00:03:50.639> like<00:03:50.760> a<00:03:50.790> server<00:03:51.090> spawn<00:03:51.450> to<00:03:51.930> teleport

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
even for like a server spawn to teleport

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.259 
even for like a server spawn to teleport
the<00:03:52.410> player<00:03:52.440> around<00:03:52.829> definitely<00:03:53.790> quite<00:03:54.239> a

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
the player around definitely quite a

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:55.910 
the player around definitely quite a
useful<00:03:54.420> concept<00:03:54.750> one<00:03:55.410> thing<00:03:55.530> you<00:03:55.620> should<00:03:55.769> note

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
useful concept one thing you should note

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.090 
useful concept one thing you should note
is<00:03:56.160> if<00:03:56.459> you<00:03:56.609> go<00:03:57.120> in<00:03:57.389> in<00:03:57.690> creative<00:03:58.500> mode<00:03:58.530> you

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
is if you go in in creative mode you

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.710 
is if you go in in creative mode you
will<00:03:59.220> be<00:03:59.400> teleported<00:03:59.760> instantly<00:04:00.299> that's<00:04:00.480> just

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
will be teleported instantly that's just

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.930 
will be teleported instantly that's just
one<00:04:00.840> of<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:00.959> new<00:04:01.079> features<00:04:01.230> so<00:04:02.160> you'll<00:04:02.819> have

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
one of the new features so you'll have

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.190 
one of the new features so you'll have
to<00:04:03.090> actually<00:04:03.209> if<00:04:03.510> you<00:04:03.569> want<00:04:03.720> to<00:04:03.780> test<00:04:03.989> it<00:04:04.109> out

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
to actually if you want to test it out

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.599 
to actually if you want to test it out
you'll<00:04:04.350> have<00:04:04.410> to<00:04:04.620> actually<00:04:04.889> go<00:04:05.069> into<00:04:05.250> survival

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
you'll have to actually go into survival

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:09.410 
you'll have to actually go into survival
mode<00:04:06.200> it's<00:04:07.200> around<00:04:07.410> mode<00:04:07.590> and<00:04:08.060> that<00:04:09.060> way<00:04:09.239> it

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
mode it's around mode and that way it

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.690 
mode it's around mode and that way it
takes<00:04:09.450> some<00:04:09.750> time<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:10.019> teleport<00:04:10.319> you<00:04:10.519> but<00:04:11.519> I

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
takes some time to teleport you but I

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.009 
takes some time to teleport you but I
thought<00:04:11.880> it<00:04:12.000> was<00:04:12.120> just<00:04:12.510> a<00:04:12.569> really<00:04:12.840> nice

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
thought it was just a really nice

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.080 
thought it was just a really nice
aesthetic<00:04:13.859> touch<00:04:14.220> that<00:04:14.430> could<00:04:14.549> be<00:04:14.609> added<00:04:14.880> to<00:04:15.060> a

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
aesthetic touch that could be added to a

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.420 
aesthetic touch that could be added to a
lot<00:04:15.389> of<00:04:15.510> maps<00:04:15.739> that's<00:04:16.739> about<00:04:16.859> it<00:04:17.010> thanks<00:04:17.400> for
