00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.040
 one way or another it looked like recently 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.860
 the data highway to the server 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.360
 because the launch of simcity would have 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.000
 actually be able to walk better 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.310
 That's right the form was full of users 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.900
 who have complained that the game 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.609
 Do not love any connections there was 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.740
 and that directly to the launch tag 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:26.380
 they did not complain wrongly 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.130
 we had the same problems and that 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.279
 just does not work 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.050
 at the moment peter the connection into 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.730
 sound studio to computers interrupted 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.410
 dear observer, we are very sorry 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.940
 please try it tomorrow or 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.050
 the day after tomorrow the video ready to look 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.559
 yes maybe the server is yes 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.480
 again 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.649
 because that's the way things are 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.600
 out talk sorry at a game that 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.100
 as hot as you can expect 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.739
 just do not deliver such a launch 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.359
 with queues with few servers 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.160
 at the beginning of the first must have marriage is 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:55.929
 unlock more servers 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.309
 update-server against not even me 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:59.530
 took forever to get into the game 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.429
 come and sometimes in the middle of the game 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.429
 flown out again 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.360
 at least you are very bitter 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.340
 Behavior did not diminish around and 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.960
 still draw first game scenes from the 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.430
 sale version to present from Sun 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.650
 quite done and when you first 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.360
 it's the game in there 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:21.100
 really fun there are big though 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.829
 however, so the basic principles 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.420
 by simcity they are really fun 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:27.729
 do you build your city.de on the power 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.579
 that makes you really moody 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:33.009
 see how the skyscrapers rise 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:35.469
 the sky and the comfort is very good 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.280
 not as such regarded as 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:38.680
 the precursors 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.450
 You've always given up on them that way 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.490
 lead a bit that you do not 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.140
 just like the ox in front of the mountain stand 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.960
 and I know what to do 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.969
 but there is always something to do so 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.479
 really not done and the winter 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:51.880
 is back 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.460
 Well, there are seasons in the game 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.119
 not that we see here that's the one 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.549
 upgrade mechanics that the building that 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.200
 What's new and simcity allowed the fourth 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.080
 not part and that makes a lot of fun 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.760
 because you have your fire department now 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.670
 headquarters and so on you can 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.220
 expand selectively and does not always have to 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.910
 new easy build to bigger detail 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.440
 radio star the really good news 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.700
 how is micro management structured? 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.280
 you still keep that easy 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.600
 Overview or is it too much everything to us 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.180
 keep in mind at the same time 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.780
 the developers have very good ones here 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.400
 quotes in quotes 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.320
 It has always been thought up 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.760
 filter features however you see 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.350
 now also look really good and are 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.660
 very very clear these are these 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.880
 Data layers are called the ones you see then 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.200
 graphically reduces very well where 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.680
 now the air pollution highest 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.630
 is where no water comes from where electricity 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.330
 it is needed 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.430
 clear at least in the rough if 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.690
 it goes into detail that the statistics 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.240
 sometimes leave a little something 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.800
 but miss electricity and water pipes 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.540
 you do not need to create yourself anymore 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.730
 or less exact address also no 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.480
 there are many said is so complex 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.160
 away from the game 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.600
 total nonsense that's just one 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.480
 good purification of the game principle 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.560
 So I have the few problems 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.740
 which I really liked is 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.410
 actually these regions map you 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:14.500
 You can now have up to 16 cities in one 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.900
 web also with several players 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.030
 in multiplayer mode and what he does 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.560
 Cool is easy you can for example 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.380
 Send fire engine to neighboring cities 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.820
 or stream and so on and so on 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.950
 The meaning behind it is that you are now 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.030
 you can do very special city tree 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.739
 For example, somewhere a crown 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.570
 settlement and there you need 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.690
 then no power station and so on because 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.160
 that comes from within the neighbor city 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.019
 but between the two cities 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.370
 douglas neighbor city I see that the 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.560
 interspaces quite big are you 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.940
 So no really big megacity 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.019
 build for the coming I the cards 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.459
 relatively small in front 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.489
 The cards are very small in comparison 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.680
 to the predecessor very fast fully built 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.390
 And as I said, they do not grow 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.610
 together several cities but those are 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.950
 always so in their own squares and 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.140
 Of course that costs atmosphere too 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.400
 these public big buildings where they 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.019
 to join several games together 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.420
 can build one like that 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.340
 they are standing somewhere on the edge but 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.640
 they part of a never really city 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.640
 what a shame 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:22.389
 finally maybe to say if 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.789
 the server gets problems in the handle 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.539
 then still buy or buy 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:28.090
 still wait 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.949
 in the booth where we made the video 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.530
 i would definitely not say that 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:36.009
 start now but that first 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:38.380
 let it go when it actually happens 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:40.870
 game is good but never quite going 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.340
 no big improvement compared to 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.990
 before he is a throwback because 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.910
 because in these little cards and because 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.610
 you just build the metropolises 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.259
 and also because the whole simulation 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.550
 not quite in detail 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:54.000
 understandable is how to find one 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.000
 little transparency 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:00.000
 that's why it's a nice game 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:02.180
 comfortable but also a simple game 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.180
 game
