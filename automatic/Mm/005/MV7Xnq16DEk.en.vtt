how<00:00:46.000> we<00:00:46.059> manufacture<00:00:46.870> calipers<00:00:47.440> we<00:00:47.830> start

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
how we manufacture calipers we start

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.710 
how we manufacture calipers we start
with<00:00:48.160> a<00:00:48.280> research<00:00:48.670> and<00:00:48.879> development<00:00:48.910> phase<00:00:49.510> of

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
with a research and development phase of

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.689 
with a research and development phase of
our<00:00:49.780> process<00:00:50.080> we<00:00:50.680> move<00:00:50.890> into<00:00:51.070> the<00:00:51.190> foundry

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
our process we move into the foundry

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:53.400 
our process we move into the foundry
process<00:00:52.180> where<00:00:52.390> we<00:00:52.510> have<00:00:52.690> samples<00:00:53.230> of

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
process where we have samples of

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.710 
process where we have samples of
different<00:00:53.770> metals<00:00:53.949> that<00:00:54.340> we're<00:00:54.460> using<00:00:54.699> in<00:00:55.510> the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720

display<00:00:59.650> shows<00:00:59.800> you<00:01:00.340> how<00:01:00.519> calipers<00:01:01.090> are<00:01:01.269> made

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
display shows you how calipers are made

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.270 
display shows you how calipers are made
starting<00:01:02.050> with<00:01:02.170> a<00:01:02.199> forged<00:01:02.650> billet<00:01:02.949> of

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
starting with a forged billet of

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.910 
starting with a forged billet of
aluminum<00:01:04.269> which<00:01:04.449> is<00:01:04.600> then<00:01:04.809> formed<00:01:05.199> and<00:01:05.470> then

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
aluminum which is then formed and then

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.700 
aluminum which is then formed and then
machined<00:01:06.369> into<00:01:06.610> a<00:01:06.729> caliper<00:01:07.200> we<00:01:08.200> also<00:01:08.380> have<00:01:08.500> an

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
machined into a caliper we also have an

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.170 
machined into a caliper we also have an
interactive<00:01:09.340> part<00:01:09.580> of<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:09.759> booth<00:01:09.910> where

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
interactive part of the booth where

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.700 
interactive part of the booth where
we're<00:01:10.330> showing<00:01:10.570> all<00:01:10.899> of<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:11.200> discs<00:01:11.470> that<00:01:11.530> we

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
we're showing all of the discs that we

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.980 
we're showing all of the discs that we
make<00:01:11.920> what<00:01:12.369> is<00:01:12.490> a<00:01:12.520> solid<00:01:13.000> iron<00:01:13.180> disk<00:01:13.600> then<00:01:13.869> we

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
make what is a solid iron disk then we

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.660 
make what is a solid iron disk then we
move<00:01:14.140> on<00:01:14.259> to<00:01:14.290> two-piece<00:01:14.830> discs<00:01:15.220> made<00:01:15.399> out<00:01:15.550> of

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
move on to two-piece discs made out of

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.580 
move on to two-piece discs made out of
steel<00:01:15.940> and<00:01:15.970> aluminum<00:01:16.600> and<00:01:16.960> we<00:01:17.080> have<00:01:17.170> carbon

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
steel and aluminum and we have carbon

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.650 
steel and aluminum and we have carbon
ceramic<00:01:17.800> discs<00:01:18.399> and<00:01:18.520> then<00:01:18.910> we<00:01:19.030> have<00:01:19.180> carbon

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
ceramic discs and then we have carbon

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.870 
ceramic discs and then we have carbon
discs<00:01:19.990> all<00:01:20.229> the<00:01:20.500> discs<00:01:20.740> is<00:01:20.830> the<00:01:20.920> same<00:01:21.160> size<00:01:21.399> and

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880

each one can be lifted by the

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.410 
each one can be lifted by the
participant<00:01:24.039> to<00:01:24.250> see<00:01:24.580> how<00:01:24.700> heavy<00:01:24.850> they<00:01:25.119> are<00:01:25.270> in
