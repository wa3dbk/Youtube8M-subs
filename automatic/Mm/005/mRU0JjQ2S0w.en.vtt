00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:05.780
Antler Farms is the leading manufacturer of
world’s best deer antler velvet.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:11.340
Highly selective in what goes into our products,
Antler Farms begins by raising naturally healthy

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.710
red deer in the rolling hills of New Zealand
- a country with virtually no pollution.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.329
Free to roam the land and graze on natural
pasture, our deer thrive on our farms in New

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:25.980
Zealand's temperate climate.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.319
Antler Farms deer antler velvet is carefully
collected and processed to ensure we deliver

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:33.579
the highest quality products.

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.070
We use only the high yielding segments of
antler to make our products.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.440
Our deer antler velvet capsules exclude the
base and bottom segments of antler, which

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.160
are well known to be less effective, deficient
segments.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.110
Some manufacturers make their products entirely
out of deer antler bases and bottoms.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.249
In other words, our competitors’ deer antler
velvet products are made out of the parts

00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:58.379
that we throw away.

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.600
Additionally, manufacturers of low grade deer
antler velvet use heat assisted techniques

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.660
to dry their deer antler velvet.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.040
However, heat reduces or completely destroys
the beneficial properties of deer antler velvet,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.440
rendering their products ineffective.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.420
Antler Farms deer antler velvet is never heated
excessively during processing.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.880
Our deer antler velvet is dried at a low temperature
for several weeks.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.580
Although this process takes more time than
heat assisted techniques, it maintains the

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.000
potency of the ingredients.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.780
Our deer antler velvet is antibiotic free,
growth hormone free, and routinely screened

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.120
for disease, agricultural and chemical contaminants.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.300
At Antler Farms, we use techniques that are
more labor intensive and more time consuming

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.780
than conventional methods, to create the purest,
strongest products.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.710
The high concentration of active ingredients
in our deer antler velvet products means quicker

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.810
results, more improvements and greater benefits.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.159
