 A app tv came to my house but there is a problem 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:25.880
 It's a TV here , though 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:29.890
 It is an old plasma TV which does not correspond to hdmi 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:35.500
 I influence I apple tv is not attached 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:43.530
 I came from Mr. amazon's 381 weak hdmi output of lk pui 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:43.530
 It is such a product that converts to s terminal composite output 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.220
 ac adapter 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.700

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.280

 Please note that there may be Kano change Toka such a thing as change design 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:18.410
 It was written that 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:25.070
 If you connect with that yellow line, it means that the image quality is rough and that's this s terminal 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:26.850
 I would like to use the person of me to connect the television with the video out 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.500
 Besides hdmi 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.500
 Here's an ac adapter and it 's led here 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.880

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:41.990

 In the case of Japan that will be converted 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:54.870
 Align the switch to those who say nps Sea 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:57.950
 Although I have to say towards this model of this new type 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:03.370
 It is same day the police department this day 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:08.560

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:14.940

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.940
 Because I think change Toka month whether the sound that I tried to buy here 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:24.470

 Power cable and the time also want to connect the I manual is black Pretty bay from now but is white 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.210

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:33.200
 It is connected like this now It is to the television 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.610
 It has led in s terminal 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.990
 Audio too 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:43.220
 Connect red and light left 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:48.370
 If you are this one , plug in the back power with the hdmi cable 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:51.350
 After this, with this app tv hdmi cable 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:55.720
 Power one would have been 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.720
 Apple tv connected properly 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.620
 A little reading is a little 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.620
 Though we use most 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:12.010
 It looks right 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:17.799
 Though I feel is slightly or a little rougher than see a Well usually 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:22.269
 But when I'm playing a movie or something like that, it looks right 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:26.870
 Image quality does not come bad It looks beautiful in front of the store 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:34.220
 I mean, the product we introduced today is 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:36.770
 It says 381 conversion to the composite output of lkv has decided the introduction of the product 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:43.480
 Everyone 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:43.480
