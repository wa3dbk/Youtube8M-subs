00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.469 
mentioned the different styles we've got
a<00:01:58.020> supposed<00:01:58.290> Middle<00:01:58.619> Eastern<00:01:58.890> team<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.340> we<00:02:00.329> saw

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
a supposed Middle Eastern team is we saw

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.789 
a supposed Middle Eastern team is we saw
a<00:02:00.509> little<00:02:00.689> bit<00:02:00.840> with<00:02:00.990> Iraq<00:02:01.290> in<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.530> World<00:02:01.710> Cup

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
a little bit with Iraq in the World Cup

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:02.749 
a little bit with Iraq in the World Cup
last<00:02:02.009> year<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.280> guess<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.549> would<00:02:02.640> probably

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
last year I guess it would probably

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.359 
last year I guess it would probably
quite<00:02:03.090> similar<00:02:03.469> yeah<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.500> think<00:02:04.680> it'll<00:02:05.070> be<00:02:05.340> very

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
quite similar yeah I think it'll be very

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.240 
quite similar yeah I think it'll be very
similar<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.180> be<00:02:06.299> fair<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.540> think<00:02:07.129> they'll<00:02:08.129> be

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
similar to be fair I think they'll be

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.199 
similar to be fair I think they'll be
used<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.670> heat<00:02:10.340> they'll<00:02:11.340> get<00:02:11.670> afterwards

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
used to the heat they'll get afterwards

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.670 
used to the heat they'll get afterwards
they'll<00:02:12.420> be<00:02:12.629> busy

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
they'll be busy
