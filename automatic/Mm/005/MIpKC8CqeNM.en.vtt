00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.890
 now again the mavericks developer 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.660
 preview the first version on our 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.950
 install hard drive or we like 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.700
 prepare our install system 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.039
 Of course you need it first 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.609
 free hard disk usb stick or one 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.050
 external plate works best 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.340
 then we start with the hard drives 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.939
 utility 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.849
 i have ssd freedom here 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.570
 The partitioning was taken in two 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.570
 parts 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:40.079
 I also like to do it again 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:43.739
 here comes our base system on it and 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:51.770
 here later our mavericks of course 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:51.770
 All right and then shoot the whole thing off 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.969
 then of course we need ours 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.710
 is downloaded installation package 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.880
 of course we have programs 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:14.630
 show the content of the app store package 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.630
 mountain we install as de schwupp 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:32.600
 then within the install dmg mountain 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:35.590
 We the base system so that we 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.659
 us now first restores 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.500
 the reported base system again 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:45.700
 produce 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.700
 on the first small partition and running 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:56.750
 it will not be a little minute 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:02:05.299
 this is much faster here with a mac 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:12.010
 ssd wonderful there have something under 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:13.970
 do not need display system anymore 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.810
 hard disk utility we need 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.680
 not anymore 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.209
 I copy here the packages with forklift 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.280
 otherwise I always recommend the 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.450
 pathfinder but with my passport 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.790
 it does not work he wants that 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.799
 not something at the installation 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:33.400
 Copy is the buggy is working on 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:36.980
 any case not so we have ours 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.600
 system here it is, we need it 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.970
 Of course now from the install as the 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:46.070
 packages are here after 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:51.320
 system installation the package link the 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:54.530
 need the deletions with and then 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.450
 just about everything would have about packages 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.590
 actually I see plenty of it 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.590
 suddenly just shoot 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:11.060
 asus has run so you copied five 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:15.780
 gigabyte in Casekow have the hobby the 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:21.900
 all I have read is no time human 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:25.080
 everything goes so fast nowadays 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.910
 Clothes are already copied then 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:31.319
 Of course we still have to take care of it 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.900
 a cameleon family property wonderful 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:37.200
 is already the latest version for 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.280
 want the mavericks in it on the plate 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:44.090
 Of course we also have a boat sector 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.090
 Write plate select by system 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:04:00.190
 and shoot it off we have it too 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:04:02.570
 here is the good case wonderful 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.490
 what else do we need? 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:10.840
 of course, borrow from ours 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:13.940
 or lion we still need our dst 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:17.090
 some do not need them some me 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:22.100
 Just copy over to the extra 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.540
 folder simply overrun says and if 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.400
 somehow you have to go to court 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.930
 just put all the clothes around 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.600
 get his hackintosh to work 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.600
 just have it over it 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.720
 copy what we're missing 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.580
 Of course, still the power makes guys 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:41.120
 where do we find that there I have, of course 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:45.590
 already the thing we have to go back 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:47.570
 times in the packages must go 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.900
 There we have a package base system 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.870
 binaries and we will with the 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.760
 Open pacifist 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.370
 for therein is the power 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.820
 looked under hammer and she with 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:08.080
 easy on our base system so easy 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:13.330
 is that now is the first course 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:17.240
 he would have to megabyte 1 gigabyte through 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.430
 found and copied over it or 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.380
 we are almost finished what we are 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:27.620
 Need now is the fake smc 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:30.700
 point text accident here still somehow 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:33.260
 something urgently needed 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.900
 also install but in the case 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.660
 then you have the extra folder 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:41.180
 only the fake smc after system 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.010
 library extensions and then it was 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.120
 already with the next book simply the 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.910
 select plate 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.620
 as a start plate and then the thing is running 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.700
 was through I installed already I 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.249
 have flattened everything again 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.709
 because I over again 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:56.779
 Clown will be my name 

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:58.729
 whole software directly from this 

00:05:56.779 --> 00:06:03.109
 Migration Assistant under hackintosh 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:06.949
 is not recommended so the thing is 

00:06:03.109 --> 00:06:10.339
 away we still need our fake smc 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:12.889
 Quite simply with the text said on the 

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:14.569
 system is called here now because of me 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:17.239
 Two had reported that one is already 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:20.209
 away but he realizes that is 

00:06:17.239 --> 00:06:26.389
 not bad has nothing to suggest so 

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:34.689
 installation hammer retex tsmc need 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:37.219
 how install day was done there 

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:39.259
 someday forget to look because I 

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:40.519
 Otherwise , unfortunately , it needs to come 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:42.949
 later I do not regret doing that 

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:46.299
 it does not have to be installed 

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:48.379
 Ribery I came across over copied text 

00:06:46.299 --> 00:06:54.019
 always recommended to later times the 

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:55.459
 right to fix and the dmx yes that was 

00:06:54.019 --> 00:06:57.889
 it also already and I still need that 

00:06:55.459 --> 00:07:00.349
 for my board beat that 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:02.959
 you can install it later so 

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:03.829
 is enough now to start and 

00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:06.259
 to install 

00:07:03.829 --> 00:07:07.939
 for the mavericks if that then 

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:09.169
 just installed is the same 

00:07:07.939 --> 00:07:10.969
 I'm still cladding here 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:12.739
 additionally packed it also has 

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:15.709
 to pack on the installed mavericks 

00:07:12.739 --> 00:07:18.319
 speak extra folder excellent text for 

00:07:15.709 --> 00:07:21.949
 fake smc or text audio what else here 

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:23.659
 needs and yes that's it then could 

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:25.539
 start and get started 

00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:30.069
 the thing is a fine thing 

00:07:25.539 --> 00:07:30.069
 All right, I wish you something until then
