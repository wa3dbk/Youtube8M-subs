experience<00:01:07.430> multi<00:01:08.430> sir<00:01:08.640> we<00:01:09.390> spent<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.720> lot<00:01:09.750> of

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
experience multi sir we spent a lot of

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.210 
experience multi sir we spent a lot of
time<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.320> effort<00:01:10.409> on<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> cover<00:01:10.950> system

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
time and effort on the cover system

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.770 
time and effort on the cover system
because<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.790> player<00:01:12.000> will<00:01:12.240> spend<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.570> lot<00:01:12.750> of

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
because the player will spend a lot of

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.170 
because the player will spend a lot of
time<00:01:12.900> using<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.590> but<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.610> have<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.880> be<00:01:14.970> careful

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
time using it but you have to be careful

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.179 
time using it but you have to be careful
because<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.780> cover<00:01:16.020> can<00:01:16.290> often<00:01:16.740> be<00:01:16.829> easily

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
because the cover can often be easily

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.100 
because the cover can often be easily
destroyed<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.149> if<00:01:18.240> you're<00:01:18.390> hiding<00:01:18.780> behind<00:01:18.810> a

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
destroyed so if you're hiding behind a

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.170 
destroyed so if you're hiding behind a
fence<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.710> starts<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.130> disintegrate<00:01:20.280> it's

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
fence and it starts to disintegrate it's

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.960 
fence and it starts to disintegrate it's

this<00:01:24.390> destructibility<00:01:25.050> was<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.440> big<00:01:25.620> thing<00:01:25.650> for
