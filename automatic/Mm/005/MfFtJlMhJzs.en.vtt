00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.790
Upin! Ipin! Where do you think you're going?

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.440
Hurry, Upin! We're going to be late!

00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:11.509
Whoa!

00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:28.728
Flying High.
Part 3.

00:00:33.311 --> 00:00:35.100
Assalamualaikum!

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.216
Atok?

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:50.173
Wow, it's so beautiful!

00:00:50.173 --> 00:00:52.278
He finally finished it!

00:00:57.123 --> 00:01:00.358
Hey, is that bird okay?
- Let's go see.

00:01:01.305 --> 00:01:03.239
How do we get up there?

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.185
Here you go.

00:01:14.344 --> 00:01:15.504
Careful!

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.143
Almost there!
Just a bit more, Ipin!

00:01:22.721 --> 00:01:24.550
I can't reach it!

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.860
Look out, Ipin!

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:30.322
Ouch...

00:01:31.223 --> 00:01:32.145
Oh, no!

00:01:34.821 --> 00:01:36.854
Upin! What do we do now?

00:01:36.854 --> 00:01:39.229
We're doomed!
- You did it...

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.118
Who's that?

00:01:42.118 --> 00:01:43.743
Take this!
- What? Why?

00:01:43.743 --> 00:01:46.140
You're older!
- You did it, you take it!

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.267
No, you take it!

00:01:55.768 --> 00:01:56.960
Where are you going?

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.519
What's all that noise?

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:02.441
I was trying to sleep...
- Hi, Atok...

00:02:03.393 --> 00:02:05.709
Oh, it's you.

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:08.085
Have you seen my Wau?

00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:10.209
Yes.

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.900
It's pretty.
- Bring it here.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.020
I haven't tied the string yet.

00:02:14.604 --> 00:02:15.643
Here!

00:02:18.032 --> 00:02:20.369
Atok! What's wrong?
- It's... it's...

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:21.732
Broken!

00:02:21.732 --> 00:02:23.438
No, it's fine, Tok!

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:27.714
Look!
- I'm so upset...

00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:32.477
How could they ever do this to me?

00:02:32.477 --> 00:02:35.011
I spent days trying to finish that Wau...

00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:38.242
I'll find other kids to help me...

00:02:39.115 --> 00:02:40.665
Forgive us, Atok!

00:02:40.665 --> 00:02:42.360
Forgive me, Atok!
- I'm sorry, Atok!

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.944
I didn't do it! Ipin did.
- I didn't mean to.

00:02:44.944 --> 00:02:47.823
Please forgive us!
- It's too late...

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:51.035
Atok, please don't be sad...

00:02:51.035 --> 00:02:52.552
We'll make a new one!

00:02:52.552 --> 00:02:54.702
Just do whatever you want...

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.459
How do we do this, Ipin?

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.092
Just do it.

00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:11.000
This is hard!

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.138
Here.

00:03:14.934 --> 00:03:16.705
We'll do this together.

00:03:34.456 --> 00:03:35.456
Wow!

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:38.423
It's finally done.

00:03:38.423 --> 00:03:40.308
And so beautiful!

00:03:40.308 --> 00:03:42.094
Thanks for helping me.

00:03:43.244 --> 00:03:44.846
You're welcome.

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:47.053
Atok...

00:03:47.053 --> 00:03:49.475
Please don't find other kids to help you...

00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:52.878
Nah, I was only kidding.

00:03:53.954 --> 00:03:55.969
Atok, can you get the bird down?

00:03:58.472 --> 00:04:00.316
The bird is fine.

00:04:00.316 --> 00:04:02.379
We can let it go now.

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:03.349
What?

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:04.482
Let it go?

00:04:04.482 --> 00:04:06.201
But I thought we can keep it.

00:04:07.233 --> 00:04:08.747
No, you can't.

00:04:08.747 --> 00:04:11.923
All birds are meant to fly freely.

00:04:11.923 --> 00:04:16.363
We're not doing any good
keeping it in a cage like this.

00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:18.818
Yes, yes, yes...

00:04:19.957 --> 00:04:22.517
Here, go feed it first.

00:04:22.517 --> 00:04:24.985
Then you can play with it a while.

00:04:28.855 --> 00:04:30.513
Fly safely, okay?

00:04:30.513 --> 00:04:32.471
Make sure you don't forget us...

00:04:49.303 --> 00:04:50.565
Want to come with me tomorrow?

00:04:51.334 --> 00:04:54.069
Welcome to the
Inter-village Wau Competition!

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:56.695
Thank you all for coming today!

00:04:56.695 --> 00:04:59.978
Two for one ringgit! Two for one ringgit!

00:05:05.144 --> 00:05:08.201
Wow, that's a lot of Waus!

00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:10.145
They're so colourful.

00:05:10.145 --> 00:05:13.528
Atok, how come they're all different?

00:05:14.311 --> 00:05:16.025
Of course.

00:05:16.025 --> 00:05:18.602
There are many different types of Waus.

00:05:19.826 --> 00:05:22.860
That one. That's a Cat Wau.
- Oh...

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.883
And that one's a Boat Wau.
- Wow!

00:05:26.914 --> 00:05:28.981
Atok, what about that one?

00:05:30.312 --> 00:05:33.403
That's called the Lazy Wau.

00:05:33.403 --> 00:05:35.346
It's too plain!

00:05:35.346 --> 00:05:37.528
It shouldn't have entered the competition!

00:05:44.668 --> 00:05:50.203
But this one is the most beautiful Wau!

00:05:50.203 --> 00:05:54.313
This is Malaysia's greatest Wau; the Moon Wau.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.327
Come, help me with this.
- Yay!

00:05:58.007 --> 00:06:00.039
Hold it carefully!
- Okay, Tok!

00:06:00.687 --> 00:06:02.065
Come on, Tok!

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:03.582
Ready!

00:06:04.372 --> 00:06:06.428
One... two...

00:06:06.428 --> 00:06:07.973
Fly!

00:06:10.645 --> 00:06:13.287
Hey, look at that!
- Wow, it's so big!

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:15.864
Wow!

00:06:15.864 --> 00:06:19.236
It's so pretty!
I guess we're good at making Waus.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:20.992
Yes, yes, yes!

00:06:20.992 --> 00:06:23.054
You want to play? Here!

00:06:23.054 --> 00:06:27.286
Yay, I get to fly a Wau!
- Hey, I want to try it, too!
