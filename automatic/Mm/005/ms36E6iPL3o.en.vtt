are fail it's better than falling in
that<00:00:43.440> way<00:00:43.650> so<00:00:44.510> anyway<00:00:45.510> it's<00:00:46.500> one<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.830> the<00:00:46.920> nicer

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
that way so anyway it's one of the nicer

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.920 
that way so anyway it's one of the nicer
looking<00:00:48.830> Hey<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:50.550> bricks<00:00:50.760> are<00:00:50.910> today<00:00:51.780> we're

car it's a hopper car and it's blue so

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.020 
car it's a hopper car and it's blue so
anyway<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:07.020> hopper<00:01:07.530> car<00:01:07.740> even<00:01:08.190> though<00:01:08.399> it<00:01:08.790> is

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
from the nine volt train era it will

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.730 
from the nine volt train era it will
connect<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.729> any<00:01:12.090> other<00:01:12.390> Lego<00:01:13.110> trains<00:01:13.560> from

1991 that's very early in the nine-volt
era<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.799> classic<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.940> me<00:01:30.120> it's<00:01:30.360> one<00:01:30.510> of

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
era it is a classic to me it's one of

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.500 
era it is a classic to me it's one of
the<00:01:30.690> better-looking<00:01:31.110> hopper<00:01:31.710> cars<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.510> it

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
the better-looking hopper cars and it

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.719 
the better-looking hopper cars and it
would<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.750> nice<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.200> have<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.440> whole<00:01:34.920> fleet<00:01:35.700> of

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
would be nice to have a whole fleet of

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.870 
would be nice to have a whole fleet of
these<00:01:36.000> like<00:01:36.540> several<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.500> them<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:38.159> put<00:01:38.400> in<00:01:38.729> a

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
these like several of them to put in a

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.219 
these like several of them to put in a
train<00:01:39.150> because<00:01:39.510> usually<00:01:39.659> when<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.080> see

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
train because usually when you see

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.990 
train because usually when you see
hopper<00:01:40.530> cars<00:01:40.770> are<00:01:41.070> usually<00:01:41.430> bunched<00:01:41.850> together

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
hopper cars are usually bunched together

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.289 
hopper cars are usually bunched together
a<00:01:42.540> whole<00:01:43.140> slew<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.500> them<00:01:43.680> in<00:01:44.010> fact<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.430> often<00:01:44.790> see

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
a whole slew of them in fact I often see

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.719 
a whole slew of them in fact I often see
trains<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.470> are<00:01:46.590> nothing<00:01:46.799> but<00:01:47.130> hopper<00:01:47.490> cars

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
trains that are nothing but hopper cars

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.340 
trains that are nothing but hopper cars
especially<00:01:47.940> the<00:01:48.450> coal<00:01:48.630> trains<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.200> are

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
especially the coal trains that are

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.890 
especially the coal trains that are
taking<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:49.920> coal<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.340> power<00:01:50.580> plants<00:01:51.000> or

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
taking the coal to the power plants or

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.560 
taking the coal to the power plants or
you<00:01:51.990> might<00:01:52.170> see<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.380> gravel<00:01:52.799> train<00:01:53.100> or<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.909> grain

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
you might see a gravel train or a grain

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.149 
you might see a gravel train or a grain
train<00:01:55.350> or<00:01:55.560> something<00:01:55.680> like<00:01:55.920> that

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
train or something like that

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.130 
train or something like that
this<00:01:56.369> one's<00:01:56.580> carrying<00:01:57.090> 1<00:01:57.270> by<00:01:57.420> 1<00:01:57.630> round<00:01:57.780> bricks

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
this one's carrying 1 by 1 round bricks

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.649 
this one's carrying 1 by 1 round bricks
whatever<00:01:59.130> those<00:01:59.310> represent<00:01:59.939> because<00:02:00.180> some<00:02:00.630> of

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
whatever those represent because some of

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.960 
whatever those represent because some of
them<00:02:00.840> are<00:02:00.930> yellow<00:02:01.159> and<00:02:02.159> some<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.610> them<00:02:02.790> are

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
them are yellow and some of them are

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.899 
them are yellow and some of them are
black<00:02:03.229> it<00:02:04.229> only<00:02:04.409> has<00:02:04.650> 2<00:02:04.860> stickers<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.670> train

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
black it only has 2 stickers the train

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.830 
black it only has 2 stickers the train
logo<00:02:06.360> which<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:06.840> on<00:02:07.220> either<00:02:08.220> side<00:02:08.630> it<00:02:09.630> does

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
logo which is on either side it does

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.600 
logo which is on either side it does
work<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.709> actually<00:02:11.209> you<00:02:12.209> can<00:02:12.480> dump<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.320> load

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
work and actually you can dump the load

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.090 
work and actually you can dump the load
at<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.850> station<00:02:15.299> here<00:02:15.560> so<00:02:16.560> that's<00:02:16.769> pretty

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
at the station here so that's pretty

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.750 
at the station here so that's pretty
neat<00:02:17.340> let's<00:02:18.030> do<00:02:18.180> that<00:02:18.470> alright<00:02:19.500> taking<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.220> 1

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
neat let's do that alright taking the 1

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.590 
neat let's do that alright taking the 1
by<00:02:20.910> 1<00:02:21.150> round<00:02:21.860> bricks<00:02:23.030> out<00:02:24.030> of<00:02:24.180> there<00:02:24.299> now<00:02:24.540> I'm

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
by 1 round bricks out of there now I'm

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.140 
by 1 round bricks out of there now I'm
going<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.840> dump<00:02:25.019> them<00:02:25.140> in<00:02:25.320> there<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:26.150> let's

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
going to dump them in there and let's

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.839 
going to dump them in there and let's
see<00:02:27.299> if<00:02:27.329> this<00:02:27.480> works<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:28.340> think<00:02:29.340> you<00:02:29.430> push<00:02:29.670> this

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
see if this works I think you push this

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.449 
see if this works I think you push this
lever<00:02:30.090> down<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.260> dumps<00:02:31.440> them<00:02:31.650> out<00:02:31.830> didn't

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
lever down and it dumps them out didn't

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.930 
lever down and it dumps them out didn't
dump<00:02:32.610> all<00:02:32.790> over

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
dump all over

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.930 
dump all over
try<00:02:34.930> again<00:02:35.080> oh<00:02:37.950> do<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:39.040> really<00:02:39.160> yeah<00:02:39.670> there<00:02:39.880> we

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
try again oh do you really yeah there we

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.540 
try again oh do you really yeah there we
go<00:02:40.000> so<00:02:40.990> that's<00:02:41.080> how<00:02:41.290> it<00:02:41.380> works<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:42.220> basically

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
go so that's how it works you basically

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.520 
go so that's how it works you basically
got<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:42.970> sloped<00:02:43.300> bricks<00:02:43.630> in<00:02:44.020> there<00:02:44.230> so

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
got the sloped bricks in there so

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.980 
got the sloped bricks in there so
nothing<00:02:44.830> can<00:02:45.130> really<00:02:45.280> get<00:02:45.520> stuck<00:02:45.850> so<00:02:46.810> that's

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
nothing can really get stuck so that's
