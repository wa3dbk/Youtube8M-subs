00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.610
 hello friends of the plants today I'm going to 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.369
 talk about an indoor plant that 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.789
 call sant pauli this plant is also 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:19.590
 known as the African violet for 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.530
 that you see a little here we have a 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.650
 shows one pink and one of 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.750
 white color as you can see so that you 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.840
 deis tells a little bit about how is this 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.820
 I'll show plant leaves his 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.680
 Leaves are beautiful as hairy 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.329
 say that he has a little hair is very 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.790
 important that when I return this 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.860
 plant not women never leaves nor 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.960
 the leaves or the area as they are very 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.510
 delicate and rot very quickly 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.690
 you will see how he cut and I one of the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.730
 flowers and they are already withered we will open 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.030
 and we will cut it 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.920
 from below this type of flower and 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.380
 we can remove 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.870
 here we have another one too 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.750
 in this way you will make the plant 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.480
 bloom again and do not have 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.870
 that suffer so much let's talk about the 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.300
 fertilizers you can have two types 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.700
 the liquid fertilizers that you buy 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.440
 the little bottle and there will give you the dose 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.510
 more or less that you have to throw in the 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.750
 water and if not there are also the bars 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.060
 how are you different types and sizes or 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.280
 be more or less without depends on the pot 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.440
 then you will have a bigger bar or 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.060
 smaller in this case is too much 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.770
 great for here but it would work 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.750
 perfectly more than anything so that what 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.100
 see what we will do is introduce the 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.900
 bar on the earth and so you leave it 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.070
 this way when we are 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.170
 watering will penetrate and so will go 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.780
 falling apart and it will be a good food 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.180
 for our indoor plant remember 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.759
 that the golden samp can last you for 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.590
 many months since it blooms for almost 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.780
 all year long remember that you have a 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.820
 wide range of color and apart that goes 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.970
 to decorate that beautiful corner of 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.300
 your house 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.300
 Thank you
