to make the beyblade long launcher I

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:29.919 
to make the beyblade long launcher I
will<00:00:23.929> use<00:00:24.320> a<00:00:25.929> ripcord<00:00:26.929> launcher<00:00:28.929> electrical

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929

clippers the first step of making the
long<00:00:38.120> launcher<00:00:38.630> is<00:00:39.050> to<00:00:39.230> take<00:00:39.440> the<00:00:40.010> handle<00:00:40.520> off

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
ripcord launcher using electrical tape

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.330 
ripcord launcher using electrical tape
first<00:01:07.790> you<00:01:08.540> wrap<00:01:08.870> the<00:01:09.200> tape<00:01:09.500> around<00:01:09.530> the

next you wrap the tape around the

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.660 
next you wrap the tape around the
launcher<00:01:24.729> be<00:01:25.729> careful<00:01:26.299> not<00:01:26.810> to<00:01:27.259> get<00:01:27.530> on<00:01:28.040> the

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
launcher be careful not to get on the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:35.530 
launcher be careful not to get on the
