00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
which isn't kind of receiver the

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.670 
which isn't kind of receiver the
connection<00:00:27.330> sometimes<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:28.140> was<00:00:28.230> bad<00:00:28.529> or

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
connection sometimes it was bad or

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
something so the fix that seems data

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.380 
something so the fix that seems data
transfer<00:00:31.710> also<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.160> some<00:00:32.430> third-party

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
transfer also to some third-party

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.860 
transfer also to some third-party
devices<00:00:34.550> they<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:36.059> should<00:00:36.270> also<00:00:36.420> be<00:00:36.570> better

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
devices they it should also be better

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.729 
devices they it should also be better
now<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.800> also<00:00:38.460> mail<00:00:38.820> had<00:00:39.180> some<00:00:39.590> problems<00:00:40.590> with

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
now and also mail had some problems with

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.580 
now and also mail had some problems with
attachments<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:42.059> think<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.020> wasn't<00:00:43.320> super

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
attachments I think that it wasn't super

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.209 
attachments I think that it wasn't super
super<00:00:44.100> secure<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:44.760> they<00:00:44.879> also<00:00:45.059> fixed<00:00:45.450> that

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
super secure so they also fixed that

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:51.319 
super secure so they also fixed that
which<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:48.079> quite<00:00:49.079> nice<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.680> have<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.190> say<00:00:50.370> quite

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
which is quite nice I have to say quite

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.260 
which is quite nice I have to say quite
nice<00:00:51.629> quite<00:00:51.930> nice<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.160> then<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:53.879> could<00:00:54.149> also

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
nice quite nice and then it could also

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.270 
nice quite nice and then it could also
be<00:00:54.360> some<00:00:54.629> other<00:00:54.840> bug<00:00:55.110> fixes<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
be some other bug fixes in the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.189 
be some other bug fixes in the
background<00:00:56.730> probably<00:00:57.680> but<00:00:58.680> overall<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.430> mean

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
background probably but overall I mean

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.020 
background probably but overall I mean
there's<00:01:01.199> nothing<00:01:01.670> really<00:01:02.670> really

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
there's nothing really really

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.060 
there's nothing really really
interesting<00:01:03.449> about<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.780> update<00:01:03.989> but<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.769> was

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
interesting about this update but I was

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.830 
interesting about this update but I was
think<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.519> might<00:01:05.729> be<00:01:05.760> able<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.119> continue

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
think that you might be able to continue

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.830 
think that you might be able to continue
to<00:01:06.960> jailbreak<00:01:07.640> wait<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.850> was<00:01:09.090> some<00:01:09.360> point<00:01:09.570> one

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
to jailbreak wait I was some point one

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.170 
to jailbreak wait I was some point one
point<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.350> say<00:01:11.100> my<00:01:11.159> sweet<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.610> have<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.790> simple

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
moment one I was some point one but one

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.270 
moment one I was some point one but one
got<00:01:15.210> released<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.869> April<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.920> think<00:01:17.159> in

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
March Apple released iOS 0.1 so they

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.490 
March Apple released iOS 0.1 so they
usually<00:01:20.970> they<00:01:21.420> don't<00:01:21.600> release<00:01:21.930> many<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.320> those
