which as you see here will still allow

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:43.670 
which as you see here will still allow
me<00:03:40.720> to<00:03:40.840> recruit<00:03:41.109> the<00:03:41.139> native<00:03:41.560> units<00:03:41.889> and

counter-attack<00:03:49.690> and<00:03:49.989> then<00:03:50.199> I<00:03:50.319> can<00:03:50.470> launch<00:03:50.680> my

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
all that ambitious for the most part so

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.920 
all that ambitious for the most part so
after<00:04:26.860> in<00:04:27.640> a<00:04:27.760> while<00:04:27.940> I<00:04:27.970> can<00:04:28.300> look<00:04:28.450> at<00:04:28.540> them<00:04:28.660> and

I'll show you guys what I plan to do so

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.360 
I'll show you guys what I plan to do so
here<00:04:34.330> I<00:04:34.360> thought<00:04:34.780> about<00:04:35.020> invading<00:04:35.320> and<00:04:35.650> I'm

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
here I thought about invading and I'm

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.400 
here I thought about invading and I'm
just<00:04:36.760> seeing<00:04:37.360> what<00:04:37.570> units<00:04:37.900> I<00:04:37.990> should<00:04:38.230> leave

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
just seeing what units I should leave

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.140 
just seeing what units I should leave
behind<00:04:38.740> a<00:04:38.890> control<00:04:39.160> the<00:04:39.250> population<00:04:39.850> but<00:04:40.000> as

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
behind a control the population but as

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.490 
behind a control the population but as
you<00:04:40.300> can<00:04:40.420> see<00:04:40.570> they're<00:04:40.750> still<00:04:40.900> kind<00:04:41.050> of<00:04:41.110> angry

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
you can see they're still kind of angry

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.410 
you can see they're still kind of angry
even<00:04:42.190> if<00:04:42.280> I<00:04:42.370> give<00:04:42.490> them<00:04:42.700> a<00:04:42.910> tax<00:04:43.480> break<00:04:43.690> and<00:04:45.420> by

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
even if I give them a tax break and by

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.030 
even if I give them a tax break and by
the<00:04:46.480> time<00:04:46.600> I<00:04:46.930> start<00:04:47.200> leaving<00:04:47.350> behind<00:04:47.620> so<00:04:48.010> many

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
the time I start leaving behind so many

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.100 
the time I start leaving behind so many
units<00:04:48.580> the<00:04:48.910> invasion<00:04:49.210> force<00:04:49.600> isn't<00:04:49.810> really

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
units the invasion force isn't really

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.590 
units the invasion force isn't really
that<00:04:50.230> large<00:04:50.560> and<00:04:50.920> I'm<00:04:51.310> worried<00:04:51.730> it<00:04:52.210> won't<00:04:52.420> be

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
that large and I'm worried it won't be

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.850 
that large and I'm worried it won't be
able<00:04:52.720> to<00:04:52.840> hold<00:04:52.990> a<00:04:53.200> city<00:04:53.440> if<00:04:53.620> they<00:04:53.770> capture<00:04:53.950> it

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
able to hold a city if they capture it

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.810 
able to hold a city if they capture it
capturing<00:04:56.860> the<00:04:56.920> city<00:04:57.190> doesn't<00:04:57.400> seem<00:04:57.670> like

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
capturing the city doesn't seem like

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.130 
capturing the city doesn't seem like
it'll<00:04:57.970> be<00:04:58.060> a<00:04:58.150> problem<00:04:58.480> because<00:04:58.720> it's<00:04:58.990> so

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
it'll be a problem because it's so

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.350 
it'll be a problem because it's so
poorly<00:04:59.410> defended<00:04:59.800> but<00:05:00.220> they<00:05:00.940> could<00:05:01.090> launch<00:05:01.240> a

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
poorly defended but they could launch a

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.120 
poorly defended but they could launch a
counter-attack<00:05:01.810> and<00:05:02.200> easily<00:05:02.620> take<00:05:02.800> it<00:05:02.950> back

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
counter-attack and easily take it back

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.650 
counter-attack and easily take it back
if<00:05:03.340> I<00:05:03.430> don't<00:05:03.610> have<00:05:03.730> enough<00:05:03.940> defending<00:05:04.390> forces

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
if I don't have enough defending forces

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:10.200 
if I don't have enough defending forces
and<00:05:06.120> I<00:05:07.120> have<00:05:07.420> um<00:05:07.750> if<00:05:08.440> I<00:05:08.590> combine<00:05:08.770> those<00:05:09.220> might

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
and I have um if I combine those might

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.240 
and I have um if I combine those might
my<00:05:10.780> armies<00:05:11.200> in<00:05:11.350> the<00:05:11.380> lower<00:05:11.620> three<00:05:11.950> territories

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
my armies in the lower three territories

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.200 
my armies in the lower three territories
it<00:05:13.150> would<00:05:13.330> actually<00:05:13.480> be<00:05:13.840> a<00:05:14.500> pretty<00:05:15.070> good<00:05:15.940> sized

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
it would actually be a pretty good sized

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.290 
it would actually be a pretty good sized
army<00:05:16.540> to<00:05:16.810> deal<00:05:16.960> with<00:05:17.169> the<00:05:17.290> Cherokee<00:05:17.740> and<00:05:18.300> I'm

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
army to deal with the Cherokee and I'm

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.090 
army to deal with the Cherokee and I'm
actually<00:05:19.750> considering<00:05:20.290> that<00:05:20.590> but<00:05:20.800> the<00:05:20.919> thing

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
actually considering that but the thing

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.800 
actually considering that but the thing
is<00:05:21.130> the<00:05:21.370> Cherokee<00:05:21.669> still<00:05:21.850> have<00:05:21.970> their<00:05:22.180> small

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
is the Cherokee still have their small

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.140 
is the Cherokee still have their small
like<00:05:23.110> raiding<00:05:23.530> forces<00:05:24.040> and<00:05:24.370> if<00:05:24.610> I<00:05:24.760> leave<00:05:24.940> one

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
like raiding forces and if I leave one

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.700 
like raiding forces and if I leave one
of<00:05:25.270> the<00:05:25.390> city's<00:05:25.780> undefended<00:05:26.350> it<00:05:26.440> could<00:05:26.560> be<00:05:26.680> a

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
of the city's undefended it could be a

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:37.380 
of the city's undefended it could be a
real<00:05:26.919> problem<00:05:33.810> and<00:05:35.580> some<00:05:36.580> people<00:05:36.850> mentioned

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
real problem and some people mentioned

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:42.290 
real problem and some people mentioned
that<00:05:37.720> I<00:05:37.780> should<00:05:38.110> skip<00:05:38.350> the<00:05:38.410> CPU<00:05:39.100> moves<00:05:39.400> and<00:05:40.260> I

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
that I should skip the CPU moves and I

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.370 
that I should skip the CPU moves and I
considered<00:05:43.300> that<00:05:43.480> and<00:05:43.660> actually<00:05:43.810> decided<00:05:44.320> it

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
considered that and actually decided it

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.290 
considered that and actually decided it
was<00:05:44.470> kind<00:05:44.680> of<00:05:44.740> a<00:05:44.830> good<00:05:44.950> idea<00:05:45.220> but<00:05:45.490> whenever<00:05:46.090> I

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
was kind of a good idea but whenever I

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.440 
was kind of a good idea but whenever I
click<00:05:46.510> game<00:05:46.930> options<00:05:47.169> in<00:05:47.650> options<00:05:48.460> it<00:05:49.120> freezes
