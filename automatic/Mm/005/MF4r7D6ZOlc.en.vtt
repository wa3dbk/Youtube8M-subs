00:00:03.519 --> 00:00:03.529 
morning practices just for some reason

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:06.289 
morning practices just for some reason
grandfathered<00:00:04.529> in<00:00:04.680> is<00:00:04.890> to<00:00:05.100> a<00:00:05.130> very<00:00:05.819> important

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
grandfathered in is to a very important

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.330 
grandfathered in is to a very important
aspect<00:00:06.359> of<00:00:06.750> swim<00:00:06.990> training<00:00:07.230> I<00:00:07.560> think<00:00:08.160> it<00:00:08.250> was

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
aspect of swim training I think it was

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.200 
aspect of swim training I think it was
some<00:00:08.550> time<00:00:09.300> back<00:00:09.540> in<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.980> 70s<00:00:10.980> or<00:00:11.160> sick<00:00:12.030> late

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
some time back in the 70s or sick late

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.350 
some time back in the 70s or sick late
60s<00:00:12.690> maybe<00:00:12.870> they<00:00:13.559> had<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.950> relate<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.150> Cold

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
60s maybe they had to relate to the Cold

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.060 
60s maybe they had to relate to the Cold
War<00:00:15.420> but<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.929> Russians<00:00:16.109> started<00:00:16.680> doing<00:00:16.920> like

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
War but the Russians started doing like

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.019 
War but the Russians started doing like
crazy<00:00:17.369> amounts<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:18.710> yardage<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.029> practices

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
crazy amounts of yardage and practices

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.150 
crazy amounts of yardage and practices
and<00:00:21.300> they'd<00:00:21.689> started<00:00:22.050> doing<00:00:22.350> doubles<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:23.010> the

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
and they'd started doing doubles so the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.640 
and they'd started doing doubles so the
Americans<00:00:23.640> had<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.970> start<00:00:24.840> doing<00:00:25.109> doubles<00:00:25.470> and

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
Americans had to start doing doubles and

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.740 
Americans had to start doing doubles and
it's<00:00:25.769> always<00:00:25.920> kind<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.250> been<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.460> part<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.849> part

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
it's always kind of been a part of part

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.110 
it's always kind of been a part of part
of<00:00:27.840> it

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:29.120 
of it

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.240 
of it
only<00:00:29.840> difference<00:00:30.020> with<00:00:30.350> my<00:00:30.500> training<00:00:30.830> program

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
only difference with my training program

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.340 
only difference with my training program
compared<00:00:31.700> to<00:00:31.880> maybe<00:00:32.210> some<00:00:32.450> other<00:00:32.600> colleges<00:00:33.110> is

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
compared to maybe some other colleges is

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.450 
compared to maybe some other colleges is
we<00:00:34.130> do<00:00:34.250> a<00:00:34.280> lot<00:00:34.490> more<00:00:34.550> weight<00:00:34.910> training

out<00:02:10.580> now<00:02:10.789> as<00:02:11.090> opposed<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.629> later<00:02:11.950> but<00:02:12.950> I<00:02:12.980> think

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:13.129 
out now as opposed to later but I think

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.059

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.850 

so<00:02:40.730> I<00:02:40.760> kind<00:02:41.300> of<00:02:41.360> like<00:02:41.540> it<00:02:41.570> and<00:02:41.930> I<00:02:42.320> like<00:02:42.350> lifting

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
so I kind of like it and I like lifting

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.460

as<00:02:42.980> a<00:02:43.010> group<00:02:43.820> so<00:02:44.150> I<00:02:44.390> wouldn't<00:02:45.110> change<00:02:45.260> it<00:02:45.410> right

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
as a group so I wouldn't change it right

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.590 
as a group so I wouldn't change it right
now<00:02:45.740> no<00:02:46.580> it's<00:02:46.730> actually<00:02:46.850> really<00:02:47.180> good<00:02:47.390> because

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
now no it's actually really good because

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
now no it's actually really good because
we're<00:02:48.560> able<00:02:48.740> to<00:02:49.330> get<00:02:50.330> a<00:02:50.360> significant<00:02:51.110> part<00:02:51.320> of

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
we're able to get a significant part of

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.010 
we're able to get a significant part of
our<00:02:52.040> commitments<00:02:52.550> out<00:02:52.670> of<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.850> way<00:02:53.020> before

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
discipline I think there's some that

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.100 
discipline I think there's some that
handled<00:03:48.520> it<00:03:48.580> really<00:03:48.730> well<00:03:48.880> and<00:03:49.270> prioritizing

handled it really well and prioritizing
time<00:03:50.290> properly<00:03:50.620> I<00:03:50.890> think<00:03:51.160> there's<00:03:51.340> some<00:03:51.580> that

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
time properly I think there's some that

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.110 
time properly I think there's some that
can't<00:03:53.590> balance<00:03:53.860> it<00:03:54.160> and<00:03:54.340> have<00:03:54.489> to<00:03:54.640> get<00:03:54.820> rid<00:03:55.060> of

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
can't balance it and have to get rid of

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.960 
can't balance it and have to get rid of
something<00:03:55.450> and<00:03:55.750> sometimes<00:03:56.140> swimming<00:03:56.820> in<00:03:57.820> a

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
program such as this they have to drop

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.729 
program such as this they have to drop
it<00:04:00.360> but<00:04:01.360> i<00:04:01.390> also<00:04:01.570> think<00:04:01.870> those<00:04:02.350> that<00:04:02.620> get

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
it but i also think those that get

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.030 
it but i also think those that get
through<00:04:03.930> you<00:04:04.930> know<00:04:05.050> make<00:04:05.290> great<00:04:05.560> employees

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
through you know make great employees

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.190 
through you know make great employees
and<00:04:06.250> you<00:04:07.000> know<00:04:07.120> really<00:04:07.150> develop<00:04:07.870> a<00:04:07.930> strong

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
and you know really develop a strong

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.070 
and you know really develop a strong
work<00:04:08.440> ethic<00:04:08.620> and<00:04:09.090> properly<00:04:10.090> managing<00:04:10.900> their

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
work ethic and properly managing their

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.350 
work ethic and properly managing their
time<00:04:11.110> and<00:04:11.560> I<00:04:12.400> mean<00:04:12.790> that's<00:04:12.910> why<00:04:13.030> you<00:04:13.090> see<00:04:13.269> a<00:04:13.300> lot

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
time and I mean that's why you see a lot

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.090 
time and I mean that's why you see a lot
of<00:04:13.480> employers<00:04:13.900> looking<00:04:14.500> for<00:04:14.739> student

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
of employers looking for student

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.949 
of employers looking for student
athletes<00:04:15.130> and<00:04:15.640> I<00:04:15.880> think<00:04:16.390> especially<00:04:16.450> at<00:04:16.870> the

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
athletes and I think especially at the

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.960 
athletes and I think especially at the
d3<00:04:17.410> levels<00:04:17.709> i'm<00:04:17.889> not<00:04:18.070> here<00:04:18.250> getting<00:04:18.549> paid<00:04:18.729> for

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
d3 levels i'm not here getting paid for

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:19.780 
d3 levels i'm not here getting paid for
it<00:04:19.030> but

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
it but

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.550 
it but
because<00:04:20.120> they<00:04:20.240> love<00:04:20.450> it<00:04:20.480> and<00:04:20.780> it<00:04:21.140> shows<00:04:21.350> that

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
because they love it and it shows that

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
because they love it and it shows that
even<00:04:21.860> more<00:04:22.280> I<00:04:23.240> think<00:04:24.220> stronger<00:04:25.220> side<00:04:25.430> of

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
even more I think stronger side of

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.390 
even more I think stronger side of
discipline<00:04:26.030> and<00:04:26.150> sacrifice
