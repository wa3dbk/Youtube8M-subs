00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.750
 but 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.160
 in the Canary Islands you can ask who 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:32.480
 for me better fish result without place 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:35.800
 to doubts it is short because they work 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.800
 directly with others 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.670
 what are those who are achieving the 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:46.670
 traceability and traceability 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.670
 sustainability 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.700
 It's an international issue 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.600
 this fish last night on a plane in the 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.600
 sea 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.970
 but we are always nine 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:17.970
 I do not think so 

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:26.759
 and when you are tasting this 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:26.759
 I will open 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.440
 how is the freezing process is very 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.510
 important to us when the 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.020
 trophy atom we do not cut and what 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.540
 we leave the tacos 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.740
 Yes Yes 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.740
 we dry it 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:57.550
 with special paper especially what 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.550
 important 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.430
 with center see what is coming 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.670
 that is Japanese the oil is worth because 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.780
 there are many that aromatizan of a moment 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.780
 but then it goes 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.920
 like when they kissed 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:33.239
 deep in the 'top blanket' then 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:33.239
 let's add sesame oil 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.409
 and the same is quite the same amount 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:43.780
 of oil the same amount of sauce 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:46.499
 Soy that the best of all is the same 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.499
 amount of oil 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:03.930
 and super 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:29.139
 but the Japanese who have refined 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:33.150
 you have taught the sauce so much because 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:33.150
 eat natural better 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.579
 then you have to recognize it 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.040
 many years ago 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.320
 and if we add to this 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.330
 salad 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.510
 to the 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.890
 it makes less for them we're going to go back 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.830
 waka waka 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.250
 good i have to 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:38.960
 I'm going to put what I do 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:41.960
 with this vegetable 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.960
 here 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.150
 a block 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.139
 and the natural 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:55.420
 nothing you are not 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:58.570

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.570
 nothing else 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.260
 There are some that have many 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.310
 who said I want to eat 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.790

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.030

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:16.190
