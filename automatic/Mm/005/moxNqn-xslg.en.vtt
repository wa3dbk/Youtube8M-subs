00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.490
 Ferrer nicer at Veer and Uecker place also just confirmed Kramper 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:05.510
 the 1 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.040
 Rabat 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.389
 well, nice thing 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.389
 Lawrence travel 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.150
 or alternatively both wm-places 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.130
 before a game in the gamepad 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.130
 then I heard somehow unfit way too little 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.050
 maybe honest and free 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.690
 administered 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.470
 it definitely makes perfect sense 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.470
 so free throws sold ITIL before 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.270
 Gilroy texted Pike 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.750
 Fact on noone mind 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.310
 that too was broken off too soon Kabul 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.140
 the tool will not work 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.720
 Mr. Frigge want 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.720
 With that he awakens take over here 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.360
 this early +3 8 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.030
 but no matter 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.030
 another fixed point 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.840
 for chips he grabs 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.390
 Hackers could 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.310
 Löw was just I like to squeeze it off 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.449
 7 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:15.449
 You know that differently 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.049
 he integrated 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.829
 there percent 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:53.139
 not even close 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.619
 there were 

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:57.619
 colorful splendor 

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:05.079
 the hall shakes 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.079
 Oppenheim Deuce 

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:13.119
 which helped 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:20.619
 whether Brückner or so what masters very powerful 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:26.439
 to 7 to 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:30.909
 is 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.499
 next to some he means 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:40.879
 after a few months 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.879
 I have for this church 

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:50.789
 Well, thanks 

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:53.789
 I do not like me either 

00:03:57.249 --> 00:04:00.870
 So the song had a different process. "Value in 1 is maybe her 

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:01.759
 excrete 

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:04.759
 tan / ap the monsters for the first time 

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:11.059
 I would not expect percent No 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.919
 you still have to do that what is going on I am looking forward to the pleasure of CNY 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.349
 before that does not work 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.409
 the events of the presbytery 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:30.850
 there are all Mazda MPV should have 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.550
 not tried so well 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.949
 the act is through as fortified 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.949
 Hura's words 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.990
 Real meets her 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:51.569
 in an obvious way 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:55.129
 contains at the same time 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:00.680
 but 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.889
 more available with which he seems to have full logic in a playground 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.889
 I would have talked a lot over the top two races 

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:15.029
 perhaps 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:19.479
 her grandchildren too 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:23.659
 do not think go up 

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:27.219
 heights 

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:33.309
 because of evasion the EKD is not planned 

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:36.309
 but much more fun 

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:40.979
 Foresters too 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.979
 After this train I wanted to say 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:56.949
 I have to zol the palm 

00:05:57.559 --> 00:06:00.249
 Tjarks me 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:03.169
 the 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:04.569
 Dreyer 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:07.569
 Oran flows back 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:11.149
 from 2 1 percent go up to 7 

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:14.080
 I'm trying everything 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.069
 Lehtinen 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:18.969
 8th 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:21.969
 Piece too far straight through more openness 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.819
 Manno 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:31.059
 I do not believe such a thing but for an essay the events and sing or 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.400
 therefore are on the other end also against Muenster otherwise I could yes 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.789
 take another leap h 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:41.219
 Suter MMX 

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:43.699
 sec 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:45.569
 that's 2 percent 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:47.629
 this Polanski l 

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:49.389
 did you build that too? 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:52.029
 So let me call 

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:55.499
 Excited Gutzler reveals something but already
