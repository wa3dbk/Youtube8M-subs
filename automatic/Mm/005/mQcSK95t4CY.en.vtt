 place all these elements I'm going to 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.360
 put my page in my base then 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.739
 well I already hit 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.060
 I'm putting here in the role of 

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:06.239
 background I do not know if you can distinguish 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.310
 which has as numbers that is one of the 

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:09.239
 elements that I am going to use 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.220
 representative in my work as 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.290
 many of you know I'm an accountant 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.269
 and well obviously it has to do 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.500
 with the numbers there stick a 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.270
 calculator 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.550
 with a little Velcro so that I 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.750
 allow it to close the folder and 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.430
 with that let it open and close and 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.870
 well I tell you place a calculator 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.300
 because the last element then is 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.000
 place several items that have 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.830
 several or one element or several that have 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.110
 what to do with your work I tell you 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.959
 draw this little calculator and the 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.850
 I put there and as you saw are you see this is 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.100
 the milestone that I love about a glass of 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.170
 coffee in first it is both blank and 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.690
 then in pink to put the plaster and 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.489
 paint up with a little milk that 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.310
 I think that this is also an element that 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.440
 has a lot to do with my work with 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.690
 the jobs that I've been in and 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.180
 well here I'm going to put some banners with 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.340
 the little piece of this pink that I had left 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.040
 that I used also in coffee and good 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.600
 I'm going to outline the title a bit like 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.140
 they saw the banners there I'm going to make a 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:13.190
 false stitched in min 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.650
 in my decorated paper background and in the 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.720
 folder where I wrote a little bit 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.459
 text of what is my work in the 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.560
 top part that I also have left my 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.270
 page a bit empty I will place other 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.640
 elements that I also think that they have 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.470
 what to do with my job, how are these 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.850
 milestones that good things were going to seal us 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.340
 but I remembered that I already had 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.230
 sealed I will also put a watch and 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.300

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.069
 cuts and how do I tell you these elements 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.720
 I think they have a lot to do 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.570
 with my work and with the jobs that I have 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.690
 I was also going to put these little houses 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.580
 that mean to me what they mean 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.800
 that many times the work then 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.810
 come back to our house we did not pass the 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.360
 most of the time there many times 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.030
 and this is what it represents and well 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.670
 I'm going to color a little bit more 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.260
 the elements that I put that are as in 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.150
 black and white to make them look a little 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.500
 more colorful and well that's how I 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.760
 My page is left as I tell you the truth 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.860

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.799
