00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
give you a weak demonstration now it's

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.470 
give you a weak demonstration now it's
really<00:00:29.830> cool<00:00:30.160> I<00:00:30.189> was<00:00:30.640> even<00:00:30.910> really

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
really cool I was even really

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.790 
really cool I was even really
considering<00:00:31.960> by<00:00:32.050> giving<00:00:32.320> away<00:00:32.439> this<00:00:32.590> trick

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
considering by giving away this trick

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.189 
considering by giving away this trick
but<00:00:33.010> because<00:00:33.340> of<00:00:33.370> soap<00:00:33.780> cause<00:00:34.780> it's<00:00:34.900> so<00:00:34.960> cool

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:35.199 
but because of soap cause it's so cool

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:37.350 
but because of soap cause it's so cool
but<00:00:35.379> I<00:00:35.620> decided<00:00:35.949> Leon<00:00:36.340> just<00:00:36.670> to<00:00:36.820> do<00:00:36.940> it<00:00:36.970> anyway

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
but I decided Leon just to do it anyway

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.020 
but I decided Leon just to do it anyway
so<00:00:37.500> that's<00:00:38.500> what<00:00:38.680> it<00:00:38.739> should<00:00:38.800> look<00:00:38.890> like<00:00:39.040> for

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
so that's what it should look like for

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.780 
so that's what it should look like for
you'd<00:00:44.010> pretty<00:00:45.010> cool<00:00:45.190> don't<00:00:45.370> you<00:00:45.400> think<00:00:45.460> I'll

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
you'd pretty cool don't you think I'll

well I got a little hold then one hands
at<00:01:52.119> the<00:01:52.180> bottom<00:01:52.450> you<00:01:52.509> only<00:01:52.600> capture<00:01:52.869> it

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
at the bottom you only capture it

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.620 
at the bottom you only capture it
between<00:01:53.439> your<00:01:53.710> fingers<00:01:54.009> like<00:01:54.040> so<00:01:54.400> I'm<00:01:54.759> just

you go so that's the trick I'll show
from<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.479> side<00:02:01.659> just<00:02:02.140> we<00:02:02.439> can<00:02:02.560> get<00:02:02.680> that<00:02:03.630> look

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
from the side just we can get that look

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.819 
from the side just we can get that look
