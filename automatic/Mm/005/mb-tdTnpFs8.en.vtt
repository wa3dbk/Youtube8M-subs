is the an-94 just such an absolute beast
of<00:02:22.380> a<00:02:22.440> weapon<00:02:22.620> here<00:02:22.890> in<00:02:22.950> aftermath<00:02:23.370> well

of a weapon here in aftermath well
there's<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:23.940> couple<00:02:24.120> of<00:02:24.360> different<00:02:24.690> reasons

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
there's a couple of different reasons

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.690 
there's a couple of different reasons
and<00:02:25.200> actually<00:02:25.590> one<00:02:25.740> of<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.860> biggest<00:02:26.160> ones<00:02:26.520> is

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
and actually one of the biggest ones is

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.990 
and actually one of the biggest ones is
that<00:02:26.760> because<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:28.370> different<00:02:29.370> engagement

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
that because of the different engagement

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.700 
that because of the different engagement
types<00:02:30.180> because<00:02:30.420> of<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.110> close<00:02:31.410> quarters

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
types because of the close quarters

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.310 
types because of the close quarters
medium<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.610> long<00:02:33.060> range<00:02:33.390> engagements<00:02:33.690> your

guys are immediately going to go to the

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.430 
guys are immediately going to go to the
m416<00:02:39.930> or<00:02:40.530> even<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:40.860> AUG<00:02:41.460> or<00:02:41.670> even<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.690> m16a3

m416 or even the AUG or even the m16a3
now<00:02:44.010> that's<00:02:44.190> those<00:02:44.580> three<00:02:44.970> weapons<00:02:45.120> are<00:02:45.510> good

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.910 
choices you can use them for that and
they'll<00:02:47.790> probably<00:02:48.030> do<00:02:48.240> pretty<00:02:48.270> well<00:02:48.920> however

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
they'll probably do pretty well however

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.570 
they'll probably do pretty well however
the<00:02:50.040> an-94<00:02:50.550> with<00:02:51.090> its<00:02:51.360> two-round<00:02:51.960> burst

was i was one of them i didn't know this

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.810 
was i was one of them i didn't know this
for<00:03:10.770> really<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.070> longest<00:03:11.400> time<00:03:11.430> when<00:03:11.730> it

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
for really the longest time when it

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.430 
for really the longest time when it
comes<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.240> the<00:03:12.360> two-round<00:03:12.720> burst<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.350> the

comes to the two-round burst and the

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.710

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
1200 RPM on it is that that's not

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.150 
1200 RPM on it is that that's not
necessarily<00:03:16.110> how<00:03:16.260> fast<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.710> two<00:03:16.830> bullets

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
necessarily how fast the two bullets

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.440 
necessarily how fast the two bullets
travel<00:03:17.430> together<00:03:17.520> but<00:03:17.880> it's<00:03:17.970> actually<00:03:18.360> the

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
travel together but it's actually the

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.240 
travel together but it's actually the
speed<00:03:18.750> in<00:03:18.900> which<00:03:18.930> you<00:03:19.320> can<00:03:19.500> pull<00:03:19.800> the<00:03:19.980> trigger

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
speed in which you can pull the trigger

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.910 
speed in which you can pull the trigger
to<00:03:20.850> get<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.270> max<00:03:21.600> fiery<00:03:22.140> out<00:03:22.500> of<00:03:22.590> this<00:03:22.680> weapon

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
to get the max fiery out of this weapon

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.580 
to get the max fiery out of this weapon
however<00:03:23.760> do<00:03:24.120> be<00:03:24.270> cautious<00:03:24.420> though<00:03:24.810> it<00:03:25.050> can<00:03:25.290> jam

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
however do be cautious though it can jam

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.140 
however do be cautious though it can jam
now<00:03:25.980> it's<00:03:26.160> possible<00:03:26.520> I'm<00:03:26.610> just<00:03:26.790> pulling<00:03:27.060> it

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
now it's possible I'm just pulling it

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.760 
now it's possible I'm just pulling it
the<00:03:27.240> trigger<00:03:27.420> at<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.720> wrong<00:03:27.930> time<00:03:28.320> however<00:03:28.560> I

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
the trigger at the wrong time however I

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.710 
the trigger at the wrong time however I
found<00:03:29.100> that<00:03:29.250> while<00:03:29.550> pulling<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.210> trigger<00:03:30.390> it

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
found that while pulling the trigger it

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.960 
found that while pulling the trigger it
just<00:03:31.230> will<00:03:31.410> stop<00:03:31.710> shooting<00:03:32.160> sometimes<00:03:32.550> so<00:03:32.820> it

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
just will stop shooting sometimes so it

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.430 
just will stop shooting sometimes so it
does<00:03:33.120> feel<00:03:33.330> like<00:03:33.450> it's<00:03:33.570> still<00:03:33.840> jamming<00:03:34.320> up

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
does feel like it's still jamming up

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.650 
does feel like it's still jamming up
maybe<00:03:35.040> it's<00:03:35.280> just<00:03:35.370> I'm<00:03:35.640> miss<00:03:35.850> clicking<00:03:36.210> on<00:03:36.390> my

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
maybe it's just I'm miss clicking on my

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.090 
maybe it's just I'm miss clicking on my
controller<00:03:37.110> as<00:03:37.260> far<00:03:37.440> as<00:03:37.560> pulling<00:03:37.830> the<00:03:37.920> trigger

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
controller as far as pulling the trigger

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.370 
controller as far as pulling the trigger
but<00:03:38.430> I<00:03:38.670> feel<00:03:39.510> that<00:03:39.630> it's<00:03:39.750> still<00:03:39.900> jamming<00:03:40.290> up

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
but I feel that it's still jamming up

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.100 
but I feel that it's still jamming up
anyways<00:03:40.910> because<00:03:41.910> of<00:03:42.240> the<00:03:42.300> fact<00:03:42.540> that<00:03:42.690> you<00:03:42.930> can

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
anyways because of the fact that you can

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.230 
anyways because of the fact that you can
basically<00:03:43.290> just<00:03:43.650> pull<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.430> trigger<00:03:44.730> as<00:03:44.940> fast

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
basically just pull the trigger as fast

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.580 
basically just pull the trigger as fast
as<00:03:45.390> you<00:03:45.450> can<00:03:45.630> on<00:03:45.780> stuff<00:03:45.959> that<00:03:46.080> you<00:03:46.170> can<00:03:46.410> get<00:03:46.530> a

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
as you can on stuff that you can get a

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.710 
as you can on stuff that you can get a
max<00:03:46.830> with<00:03:47.010> 1200<00:03:47.610> RPM<00:03:47.760> at<00:03:48.180> it<00:03:48.300> which<00:03:48.480> is<00:03:48.600> the

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
max with 1200 RPM at it which is the

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.740 
max with 1200 RPM at it which is the
fastest<00:03:49.410> in<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.620> game<00:03:50.130> I<00:03:50.430> say<00:03:51.209> again<00:03:51.240> that<00:03:51.630> is

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
fastest in the game I say again that is

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.350 
fastest in the game I say again that is
the<00:03:51.930> fastest<00:03:52.680> in<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.250> game<00:03:53.459> making<00:03:54.240> this

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
the fastest in the game making this

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.750 
the fastest in the game making this
weapon<00:03:54.720> very<00:03:55.200> formidable<00:03:55.620> in<00:03:55.950> close<00:03:56.220> quarters

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
weapon very formidable in close quarters

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.449 
weapon very formidable in close quarters
so<00:03:56.910> this<00:03:57.030> is<00:03:57.150> an<00:03:57.410> all-around<00:03:58.410> weapon<00:03:58.860> guys<00:03:59.250> if

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
so this is an all-around weapon guys if

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.850 
so this is an all-around weapon guys if
you<00:03:59.580> can<00:03:59.760> learn<00:03:59.970> to<00:04:00.480> master<00:04:00.959> when<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.500> pull<00:04:01.740> the

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
you can learn to master when to pull the

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.350 
you can learn to master when to pull the
trigger<00:04:01.890> to<00:04:02.250> get<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.490> max<00:04:02.700> fire<00:04:02.940> out<00:04:03.180> of<00:04:03.209> the

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
trigger to get the max fire out of the

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.240 
trigger to get the max fire out of the
gun<00:04:03.570> and<00:04:03.780> as<00:04:04.290> well<00:04:04.440> as<00:04:04.530> control<00:04:04.920> it<00:04:05.070> when<00:04:05.160> it

gun and as well as control it when it

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
recommend anything other than heavy

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.390 
recommend anything other than heavy
barrel<00:04:12.930> heavy<00:04:13.410> barrel<00:04:13.680> makes<00:04:13.860> this<00:04:14.010> weapon

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
barrel heavy barrel makes this weapon

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.010 
barrel heavy barrel makes this weapon
just<00:04:14.610> an<00:04:14.850> absolute<00:04:15.360> beast<00:04:15.390> you<00:04:15.720> can<00:04:15.870> use

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
barrel just increases as accuracy just

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.730 
barrel just increases as accuracy just
absurd<00:04:20.880> and<00:04:21.209> if<00:04:21.660> you're<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:21.840> very<00:04:22.109> good<00:04:22.350> aim<00:04:22.500> you

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
absurd and if you're a very good aim you

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.890 
absurd and if you're a very good aim you
can<00:04:22.860> oftentimes<00:04:23.520> get<00:04:23.850> that<00:04:24.060> one<00:04:24.330> burst<00:04:24.630> kill

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
can oftentimes get that one burst kill

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.430 
can oftentimes get that one burst kill
if<00:04:25.110> you're<00:04:25.320> close<00:04:25.530> enough<00:04:25.590> in<00:04:26.100> close

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
if you're close enough in close

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.870 
if you're close enough in close
if<00:04:26.560> you're<00:04:26.740> in<00:04:26.830> close<00:04:27.040> quarters<00:04:27.400> that<00:04:27.520> is<00:04:27.640> and

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
if you're in close quarters that is and

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.240 
if you're in close quarters that is and
get<00:04:28.180> that<00:04:28.360> head<00:04:28.540> shots<00:04:28.840> and<00:04:29.170> it<00:04:29.410> feels<00:04:30.070> like

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
get that head shots and it feels like

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.590 
get that head shots and it feels like
it's<00:04:30.430> a<00:04:30.490> one-shot<00:04:30.700> kill<00:04:31.090> when<00:04:31.330> you're<00:04:31.450> on<00:04:31.570> the

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
it's a one-shot kill when you're on the

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.690 
it's a one-shot kill when you're on the
receiving<00:04:31.780> end<00:04:32.230> but<00:04:32.470> trust<00:04:33.220> me<00:04:33.250> guys<00:04:33.400> it<00:04:33.580> is<00:04:33.670> a

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
receiving end but trust me guys it is a

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.100 
receiving end but trust me guys it is a
two-shot<00:04:34.120> kill<00:04:34.300> because<00:04:34.450> it<00:04:34.630> does<00:04:34.750> fire<00:04:34.960> that

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
two-shot kill because it does fire that

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.690 
two-shot kill because it does fire that
two-round<00:04:35.380> burst<00:04:35.500> so<00:04:35.890> another<00:04:36.520> good<00:04:36.640> thing

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
two-round burst so another good thing

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.030 
two-round burst so another good thing
about<00:04:36.850> the<00:04:37.120> an-94<00:04:37.630> is<00:04:38.170> that<00:04:38.440> actually<00:04:38.890> its

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
about the an-94 is that actually its

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.760 
about the an-94 is that actually its
first<00:04:39.370> shot<00:04:39.610> recoil<00:04:39.760> multiplier<00:04:40.240> is<00:04:40.870> very<00:04:41.440> low

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
first shot recoil multiplier is very low

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:42.840 
first shot recoil multiplier is very low
and<00:04:42.010> compared<00:04:42.310> to<00:04:42.400> a<00:04:42.430> lot<00:04:42.550> of<00:04:42.610> the<00:04:42.670> other

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
and compared to a lot of the other

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.850 
and compared to a lot of the other
assault<00:04:43.180> rifles<00:04:43.240> in<00:04:43.600> battlefield<00:04:44.110> 3<00:04:44.170> it's

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
assault rifles in battlefield 3 it's

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.730 
assault rifles in battlefield 3 it's
actually<00:04:45.100> half<00:04:45.580> of<00:04:45.760> that<00:04:45.880> of<00:04:45.940> the<00:04:46.350> aek-971<00:04:47.350> and

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
actually half of that of the aek-971 and

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.790 
actually half of that of the aek-971 and
the<00:04:48.010> f2000<00:04:48.910> it's<00:04:49.120> even<00:04:49.360> lower<00:04:49.540> than<00:04:49.690> the<00:04:49.900> m16a3

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
the f2000 it's even lower than the m16a3

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.420 
the f2000 it's even lower than the m16a3
and<00:04:51.310> the<00:04:51.850> m416<00:04:52.510> was<00:04:53.020> l85<00:04:53.710> and<00:04:53.950> several<00:04:54.250> other

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
and the m416 was l85 and several other

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.250 
and the m416 was l85 and several other
ones<00:04:54.670> it<00:04:55.180> is<00:04:55.330> tied<00:04:55.600> with<00:04:55.630> a<00:04:55.870> couple<00:04:56.200> of

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
ones it is tied with a couple of

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.900 
ones it is tied with a couple of
different<00:04:56.530> assault<00:04:56.770> rifles<00:04:57.220> though<00:04:57.370> with<00:04:57.670> its

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
different assault rifles though with its

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.940 
different assault rifles though with its
first<00:04:58.180> shot<00:04:58.330> recoil<00:04:58.450> multiplier<00:04:58.720> only<00:04:59.230> 1.5

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
first shot recoil multiplier only 1.5

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.310 
first shot recoil multiplier only 1.5
and<00:05:00.250> the<00:05:00.700> only<00:05:00.880> assault<00:05:01.450> rifle<00:05:01.780> that<00:05:01.810> beats<00:05:02.140> it

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
and the only assault rifle that beats it

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.590 
and the only assault rifle that beats it
out<00:05:02.440> in<00:05:02.620> that<00:05:02.770> category<00:05:03.160> is<00:05:03.460> the<00:05:03.610> g3a3<00:05:04.060> but

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
out in that category is the g3a3 but

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.830 
out in that category is the g3a3 but
it's<00:05:04.720> only<00:05:04.930> at<00:05:05.130> 1.4<00:05:06.130> so<00:05:06.700> the<00:05:06.820> an-94<00:05:07.180> first<00:05:07.720> shot

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
it's only at 1.4 so the an-94 first shot

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.240 
it's only at 1.4 so the an-94 first shot
recoil<00:05:07.900> is<00:05:08.260> not<00:05:08.440> really<00:05:08.650> something<00:05:08.830> to<00:05:09.040> worry

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
recoil is not really something to worry

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.340 
recoil is not really something to worry
about<00:05:09.480> that's<00:05:10.480> really<00:05:10.630> a<00:05:10.720> big<00:05:10.870> factor<00:05:11.050> with<00:05:11.230> a

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
about that's really a big factor with a

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.720 
about that's really a big factor with a
burst<00:05:11.530> fire<00:05:11.800> weapon<00:05:12.130> because<00:05:12.310> every<00:05:12.520> time<00:05:12.550> you

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 
burst fire weapon because every time you

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.640 
burst fire weapon because every time you
pull<00:05:12.910> that<00:05:13.060> you're<00:05:13.570> getting<00:05:13.750> that<00:05:14.020> recoil

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
pull that you're getting that recoil

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.280 
pull that you're getting that recoil
multiplier<00:05:15.220> again<00:05:15.820> so<00:05:16.060> it<00:05:16.300> was<00:05:16.420> about<00:05:16.600> excuse

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
multiplier again so it was about excuse

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:18.750 
multiplier again so it was about excuse
me<00:05:17.440> about<00:05:17.650> the<00:05:17.710> fact<00:05:17.860> that<00:05:17.920> it<00:05:18.040> does<00:05:18.280> have<00:05:18.550> a

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
me about the fact that it does have a

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.370 
me about the fact that it does have a
low<00:05:19.000> first<00:05:19.450> shot<00:05:19.600> recoil<00:05:19.630> multiplier<00:05:19.900> makes

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
low first shot recoil multiplier makes

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.100 
low first shot recoil multiplier makes
even<00:05:20.620> easier<00:05:20.890> to<00:05:21.190> control<00:05:21.690> so<00:05:22.690> hopefully<00:05:23.020> you

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
even easier to control so hopefully you

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.750 
even easier to control so hopefully you
guys<00:05:23.200> found<00:05:23.470> this<00:05:23.620> video<00:05:23.770> rather<00:05:24.130> helpful<00:05:24.460> and

below as far as what you think the best

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.060 
below as far as what you think the best
assault<00:05:28.420> rifle<00:05:28.750> for<00:05:28.840> aftermath<00:05:29.320> is<00:05:29.530> and<00:05:29.740> give

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
assault rifle for aftermath is and give

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.010 
assault rifle for aftermath is and give
the<00:05:30.160> an-94<00:05:30.580> shot<00:05:31.180> hopefully<00:05:31.450> it<00:05:31.630> works<00:05:31.750> well

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
the an-94 shot hopefully it works well

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.630 
the an-94 shot hopefully it works well
for<00:05:32.230> you<00:05:32.350> and<00:05:32.500> I<00:05:32.980> will<00:05:33.100> see<00:05:33.220> you<00:05:33.250> guys<00:05:33.340> next
