00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
on a simmer so I didn't turn it off but

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.060 
on a simmer so I didn't turn it off but
i<00:02:23.040> did<00:02:23.220> on<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.430> simmer<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:23.940> believe<00:02:24.570> that<00:02:24.720> the

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
i did on a simmer I believe that the

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.070 
i did on a simmer I believe that the
recipe<00:02:26.070> online<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:27.000> one<00:02:27.120> that<00:02:27.240> I<00:02:27.270> have<00:02:27.450> tells

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
recipe online the one that I have tells

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.100 
recipe online the one that I have tells
you<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.530> turn<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.970> water<00:02:30.090> off<00:02:30.209> but<00:02:30.630> I<00:02:30.660> kind<00:02:31.020> of

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
you to turn the water off but I kind of

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.560 
you to turn the water off but I kind of
wanted<00:02:31.350> a<00:02:32.750> more<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:34.140> more<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:35.459> stronger<00:02:36.030> brewing

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
wanted a more a more a stronger brewing

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.180 
wanted a more a more a stronger brewing
so<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:36.900> just<00:02:37.140> left<00:02:37.320> it<00:02:37.500> in<00:02:37.650> for<00:02:37.830> a<00:02:37.860> little<00:02:38.010> longer

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
so I just left it in for a little longer

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.290 
so I just left it in for a little longer
and<00:02:38.550> then<00:02:39.300> I<00:02:39.620> steeped<00:02:40.620> that<00:02:40.860> for<00:02:41.130> about<00:02:41.550> 10-15

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
and then I steeped that for about 10-15

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.500 
and then I steeped that for about 10-15
minutes<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.200> then<00:02:44.130> I<00:02:44.459> turn<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.910> heat<00:02:45.120> off<00:02:45.150> and

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
minutes and then I turn the heat off and

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.949 
minutes and then I turn the heat off and
I<00:02:46.110> let<00:02:46.320> it<00:02:47.000> cool<00:02:48.000> for<00:02:48.060> about<00:02:48.360> five<00:02:48.750> minutes

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
I let it cool for about five minutes

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.500 
I let it cool for about five minutes
then<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:49.650> took<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:50.010> bags<00:02:50.220> out<00:02:50.489> and<00:02:50.670> then<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:51.030> let

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
then I took the bags out and then I let

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.010 
then I took the bags out and then I let
it<00:02:51.600> cool<00:02:51.840> until<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.530> could<00:02:53.720> put<00:02:54.720> it<00:02:54.810> into

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
it cool until I could put it into

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.250 
it cool until I could put it into

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
not sure but two tablespoons look like a

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.720 
not sure but two tablespoons look like a
lot<00:03:23.030> so<00:03:24.030> i<00:03:24.060> just<00:03:24.299> used<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.600> tiny<00:03:24.840> tiny<00:03:25.080> bit<00:03:25.730> apple

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
lot so i just used a tiny tiny bit apple

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.190 
lot so i just used a tiny tiny bit apple
cider<00:03:26.820> vinegar<00:03:26.970> is<00:03:27.330> good<00:03:27.480> for<00:03:27.660> conditioning

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
cider vinegar is good for conditioning

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.229 
cider vinegar is good for conditioning
it<00:03:28.410> naturally<00:03:29.690> makes<00:03:30.690> your<00:03:30.870> hair<00:03:31.019> softer<00:03:32.239> and

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239

it naturally makes your hair softer and
it's<00:03:33.810> really<00:03:34.019> good<00:03:34.140> for<00:03:34.350> hard<00:03:34.620> water<00:03:34.830> which<00:03:35.100> I

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
it's really good for hard water which I

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.410 
it's really good for hard water which I
have<00:03:35.400> done<00:03:35.580> here<00:03:35.760> I<00:03:35.820> probably<00:03:36.150> should<00:03:36.390> have

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
have done here I probably should have

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.330 
have done here I probably should have
added<00:03:36.750> more<00:03:36.930> but<00:03:37.200> since<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:37.590> dyed<00:03:37.769> my<00:03:37.799> hair<00:03:37.950> I

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
added more but since I dyed my hair I

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.479 
added more but since I dyed my hair I
just<00:03:38.610> don't<00:03:38.850> want<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.530> risk<00:03:40.530> it<00:03:40.829> and<00:03:40.860> since<00:03:41.340> the

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
just don't want to risk it and since the

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.940 
just don't want to risk it and since the
colors<00:03:41.820> fading<00:03:42.269> very<00:03:42.450> quickly<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:43.110> don't<00:03:43.769> want

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
colors fading very quickly I don't want

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.280 
colors fading very quickly I don't want
to<00:03:44.040> increase<00:03:44.579> that<00:03:44.790> risk<00:03:46.640> so<00:03:47.720> you<00:03:48.720> can<00:03:48.989> use

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
to increase that risk so you can use

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.340 
to increase that risk so you can use
these<00:03:49.470> rinses<00:03:49.980> any<00:03:50.730> time<00:03:51.239> the<00:03:51.660> website<00:03:51.959> that<00:03:52.320> I
