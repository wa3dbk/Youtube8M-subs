is<00:00:21.570> holding<00:00:21.990> up<00:00:22.140> very<00:00:22.289> nicely<00:00:23.449> but<00:00:24.449> first

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
is holding up very nicely but first

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.810 
is holding up very nicely but first
we're<00:00:24.750> gonna<00:00:24.810> start<00:00:24.960> off<00:00:25.170> with<00:00:25.670> actually<00:00:26.670> one

we're gonna start off with actually one
thing<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.090> we<00:00:27.150> want<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.359> start<00:00:27.570> off<00:00:27.660> with<00:00:27.720> is

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
thing that we want to start off with is

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.679 
thing that we want to start off with is
that<00:00:28.380> first<00:00:29.250> maybe<00:00:29.910> some<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.359> don't<00:00:30.480> know

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
that first maybe some of you don't know

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.690 
that first maybe some of you don't know
this<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:31.080> lot<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.439> probably<00:00:31.560> do<00:00:32.070> but

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
this a lot of you probably do but

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.410 
this a lot of you probably do but

Lowepro is established in portugal and a

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.270 
Lowepro is established in portugal and a
lot<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.870> times<00:00:37.140> people<00:00:37.290> ask<00:00:37.649> me<00:00:37.950> why<00:00:38.250> I

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
lot of the times people ask me why I

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.660 
lot of the times people ask me why I
don't<00:00:38.610> talk<00:00:39.030> about<00:00:39.059> shipping<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.899> my<00:00:40.050> reviews

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
don't talk about shipping in my reviews

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.920 
don't talk about shipping in my reviews
well<00:00:41.670> it's<00:00:41.820> very<00:00:41.910> simple<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.510> reason<00:00:42.750> why<00:00:42.870> I

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
well it's very simple the reason why I

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.900 
well it's very simple the reason why I
don't<00:00:43.020> talk<00:00:43.350> about<00:00:43.410> shipping<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.160> because

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
don't talk about shipping is because

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.090 
don't talk about shipping is because
shipping<00:00:45.300> times<00:00:45.600> all<00:00:45.960> depend<00:00:46.440> on<00:00:46.620> where<00:00:46.950> you

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
shipping times all depend on where you

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.600 
shipping times all depend on where you
live<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:48.059> from<00:00:48.780> Portugal<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.800> where<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.010> live<00:00:50.460> in

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
live so from Portugal to where I live in

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.110 
live so from Portugal to where I live in
Canada<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.390> may<00:00:51.899> take<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.620> bit<00:00:52.710> longer<00:00:53.010> or<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.789> bit

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
Canada it may take a bit longer or a bit

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.770 
Canada it may take a bit longer or a bit
shorter<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.750> say<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.530> go<00:00:55.680> from<00:00:55.949> Portugal<00:00:56.520> to

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
shorter to say to go from Portugal to

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.260 
shorter to say to go from Portugal to
USA<00:00:57.780> or<00:00:58.079> Portugal<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.859> Australia<00:00:59.489> or<00:00:59.820> wherever

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
USA or Portugal to Australia or wherever

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.439 
USA or Portugal to Australia or wherever
so<00:01:00.600> shipping<00:01:01.559> times<00:01:02.010> definitely<00:01:02.760> depend<00:01:03.210> on

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
so shipping times definitely depend on

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.230 
so shipping times definitely depend on
where<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.899> live<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:05.460> only<00:01:05.729> thing<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.030> can

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
where you live the only thing that I can

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.660 
where you live the only thing that I can
say<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.990> be<00:01:07.140> patient<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.430> will

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
say is to be patient and that you will

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.120 
say is to be patient and that you will
definitely<00:01:09.000> be<00:01:09.299> getting<00:01:09.600> your<00:01:09.720> product<00:01:10.200> all

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
definitely be getting your product all

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.740 
definitely be getting your product all
right<00:01:11.310> but<00:01:11.430> having<00:01:11.610> said<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:11.970> we're<00:01:12.659> going

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
right but having said that we're going

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.990 
right but having said that we're going
to<00:01:12.840> get<00:01:12.930> into<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.170> specs<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.799> deck<00:01:14.010> this

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
to get into the specs of the deck this

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.300 
to get into the specs of the deck this
is<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> five<00:01:15.720> ply<00:01:16.049> deck<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.710> as<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.159> can<00:01:17.250> see

is a five ply deck and as you can see

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.179 
is a five ply deck and as you can see
there<00:01:17.729> are<00:01:17.909> coloured<00:01:18.509> plies<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:19.710> one<00:01:19.950> goes

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
there are coloured plies this one goes

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
believe the colored plies are random it

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.910 
believe the colored plies are random it

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
concave and medium kicks now with this

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.319 
concave and medium kicks now with this
deck<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.590> don't<00:01:37.860> know<00:01:37.920> it's<00:01:38.189> just<00:01:38.280> my<00:01:38.670> eyes<00:01:38.909> but

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
deck I don't know it's just my eyes but

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.630 
deck I don't know it's just my eyes but
it<00:01:39.420> looks<00:01:39.630> pretty<00:01:40.380> symmetrical<00:01:41.280> when<00:01:41.520> it

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
it looks pretty symmetrical when it

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.060 
it looks pretty symmetrical when it
comes<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.119> kick<00:01:42.360> heights<00:01:42.740> except<00:01:43.740> this

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
comes to the kick heights except this

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.649 
comes to the kick heights except this
one<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:45.240> side<00:01:45.570> here<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.170> just<00:01:46.860> slightly

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
one this side here is just slightly

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.310 
one this side here is just slightly
maybe<00:01:48.890> slightly<00:01:49.890> lower<00:01:50.790> than<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.810> other<00:01:52.020> one

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
maybe slightly lower than the other one

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.020 
maybe slightly lower than the other one
now<00:01:52.619> on<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.890> camera<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.399> looks<00:01:53.610> like<00:01:53.759> it's<00:01:53.939> a

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
now on the camera it looks like it's a

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.969 
now on the camera it looks like it's a
lot<00:01:54.299> lower<00:01:54.630> than<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:54.960> other<00:01:55.079> one<00:01:55.259> but<00:01:55.799> when

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
lot lower than the other one but when

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.429 
lot lower than the other one but when
you<00:01:56.070> look<00:01:56.219> at<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.460> up<00:01:56.610> close<00:01:56.810> it's<00:01:57.810> slightly

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
you look at it up close it's slightly

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.429 
you look at it up close it's slightly
lower<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.340> isn't<00:01:59.670> really<00:01:59.729> a<00:02:00.439> symmetrical

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
lower so it isn't really a symmetrical

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.200 
lower so it isn't really a symmetrical
deck<00:02:01.680> there<00:02:01.920> is<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.100> bit<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.729> difference<00:02:03.119> in

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
deck there is a bit of a difference in

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.200 
deck there is a bit of a difference in
the<00:02:03.270> kicks<00:02:04.460> which<00:02:05.460> again<00:02:05.670> are<00:02:05.790> on<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.969> medium

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
the kicks which again are on the medium

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.210 
the kicks which again are on the medium
side<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.689> they<00:02:06.750> do<00:02:06.810> have<00:02:07.140> some<00:02:07.200> very<00:02:07.710> well

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
side and they do have some very well

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.370 
side and they do have some very well
defined<00:02:08.670> dips<00:02:09.739> these<00:02:10.739> do<00:02:11.640> not<00:02:11.849> have

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
defined dips these do not have

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.040 
defined dips these do not have
kingpin<00:02:12.800> holes<00:02:13.070> so<00:02:14.000> again<00:02:14.330> you<00:02:14.540> will<00:02:14.690> need<00:02:14.870> to

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
kingpin holes so again you will need to

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.050 
kingpin holes so again you will need to
use<00:02:15.080> trucks<00:02:15.830> that<00:02:16.160> do<00:02:16.280> not<00:02:16.400> have<00:02:16.610> protruding

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
use trucks that do not have protruding

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.300 
use trucks that do not have protruding
kingpins<00:02:17.480> underneath<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.770> base<00:02:19.340> plates<00:02:19.960> the

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
kingpins underneath the base plates the

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.700 
kingpins underneath the base plates the
truck<00:02:22.310> holes<00:02:22.550> were<00:02:22.940> all<00:02:23.750> aligned<00:02:24.380> perfectly

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
truck holes were all aligned perfectly

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.500 
truck holes were all aligned perfectly
the<00:02:25.190> countersinks<00:02:25.790> were<00:02:25.880> perfect

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
the countersinks were perfect

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.780 
the countersinks were perfect
again<00:02:27.260> no<00:02:27.440> trouble<00:02:27.860> mounting<00:02:28.310> trucks<00:02:28.550> on<00:02:28.670> this

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
again no trouble mounting trucks on this

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.870 
again no trouble mounting trucks on this
deck<00:02:29.710> the<00:02:30.710> pop<00:02:31.010> is<00:02:32.410> phenomenal<00:02:33.410> it<00:02:33.650> is<00:02:34.040> a<00:02:34.490> very

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
very very well crafted deck and I'll

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.970 
very very well crafted deck and I'll
show<00:02:37.610> you<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.850> rounding<00:02:38.300> here<00:02:38.800> they<00:02:39.800> are

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
show you the rounding here they are

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.030 
show you the rounding here they are
perfect<00:02:40.550> on<00:02:40.670> both<00:02:40.940> sides<00:02:41.300> and<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:42.530> sanding

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
perfect on both sides and the sanding

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:51.040 
perfect on both sides and the sanding
along<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.400> side<00:02:43.640> again<00:02:44.000> is<00:02:44.270> just<00:02:45.910> amazing<00:02:50.050> so

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
along the side again is just amazing so

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.600 
along the side again is just amazing so
now<00:02:51.140> in<00:02:51.350> regards<00:02:51.740> to<00:02:51.770> the<00:02:51.890> performance<00:02:52.430> this

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
now in regards to the performance this

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.750 
now in regards to the performance this
again<00:02:52.940> is<00:02:53.150> a<00:02:53.180> 31<00:02:54.020> millimeter<00:02:54.800> wide<00:02:55.070> deck<00:02:55.490> and

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
again is a 31 millimeter wide deck and

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.730 
again is a 31 millimeter wide deck and
the<00:02:56.300> length<00:02:56.510> I<00:02:56.690> believe<00:02:56.960> is<00:02:57.080> about<00:02:57.200> a<00:02:57.500> hundred

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
the length I believe is about a hundred

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.480 
the length I believe is about a hundred
to<00:02:58.100> 101<00:02:58.550> millimeters<00:02:59.210> long<00:03:00.130> which<00:03:01.130> for<00:03:01.370> me<00:03:01.460> is

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
to 101 millimeters long which for me is

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:07.420 
to 101 millimeters long which for me is
a<00:03:01.700> great<00:03:02.240> size<00:03:04.300> again<00:03:05.300> I<00:03:05.600> I<00:03:05.900> prefer<00:03:06.560> more<00:03:06.950> of<00:03:06.980> a

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
a great size again I I prefer more of a

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.490 
a great size again I I prefer more of a
twenty-nine<00:03:08.240> thirty<00:03:08.930> to<00:03:09.200> thirty<00:03:09.410> one

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
twenty-nine thirty to thirty one

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.500 
twenty-nine thirty to thirty one
millimeter<00:03:10.010> deck<00:03:10.280> and<00:03:10.550> again<00:03:11.120> I<00:03:11.180> do<00:03:11.240> enjoy

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
millimeter deck and again I do enjoy

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.630 
millimeter deck and again I do enjoy
using<00:03:12.200> thirty<00:03:12.530> two<00:03:12.740> millimeters<00:03:13.220> but<00:03:13.460> these

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
using thirty two millimeters but these

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.810 
using thirty two millimeters but these
ones<00:03:13.850> are<00:03:14.030> more<00:03:14.240> of<00:03:14.390> my<00:03:14.510> width<00:03:14.780> preference<00:03:15.820> the

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
ones are more of my width preference the

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.120 
ones are more of my width preference the
lengths<00:03:17.300> being<00:03:17.780> a<00:03:18.020> hundred<00:03:18.500> to<00:03:18.680> 101

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
lengths being a hundred to 101

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.510 
lengths being a hundred to 101
millimeters<00:03:19.760> long<00:03:20.240> is<00:03:20.600> is<00:03:20.960> great<00:03:21.920> sometimes

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
millimeters long is is great sometimes

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.920 
millimeters long is is great sometimes
I've<00:03:22.700> even<00:03:22.880> preferred<00:03:23.300> to<00:03:23.360> use<00:03:23.480> a<00:03:23.510> shorter

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
I've even preferred to use a shorter

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.240 
I've even preferred to use a shorter
deck<00:03:24.140> which<00:03:24.320> is<00:03:24.440> around<00:03:24.620> ninety<00:03:25.070> nine

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
deck which is around ninety nine

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.270 
deck which is around ninety nine
millimeters<00:03:25.880> but<00:03:26.780> with<00:03:27.590> the<00:03:27.770> width<00:03:27.980> of<00:03:28.100> this

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
millimeters but with the width of this

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.240 
millimeters but with the width of this
deck<00:03:28.580> the<00:03:29.480> 100<00:03:29.840> millimeter<00:03:30.260> or<00:03:30.680> sorry<00:03:31.130> the

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
deck the 100 millimeter or sorry the

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.650 
deck the 100 millimeter or sorry the
hundred<00:03:31.490> and<00:03:31.580> one<00:03:31.700> millimeter<00:03:32.150> length<00:03:32.420> is

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
hundred and one millimeter length is

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.390 
hundred and one millimeter length is
perfect

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
perfect

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.230 
perfect
I<00:03:34.870> didn't<00:03:35.870> didn't<00:03:36.410> take<00:03:36.530> me<00:03:36.710> actually<00:03:37.700> no<00:03:37.940> time

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
I didn't didn't take me actually no time

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.940 
I didn't didn't take me actually no time
to<00:03:38.420> get<00:03:38.540> used<00:03:38.780> to<00:03:38.840> this<00:03:38.960> deck<00:03:39.230> this<00:03:39.470> deck<00:03:39.680> felt

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
to get used to this deck this deck felt

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.400 
to get used to this deck this deck felt
very<00:03:40.730> natural<00:03:41.330> to<00:03:41.450> me<00:03:41.480> as<00:03:41.720> soon<00:03:41.900> as<00:03:41.990> I<00:03:42.080> started

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
very natural to me as soon as I started

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.600 
very natural to me as soon as I started
using<00:03:42.470> it<00:03:43.870> so<00:03:44.870> again<00:03:44.990> it<00:03:45.410> had<00:03:45.590> and<00:03:46.070> I<00:03:46.160> when<00:03:46.580> I

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
using it so again it had and I when I

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.100 
using it so again it had and I when I
first<00:03:46.670> looked<00:03:47.180> at<00:03:47.240> the<00:03:47.330> deck<00:03:47.540> I<00:03:47.720> thought<00:03:47.930> that

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
first looked at the deck I thought that

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.340 
first looked at the deck I thought that
that<00:03:48.260> was<00:03:48.410> that<00:03:48.709> wasn't<00:03:49.550> going<00:03:49.700> to<00:03:49.790> be<00:03:49.880> the<00:03:50.350> the

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
that was that wasn't going to be the the

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.410 
that was that wasn't going to be the the
the<00:03:51.590> case<00:03:51.830> because<00:03:52.550> when<00:03:52.790> I<00:03:52.850> looked<00:03:53.120> at<00:03:53.270> it<00:03:53.390> it

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
the case because when I looked at it it

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.360 
the case because when I looked at it it
was<00:03:53.720> it<00:03:54.080> looked<00:03:54.560> to<00:03:54.650> me<00:03:54.770> like<00:03:54.800> it<00:03:54.920> was<00:03:55.100> gonna<00:03:55.190> be

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
was it looked to me like it was gonna be

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.090 
was it looked to me like it was gonna be
a<00:03:55.400> symmetrical<00:03:56.120> deck<00:03:56.650> but<00:03:57.650> now<00:03:57.770> I'm<00:03:57.950> actually

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
a symmetrical deck but now I'm actually

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.280 
a symmetrical deck but now I'm actually
the<00:03:58.400> more<00:03:58.580> that<00:03:58.760> I<00:03:58.820> look<00:03:58.880> at<00:03:59.209> it<00:03:59.360> I<00:03:59.510> can<00:03:59.870> see<00:04:00.170> the

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
the more that I look at it I can see the

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.340 
the more that I look at it I can see the
difference<00:04:00.740> in<00:04:00.980> the<00:04:01.610> kicks<00:04:01.910> I<00:04:02.330> guess<00:04:03.170> it's

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
difference in the kicks I guess it's

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.900 
difference in the kicks I guess it's
just<00:04:03.440> basically<00:04:03.920> the<00:04:04.040> way<00:04:04.250> that<00:04:04.430> you<00:04:04.520> hold<00:04:04.760> the

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
just basically the way that you hold the

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.850 
just basically the way that you hold the
deck<00:04:05.090> but<00:04:05.690> when<00:04:05.870> I<00:04:05.900> first<00:04:06.170> noticed<00:04:06.440> the<00:04:06.680> deck

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
deck but when I first noticed the deck

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.470 
deck but when I first noticed the deck
it<00:04:07.040> did<00:04:07.190> look<00:04:07.310> like<00:04:07.370> a<00:04:07.520> symmetrical<00:04:08.120> deck<00:04:08.330> to

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
it did look like a symmetrical deck to

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.280 
it did look like a symmetrical deck to
me<00:04:08.570> and<00:04:08.660> I<00:04:08.690> thought<00:04:08.840> that<00:04:09.020> was<00:04:09.110> going<00:04:09.230> to

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
me and I thought that was going to

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.290 
me and I thought that was going to
interfere<00:04:09.800> with<00:04:09.860> performance<00:04:10.490> but<00:04:11.030> like<00:04:11.209> I

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
interfere with performance but like I

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.660 
interfere with performance but like I
said<00:04:11.480> before<00:04:11.630> it<00:04:12.140> didn't<00:04:12.440> take<00:04:12.590> me<00:04:12.800> any<00:04:13.160> time

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
said before it didn't take me any time

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.710 
said before it didn't take me any time
at<00:04:13.880> all<00:04:14.120> to<00:04:14.150> get<00:04:14.540> used<00:04:14.720> to<00:04:14.810> the<00:04:14.930> deck<00:04:15.140> it<00:04:15.410> is<00:04:16.100> a

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
at all to get used to the deck it is a

with this deck it works even a lot
better<00:04:35.360> than<00:04:35.720> some<00:04:35.930> of<00:04:35.960> the<00:04:36.080> other<00:04:36.229> decks<00:04:36.470> that

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
better than some of the other decks that

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.930 
better than some of the other decks that
I've<00:04:36.650> used<00:04:36.889> I<00:04:37.009> don't<00:04:37.160> know<00:04:37.250> what<00:04:37.400> it<00:04:37.490> is<00:04:37.580> but<00:04:37.759> it

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
I've used I don't know what it is but it

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.330 
I've used I don't know what it is but it
just<00:04:37.970> it<00:04:38.630> works<00:04:38.870> amazing<00:04:39.680> can't<00:04:40.009> get<00:04:40.130> enough

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
just it works amazing can't get enough

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
just it works amazing can't get enough
of<00:04:40.430> it

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
of it

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.110 
of it
I<00:04:41.389> am<00:04:41.750> I<00:04:42.229> did<00:04:42.680> notice<00:04:43.009> however<00:04:43.220> that<00:04:43.669> there<00:04:43.850> is

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
I am I did notice however that there is

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.430 
I am I did notice however that there is
and<00:04:44.389> I'm<00:04:44.449> not<00:04:44.479> sure<00:04:44.600> if<00:04:44.960> you're<00:04:45.050> gonna<00:04:45.110> be<00:04:45.320> able

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
and I'm not sure if you're gonna be able

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.689 
and I'm not sure if you're gonna be able
to<00:04:45.530> see<00:04:45.680> this<00:04:45.860> but<00:04:46.639> there<00:04:46.820> is<00:04:47.000> just<00:04:47.240> a<00:04:47.419> slight

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
to see this but there is just a slight

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.810 
to see this but there is just a slight
mold<00:04:49.699> marking<00:04:50.600> right<00:04:50.930> here<00:04:51.260> in<00:04:51.380> the<00:04:51.470> middle

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
mold marking right here in the middle

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.950 
mold marking right here in the middle
now<00:04:52.820> it<00:04:53.120> makes<00:04:53.449> the<00:04:53.720> deck<00:04:53.930> look<00:04:54.229> like<00:04:54.470> it<00:04:54.680> has<00:04:54.919> a

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
now it makes the deck look like it has a

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.500 
now it makes the deck look like it has a
boxy<00:04:56.960> of<00:04:57.320> style<00:04:57.860> type<00:04:58.250> of<00:04:58.400> concave<00:04:58.880> when

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
boxy of style type of concave when

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.040 
boxy of style type of concave when
actually<00:05:00.020> it<00:05:00.199> doesn't<00:05:01.150> I<00:05:02.150> don't<00:05:02.600> know<00:05:02.750> this<00:05:02.990> is

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
actually it doesn't I don't know this is

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.020 
actually it doesn't I don't know this is
my<00:05:03.229> first<00:05:03.470> family<00:05:03.919> shape<00:05:04.310> so<00:05:04.580> I<00:05:04.610> don't<00:05:04.850> know<00:05:04.940> if

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
my first family shape so I don't know if

my first family shape so I don't know if
there<00:05:05.180> have<00:05:05.300> been<00:05:05.360> any<00:05:05.570> improvements<00:05:06.260> in

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
there have been any improvements in

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.800 
there have been any improvements in
regards<00:05:06.800> that<00:05:06.979> will<00:05:07.220> mold<00:05:07.610> marking<00:05:08.060> or<00:05:08.240> if

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
regards that will mold marking or if

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.430 
regards that will mold marking or if
this<00:05:08.960> is<00:05:09.110> how<00:05:09.229> they<00:05:09.380> do<00:05:09.560> it<00:05:09.849> from<00:05:10.849> now<00:05:11.030> on<00:05:11.300> but<00:05:12.199> I

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
this is how they do it from now on but I

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.080 
this is how they do it from now on but I
do<00:05:12.500> have<00:05:12.889> a<00:05:12.919> k4<00:05:13.580> and<00:05:13.970> the<00:05:14.539> k4<00:05:14.990> was<00:05:15.289> actually

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
do have a k4 and the k4 was actually

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.570 
do have a k4 and the k4 was actually
smooth<00:05:17.090> on<00:05:17.479> the<00:05:18.259> outside<00:05:18.740> as<00:05:18.949> well<00:05:19.130> there<00:05:19.430> was

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
smooth on the outside as well there was

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.150 
smooth on the outside as well there was
no<00:05:19.729> mold<00:05:19.970> marking<00:05:20.330> at<00:05:20.419> all<00:05:20.620> but<00:05:21.620> again<00:05:21.800> it's<00:05:22.039> a

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
no mold marking at all but again it's a

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.370 
no mold marking at all but again it's a
slight<00:05:22.430> detail<00:05:22.910> which<00:05:23.180> really<00:05:23.479> doesn't<00:05:23.720> make

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
slight detail which really doesn't make

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.020 
slight detail which really doesn't make
much<00:05:24.710> of<00:05:24.740> a<00:05:24.919> difference<00:05:25.039> because<00:05:25.370> with<00:05:25.820> the

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
much of a difference because with the

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.360 
much of a difference because with the
graphic<00:05:26.510> I<00:05:26.720> mean<00:05:27.229> you<00:05:27.349> can't<00:05:27.560> even<00:05:27.740> really

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
graphic I mean you can't even really

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.689 
graphic I mean you can't even really

favorite graphics that they have and
that<00:05:38.570> these<00:05:38.900> shapes<00:05:39.320> are<00:05:39.680> not<00:05:39.979> only<00:05:40.250> available

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
that these shapes are not only available

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.089 
that these shapes are not only available
in<00:05:41.000> 31<00:05:41.479> millimeter<00:05:41.930> they<00:05:42.229> are<00:05:42.349> also<00:05:42.680> available

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:43.099 
in 31 millimeter they are also available

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:46.750 
in 31 millimeter they are also available
in<00:05:43.490> 29<00:05:43.940> millimeter<00:05:44.360> so<00:05:45.159> you<00:05:46.159> have<00:05:46.370> the<00:05:46.520> choice

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
in 29 millimeter so you have the choice

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.960 
in 29 millimeter so you have the choice
of<00:05:47.090> what<00:05:47.419> size<00:05:47.659> you<00:05:47.900> want<00:05:48.080> to<00:05:48.139> get<00:05:48.380> and<00:05:48.970> there's

also another shape called the tiramisu

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.339 
also another shape called the tiramisu
which<00:05:52.130> I<00:05:52.220> haven't<00:05:52.520> tried<00:05:52.729> but<00:05:53.479> it<00:05:53.900> also<00:05:54.050> looks

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:54.349 
which I haven't tried but it also looks

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:56.980 
which I haven't tried but it also looks
like<00:05:54.409> a<00:05:54.500> very<00:05:54.740> cool<00:05:54.949> shape<00:05:55.250> so<00:05:55.970> again<00:05:56.210> it's<00:05:56.780> the

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
like a very cool shape so again it's the

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.370 
like a very cool shape so again it's the
lowepro<00:05:57.470> 31<00:05:58.400> millimeter<00:05:58.909> family<00:05:59.720> shaped<00:06:00.020> I'll

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
lowepro 31 millimeter family shaped I'll

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.500
