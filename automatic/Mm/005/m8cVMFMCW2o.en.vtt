decent quality you know after getting

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.840 
decent quality you know after getting
burned<00:03:41.480> by<00:03:41.660> that<00:03:41.780> biocube<00:03:42.530> you<00:03:43.519> know<00:03:43.609> just

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
burned by that biocube you know just

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.970 
burned by that biocube you know just
crapping<00:03:44.359> out<00:03:44.450> on<00:03:44.510> me<00:03:44.810> after<00:03:45.680> just<00:03:45.859> a<00:03:45.950> couple

crapping out on me after just a couple

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.440 
crapping out on me after just a couple
months<00:03:46.609> and<00:03:46.670> some<00:03:46.849> change<00:03:48.010> so<00:03:49.010> I<00:03:49.400> ended<00:03:50.389> up

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
months and some change so I ended up

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.910

doing was as I was searching for that

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.620 
doing was as I was searching for that
better<00:03:52.519> lighting<00:03:52.819> you<00:03:53.120> know<00:03:53.209> I<00:03:53.239> came<00:03:53.359> across

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
better lighting you know I came across

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.390 
better lighting you know I came across
this<00:03:54.109> tank<00:03:54.380> that<00:03:54.560> you<00:03:54.680> see<00:03:54.859> here<00:03:55.099> i<00:03:55.160> came

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
this tank that you see here i came

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.680 
this tank that you see here i came
across<00:03:55.519> this<00:03:56.299> jbj<00:03:56.930> 28<00:03:57.500> gallon<00:03:58.209> and<00:03:59.209> it's<00:03:59.389> been

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
across this jbj 28 gallon and it's been

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.520 
across this jbj 28 gallon and it's been
retrofitted<00:04:00.169> with<00:04:01.060> LEDs<00:04:02.319> they're<00:04:03.319> not<00:04:03.440> the

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
retrofitted with LEDs they're not the

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.170 
retrofitted with LEDs they're not the
LEDs<00:04:03.889> that<00:04:03.919> you<00:04:04.340> would<00:04:04.459> get<00:04:04.639> if<00:04:04.790> you<00:04:04.910> got<00:04:05.060> the

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
LEDs that you would get if you got the

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.920 
LEDs that you would get if you got the
LED<00:04:05.450> option<00:04:05.900> you<00:04:06.709> know<00:04:06.829> for<00:04:07.130> the<00:04:07.160> J<00:04:07.400> bjs<00:04:07.930> it's

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
LED option you know for the J bjs it's

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.590 
LED option you know for the J bjs it's
just<00:04:09.109> all<00:04:09.290> custom

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
just all custom

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.370 
just all custom
LED<00:04:11.410> in<00:04:11.590> there<00:04:11.770> and<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:13.540> par<00:04:13.750> ratings<00:04:14.230> and

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
LED in there and the par ratings and

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.990 
LED in there and the par ratings and
everything<00:04:14.770> like<00:04:14.860> that<00:04:14.920> from<00:04:15.340> what<00:04:15.550> the<00:04:15.730> owner

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
everything like that from what the owner

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.080 
everything like that from what the owner
was<00:04:16.209> telling<00:04:16.570> me<00:04:16.690> are<00:04:16.959> a<00:04:17.070> little<00:04:18.070> bit<00:04:18.310> higher

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
was telling me are a little bit higher

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.640 
was telling me are a little bit higher
than<00:04:19.120> what<00:04:19.510> you<00:04:19.630> would<00:04:19.720> be<00:04:19.930> getting<00:04:20.230> out<00:04:20.380> of<00:04:20.530> a

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
than what you would be getting out of a

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.380 
than what you would be getting out of a
150<00:04:21.340> halide<00:04:22.060> and<00:04:22.860> I<00:04:23.860> like<00:04:24.820> the<00:04:24.850> idea<00:04:25.030> of<00:04:25.240> that

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
150 halide and I like the idea of that

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.800 
150 halide and I like the idea of that
because<00:04:25.690> he<00:04:26.260> was<00:04:26.410> keeping<00:04:27.060> SPS<00:04:28.060> and<00:04:28.390> all<00:04:28.450> kinds

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
because he was keeping SPS and all kinds

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.140 
because he was keeping SPS and all kinds
of<00:04:28.870> stuff<00:04:28.930> in<00:04:29.260> here<00:04:29.730> so<00:04:30.730> I<00:04:30.760> figure<00:04:30.970> to<00:04:31.060> be

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
of stuff in here so I figure to be

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.480 
of stuff in here so I figure to be
