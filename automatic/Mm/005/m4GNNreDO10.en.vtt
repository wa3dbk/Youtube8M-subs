00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.970
 because really the question how high can 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.490
 storks actually fly in nature 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.440
 say so about 4,500 m 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.660
 that corresponds to the summit of 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.460
 matterhorns in the table you have to 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.710
 The kieler began to fly high 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.930
 storks with place ten 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.160
 by the tenth day of the game was that 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.590
 I went for a dive then it went 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.420
 really nice up and there you have to 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.550
 Now if that goes on then say 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.010
 There seems to be only that 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.050
 summit as a goal 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.910
 it's actually possible kiel is 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.700
 turn on maybe first 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.800
 resurgence in the second league after 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.180
 34 years and still want the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.430
 Storks do not really stand out 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.090
 everything else now in the report of 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.850
 day before 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.829
 The children continue to practice in typical 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.559
 Schleswig Holstein restraint 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.120
 allegedly it is still only against 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.879
 the descent, the storks have the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.500
 best defensive league but opponents 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.840
 Münster has the last nine at home here 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.760
 play all won and the prussians 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.439
 start again today with punch 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.340
 mehmet kara exactly in the interface 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:12.440
 the strong kieler defended sixth 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.090
 behind kenneth crown 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.160
 at 14 you can not even do that 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.290
 football rules because he's from home 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:22.900
 had to play handball his grandfather edwin 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.900
 courage at german field handball national 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.910
 both teams immediately will be much 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:33.110
 Seriousness here directly print it 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.670
 on it with the help of Endl Bishop and then 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.070
 cook up the emotions 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.890
 this is about what the dams wendel 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.850
 by nickname bulldozer gets for it 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.460
 also rightly because the prussians 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:50.000
 develop as always at home big bruck 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.470
 in the paragraph to mori bishop and 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.470
 fullback Schöneberg 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.300
 there comes marcus piossek again 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.250
 but still the team of 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.380
 trainer ralf loose in china 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.150
 did not crack holstein had over that 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.910
 half of the games do not hit the bullseye 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.970
 cashed in the front of the search 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.190
 after mid- striker rich was a hauke 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.030
 explains badly and there comes mehmet 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.030
 kara from Neumünster 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.760
 We talk about them that often 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.740
 meaning mast of tactics around then 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.350
 it's a simple blow to the front 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.570
 astor brings minster enforces this 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:33.030
 but also because they are the clear ones 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.030
 attention is on the second balls 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.260
 the prussians always lead and if that in 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.450
 the last one and a half years of the fall 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.420
 you did not have the game anymore 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.860
 lost the heavy task for keel the 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.440
 team of coach carsten heil zu 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.480
 their game structure and high addresses 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.690
 the münsteraner still like 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.980
 is chopped up just under ten minutes 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.480
 until the break four times with tim siedschlag 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.800
 The Schöneberg wants to clarify that is 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.500
 weak and that is the compensation 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.660
 Yaroslav Lindner wanted 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.880
 to the ball marc heider falls ill at home 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.050
 stayed in bed 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.270
 but maybe that would be better 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.280
 minster schöneberg times remained the 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:18.530
 can raushauen the ball on the but still 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:21.330
 not in the center to the opponent submit 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.490
 and suddenly that's a different story 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:27.390
 Kiel is playing fast now 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:29.220
 and directly middle striker schaeffler was 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.790
 I flank off the flank for 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.560
 rafael kazior not five minutes after 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.080
 The compensation led here at the 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.990
 Prussia and scratches on the paint 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.540
 Münsterer home win 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.830
 of course home in 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.050
 Westphalia and they are not here 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.700
 commanded last nine home games 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.350
 the prussians have become as said 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:55.880
 second half the hosts are raging 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:57.780
 benjamin siegert dominik schmidt the 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.910
 defender very important man 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.100
 here at the Prussia posted in the 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.740
 gone but missed the münster 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.260

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.210
 now sustainable holstein the pace 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.140
 stay out dangerous at standards tim 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:15.900
 Siedschlag kaczor 13, the decision in 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.670

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.500
 non-descent to make it clear with this 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.970
 victory would be 43 congratulations with it 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.800
 Holstein to the non-descent but all 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.800

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.699
 clear here is as high as possible while 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.889
 but we want to talk to you now 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:33.610
 not from exhibitions what i believe 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:34.960

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.850

 a top team yes you can hear that 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.580

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.919
 friends in connection with 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.630

 direction direct resurgence place 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.120

 she either first or second now 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.910
 for the first time quite unusual on the fourth 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.010
 space 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.770
 behind the altitude flight continues 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.720
 fifth place for holstein kiel that is the 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.030
 Best season placement and the kickers 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.979
 on 7 have only three points 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.110
 residue on the relegation place and 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:54.849
 another catch-up game in the backhand 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:58.270
 short look at the bottom 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:59.590
 table half mainz second grandpa 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.669

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.150
 relegation places 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:04.889
 but there is nothing decided yet 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.150
 after that sweaty 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:09.270
 We can warm up first 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.270
 built
