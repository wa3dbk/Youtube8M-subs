00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
was gonna do this I'm not a like

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.480 
was gonna do this I'm not a like
cardboard<00:02:36.410> or<00:02:36.710> something<00:02:36.740> but<00:02:37.190> it<00:02:37.280> didn't

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
cardboard or something but it didn't

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.180 
cardboard or something but it didn't
work<00:02:37.610> out<00:02:37.760> too<00:02:37.970> well<00:02:38.000> so<00:02:38.450> I<00:02:38.660> just<00:02:39.500> sculpted<00:02:40.070> a

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
work out too well so I just sculpted a

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.560 
work out too well so I just sculpted a
clay<00:02:40.550> so<00:02:40.610> it's<00:02:40.880> a<00:02:40.940> little<00:02:41.060> bit<00:02:41.830> off-center<00:02:42.830> and

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
clay so it's a little bit off-center and

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.410 
clay so it's a little bit off-center and
not<00:02:44.570> quite<00:02:44.810> perfect<00:02:45.260> but<00:02:45.290> it<00:02:45.530> looks<00:02:45.650> okay<00:02:46.420> and

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
not quite perfect but it looks okay and

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.350 
not quite perfect but it looks okay and
I<00:02:47.959> decided<00:02:48.320> to<00:02:48.500> leave<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:48.890> eyes<00:02:49.040> open<00:02:49.400> because

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
I decided to leave the eyes open because

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.300 
I decided to leave the eyes open because
while<00:02:50.780> in<00:02:50.990> the<00:02:51.110> game<00:02:51.290> they<00:02:51.590> are<00:02:51.620> like<00:02:52.070> black

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
while in the game they are like black

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.490 
while in the game they are like black
and<00:02:52.640> you<00:02:52.700> can't<00:02:52.910> see<00:02:53.150> your<00:02:53.930> character's<00:02:54.350> eyes

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
and you can't see your character's eyes

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.940 
and you can't see your character's eyes
um<00:02:55.370> I<00:02:56.140> think<00:02:57.140> that's<00:02:57.320> just<00:02:57.500> because<00:02:57.590> I<00:02:57.739> didn't

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
um I think that's just because I didn't

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.470 
um I think that's just because I didn't
want<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.130> have<00:02:58.280> to<00:02:58.400> render<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:58.820> eyes<00:02:58.940> do<00:02:59.360> the

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
want to have to render the eyes do the

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.210 
want to have to render the eyes do the
elements<00:02:59.900> oh<00:03:01.570> it's<00:03:02.570> a<00:03:02.660> medieval<00:03:02.959> helmet<00:03:03.410> you

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
elements oh it's a medieval helmet you

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.949 
elements oh it's a medieval helmet you
know<00:03:04.250> they<00:03:04.580> would<00:03:04.970> have<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.239> eyes<00:03:05.360> open<00:03:05.630> most

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
know they would have the eyes open most

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.810 
know they would have the eyes open most
likely<00:03:07.060> plus<00:03:08.060> it's<00:03:08.239> less<00:03:08.390> work<00:03:08.570> for<00:03:08.630> me<00:03:08.840> and<00:03:09.820> I

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
likely plus it's less work for me and I

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:18.270 
likely plus it's less work for me and I
like<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.150> way<00:03:11.239> it<00:03:11.330> looks<00:03:11.480> like<00:03:11.600> this

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.400 

so<00:03:19.280> I<00:03:19.310> guess<00:03:19.550> that's<00:03:19.700> it<00:03:19.940> I<00:03:20.210> just<00:03:20.510> had<00:03:20.840> been<00:03:21.050> we

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
so I guess that's it I just had been we

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.220 
so I guess that's it I just had been we
wanted<00:03:21.830> to<00:03:21.890> show<00:03:22.040> you<00:03:22.069> guys<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:22.730> I<00:03:23.090> am<00:03:23.900> working

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
wanted to show you guys and I am working

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.670

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
on painting a my cast of the gray helmet

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.840 
on painting a my cast of the gray helmet
so<00:03:30.680> I<00:03:30.709> don't<00:03:31.040> know<00:03:31.130> when<00:03:31.250> I'll<00:03:31.340> have<00:03:31.400> that<00:03:31.670> done

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
so I don't know when I'll have that done

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.640 
so I don't know when I'll have that done
because<00:03:31.970> I<00:03:32.120> painted<00:03:32.450> it<00:03:32.630> yesterday<00:03:33.350> and<00:03:33.590> I

because I painted it yesterday and I

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.410 
because I painted it yesterday and I
didn't<00:03:33.890> like<00:03:33.980> it<00:03:34.160> so<00:03:34.190> I'm<00:03:34.490> gonna<00:03:34.640> redo<00:03:34.880> it<00:03:35.030> and
