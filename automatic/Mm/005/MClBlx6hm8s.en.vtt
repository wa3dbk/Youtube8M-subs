 welcome to this channel again or be 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:28.250
 a new simple pixel tutorial for 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.710
 those who are just learning I'm with 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.989
 several people post on the page if 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.489
 they wanted to join and well enough 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.160
 people joined this world to 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.080
 see how I make this pixelated or they went 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.890
 to also roll the world and will specify the 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:45.910
 dgr to the ok 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:50.600
 Band materials for this construction 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.870
 are about 678 materials will be what 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.610
 what is 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.240
 wool with black color 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.630
 lara color blue 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.760
 what is cyan 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.939
 blue pencil 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.540
 gray stone wool this is important to 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:10.040
 stone and what is gray wool the ok are 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.549
 the only materials that we are going to occupy 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.350
 this time so let's go to iraq at 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.049
 center to do the third predicate 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.220
 that we have here we are going to put three of 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.220
 base color black 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:28.220
 1 2 3 in the right corner we place in 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.710
 the left corner but one black and in 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.330
 the right corner other 2 1 2 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.970
 we climb three times in the right corner 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:41.540
 1-2-3 ready and on top of that we are going to 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.150
 place what are two blue 1 2 at 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.690
 right side a black wool and towards 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.430
 above 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:51.080
 others blue but this time they will be 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:53.270
 4 blue wool 1 2 3 4 in the hair 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:58.180
 last of what is the blue color let's go 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:02.560
 to place 3 black color on the right side 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.450
 here exactly here 1 2 3 in the 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.390
 first that we put we are going to place what 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.810
 what is this one gray and in the corner 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.960
 right two grays lower down stone in 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.980
 we're going to make a l with stone 2 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.959
 here 2 up 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.660
 there they are extracting it and with gray wool 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.220
 of course we are going to cover these two here and this 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.050
 of the way so that the tail is made 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.300
 fish very well 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.640
 now we grab what is the color cyan 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.290
 and from the blue we tell what are three 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.340
 left side left corner 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:37.870
 down another two left corner 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:40.570
 down 3 1 2 3 ready now we go down 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.660
 self and with the color cyan and in 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.190
 left corner again a 100 and two 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.470
 more down 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.730
 ok we will do the blue outline 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:55.120
 plugging these three blacks plugging 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.610
 the blue one in escalerita other 3 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.190
 Escaleritas others 2 and others 12 a 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.980
 Escalerita and one more ready we have the 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.349
 contour 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.830
 everything that is inside we are going to 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:10.290
 fill with the nation all all all 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.099
 all this part of here ok since already 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.099
 is finished 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.599
 let's give the effects to the fish 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:21.359
 for that we are going to put what is first 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:24.200
 the eye and where is the black on the side 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:26.700
 left we will place what is a 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.379
 reference in the right corner and 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.599
 above that we are going to place a black 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.579
 breaking this blue we already have the 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.560
 eye let's give it the effect of 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.090
 flakes with blue pencil leaving a 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.239
 space on the right side of what is the 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:42.069
 black we put in the corner of what is 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.769
 this blue pencil 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.079
 this part down here to this corner 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.239
 left corner to corner 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.900
 right down as well as if it were 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.600
 zig Zag 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.060
 in everything that is fish 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.510
 everything we have of the nation in what 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.160
 which is the the reason remains intact here 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.620
 also in the bottom part and in the 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.210
 top part obviously ready already 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.800
 we have the fish scales now 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:10.180
 we are missing the fins of what is the 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.740
 front and sides for it 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:16.010
 let's count three from this point 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.720
 where is the eye one two three in the 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.660
 fourth we break and put a gray 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.100
 right corner up two others and 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.020
 below those we will place a 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.030
 stone and one more in the right corner 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.700
 we have the first fin with gray 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.280
 clear on the upper fin leaving a 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.680
 space of these three this color is 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.070
 let's make stairs down 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.700
 twice one two and one more down ready 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.200
 and ok the tutorial is over 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.840
 it really is a tutor something simple this 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.520
 is for the fishmongers that want 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.500
 do in your cities the truth is 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.680
 nice because we put it up to 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.080
 scales so if you want to support the 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.390
 channel simply leaves a little hand up 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.430
 Share if you liked the video and already 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.940
 you know if you want more tutorials left 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.240
 a comment on the bottom 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.410
