00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.970
 let's go through the wonderful land 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:12.860
 of crazy mathematics with a moment 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.570
 donald you like music is not true 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.619
 good without math could not have 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.350
 music come let's go to ancient greece 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.310
 during the time of Pythagoras a great 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.310
 crazy according to you 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.700
 the father of mathematics and music 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.530
 dad you will realize that there are 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.530
 mathematics even in what less you 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:44.600
 imagine look first we will need a 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:46.910
 thread you have to put it well tense touch it 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.390
 now divide it into two touches the other 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.610
 You realize the same tone 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.410
 but an octave higher comes back to 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.750
 divide the section and the next 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.210
 Pythagoras discovered that the eighth had 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:07.000
 a ratio or radius of 2 to 1 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.000
 by simple fractions I achieve this 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.420
 and this mathematical harmony was born 

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:14.420
 our current scale 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.909
 i 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.470
 Pythagoras unveiled his 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.840
 discovery to his friends a 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.500
 Mathematics fraternity known as 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.960
 the Pythagoreans 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.640
 these men used to meet in 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.130
 secret to discuss their 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.780
 mathematical discoveries only 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.090
 members of the fraternity could 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.260
 attend and they identified with a 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.260
 secret emblem 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.790
 let's see what is the topic of the day 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.750
 i 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.349
 it's a musical session 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.849
 although he has finished talking 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.530
 everyone 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.730
 the Pythagoreans with their formula 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.720
 mathematical laid the foundations of our 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.720
 actual music
