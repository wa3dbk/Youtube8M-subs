 the tomato sauce is one of my numbers 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.519
 and is super easy to do 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.679

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.080
 tomato concassê ​​here I have a pound 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.000
 tomatoes and I 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.220
 start by making a superficial cut in the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.240
 tomato skin on the underside of 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.460
 x format 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.250
 soon after she takes a pan with water 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.740
 boiling and kneeling for a maximum of 15 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.900
 seconds is very fast because it is 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.470
 just for the skin of the tomato to drop and he does not 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.470
 can cook 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.260

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.260

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.700

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.129

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.210

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.210

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.340

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.470

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.360
 Olive oil just down the road I 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.800

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.640
 the tomatoes 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.090
 leaving a kitchen nothing on low heat

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.140
 started off 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.550
 hence the seasoning with salt and black pepper 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.140
 gil since he died also the acid is super 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.550
 of this technique of putting a 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.550
 teaspoon of sugar 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.590

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.480
 handful of basil leaves to leave 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.550

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.620
 Tomato on the next recipe so it's good 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.870

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.190
 in smaller pots and freeze 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.190
