sheetmetal worker program there's only

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.240 
sheetmetal worker program there's only
one<00:00:33.149> spot<00:00:33.390> in<00:00:33.510> province<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.079> it's<00:00:34.260> offer<00:00:34.469> in

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
one spot in province that it's offer in

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.920 
one spot in province that it's offer in
this<00:00:35.850> campus<00:00:36.180> right<00:00:36.360> here<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.719> only<00:00:36.840> place

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
this campus right here is the only place

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.569 
this campus right here is the only place
is<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.380> only<00:00:37.469> place<00:00:37.710> set<00:00:37.920> up<00:00:37.950> even<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.489> the

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
is the only place set up even to the

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.580 
is the only place set up even to the
block<00:00:38.790> unique<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:39.930> area<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.200> guess<00:00:40.410> that's

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
block unique this area I guess that's

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.930 
block unique this area I guess that's
the<00:00:40.649> reason<00:00:40.710> why<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.129> lot<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.520> students<00:00:41.850> are

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
the reason why a lot of the students are

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.790 
the reason why a lot of the students are
getting<00:00:42.059> work<00:00:42.590> opportunities<00:00:43.590> are<00:00:43.710> there

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
getting work opportunities are there

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.319 
getting work opportunities are there
because<00:00:44.010> there's<00:00:44.280> not<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.399> lot<00:00:44.489> numbers<00:00:45.030> coming

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
because there's not a lot numbers coming

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.720 
because there's not a lot numbers coming
out<00:00:45.420> right<00:00:45.629> now<00:00:45.920> there's<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.980> lot<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.399> lot<00:00:47.670> of
