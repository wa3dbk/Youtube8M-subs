00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
series I saw a couple years back that

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.490 
series I saw a couple years back that
series<00:00:57.000> was<00:00:57.120> big<00:00:57.480> talk<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> anime

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
series was big talk in the anime

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.860 
series was big talk in the anime
industry<00:00:58.699> because<00:00:59.699> it<00:01:00.149> was<00:01:00.480> an<00:01:00.600> anime

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
industry because it was an anime

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.029 
industry because it was an anime
original<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.230> going<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.410> be<00:01:01.469> unique<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.890> heard

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
original is going to be unique I heard

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.680 
original is going to be unique I heard
some<00:01:02.280> talk<00:01:02.430> about<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.030> people<00:01:03.239> needed<00:01:03.629> to

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
some talk about it and people needed to

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.030 
some talk about it and people needed to
pick<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.960> up<00:01:04.049> that's<00:01:04.229> why<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.379> heard<00:01:04.559> people<00:01:04.830> say

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
pick it up that's why I heard people say

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.940 
pick it up that's why I heard people say
and<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.909> I'm<00:01:06.210> guessing<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.930> anime<00:01:07.590> title

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
and so I'm guessing that anime title

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.010 
and so I'm guessing that anime title
that<00:01:08.070> was<00:01:08.189> used<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:09.360> episode<00:01:09.720> was<00:01:09.960> a

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
that was used in this episode was a

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.929 
that was used in this episode was a
reference<00:01:10.650> towards<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.189> anime<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.790> was

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
reference towards that anime that was

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.910 
reference towards that anime that was
the<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.750> was<00:01:12.810> made<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.049> couple<00:01:13.350> years<00:01:13.650> back

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
the that was made a couple years back

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.800 
the that was made a couple years back
I'm<00:01:14.460> assuming<00:01:15.000> I'm<00:01:15.090> assuming<00:01:15.509> that's<00:01:15.600> where

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
I'm assuming I'm assuming that's where

the pacing of that is a little bit fast

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.479
