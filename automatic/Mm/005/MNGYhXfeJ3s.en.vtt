most common tasks I have to do involving

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.159 
most common tasks I have to do involving
the<00:00:14.330> Kreg<00:00:14.599> jig<00:00:14.630> and<00:00:15.460> that<00:00:16.460> is<00:00:16.700> making<00:00:17.240> a<00:00:17.630> door

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:18.169 
the Kreg jig and that is making a door

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:21.220 
the Kreg jig and that is making a door
for<00:00:18.529> crawlspace<00:00:19.189> entrance<00:00:19.869> I'll<00:00:20.869> show<00:00:21.140> you

for crawlspace entrance I'll show you

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.350 
for crawlspace entrance I'll show you
just<00:00:21.290> how<00:00:21.529> easy<00:00:21.980> it<00:00:22.250> is<00:00:22.430> to<00:00:22.730> make<00:00:22.880> a<00:00:23.060> great

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.360 
just how easy it is to make a great

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.960 
just how easy it is to make a great
sturdy<00:00:24.079> door<00:00:24.470> quickly<00:00:24.860> now<00:00:25.579> whenever<00:00:25.730> you're

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
sturdy door quickly now whenever you're

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.139 
sturdy door quickly now whenever you're
making<00:00:26.119> a<00:00:26.390> door<00:00:27.250> these<00:00:28.250> side<00:00:28.579> parts<00:00:29.000> are

00:00:29.139 --> 00:00:29.149 
making a door these side parts are

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:33.310 
making a door these side parts are
called<00:00:29.329> the<00:00:29.660> Stiles<00:00:30.559> and<00:00:31.870> these<00:00:32.870> horizontal

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
called the Stiles and these horizontal

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.520 
called the Stiles and these horizontal
parts<00:00:33.980> are<00:00:34.190> called<00:00:34.370> the<00:00:34.610> rails<00:00:35.140> the<00:00:36.140> style

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
parts are called the rails the style

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.930 
parts are called the rails the style
should<00:00:36.860> go<00:00:37.040> from<00:00:37.280> top<00:00:37.609> to<00:00:37.640> bottom<00:00:37.879> so<00:00:38.480> my<00:00:39.469> style

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
should go from top to bottom so my style

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.250 
should go from top to bottom so my style
is<00:00:40.940> going<00:00:41.149> to<00:00:41.210> be<00:00:41.329> 17<00:00:41.960> and<00:00:42.199> 3/4<00:00:43.839> the<00:00:44.839> total

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
is going to be 17 and 3/4 the total

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.060 
is going to be 17 and 3/4 the total
width<00:00:45.499> has<00:00:45.800> to<00:00:45.980> be<00:00:46.100> 23<00:00:46.760> and<00:00:46.910> 3/4<00:00:47.649> so<00:00:48.649> since<00:00:48.890> I'm

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
width has to be 23 and 3/4 so since I'm

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.779 
width has to be 23 and 3/4 so since I'm
using<00:00:49.510> 2<00:00:50.510> and<00:00:50.629> a<00:00:50.659> half<00:00:50.839> inch<00:00:51.109> stock<00:00:51.789> I'll

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
using 2 and a half inch stock I'll

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.660 
using 2 and a half inch stock I'll
subtract<00:00:53.359> 5<00:00:53.719> inches<00:00:54.170> so<00:00:55.070> I'm<00:00:55.129> going<00:00:55.249> to<00:00:55.280> cut<00:00:55.460> to

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
subtract 5 inches so I'm going to cut to

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:07.569 
subtract 5 inches so I'm going to cut to
18<00:00:56.210> and<00:00:56.390> 3/4<00:00:56.929> and<00:00:57.170> to<00:00:57.409> 17

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:07.579 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:10.130 

so<00:01:08.579> here's<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.850> basic<00:01:09.179> layout<00:01:09.329> for<00:01:09.719> our<00:01:09.840> frame

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
so here's the basic layout for our frame

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.440 
so here's the basic layout for our frame
and<00:01:10.490> just<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.579> double-check<00:01:11.880> when<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.270> have

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
and just to double-check when I have

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.779 
and just to double-check when I have
everything<00:01:12.719> laid<00:01:13.049> out<00:01:13.100> its<00:01:14.100> twenty<00:01:14.429> three<00:01:14.640> and

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:14.789 
everything laid out its twenty three and

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:18.919 
everything laid out its twenty three and
three<00:01:14.969> quarters<00:01:15.420> by<00:01:17.299> seventeen<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.570> three

00:01:18.919 --> 00:01:18.929 
three quarters by seventeen and three

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:21.620 
three quarters by seventeen and three
quarters<00:01:19.670> so<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.060> how<00:01:21.210> we<00:01:21.270> have<00:01:21.479> to

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
quarters so this is how we have to

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.700 
quarters so this is how we have to
assemble<00:01:21.929> the<00:01:22.140> frame<00:01:22.819> so<00:01:23.819> we're<00:01:23.939> going<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.119> put

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
assemble the frame so we're going to put

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.410 
assemble the frame so we're going to put
the<00:01:25.710> joinery<00:01:26.130> right<00:01:26.429> here<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:26.969> we'll<00:01:27.119> put<00:01:27.299> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
the joinery right here and we'll put the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.240 
the joinery right here and we'll put the
screws<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:27.959> the<00:01:27.990> back<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.560> it's<00:01:28.679> hitting<00:01:28.979> now

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
screws on the back so it's hitting now

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.100 
screws on the back so it's hitting now
the<00:01:29.310> Kreg<00:01:29.579> jig<00:01:29.610> has<00:01:30.030> marks<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.750> know<00:01:30.869> where

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
the Kreg jig has marks so you know where

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.660 
the Kreg jig has marks so you know where
to<00:01:31.229> set<00:01:31.530> everything<00:01:31.979> depending<00:01:32.429> on<00:01:32.520> the

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
to set everything depending on the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.779 
to set everything depending on the
thickness<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.179> your<00:01:33.509> material<00:01:34.610> since<00:01:35.610> we're

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
thickness of your material since we're

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.609 
thickness of your material since we're
using<00:01:35.819> 3/4<00:01:36.810> inch<00:01:36.929> material<00:01:39.140> we<00:01:40.140> want<00:01:40.289> to<00:01:40.439> set

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
using 3/4 inch material we want to set

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.399 
using 3/4 inch material we want to set
this<00:01:40.829> at<00:01:41.159> 3/4<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.149> an<00:01:42.420> inch<00:01:42.539> which<00:01:42.929> is<00:01:43.110> marked

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
this at 3/4 of an inch which is marked

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.460 
this at 3/4 of an inch which is marked
right<00:01:43.590> there<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.610> we<00:01:44.670> slide<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.209> down<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.750> 3/4

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
right there so we slide that down to 3/4

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.029 
right there so we slide that down to 3/4
and<00:01:46.709> then<00:01:47.610> tighten<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.090> screw<00:01:48.450> here<00:01:48.950> and<00:01:49.950> it

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
and then tighten the screw here and it

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.520 
and then tighten the screw here and it
goes<00:01:50.220> right<00:01:50.489> in<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:51.920> there<00:01:52.920> we<00:01:53.069> go<00:01:54.439> since<00:01:55.439> I

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
goes right in so there we go since I

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.479 
goes right in so there we go since I
want<00:01:55.709> to<00:01:55.739> put<00:01:55.920> my<00:01:56.039> screws<00:01:56.429> in<00:01:56.789> here<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:58.369> will<00:01:59.369> do

00:01:59.479 --> 00:01:59.489 
want to put my screws in here I will do

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:06.649 
want to put my screws in here I will do
this<00:01:59.670> take<00:02:00.599> this<00:02:00.810> piece<00:02:05.329> I'll<00:02:06.329> put<00:02:06.539> it<00:02:06.629> right

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
this take this piece I'll put it right

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.020 
this take this piece I'll put it right
in<00:02:06.989> the<00:02:07.079> jig<00:02:07.819> and<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:08.910> want<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.209> do<00:02:09.329> two<00:02:09.690> screws

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
in the jig and I want to do two screws

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.729 
in the jig and I want to do two screws
so<00:02:12.030> I'm<00:02:12.120> going<00:02:12.299> to<00:02:12.389> use<00:02:12.480> holes<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:13.049> and<00:02:13.560> B<00:02:15.739> so

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
so I'm going to use holes a and B so

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.680 
so I'm going to use holes a and B so
I'll<00:02:16.859> get<00:02:17.040> those<00:02:17.250> lined<00:02:17.639> up<00:02:17.850> in<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.180> middle<00:02:18.420> of

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
I'll get those lined up in the middle of

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.770 
I'll get those lined up in the middle of
this<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.639> then<00:02:20.639> I<00:02:20.670> just<00:02:20.790> clamp<00:02:21.359> it<00:02:21.510> down<00:02:23.780> that

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
this and then I just clamp it down that

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.190 
this and then I just clamp it down that
now<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:25.650> thing<00:02:25.859> can't<00:02:26.100> move<00:02:26.340> I<00:02:26.730> can<00:02:27.660> drill<00:02:28.079> my

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
now that thing can't move I can drill my

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.620 
now that thing can't move I can drill my
holes<00:02:28.440> in<00:02:28.680> there<00:02:28.829> the<00:02:29.489> Kreg<00:02:29.730> jig<00:02:29.760> also<00:02:30.389> tells

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
holes in there the Kreg jig also tells

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.900 
holes in there the Kreg jig also tells
you<00:02:30.750> what<00:02:30.870> size<00:02:31.260> screws<00:02:31.799> to<00:02:32.130> use<00:02:32.310> depending<00:02:32.819> on

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
you what size screws to use depending on

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.930 
you what size screws to use depending on
the<00:02:32.970> thickness<00:02:33.239> so<00:02:33.810> here<00:02:34.200> we've<00:02:34.829> got<00:02:35.040> 3/4<00:02:35.730> inch

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
the thickness so here we've got 3/4 inch

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.569 
the thickness so here we've got 3/4 inch
stock<00:02:36.380> so<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:37.410> want<00:02:37.739> to<00:02:37.829> use<00:02:37.950> inch<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.519> a

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
stock so you want to use inch and a
