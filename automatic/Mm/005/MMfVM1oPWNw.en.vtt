00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
talk about the recording software for

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.859 
talk about the recording software for
this<00:00:30.419> year

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
this year

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.170 
this year
now<00:00:31.110> fraps<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.949> extort<00:00:32.369> there's<00:00:32.669> been<00:00:32.879> a<00:00:32.910> lot

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
now fraps the extort there's been a lot

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.420 
now fraps the extort there's been a lot
of<00:00:33.210> complaining<00:00:33.720> about<00:00:33.809> those<00:00:34.140> two<00:00:34.379> dxtory<00:00:35.250> is

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
of complaining about those two dxtory is

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.000 
of complaining about those two dxtory is
being<00:00:35.670> too<00:00:35.940> too<00:00:36.809> complicated<00:00:37.230> for<00:00:37.649> people<00:00:37.890> to

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
being too too complicated for people to

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.490 
being too too complicated for people to
use<00:00:39.110> fraps<00:00:40.110> was<00:00:40.470> apparently<00:00:42.260> using<00:00:43.260> too<00:00:43.379> much

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
use fraps was apparently using too much

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.100 
use fraps was apparently using too much
system<00:00:43.890> resources<00:00:44.580> so<00:00:45.089> the<00:00:45.210> FPS<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.809> people

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
system resources so the FPS to people

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.439 
system resources so the FPS to people
God<00:00:46.320> was<00:00:46.589> like<00:00:46.710> seriously<00:00:47.460> terrible<00:00:48.030> unless

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
God was like seriously terrible unless

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:51.530 
God was like seriously terrible unless
you<00:00:48.600> had<00:00:48.780> unless<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.680> had<00:00:49.860> like<00:00:50.129> $1000<00:00:50.970> or<00:00:51.150> PC

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
you had unless you had like $1000 or PC

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.880 
you had unless you had like $1000 or PC
so<00:00:52.110> basically<00:00:53.930> what<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:54.960> wanted<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.440> do<00:00:55.589> is

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
so basically what I wanted to do is

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.340 
so basically what I wanted to do is
search<00:00:56.100> for<00:00:56.150> recording<00:00:57.150> software<00:00:57.659> that

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
search for recording software that

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.520 
search for recording software that
combines<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.820> two<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.479> combines<00:01:00.900> the<00:01:01.140> options

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
combines the two it combines the options

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.609 
combines the two it combines the options
that<00:01:01.890> dxtory<00:01:02.580> has<00:01:03.019> while<00:01:04.019> some<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.409> them<00:01:04.530> at

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
that dxtory has while some of them at

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.160 
that dxtory has while some of them at
least<00:01:04.710> not<00:01:04.860> all<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:06.360> functionality<00:01:07.140> and

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
least not all and the functionality and

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.200 
least not all and the functionality and
simplicity<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.950> fraps<00:01:08.610> have<00:01:08.880> now<00:01:10.369> also<00:01:11.369> some

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
simplicity the fraps have now also some

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.789 
simplicity the fraps have now also some
of<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.390> extra<00:01:12.659> features<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.409> thing<00:01:13.619> is

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
of the extra features of this thing is

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.530 
of the extra features of this thing is

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
thing that really makes this program a

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.919 
thing that really makes this program a
lot<00:01:58.530> different<00:01:59.100> from<00:01:59.219> fraps<00:01:59.999> and<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.659> DX

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
lot different from fraps and the DX

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:03.709 
lot different from fraps and the DX
story<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:02.249> it<00:02:02.759> really<00:02:03.179> doesn't<00:02:03.659> take

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
story is that it it really doesn't take

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.459 
story is that it it really doesn't take
a<00:02:03.899> lot<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.259> system<00:02:04.829> resources<00:02:05.090> it's<00:02:06.469> it's

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
a lot of system resources it's it's

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.130 
a lot of system resources it's it's
extremely<00:02:08.039> easy<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.399> use<00:02:08.600> when<00:02:09.600> you<00:02:09.690> get<00:02:09.810> into

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
extremely easy to use when you get into

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.050 
extremely easy to use when you get into
game<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.440> record<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:10.979> when<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:11.850> start

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
recording with fraps you first thing you

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.850 
recording with fraps you first thing you
need<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.850> see<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.630> FPS<00:02:15.900> drop<00:02:16.380> with<00:02:16.680> this

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
need you see is the FPS drop with this

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.500 
need you see is the FPS drop with this
thing<00:02:17.069> is<00:02:17.220> it<00:02:17.490> pretty<00:02:17.670> much<00:02:17.819> just<00:02:17.880> go<00:02:18.209> smoothly

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
thing is it pretty much just go smoothly

I<00:02:22.740> suggest<00:02:23.520> we<00:02:23.550> get<00:02:23.730> into<00:02:24.120> battlefield<00:02:24.510> 3<00:02:25.020> and

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
I suggest we get into battlefield 3 and

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.940 
I suggest we get into battlefield 3 and
I'm<00:02:26.100> gonna<00:02:26.280> try<00:02:26.490> recording<00:02:26.959> 60fps<00:02:27.959> with<00:02:28.290> video

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
I'm gonna try recording 60fps with video

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.520 
I'm gonna try recording 60fps with video

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
do it this with fraps and would I would

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.229 
do it this with fraps and would I would
probably<00:03:37.569> fail<00:03:38.230> epically<00:03:38.919> with<00:03:39.189> it<00:03:39.340> really

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
probably fail epically with it really

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.119

because I mean if I try to do it with
fraps<00:03:42.790> I<00:03:43.090> would<00:03:43.629> get<00:03:43.780> like<00:03:43.930> mostly<00:03:44.409> 40<00:03:44.889> fps<00:03:45.310> now

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:45.699

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
I'm gonna change the map so you guys can

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.189 
I'm gonna change the map so you guys can
see<00:04:10.169> you<00:04:11.169> can<00:04:11.319> see<00:04:11.530> some<00:04:12.129> more<00:04:12.280> of<00:04:12.370> this<00:04:13.049> how<00:04:14.049> it

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:14.199 
see you can see some more of this how it

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:18.649 
see you can see some more of this how it
performs<00:04:14.560> at<00:04:14.680> everything<00:04:14.859> and<00:04:16.320> yeah<00:04:17.370> let's

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:18.659 
performs at everything and yeah let's

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:22.110 
performs at everything and yeah let's
let's<00:04:19.659> do<00:04:19.930> that<00:04:20.109> okay<00:04:20.949> and<00:04:21.430> we're<00:04:21.609> back<00:04:21.880> now

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
we're playing a different map so you

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.320 
we're playing a different map so you
wouldn't<00:04:24.070> think<00:04:24.250> oh<00:04:24.460> this<00:04:24.789> is<00:04:24.849> only<00:04:25.090> an

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
wouldn't think oh this is only an
