custom earphones and earbuds and how
quick<00:00:47.920> how<00:00:48.159> quickly<00:00:48.429> we<00:00:48.579> get<00:00:48.730> these<00:00:48.910> done<00:00:49.090> four

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
quick how quickly we get these done four

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.229 
quick how quickly we get these done four
minutes<00:00:49.750> in<00:00:50.109> four<00:00:50.590> minutes<00:00:50.980> okay<00:00:51.820> so<00:00:51.879> let's

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
minutes in four minutes okay so let's

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:53.970 
minutes in four minutes okay so let's
sit<00:00:52.449> let's<00:00:52.660> see<00:00:52.809> how<00:00:52.989> we<00:00:53.050> do<00:00:53.350> this<00:00:53.500> in<00:00:53.710> four

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
sit let's see how we do this in four

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.180 
sit let's see how we do this in four
minutes<00:00:54.250> okay<00:00:54.640> so<00:00:55.149> here's<00:00:55.600> the<00:00:55.750> deal<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:56.829> is

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
minutes okay so here's the deal this is

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.020 
minutes okay so here's the deal this is
the<00:00:57.609> fitting<00:00:58.269> system<00:00:58.960> inside<00:01:00.030> there's

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
the fitting system inside there's

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.380 
the fitting system inside there's
silicon<00:01:01.839> that<00:01:02.140> gets<00:01:02.379> injected<00:01:02.879> not<00:01:03.879> into<00:01:04.239> your

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
silicon that gets injected not into your

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.020 
silicon that gets injected not into your
ears<00:01:04.660> technically<00:01:05.460> but<00:01:06.460> into<00:01:06.880> these<00:01:06.970> little

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
ears technically but into these little

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.719 
ears technically but into these little
balloons<00:01:07.929> ok<00:01:08.530> so<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:08.950> silicon<00:01:09.340> doesn't<00:01:09.640> go

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
balloons ok so the silicon doesn't go

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.070 
balloons ok so the silicon doesn't go
into<00:01:09.909> your<00:01:10.090> ear<00:01:10.300> all<00:01:10.570> right<00:01:10.810> you<00:01:10.929> don't<00:01:10.990> have

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
into your ear all right you don't have

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.469 
into your ear all right you don't have
to<00:01:11.229> worry<00:01:11.409> about<00:01:11.500> that<00:01:11.830> so<00:01:12.550> the<00:01:12.640> silicon<00:01:13.090> flows

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
to worry about that so the silicon flows

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.990 
to worry about that so the silicon flows
through<00:01:13.929> for<00:01:14.710> about<00:01:14.830> two<00:01:15.039> minutes<00:01:15.159> and<00:01:15.520> then

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
through for about two minutes and then

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.270 
through for about two minutes and then
it<00:01:16.119> cures<00:01:16.390> for<00:01:16.869> about<00:01:17.080> two<00:01:17.319> minutes<00:01:17.440> you<00:01:18.069> take

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
it cures for about two minutes you take

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.080 
it cures for about two minutes you take
the<00:01:18.429> headset<00:01:18.640> off<00:01:19.119> you're<00:01:19.840> done<00:01:20.229> that's<00:01:20.979> it<00:01:21.250> so

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
the headset off you're done that's it so

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.030 
the headset off you're done that's it so
four<00:01:22.479> minutes<00:01:22.840> and<00:01:23.049> you've<00:01:23.170> got<00:01:23.350> custom<00:01:23.829> head

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
four minutes and you've got custom head

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.630 
four minutes and you've got custom head
custom<00:01:24.790> earbuds<00:01:25.329> okay<00:01:25.899> that<00:01:26.640> specifically

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
custom earbuds okay that specifically

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.420 
custom earbuds okay that specifically
for<00:01:27.939> your<00:01:28.090> ear<00:01:28.390> a<00:01:28.740> lot<00:01:29.740> of<00:01:29.770> people<00:01:30.070> don't<00:01:30.250> know

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
for your ear a lot of people don't know

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.969 
for your ear a lot of people don't know
you<00:01:30.820> know<00:01:30.850> we<00:01:31.090> no<00:01:31.299> fingerprints<00:01:32.140> are<00:01:32.320> unique

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
you know we no fingerprints are unique

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.090 
you know we no fingerprints are unique
right<00:01:33.399> your<00:01:34.149> canals<00:01:34.540> are<00:01:34.750> even<00:01:35.079> more<00:01:35.500> unique

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
right your canals are even more unique

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.389 
right your canals are even more unique
so<00:01:36.700> it's<00:01:37.600> only<00:01:37.899> going<00:01:38.229> to<00:01:38.290> fit<00:01:38.500> you<00:01:38.710> nobody

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
so it's only going to fit you nobody

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.789 
so it's only going to fit you nobody
else<00:01:39.640> can<00:01:40.180> use<00:01:40.420> it<00:01:40.450> well<00:01:41.439> that's<00:01:41.590> great

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
else can use it well that's great

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.260 
else can use it well that's great
because<00:01:41.950> it'll<00:01:42.280> keep<00:01:42.399> it<00:01:42.490> away<00:01:42.670> from<00:01:42.700> my<00:01:42.969> kids

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
because it'll keep it away from my kids

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.959 
because it'll keep it away from my kids
so<00:01:43.990> you<00:01:44.049> put<00:01:44.439> this<00:01:44.560> on<00:01:44.770> right<00:01:45.189> and<00:01:45.430> then<00:01:45.759> you

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 
so you put this on right and then you

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:47.940 
so you put this on right and then you
flick<00:01:46.240> one<00:01:46.450> switch<00:01:46.750> yeah<00:01:47.380> then<00:01:47.619> you<00:01:47.710> flick<00:01:47.920> the

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
flick one switch yeah then you flick the

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.310 
flick one switch yeah then you flick the
other<00:01:48.189> switch<00:01:48.520> it<00:01:49.000> activates<00:01:49.509> it<00:01:49.689> which<00:01:49.930> makes

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
other switch it activates it which makes

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.719 
other switch it activates it which makes
the<00:01:50.530> silicon<00:01:50.920> flow<00:01:51.189> through<00:01:51.399> the<00:01:51.490> tubes

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
the silicon flow through the tubes

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.480 
the silicon flow through the tubes
that's<00:01:52.210> it<00:01:52.390> so<00:01:53.049> once<00:01:53.409> you<00:01:53.530> get<00:01:53.649> them<00:01:53.770> done<00:01:53.950> you

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
that's it so once you get them done you

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.819 
that's it so once you get them done you
pop<00:01:54.759> them<00:01:54.909> in<00:01:55.119> the<00:01:55.149> sound<00:01:55.930> isolation<00:01:56.530> is

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
pop them in the sound isolation is

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.780 
pop them in the sound isolation is
amazing<00:01:57.610> and<00:01:57.850> then<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.750> sound<00:01:58.990> quality<00:01:59.229> is

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
amazing and then the sound quality is

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.310 
amazing and then the sound quality is
really<00:02:01.790> impressive<00:02:02.119> it's<00:02:02.540> so<00:02:02.720> cool<00:02:03.020> to<00:02:03.049> watch

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
really impressive it's so cool to watch
