detail<00:01:48.369> these<00:01:48.909> mechanisms<00:01:49.420> so<00:01:50.110> that<00:01:50.140> we<00:01:50.409> can

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
detail these mechanisms so that we can

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.289 
detail these mechanisms so that we can
manipulate<00:01:50.829> them<00:01:51.340> at<00:01:51.790> the<00:01:51.939> same<00:01:52.090> time
