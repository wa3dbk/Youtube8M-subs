this<00:00:39.900> there<00:00:40.199> is<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.350> process<00:00:40.739> that's<00:00:40.769> a<00:00:40.979> step

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:41.339 
this there is a process that's a step

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:42.799 
this there is a process that's a step
beyond<00:00:41.729> that<00:00:41.909> something<00:00:42.150> a<00:00:42.210> bit<00:00:42.360> cleverer

professor<00:00:47.519> it's<00:00:47.940> not<00:00:48.210> burning<00:00:48.600> energy<00:00:48.839> waste

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
professor it's not burning energy waste

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.469 
professor it's not burning energy waste
directly<00:00:49.830> fuse<00:00:50.159> Energizer's<00:00:50.699> no<00:00:51.120> it's<00:00:51.299> not

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:51.479 
directly fuse Energizer's no it's not

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:53.360 
directly fuse Energizer's no it's not
what<00:00:52.019> it<00:00:52.170> does<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.500> it's<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.979> process<00:00:53.190> called

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
what it does is it's a process called

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.759 
what it does is it's a process called
pyrolysis<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.870> takes<00:00:55.049> a<00:00:55.170> wide<00:00:55.379> range<00:00:55.680> of

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769 
pyrolysis and it takes a wide range of

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:57.640 
pyrolysis and it takes a wide range of
different<00:00:55.920> types<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.460> waste<00:00:56.670> material<00:00:57.239> and

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
different types of waste material and

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.600 
different types of waste material and
produces<00:00:58.650> three<00:00:59.010> different<00:00:59.309> types<00:00:59.460> of

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
produces three different types of

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.590 
produces three different types of
outputs<00:01:00.440> oils<00:01:01.460> vapors<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.699> charcoal<00:01:03.299> and

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
outputs oils vapors and charcoal and

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.240 
outputs oils vapors and charcoal and
what's<00:01:04.019> exciting<00:01:04.500> about<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.070> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
what's exciting about this is the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.850 
what's exciting about this is the
charcoal<00:01:05.900> sequester's<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.049> carbon<00:01:07.440> so<00:01:07.710> this

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
charcoal sequester's the carbon so this

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.770 
charcoal sequester's the carbon so this
becomes<00:01:08.189> basically<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.789> carbon<00:01:09.060> negative

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
becomes basically a carbon negative

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.310 
becomes basically a carbon negative
process<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:11.909> you've<00:01:12.899> been<00:01:13.020> trying<00:01:13.259> this

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
process and so you've been trying this

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.480 
process and so you've been trying this
on<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.469> big<00:01:13.649> scale<00:01:13.890> here<00:01:14.159> but<00:01:14.280> you're<00:01:14.399> also

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
on a big scale here but you're also

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.130 
on a big scale here but you're also
doing<00:01:14.609> experiments<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.450> India<00:01:15.780> aren't<00:01:15.960> you

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
doing experiments in India aren't you

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.679 
doing experiments in India aren't you
yes<00:01:16.409> we<00:01:16.590> are<00:01:16.740> we<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.299> we've<00:01:18.299> been<00:01:18.420> looking

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
yes we are we have a we've been looking

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.999 
yes we are we have a we've been looking
at<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.869> really<00:01:19.200> interesting<00:01:19.409> problem<00:01:19.799> in

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
at a really interesting problem in

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.730 
at a really interesting problem in
punjab<00:01:20.460> where<00:01:20.820> rice<00:01:21.570> straw<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.229> wheat<00:01:22.530> straw

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
punjab where rice straw and wheat straw

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.980 
punjab where rice straw and wheat straw
basically<00:01:23.219> agricultural<00:01:23.820> waste<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.570> still

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
basically agricultural waste is still

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.709 
basically agricultural waste is still
being<00:01:25.229> burnt<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.770> open<00:01:26.130> fields<00:01:26.549> across<00:01:26.880> wide

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:27.719 
being burnt in open fields across wide

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:30.200 
being burnt in open fields across wide
areas<00:01:28.289> of<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.469> country<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.060> while<00:01:30.060> it's

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
areas of the country and while it's

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.510 
areas of the country and while it's
illegal<00:01:30.659> people<00:01:30.869> still<00:01:31.140> do<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.950> we've<00:01:32.340> been

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
illegal people still do it so we've been

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.679 
illegal people still do it so we've been
looking<00:01:32.670> at<00:01:32.909> whether<00:01:33.090> we<00:01:33.149> can<00:01:33.359> apply<00:01:33.630> this

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
looking at whether we can apply this

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.169 
looking at whether we can apply this
technology<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.619> transform<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.429> waste<00:01:35.759> into

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179 
technology to transform that waste into

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:37.999 
technology to transform that waste into
something<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.450> has<00:01:36.630> value<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:37.859> we've

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
something that has value and so we've

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.380 
something that has value and so we've
been<00:01:38.100> doing<00:01:38.249> this<00:01:38.399> for<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.850> last<00:01:38.939> two<00:01:39.240> months

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
been doing this for the last two months

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.690 
been doing this for the last two months
or<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.079> village<00:01:40.380> in<00:01:40.649> Punjab<00:01:40.950> called<00:01:41.460> wasp

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
or so in a village in Punjab called wasp

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.940 
or so in a village in Punjab called wasp
Ora<00:01:41.969> and<00:01:42.539> we've<00:01:42.869> been<00:01:43.020> very<00:01:43.049> successful<00:01:43.229> and

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
Ora and we've been very successful and

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.679 
Ora and we've been very successful and
we've<00:01:44.280> been<00:01:44.399> powering<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.909> local<00:01:45.210> school<00:01:45.479> and

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
we've been powering the local school and

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.160 
we've been powering the local school and
producing<00:01:46.590> a

an<00:01:48.619> enhancement<00:01:49.100> to<00:01:49.400> diesel<00:01:49.939> which<00:01:50.210> reduces

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
an enhancement to diesel which reduces

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.539 
an enhancement to diesel which reduces
the<00:01:50.720> cost<00:01:50.750> of<00:01:51.020> that<00:01:51.140> diesel<00:01:51.350> that<00:01:51.590> allows<00:01:51.770> that

energy<00:04:46.479> bills<00:04:46.689> down<00:04:47.139> I<00:04:47.439> think<00:04:47.800> for<00:04:48.039> you<00:04:48.279> and<00:04:48.400> me

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
energy bills down I think for you and me

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.469 
energy bills down I think for you and me
and<00:04:48.639> people<00:04:48.849> watching<00:04:49.150> at<00:04:49.210> home<00:04:49.240> tonight

the<00:04:59.860> cider<00:05:00.150> and<00:05:01.150> this<00:05:01.449> will<00:05:01.599> be<00:05:01.659> another<00:05:01.930> way

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
the cider and this will be another way

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.079 
the cider and this will be another way
for<00:05:02.169> them<00:05:02.379> to<00:05:02.439> extract<00:05:02.740> even<00:05:03.400> more<00:05:03.580> energy<00:05:03.969> out

00:05:04.079 --> 00:05:04.089

these<00:05:30.129> new<00:05:30.430> plants<00:05:30.759> as<00:05:30.969> new<00:05:31.120> technology<00:05:31.659> and

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
these new plants as new technology and

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.179 
these new plants as new technology and
so<00:05:32.169> that's<00:05:32.319> helped<00:05:32.499> safeguard<00:05:32.979> the<00:05:33.099> future

00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:33.189 
so that's helped safeguard the future

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:34.829 
so that's helped safeguard the future
the<00:05:33.430> firm<00:05:33.580> but<00:05:33.699> also<00:05:33.819> hopefully<00:05:34.300> will<00:05:34.659> allow

00:05:34.829 --> 00:05:34.839 
the firm but also hopefully will allow

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:37.049 
the firm but also hopefully will allow
them<00:05:35.020> to<00:05:35.050> expand<00:05:35.469> and<00:05:35.499> if<00:05:35.710> they<00:05:35.860> have<00:05:36.129> this<00:05:36.249> 16

00:05:37.049 --> 00:05:37.059 
them to expand and if they have this 16

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:38.579 
them to expand and if they have this 16
million<00:05:37.300> pound<00:05:37.569> nucleus<00:05:38.050> at<00:05:38.169> the<00:05:38.229> center<00:05:38.529> of

00:05:38.579 --> 00:05:38.589 
million pound nucleus at the center of

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:40.589 
million pound nucleus at the center of
this<00:05:38.680> bioenergy<00:05:39.339> sector<00:05:39.370> in<00:05:40.089> the<00:05:40.300> Midlands

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:40.599 
this bioenergy sector in the Midlands

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:42.450 
this bioenergy sector in the Midlands
then<00:05:40.749> the<00:05:40.930> hope<00:05:41.139> is<00:05:41.379> companies<00:05:41.979> will<00:05:42.129> grow<00:05:42.310> up

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
then the hope is companies will grow up

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.730 
then the hope is companies will grow up
around<00:05:42.699> it<00:05:42.909> now<00:05:43.360> we<00:05:43.419> know<00:05:43.689> very<00:05:44.289> well<00:05:44.379> each

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
around it now we know very well each

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.260 
around it now we know very well each
time<00:05:45.009> there<00:05:45.159> are<00:05:45.189> plans<00:05:45.460> for<00:05:45.610> an<00:05:45.759> incinerator

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
time there are plans for an incinerator

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.269 
time there are plans for an incinerator
to<00:05:46.539> be<00:05:46.689> built<00:05:46.930> that's<00:05:47.199> really<00:05:47.740> strong<00:05:48.009> local

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:48.279 
to be built that's really strong local

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:50.429 
to be built that's really strong local
opposition<00:05:48.879> so<00:05:49.060> how<00:05:49.419> did<00:05:49.569> this<00:05:49.689> bioenergy

00:05:50.429 --> 00:05:50.439 
opposition so how did this bioenergy

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:51.809 
opposition so how did this bioenergy
Center<00:05:50.740> get<00:05:50.860> around<00:05:51.069> that<00:05:51.219> problem<00:05:51.370> well

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:51.819 
Center get around that problem well

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:53.489 
Center get around that problem well
that's<00:05:52.089> a<00:05:52.180> fair<00:05:52.360> point<00:05:52.569> and<00:05:52.659> we<00:05:52.719> sought<00:05:52.870> Eisley

00:05:53.489 --> 00:05:53.499 
that's a fair point and we sought Eisley

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:54.480 
that's a fair point and we sought Eisley
at<00:05:53.589> the<00:05:53.649> start<00:05:53.889> of<00:05:54.009> my<00:05:54.069> report<00:05:54.370> that's

00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 
the kind of problems you get with big

the kind of problems you get with big
large-scale<00:06:08.949> incinerators<00:06:09.550> and<00:06:09.580> I<00:06:09.669> think

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:09.849 
large-scale incinerators and I think

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:11.579 
large-scale incinerators and I think
putting<00:06:09.999> it<00:06:10.240> there<00:06:10.449> right<00:06:11.080> in<00:06:11.199> the<00:06:11.289> central

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:11.589 
putting it there right in the central

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:13.079 
putting it there right in the central
campus<00:06:11.860> is<00:06:12.009> a<00:06:12.039> vote<00:06:12.249> of<00:06:12.279> confidence<00:06:12.459> in<00:06:12.969> that
