00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.790 
hardly covered itself in glory in recent
times<00:02:36.239> and<00:02:36.480> Klitschko<00:02:37.140> might<00:02:37.380> decide<00:02:37.680> he

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
times and Klitschko might decide he

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.690 
times and Klitschko might decide he
wants<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:38.100> go<00:02:38.190> in<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.340> different<00:02:38.489> direction

maybe<00:02:39.180> even<00:02:39.480> retire<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.500> going<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.340> number<00:02:42.000> one

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
maybe even retire so going to number one

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.970 
maybe even retire so going to number one
is<00:02:42.450> one<00:02:42.870> thing<00:02:43.110> but<00:02:43.230> actually<00:02:43.470> getting<00:02:43.830> the
