00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
hello all this is omega here to

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.990 
hello all this is omega here to
demonstrate<00:00:02.879> the<00:00:03.720> burst<00:00:04.470> fire<00:00:05.000> minecart

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
demonstrate the burst fire minecart

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.190 
demonstrate the burst fire minecart
system<00:00:07.700> it's<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:08.970> system<00:00:09.570> that<00:00:09.750> i<00:00:09.900> developed

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
system it's the system that i developed

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.959 
system it's the system that i developed
a<00:00:10.769> minecart<00:00:11.370> station<00:00:12.740> that's<00:00:13.740> pretty<00:00:14.400> similar

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
a minecart station that's pretty similar

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.890 
a minecart station that's pretty similar
in<00:00:15.000> functionality<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:16.320> most<00:00:16.949> other<00:00:17.100> stations

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
in functionality to most other stations

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.810 
in functionality to most other stations
lozito<00:00:18.900> get<00:00:19.650> from<00:00:19.859> one<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.340> other<00:00:20.430> without

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
lozito get from one to the other without

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.920 
lozito get from one to the other without
having<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.689> do<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.289> whole<00:00:22.500> lot<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.830> work<00:00:23.570> but<00:00:24.570> it

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
having to do a whole lot of work but it

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.400 
having to do a whole lot of work but it
also<00:00:25.170> has<00:00:25.800> an<00:00:26.250> interesting<00:00:26.670> feature<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.960> as

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
also has an interesting feature that as

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.420 
also has an interesting feature that as
far<00:00:28.769> as<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.070> know<00:00:29.390> no<00:00:30.390> other<00:00:30.420> station<00:00:31.349> has<00:00:31.619> at

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
far as I know no other station has at

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.520 
far as I know no other station has at
this<00:00:32.730> point<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:34.070> is<00:00:35.210> with<00:00:36.210> only<00:00:36.540> two

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
this point and that is with only two

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.150 
this point and that is with only two
rail<00:00:38.340> lines<00:00:38.760> connecting<00:00:39.629> stations<00:00:40.140> not<00:00:40.770> four

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
rail lines connecting stations not four

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.529 
rail lines connecting stations not four
not<00:00:41.190> six<00:00:42.440> and<00:00:43.440> no<00:00:43.770> redstone<00:00:44.520> wire<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.210> going

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
not six and no redstone wire is going

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.770 
not six and no redstone wire is going
between<00:00:45.719> stations<00:00:46.230> just<00:00:46.800> two<00:00:47.070> rail<00:00:47.370> lines<00:00:47.780> it

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
between stations just two rail lines it

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.610 
between stations just two rail lines it
can<00:00:48.960> handle<00:00:49.200> both<00:00:49.890> freight<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.620> passengers

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
can handle both freight and passengers

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.240 
can handle both freight and passengers
so<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.699> already<00:00:53.969> see<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:55.379> know<00:00:55.530> can<00:00:56.039> get

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
so you already see that you know can get

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.029 
so you already see that you know can get
in<00:00:56.340> one<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.489> these<00:00:56.670> passenger<00:00:57.360> cars<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.199> after

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
in one of these passenger cars and after

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.369 
in one of these passenger cars and after
a<00:00:59.070> little<00:00:59.219> delay<00:00:59.760> it<00:01:00.090> boosts<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.809> on<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
a little delay it boosts you on to the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.640 
a little delay it boosts you on to the
next<00:01:01.559> station<00:01:02.600> now<00:01:03.600> if<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:04.049> had<00:01:04.199> built<00:01:04.439> more

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
next station now if I had built more

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.679 
next station now if I had built more
stations<00:01:05.250> than<00:01:05.580> just<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:06.000> demonstration

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
stations than just this demonstration

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:14.510 
stations than just this demonstration
model<00:01:07.229> then<00:01:07.909> then<00:01:09.740> jeez<00:01:12.290> so<00:01:13.290> here's<00:01:13.920> one<00:01:14.189> thing

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
model then then jeez so here's one thing

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.940 
model then then jeez so here's one thing
about<00:01:14.760> mine<00:01:15.240> cart<00:01:15.570> systems<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.380> it's<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.770> really

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
about mine cart systems is it's a really

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.469 
about mine cart systems is it's a really
bad<00:01:17.280> idea<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:18.150> build<00:01:18.780> them<00:01:19.170> above<00:01:20.009> ground<00:01:20.479> near

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
bad idea to build them above ground near

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.340 
bad idea to build them above ground near
grass<00:01:22.259> where<00:01:22.950> animals<00:01:23.490> can<00:01:23.640> just<00:01:24.170> get<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.229> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
grass where animals can just get in the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.730 
grass where animals can just get in the
way<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.530> really<00:01:26.490> mess<00:01:26.820> things<00:01:26.850> up<00:01:28.520> so<00:01:30.710> so<00:01:31.710> I

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
way and really mess things up so so I

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.770 
way and really mess things up so so I
hope<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.130> don't<00:01:32.310> mind<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.630> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
hope you don't mind that this is the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.690 
hope you don't mind that this is the
second<00:01:34.170> time<00:01:34.350> I've<00:01:34.590> started<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.130> recording

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
second time I've started this recording

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.450 
second time I've started this recording
and<00:01:35.850> I'm<00:01:36.030> not<00:01:36.240> going<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.540> do<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.369> over<00:01:38.369> and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
and I'm not going to do this over and

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.300 
and I'm not going to do this over and
over<00:01:38.549> again<00:01:38.960> so<00:01:39.960> I'm<00:01:40.470> just<00:01:40.829> going<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.100> keep

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
over again so I'm just going to keep

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.160 
over again so I'm just going to keep
recording<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:43.399> get<00:01:44.399> on<00:01:44.549> with<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.960> reset<00:01:45.960> this

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
recording and get on with it reset this

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:53.149 
recording and get on with it reset this
thing<00:01:46.439> manually<00:01:51.350> yes<00:01:52.350> i<00:01:52.619> did<00:01:52.799> use<00:01:53.009> an

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
thing manually yes i did use an

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.260 
thing manually yes i did use an
inventory<00:01:53.460> editor<00:01:54.710> but<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.460> just<00:01:56.969> a

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
inventory editor but it is just a

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.050 
inventory editor but it is just a
demonstration<00:01:57.560> model<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:58.860> isn't<00:01:59.189> my<00:01:59.369> main

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
demonstration model this isn't my main

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.139 
demonstration model this isn't my main
world<00:02:00.799> so<00:02:01.799> for<00:02:02.189> all<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.280> purists<00:02:03.270> out<00:02:03.659> there

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
world so for all you purists out there

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.440 
world so for all you purists out there
yeah

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.160 

okay<00:02:11.890> so<00:02:12.890> this<00:02:13.280> should<00:02:13.730> still<00:02:14.450> work<00:02:14.720> in<00:02:15.050> the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
okay so this should still work in the

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:22.060 
okay so this should still work in the
theory<00:02:16.150> just<00:02:17.150> gotta<00:02:17.540> wait<00:02:18.320> for<00:02:18.590> it<00:02:19.810> yes<00:02:21.070> okay

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
theory just gotta wait for it yes okay

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.950 
theory just gotta wait for it yes okay
so<00:02:22.550> that's<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.360> passenger<00:02:24.320> side<00:02:24.560> of<00:02:24.770> things

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
so that's the passenger side of things

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:32.500 
so that's the passenger side of things
pretty<00:02:26.960> straightforward<00:02:31.120> it's<00:02:32.120> probably<00:02:32.300> a

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
pretty straightforward it's probably a

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.240 
pretty straightforward it's probably a
more<00:02:32.630> efficient<00:02:33.140> way<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.350> take<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.800> card<00:02:34.040> away

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
more efficient way to take the card away

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.320 
more efficient way to take the card away
but<00:02:34.550> this<00:02:34.790> one<00:02:35.330> works<00:02:36.140> every<00:02:36.740> single<00:02:36.770> time

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
but this one works every single time

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.520 
but this one works every single time
even<00:02:38.330> if<00:02:38.450> it<00:02:38.570> uses<00:02:38.780> a<00:02:38.990> little<00:02:39.230> bit<00:02:39.380> more

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
even if it uses a little bit more

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.060 
even if it uses a little bit more
material<00:02:41.050> okay<00:02:42.050> so<00:02:42.110> that's<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.500> passenger

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
material okay so that's the passenger

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.760 
material okay so that's the passenger
side<00:02:43.580> of<00:02:43.820> things<00:02:44.030> now<00:02:44.450> we<00:02:44.510> go<00:02:44.810> down<00:02:45.050> here<00:02:45.080> to

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
side of things now we go down here to

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.760 
side of things now we go down here to
the<00:02:46.370> freight<00:02:46.960> area<00:02:47.960> and<00:02:49.150> there's<00:02:50.150> little

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
the freight area and there's little

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.260 
the freight area and there's little
place<00:02:51.770> here<00:02:51.800> where<00:02:52.190> you<00:02:52.460> can<00:02:52.640> interface<00:02:53.210> with

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
place here where you can interface with

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.400 
place here where you can interface with
your<00:02:53.810> with<00:02:54.800> your<00:02:54.830> freight<00:02:55.340> car<00:02:55.640> and<00:02:56.110> if<00:02:57.110> I<00:02:57.260> had

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
your with your freight car and if I had

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.590 
your with your freight car and if I had
built<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.800> other<00:02:58.040> half<00:02:58.340> of<00:02:58.520> the<00:02:58.700> station<00:02:59.150> that

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
built the other half of the station that

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.150 
built the other half of the station that
would<00:02:59.810> connect<00:03:00.230> in<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.740> other<00:03:00.860> direction

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
would connect in the other direction

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.620 
would connect in the other direction
then<00:03:01.640> there<00:03:01.820> would<00:03:01.970> be<00:03:02.000> another<00:03:02.270> one<00:03:02.480> over

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
then there would be another one over

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.670 
then there would be another one over
here<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:03.610> here<00:03:04.610> is<00:03:04.730> a<00:03:04.910> lever<00:03:05.240> that<00:03:06.050> switches

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
here and here is a lever that switches

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.480 
here and here is a lever that switches
between<00:03:07.630> different<00:03:08.630> directions<00:03:09.200> so<00:03:09.740> if<00:03:10.370> I

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
between different directions so if I

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.810 
between different directions so if I
want<00:03:10.670> to<00:03:10.790> send<00:03:11.120> this<00:03:11.600> Freight<00:03:12.500> or<00:03:12.860> this<00:03:13.220> empty

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
want to send this Freight or this empty

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.440 
want to send this Freight or this empty
box<00:03:14.120> either<00:03:14.810> way<00:03:15.170> to<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:16.459> beach<00:03:16.670> then<00:03:17.180> I<00:03:17.270> would

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
box either way to the beach then I would

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.620 
box either way to the beach then I would
switch<00:03:17.780> this<00:03:18.050> this<00:03:18.350> way<00:03:18.620> if<00:03:19.580> I<00:03:19.700> want<00:03:19.910> to<00:03:20.000> send

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
switch this this way if I want to send

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.860 
switch this this way if I want to send
this<00:03:20.989> cart<00:03:21.440> over<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.280> spawn<00:03:23.030> then<00:03:23.570> I<00:03:23.660> would

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
this cart over to the spawn then I would

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.720 
this cart over to the spawn then I would
you<00:03:24.650> know<00:03:24.680> switch<00:03:25.220> it<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.489> other<00:03:25.610> way<00:03:27.730> right

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
you know switch it the other way right

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.360 
you know switch it the other way right
now<00:03:28.790> this<00:03:29.209> just<00:03:29.480> loops<00:03:29.840> back<00:03:30.620> to<00:03:30.950> this<00:03:31.070> same

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
now this just loops back to this same

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.400 
now this just loops back to this same
station<00:03:32.350> so<00:03:33.350> I<00:03:33.380> look<00:03:33.800> in<00:03:33.950> here<00:03:34.480> yeah<00:03:35.480> i'll<00:03:36.080> send

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
station so I look in here yeah i'll send

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:46.680 
station so I look in here yeah i'll send
it<00:03:36.500> off<00:03:36.620> with<00:03:36.860> one<00:03:37.100> dirt<00:03:38.050> press<00:03:39.050> that<00:03:39.260> button

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.100 

this<00:03:47.410> guy<00:03:47.620> this<00:03:48.310> guy<00:03:48.430> has<00:03:48.700> two<00:03:49.000> dirt<00:03:49.210> you<00:03:49.960> gotta

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
this guy this guy has two dirt you gotta

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.080 
this guy this guy has two dirt you gotta
wait<00:03:50.320> at<00:03:50.620> least<00:03:50.680> 20<00:03:51.340> seconds<00:03:52.800> between<00:03:54.090> sending

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
wait at least 20 seconds between sending

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.570 
wait at least 20 seconds between sending
one<00:03:55.720> freight<00:03:56.140> carton<00:03:56.590> sending<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.130> next<00:03:57.400> one

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
one freight carton sending the next one

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.750 
one freight carton sending the next one
otherwise<00:03:58.450> it'll<00:03:58.810> Jam<00:03:59.350> the<00:03:59.620> system<00:04:00.010> but<00:04:00.670> now

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
otherwise it'll Jam the system but now

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.650 
otherwise it'll Jam the system but now
we<00:04:00.820> can<00:04:01.030> send<00:04:01.270> this<00:04:01.360> guy<00:04:01.600> off<00:04:03.330> let's<00:04:04.330> take<00:04:04.600> a

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
we can send this guy off let's take a

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.310 
we can send this guy off let's take a
look<00:04:04.960> at<00:04:05.110> what's<00:04:05.320> going<00:04:05.440> on<00:04:05.860> up<00:04:06.460> above<00:04:07.200> see<00:04:08.200> if

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
look at what's going on up above see if

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.910 
look at what's going on up above see if
we<00:04:08.470> can<00:04:08.650> get<00:04:09.280> there<00:04:09.520> in<00:04:09.700> time<00:04:10.500> okay<00:04:11.500> so<00:04:11.590> there's

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
we can get there in time okay so there's

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.080 
we can get there in time okay so there's
that<00:04:12.100> free<00:04:12.400> cart<00:04:12.700> and<00:04:12.880> there<00:04:14.700> this<00:04:15.700> is<00:04:15.880> why

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
that free cart and there this is why

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.470 
that free cart and there this is why
it's<00:04:16.269> called<00:04:16.510> the<00:04:16.690> burst<00:04:16.930> fire<00:04:17.230> system<00:04:17.830> is

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
it's called the burst fire system is

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:24.630 
it's called the burst fire system is
because<00:04:20.430> when<00:04:21.430> a<00:04:21.760> freight<00:04:22.360> cart<00:04:23.280> gets<00:04:24.280> sent

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
because when a freight cart gets sent

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.900 
because when a freight cart gets sent
off<00:04:24.820> and<00:04:25.920> activates<00:04:26.920> this<00:04:27.190> pressure<00:04:27.550> plate

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
off and activates this pressure plate

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:34.050 
off and activates this pressure plate
here<00:04:31.200> and<00:04:32.200> it<00:04:32.320> lands<00:04:32.710> here<00:04:33.040> that<00:04:33.700> pressure

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
here and it lands here that pressure

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.910 
here and it lands here that pressure
plate<00:04:34.890> does<00:04:35.890> the<00:04:36.160> same<00:04:36.610> thing<00:04:37.180> as<00:04:37.510> this<00:04:38.170> stone

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
plate does the same thing as this stone

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.210 
plate does the same thing as this stone
pressure<00:04:39.400> plate<00:04:39.790> right<00:04:40.180> here<00:04:40.680> it<00:04:41.680> activates

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
pressure plate right here it activates

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.700 
pressure plate right here it activates
that<00:04:42.520> door<00:04:42.760> booster<00:04:43.240> which<00:04:43.480> sends<00:04:44.140> an

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
that door booster which sends an

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.710 
that door booster which sends an
unoccupied<00:04:45.340> cart<00:04:46.090> down<00:04:46.900> the<00:04:47.080> track<00:04:47.380> and<00:04:47.740> that

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
unoccupied cart down the track and that

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.470 
unoccupied cart down the track and that
unoccupied<00:04:49.720> cart<00:04:50.470> you<00:04:51.460> know<00:04:51.580> in<00:04:51.850> a<00:04:51.970> sort<00:04:52.360> of

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
unoccupied cart you know in a sort of

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.840 
unoccupied cart you know in a sort of
burst<00:04:53.110> fire<00:04:53.700> configuration<00:04:54.700> with<00:04:55.540> the

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
burst fire configuration with the

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.470 
burst fire configuration with the
freight<00:04:57.850> cart<00:04:59.490> the<00:05:00.490> unoccupied<00:05:00.790> cart

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
freight cart the unoccupied cart

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.380 
freight cart the unoccupied cart
activates<00:05:02.410> this<00:05:03.040> pressure<00:05:03.430> plate<00:05:03.760> which

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
activates this pressure plate which

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.380 
activates this pressure plate which
changes<00:05:04.990> this<00:05:05.350> track<00:05:05.830> and<00:05:07.260> that<00:05:08.260> way<00:05:08.470> the

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
changes this track and that way the

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.860 
changes this track and that way the
freight<00:05:10.390> cart<00:05:10.800> can<00:05:11.800> go<00:05:12.040> this<00:05:12.250> way<00:05:12.630> to<00:05:13.630> the

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
freight cart can go this way to the

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.250 
freight cart can go this way to the
freight<00:05:14.380> area<00:05:14.770> and<00:05:15.160> the<00:05:15.430> unoccupied

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
freight area and the unoccupied

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.250 
freight area and the unoccupied
passenger<00:05:17.260> car<00:05:17.970> goes<00:05:18.970> this<00:05:19.240> way<00:05:19.510> and<00:05:19.780> gets

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
passenger car goes this way and gets

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:32.119 
passenger car goes this way and gets
reloaded<00:05:21.210> into<00:05:22.210> this<00:05:22.870> hopper<00:05:23.470> here<00:05:27.630> yeah

00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:32.129 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:36.539 

so<00:05:33.929> the<00:05:34.929> dimensions<00:05:35.589> of<00:05:35.799> this<00:05:35.979> thing<00:05:36.309> this

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:36.549 
so the dimensions of this thing this

00:05:36.549 --> 00:05:38.159 
so the dimensions of this thing this
thing<00:05:36.610> is<00:05:36.909> not<00:05:37.119> small<00:05:37.509> it<00:05:37.569> has<00:05:37.869> not<00:05:38.110> been

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
thing is not small it has not been

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:44.149 
thing is not small it has not been

a cart along to the next station which

a cart along to the next station which

is probably running low on mine carts by
them<00:07:11.159> so<00:07:12.159> that<00:07:12.489> is<00:07:13.089> omegas<00:07:14.019> burst<00:07:14.799> fire

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:15.159 
them so that is omegas burst fire
