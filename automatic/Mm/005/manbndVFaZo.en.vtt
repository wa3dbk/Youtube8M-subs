00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
time we're going to do a pushing and

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.470 
time we're going to do a pushing and
pulling<00:00:40.770> exercise<00:00:41.460> last<00:00:41.879> time<00:00:42.180> we<00:00:42.300> did<00:00:42.450> a

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
pulling exercise last time we did a

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.060 
pulling exercise last time we did a
push-pull<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.500> time<00:00:43.680> we're<00:00:43.800> going<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.980> do<00:00:44.040> a

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
push pull this way so we're going to

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.110 
push pull this way so we're going to
bring<00:00:46.110> some<00:00:46.289> balance<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.649> our<00:00:46.800> body<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.370> again

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
bring some balance to our body and again

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.360 
bring some balance to our body and again
we're<00:00:48.270> going<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.450> focus<00:00:48.600> on<00:00:48.840> speed<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:50.100> get<00:00:50.219> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
we're going to focus on speed to get the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.040 
we're going to focus on speed to get the
conditioning<00:00:50.910> effect<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.300> promote<00:00:51.600> fat<00:00:51.809> loss

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
conditioning effect to promote fat loss

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.720 
conditioning effect to promote fat loss
remember<00:00:52.440> fat<00:00:52.620> losses<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.100> just<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.370> function

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
remember fat losses and just a function

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.010 
remember fat losses and just a function
of<00:00:53.820> strength<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.300> how<00:00:54.420> much<00:00:54.539> weight<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.930> can

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
of strength and how much weight you can

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.000 
of strength and how much weight you can
lift<00:00:55.079> it's<00:00:55.350> also<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.590> function<00:00:55.770> of

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
lift it's also a function of

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.099 
lift it's also a function of
conditioning<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.820> speed<00:00:57.390> those<00:00:57.809> are<00:00:57.960> other

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
conditioning and speed those are other

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.450 
conditioning and speed those are other
elements<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.649> can't<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.070> don't<00:00:59.190> want<00:00:59.370> to

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
elements you can't you don't want to

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.849 
elements you can't you don't want to
miss<00:00:59.840> and<00:01:00.840> we're<00:01:00.989> going<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.170> focus<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.620> higher

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
miss and we're going to focus on higher

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.490 
miss and we're going to focus on higher
reps<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.699> really<00:01:02.969> promote<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.809> oxygen<00:01:04.320> debt

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
reps to really promote that oxygen debt

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.080 
reps to really promote that oxygen debt
so<00:01:04.710> your<00:01:04.830> training<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.339> fatigued<00:01:05.700> state

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
so your training in a fatigued state

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.670 
so your training in a fatigued state
that's<00:01:06.510> going<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.780> help<00:01:06.869> promote<00:01:07.170> promote

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
that's going to help promote promote

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.469 
that's going to help promote promote
lactic<00:01:08.130> acid<00:01:08.520> lactic<00:01:08.760> acid<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.270> going<00:01:09.420> to

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
lactic acid lactic acid is going to

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.179 
lactic acid lactic acid is going to
promote<00:01:09.720> growth<00:01:09.960> hormone<00:01:10.409> which<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.070> most

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
promote growth hormone which is the most

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.590 
promote growth hormone which is the most
powerful<00:01:11.580> fat-burning<00:01:12.119> hormone<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.570> your

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
powerful fat-burning hormone in your

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.920 
powerful fat-burning hormone in your
body<00:01:12.710> all<00:01:13.710> right<00:01:13.860> let's<00:01:14.100> rock<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.310> roll<00:01:14.930> last

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
body all right let's rock and roll last

body all right let's rock and roll last
time<00:01:16.110> we<00:01:16.259> worked<00:01:16.409> our<00:01:16.560> quads<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.159> front<00:01:17.369> of

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
time we worked our quads the front of

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.590 
time we worked our quads the front of
her<00:01:17.520> body<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:17.880> we're<00:01:17.970> going<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.150> work<00:01:18.299> more<00:01:18.479> of

yeah better flexibility than I do go
down<00:01:54.100> lower<00:01:54.310> should<00:01:54.939> be<00:01:55.030> able<00:01:55.180> to<00:01:55.270> go<00:01:55.360> as<00:01:55.420> low

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
down lower should be able to go as low

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.300 
down lower should be able to go as low
as<00:01:55.689> you<00:01:55.869> can<00:01:56.080> my<00:01:56.259> while<00:01:56.560> maintaining<00:01:56.890> a<00:01:57.100> flat

prepared to work make the program work

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.240 
prepared to work make the program work
remember<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.140> program<00:04:47.500> isn't<00:04:47.860> going<00:04:48.100> to<00:04:48.160> work

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
remember the program isn't going to work

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.310 
remember the program isn't going to work
for<00:04:48.310> you<00:04:48.790> you<00:04:49.000> have<00:04:49.720> to<00:04:49.750> make<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:50.110> program

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
for you you have to make the program

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.720 
for you you have to make the program
work<00:04:50.650> if<00:04:50.800> you're<00:04:50.950> truly<00:04:51.130> committed<00:04:51.490> to<00:04:51.610> your
