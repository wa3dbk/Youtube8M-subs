00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
gameplay trailer the GTA 5 had quite a

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.200 
gameplay trailer the GTA 5 had quite a
bit<00:02:33.240> of<00:02:33.390> them<00:02:34.670> destructible<00:02:35.670> environments

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
bit of them destructible environments

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.790 
bit of them destructible environments
from<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.420> walls<00:02:36.600> breaking<00:02:36.960> down<00:02:37.200> stuff<00:02:37.620> like

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
from the walls breaking down stuff like

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.620 
from the walls breaking down stuff like
that<00:02:37.830> so<00:02:38.100> that<00:02:38.220> would<00:02:38.310> be<00:02:38.340> pretty<00:02:38.490> cool<00:02:38.630> combat

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
that so that would be pretty cool combat

that so that would be pretty cool combat
AI<00:02:39.810> are<00:02:40.230> much<00:02:40.410> more<00:02:40.620> advanced<00:02:40.920> with<00:02:41.160> more

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
AI are much more advanced with more

knowledge<00:02:41.580> of<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:41.970> environment<00:02:42.510> so<00:02:42.960> they

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
knowledge of the environment so they

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.690 
knowledge of the environment so they
know<00:02:43.290> what's<00:02:43.620> around<00:02:43.920> them<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.250> where<00:02:44.610> they

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
know what's around them and where they

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.000 
know what's around them and where they
can<00:02:44.820> take<00:02:45.000> cover<00:02:45.210> etc<00:02:45.620> enemies<00:02:46.620> will<00:02:46.800> behave
