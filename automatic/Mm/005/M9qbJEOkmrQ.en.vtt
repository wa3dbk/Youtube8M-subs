00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
where you can get to your horse's mind

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.520 
where you can get to your horse's mind
that's<00:01:23.939> gonna<00:01:24.150> be<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.509> pathway<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.990> his<00:01:25.259> heart

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530

if<00:01:25.830> we<00:01:26.250> don't<00:01:26.460> force<00:01:26.850> they<00:01:27.570> won't<00:01:27.869> resist<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
if we don't force they won't resist the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.890 
if we don't force they won't resist the

biggest concept I want you to focus on

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.350 
biggest concept I want you to focus on
is<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.290> continual<00:01:32.220> conversation<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:33.240> I'm

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
is a continual conversation that I'm

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
responsiveness and their choice to stay

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.819 
responsiveness and their choice to stay
with<00:01:38.759> me<00:01:39.210> instead<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.720> anywhere<00:01:40.110> else<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:40.590> this

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
with me instead of anywhere else in this

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.800 
with me instead of anywhere else in this
environment<00:01:41.490> it's<00:01:41.970> not<00:01:42.240> all<00:01:42.479> about<00:01:42.659> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
environment it's not all about the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.690 
environment it's not all about the
techniques<00:01:43.439> if<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.070> can<00:01:44.280> have<00:01:44.460> that

techniques if you can have that

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.030 
techniques if you can have that
