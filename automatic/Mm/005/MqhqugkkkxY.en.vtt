00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
me a while to figure it out but you

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.820

could<00:00:15.059> actually<00:00:15.240> join<00:00:15.830> regular-size

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
could actually join regular-size

points if you look at the mini-map

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.340 
points if you look at the mini-map
you'll<00:00:23.519> notice<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.150> it's<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:25.019> three

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
you'll notice that it's the three

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.900 
you'll notice that it's the three

there's no attack helicopters you get

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.510 
there's no attack helicopters you get
the<00:00:30.090> Scout<00:00:30.420> heli<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.960> that's<00:00:31.920> pretty<00:00:32.160> much<00:00:32.309> it

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
the Scout heli and that's pretty much it

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.610 
the Scout heli and that's pretty much it
for<00:00:32.550> air<00:00:32.910> vehicles<00:00:33.480> it's<00:00:33.870> unfortunate<00:00:34.590> that

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
for air vehicles it's unfortunate that

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.500 
for air vehicles it's unfortunate that
there<00:00:34.920> weren't<00:00:35.130> more<00:00:35.520> thirty-two<00:00:36.239> player

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
there weren't more thirty-two player

I<00:00:39.360> think<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.809> Scout<00:00:40.379> helicopter<00:00:40.980> version<00:00:41.370> of

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
I think the Scout helicopter version of

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.010 
I think the Scout helicopter version of
this<00:00:41.640> map<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.120> actually<00:00:42.510> really<00:00:42.750> well

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
this map is actually really well

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.380 
this map is actually really well
balanced<00:00:43.440> than<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.649> lot<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:44.040> fun<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.399> play<00:00:44.579> now

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
balanced than a lot of fun to play now

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.479 
balanced than a lot of fun to play now
picking<00:00:45.930> off<00:00:46.140> infantry<00:00:46.649> from<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.980> top<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.399> the

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
picking off infantry from the top of the

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.220 
picking off infantry from the top of the
skyscraper<00:00:47.730> was<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.390> lot<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.690> fun<00:00:48.930> with<00:00:49.110> the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
skyscraper was a lot of fun with the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.260 
skyscraper was a lot of fun with the
little<00:00:49.350> bird<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.129> it's<00:00:50.730> something<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.239> I

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
little bird and it's something that I

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.119 
little bird and it's something that I
still<00:00:51.510> have<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.809> get<00:00:51.930> used<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.260> aiming<00:00:52.710> with<00:00:52.920> it

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
still have to get used to aiming with it

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.180 
still have to get used to aiming with it
almost<00:00:53.460> feels<00:00:53.760> like<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.770> bullets<00:00:55.770> since<00:00:56.039> they

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
almost feels like the bullets since they

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.590 
almost feels like the bullets since they
cross<00:00:56.460> over<00:00:56.730> from<00:00:56.910> either<00:00:57.149> side<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.449> the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
cross over from either side of the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.660 
cross over from either side of the
chopper<00:00:57.989> meet<00:00:58.289> up<00:00:58.469> at<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.739> certain<00:00:59.100> point<00:00:59.370> and

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
chopper meet up at a certain point and

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.610 
chopper meet up at a certain point and
if<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.420> can<00:01:00.600> line<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.079> up<00:01:01.109> right<00:01:01.410> then

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
if you can line that up right then

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.460 
if you can line that up right then
you'll<00:01:01.770> kill<00:01:02.039> infantry<00:01:02.640> better<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:04.110> seems

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
you'll kill infantry better so it seems

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.380 
you'll kill infantry better so it seems
like<00:01:04.589> certain<00:01:05.040> engagement<00:01:05.640> distances<00:01:06.180> are

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
like certain engagement distances are

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.870 
like certain engagement distances are
preferable<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.680> kill<00:01:07.950> infantry<00:01:08.460> as<00:01:08.549> opposed

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
preferable to kill infantry as opposed

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.149 
preferable to kill infantry as opposed
to<00:01:09.030> just<00:01:09.450> really<00:01:09.990> up<00:01:10.200> close<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.740> personal

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
to just really up close and personal

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.730 
to just really up close and personal
that<00:01:11.310> might<00:01:11.700> not<00:01:12.270> be<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.570> best<00:01:13.200> way<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.439> kill

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
that might not be the best way to kill

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.100 
that might not be the best way to kill
them<00:01:13.920> honestly<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.729> have<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.000> test<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.750> out<00:01:15.900> more

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
them honestly I have to test it out more

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.499 
them honestly I have to test it out more
and<00:01:16.229> fly<00:01:16.470> around<00:01:16.619> more<00:01:17.040> get<00:01:17.610> used<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
and fly around more get used to it the

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.929 
and fly around more get used to it the
little<00:01:19.020> bird<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.320> significantly<00:01:20.189> more<00:01:20.280> agile

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
little bird is significantly more agile

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.240 
little bird is significantly more agile
than<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.240> was<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.659> battlefield<00:01:22.530> 3<00:01:22.619> which<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.070> a

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
than it was in battlefield 3 which is a

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.340 
than it was in battlefield 3 which is a
really<00:01:23.520> nice<00:01:23.939> addition<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.869> game<00:01:25.020> because

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
really nice addition to the game because

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.469 
really nice addition to the game because
it<00:01:25.470> did<00:01:25.650> feel<00:01:25.860> kind<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.520> sluggish<00:01:27.060> in

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
it did feel kind of sluggish in

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.090 
it did feel kind of sluggish in
battlefield<00:01:28.110> 3<00:01:28.200> where<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.680> attack

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
battlefield 3 where the attack

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.280 
battlefield 3 where the attack
helicopter<00:01:29.700> was<00:01:29.909> pretty<00:01:30.210> darn<00:01:30.450> agile<00:01:30.990> and

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
helicopter was pretty darn agile and

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.640 
helicopter was pretty darn agile and
fast<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.220> now<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:33.299> battlefield<00:01:33.869> 4<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.380> little

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
fast so now in battlefield 4 the little

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.219 
fast so now in battlefield 4 the little
bird<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:35.040> actually<00:01:35.220> very<00:01:35.670> agile<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.329> quick<00:01:36.990> to

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
bird is actually very agile and quick to

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.140 
bird is actually very agile and quick to
change<00:01:37.590> around<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.040> attack<00:01:38.430> helicopter<00:01:39.030> is

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
change around the attack helicopter is

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.960 
change around the attack helicopter is
still<00:01:39.360> fast<00:01:39.720> in<00:01:40.560> terms<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:41.009> overall<00:01:41.310> speed<00:01:41.759> but

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
still fast in terms of overall speed but

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.520 
still fast in terms of overall speed but
its<00:01:42.090> maneuverability<00:01:42.720> has<00:01:43.049> gone<00:01:43.259> down<00:01:43.500> a

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
its maneuverability has gone down a

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.440 
its maneuverability has gone down a
little<00:01:43.770> bit<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.250> now<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.970> actually<00:01:45.119> have<00:01:45.329> a

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
little bit so now you actually have a

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.719 
little bit so now you actually have a
bigger<00:01:45.689> divergence<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.979> helicopters

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
bigger divergence in the helicopters

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.910 
bigger divergence in the helicopters
abilities<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.750> Scout<00:01:49.140> helicopter<00:01:49.290> has

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
abilities and the Scout helicopter has

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.340 
abilities and the Scout helicopter has
some<00:01:50.189> nice<00:01:50.460> little<00:01:51.119> abilities<00:01:51.840> over<00:01:52.049> the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
some nice little abilities over the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.249 
some nice little abilities over the
attack<00:01:52.619> helicopter<00:01:52.799> actually<00:01:53.540> I'm<00:01:54.540> looking

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
attack helicopter actually I'm looking

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.840 
attack helicopter actually I'm looking
forward<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.590> seeing<00:01:55.860> what<00:01:56.219> happens<00:01:56.250> when

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
forward to seeing what happens when

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.520 
forward to seeing what happens when
Scout<00:01:57.119> helicopters<00:01:57.689> go<00:01:57.810> up<00:01:57.930> against<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.320> TAC

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
Scout helicopters go up against the TAC

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.530 
Scout helicopters go up against the TAC
helicopters<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.280> air-to-air<00:01:59.549> combat<00:01:59.759> because

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
helicopters in air-to-air combat because

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.330 
helicopters in air-to-air combat because
I<00:02:00.659> think<00:02:00.719> once<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.320> scout<00:02:01.590> helicopter<00:02:02.130> gets

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
I think once the scout helicopter gets

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.160 
I think once the scout helicopter gets
in<00:02:02.490> close<00:02:02.790> we're<00:02:03.420> gonna<00:02:03.509> find<00:02:03.869> that<00:02:03.990> it's

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
in close we're gonna find that it's

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.050 
in close we're gonna find that it's
potentially<00:02:04.320> even<00:02:04.860> more<00:02:05.250> effective<00:02:05.759> than<00:02:05.939> an

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
potentially even more effective than an

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.570 
potentially even more effective than an
attack<00:02:06.420> helicopter<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.950> think<00:02:08.429> that's

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
attack helicopter so I think that's

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.430 
attack helicopter so I think that's
going<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.729> be<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.910> really<00:02:09.209> fun<00:02:09.360> little<00:02:09.840> dynamic

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
going to be a really fun little dynamic

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.040 
going to be a really fun little dynamic
another<00:02:11.099> really<00:02:11.489> interesting<00:02:11.670> aspect<00:02:12.450> of

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
another really interesting aspect of

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.780 
another really interesting aspect of
little<00:02:13.200> bird<00:02:13.350> combat<00:02:13.860> is<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.100> passenger

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
little bird combat is the passenger

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.700 
little bird combat is the passenger
seats<00:02:15.060> passengers<00:02:15.750> can<00:02:15.960> now<00:02:16.080> aim<00:02:16.350> straight

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
seats passengers can now aim straight

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.830 
seats passengers can now aim straight
forward<00:02:17.190> on<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.550> little<00:02:17.790> bird<00:02:17.970> which<00:02:18.480> leaves

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
forward on the little bird which leaves

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.380 
forward on the little bird which leaves
you<00:02:18.990> some<00:02:19.200> very<00:02:19.560> interesting<00:02:20.010> combat<00:02:20.850> options

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
you some very interesting combat options

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.760 
you some very interesting combat options
you're<00:02:21.570> going<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:21.750> see<00:02:21.930> here<00:02:22.260> I'm<00:02:22.590> going<00:02:22.680> to

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
you're going to see here I'm going to

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.280 
you're going to see here I'm going to
pop<00:02:22.980> out<00:02:23.160> an<00:02:23.310> RPG<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:24.060> has<00:02:24.210> lock<00:02:24.540> on<00:02:24.750> the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
pop out an RPG that has lock on the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.200 
pop out an RPG that has lock on the
passenger<00:02:26.040> on<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.340> other<00:02:26.520> side<00:02:26.820> has<00:02:27.000> got<00:02:27.150> a

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
passenger on the other side has got a

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.750 
passenger on the other side has got a
laser<00:02:27.510> tool<00:02:27.810> he<00:02:28.050> laces<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.650> helicopter<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.640> I

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
laser tool he laces the helicopter and I

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.570 
laser tool he laces the helicopter and I
am<00:02:29.850> able<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.240> fire<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.990> lock-on<00:02:31.560> rocket<00:02:32.220> from

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
am able to fire a lock-on rocket from

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.040 
am able to fire a lock-on rocket from
the<00:02:32.700> side<00:02:32.910> of<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.060> little<00:02:33.360> bird<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.750> get<00:02:33.930> the

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
the side of the little bird and get the

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.170 
the side of the little bird and get the
kill<00:02:34.320> so<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.010> pilot<00:02:35.340> doesn't<00:02:35.640> even<00:02:35.730> take<00:02:35.970> out

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
kill so the pilot doesn't even take out

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.150 
kill so the pilot doesn't even take out
the<00:02:36.330> other<00:02:36.480> helicopter<00:02:36.720> in<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:37.740> scenario

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
the other helicopter in that scenario

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.220 
the other helicopter in that scenario
and<00:02:38.640> although<00:02:39.450> they<00:02:39.600> are<00:02:39.750> getting<00:02:40.050> rid<00:02:40.200> of

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
and although they are getting rid of

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.860 
and although they are getting rid of
lock-on<00:02:40.710> RPGs<00:02:41.280> in<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.940> final<00:02:42.330> release<00:02:42.480> we're

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
lock-on RPGs in the final release we're

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.590 
lock-on RPGs in the final release we're
still<00:02:43.050> going<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.230> have<00:02:43.290> javelins<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.160> other

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
still going to have javelins and other

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.880 
still going to have javelins and other
explosive<00:02:45.600> devices<00:02:45.630> that<00:02:46.230> will<00:02:46.380> do<00:02:46.740> the<00:02:46.860> same

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
explosive devices that will do the same

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.070 
explosive devices that will do the same
thing<00:02:47.130> so<00:02:47.760> there's<00:02:48.270> going<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:48.450> be<00:02:48.540> some<00:02:48.780> very

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
thing so there's going to be some very

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.930 
thing so there's going to be some very
interesting<00:02:49.580> combinations<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:50.760> the

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
interesting combinations and the

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.610 
interesting combinations and the
passengers<00:02:51.510> are<00:02:51.690> now<00:02:51.810> going<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:51.990> play<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.230> much

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
passengers are now going to play a much

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.460 
passengers are now going to play a much
bigger<00:02:52.650> role<00:02:53.070> in<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:54.090> actual<00:02:54.570> fate<00:02:54.990> of<00:02:55.230> the

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
bigger role in the actual fate of the

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.890 
bigger role in the actual fate of the
little<00:02:55.770> bird<00:02:56.040> helicopter<00:02:56.700> I<00:02:56.880> remember<00:02:57.630> losing

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
little bird helicopter I remember losing

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.990 
little bird helicopter I remember losing
a<00:02:58.230> duel<00:02:58.440> in<00:02:58.740> this<00:02:58.920> thing<00:02:59.130> to<00:02:59.280> another<00:02:59.520> little

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
a duel in this thing to another little

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.520 
a duel in this thing to another little
bird<00:03:00.120> helicopter<00:03:00.810> where<00:03:00.960> the<00:03:01.050> pilot<00:03:01.380> wasn't

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
bird helicopter where the pilot wasn't

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.890 
bird helicopter where the pilot wasn't
particularly<00:03:02.010> great<00:03:02.640> but<00:03:03.270> he<00:03:03.510> had<00:03:03.660> two

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
particularly great but he had two

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.780 
particularly great but he had two
passengers<00:03:04.560> that<00:03:04.740> were<00:03:04.800> non<00:03:05.190> stop<00:03:05.520> firing

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
passengers that were non stop firing

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.120 
passengers that were non stop firing
Stinger<00:03:06.360> missiles<00:03:06.690> at<00:03:06.840> me<00:03:06.960> and<00:03:07.170> I<00:03:07.680> simply

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
Stinger missiles at me and I simply

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.250 
Stinger missiles at me and I simply
could<00:03:08.490> not<00:03:08.670> pop<00:03:09.000> flares<00:03:09.330> or<00:03:09.630> repair<00:03:09.990> fast

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
could not pop flares or repair fast

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.710 
could not pop flares or repair fast
enough<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.830> deal<00:03:11.070> with<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:12.000> amount<00:03:12.210> of<00:03:12.360> damage

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
enough to deal with the amount of damage

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.230 
enough to deal with the amount of damage
incoming<00:03:13.380> so<00:03:13.650> a<00:03:13.890> little<00:03:14.400> bird<00:03:14.580> with<00:03:14.790> multiple

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
incoming so a little bird with multiple

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.090 
incoming so a little bird with multiple
guys<00:03:15.420> with<00:03:15.660> Stinger<00:03:15.990> missiles<00:03:16.410> with<00:03:16.620> lock-ons

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
guys with Stinger missiles with lock-ons

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.000 
guys with Stinger missiles with lock-ons
with<00:03:17.340> javelins<00:03:17.959> with<00:03:18.959> guys<00:03:19.290> repairing<00:03:19.890> your

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
with javelins with guys repairing your

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.620 
with javelins with guys repairing your
helicopter<00:03:20.610> at<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.850> same<00:03:21.060> time<00:03:21.330> there's

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
helicopter at the same time there's

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.290 
helicopter at the same time there's
going<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.780> be<00:03:21.870> some<00:03:22.140> very<00:03:22.440> interesting

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
going to be some very interesting

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.699 
going to be some very interesting
combinations<00:03:24.300> and<00:03:24.510> I<00:03:25.080> think<00:03:25.290> it's<00:03:25.440> just<00:03:25.590> going

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
combinations and I think it's just going

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.380 
combinations and I think it's just going
to<00:03:25.770> make<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.130> combat<00:03:26.520> aspect<00:03:26.940> of<00:03:27.090> this<00:03:27.239> so

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
to make the combat aspect of this so

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.790 
to make the combat aspect of this so
much<00:03:27.450> more<00:03:27.570> interesting<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:28.260> I<00:03:28.380> love

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
much more interesting and I love

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.290 
much more interesting and I love
shooting<00:03:29.100> those<00:03:29.430> guys<00:03:29.640> out<00:03:29.850> of<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.060> air<00:03:30.150> that

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
shooting those guys out of the air that

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.540 
shooting those guys out of the air that
are<00:03:30.450> parachuting<00:03:30.870> down<00:03:31.050> probably<00:03:31.950> one<00:03:32.370> of<00:03:32.400> the

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
are parachuting down probably one of the

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.430 
are parachuting down probably one of the
more<00:03:32.700> things<00:03:32.970> fun<00:03:33.360> things<00:03:33.690> to<00:03:33.900> do<00:03:34.020> in<00:03:34.050> this

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
more things fun things to do in this

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.020 
more things fun things to do in this
helicopter<00:03:35.070> now<00:03:35.489> you're<00:03:35.670> going<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:35.850> notice

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
here I'm going to assault a rooftop that

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.580 
here I'm going to assault a rooftop that
is<00:03:38.430> just<00:03:38.640> crawling<00:03:39.060> with<00:03:39.390> bad<00:03:39.840> guys<00:03:40.110> now<00:03:40.440> in

battlefield<00:03:41.040> 3<00:03:41.130> I<00:03:41.310> feel<00:03:41.580> like<00:03:41.760> one<00:03:42.000> pass<00:03:42.239> here

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
battlefield 3 I feel like one pass here

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.570 
battlefield 3 I feel like one pass here
I<00:03:42.810> might<00:03:43.170> have<00:03:43.290> been<00:03:43.410> able<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.739> take<00:03:43.950> out<00:03:44.100> three

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
I might have been able to take out three

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.790 
I might have been able to take out three
guys<00:03:44.850> just<00:03:45.630> because<00:03:45.870> of<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.080> sheer<00:03:46.110> damage<00:03:46.680> to

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
guys just because of the sheer damage to

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.070 
guys just because of the sheer damage to
the<00:03:46.890> minigun<00:03:47.250> versus<00:03:47.670> infantry<00:03:48.239> seems<00:03:48.870> like

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
the minigun versus infantry seems like

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.990 
the minigun versus infantry seems like
you<00:03:49.260> have<00:03:49.380> to<00:03:49.530> focus<00:03:49.739> fire<00:03:50.070> a<00:03:50.100> little<00:03:50.550> bit<00:03:50.640> more

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
you have to focus fire a little bit more

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.150 
you have to focus fire a little bit more
in<00:03:51.120> battlefield<00:03:51.600> 4<00:03:51.690> spend<00:03:52.530> some<00:03:52.709> time<00:03:52.950> taking

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
in battlefield 4 spend some time taking

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.699 
in battlefield 4 spend some time taking
them<00:03:53.459> out<00:03:53.610> I'm<00:03:53.820> trying<00:03:54.239> to<00:03:54.420> be<00:03:54.709> maneuverable

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
them out I'm trying to be maneuverable

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.890 
them out I'm trying to be maneuverable
and<00:03:55.950> accurate<00:03:56.459> at<00:03:56.580> the<00:03:56.700> same<00:03:56.940> time<00:03:57.239> flying

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
and accurate at the same time flying

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.350 
and accurate at the same time flying
directly<00:03:58.560> at<00:03:58.770> your<00:03:58.980> target<00:03:59.370> isn't<00:03:59.520> always<00:04:00.000> the

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
directly at your target isn't always the

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.540 
directly at your target isn't always the
best<00:04:00.390> idea<00:04:01.080> just<00:04:01.380> because<00:04:01.500> it<00:04:01.830> makes<00:04:02.100> you<00:04:02.310> an

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
best idea just because it makes you an

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.460 
best idea just because it makes you an
easy<00:04:02.730> shot<00:04:03.209> for<00:04:03.480> shooting<00:04:04.200> out<00:04:04.320> of<00:04:04.410> the

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
easy shot for shooting out of the

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.680 
easy shot for shooting out of the
cockpit<00:04:04.709> and<00:04:05.220> I<00:04:05.550> know<00:04:05.940> I<00:04:06.090> hit<00:04:06.270> that<00:04:06.450> building

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
cockpit and I know I hit that building

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.479 
cockpit and I know I hit that building
there<00:04:07.020> but<00:04:07.170> I<00:04:07.200> actually<00:04:07.350> did<00:04:07.800> survive<00:04:08.220> it<00:04:08.459> and

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
there but I actually did survive it and

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.100 
there but I actually did survive it and
this<00:04:08.670> is<00:04:08.790> me<00:04:08.940> coming<00:04:09.180> back<00:04:09.510> from<00:04:09.870> the

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
off the last guys on the rooftop like

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.849 
off the last guys on the rooftop like

a lot of unlocks in fact I think I got

a lot of unlocks in fact I think I got
really<00:04:21.150> close<00:04:21.330> to<00:04:21.510> unlocking<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:22.080> Stinger

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
really close to unlocking the Stinger

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.640 
really close to unlocking the Stinger
missiles<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:23.610> then<00:04:23.850> just<00:04:24.120> never<00:04:24.390> got<00:04:24.870> them<00:04:25.140> in

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
missiles and then just never got them in

missiles and then just never got them in

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
we know you can get lock-on

air-to-ground missiles lock-on
air-to-air<00:04:29.639> missiles<00:04:30.210> and<00:04:30.480> there's<00:04:30.630> going<00:04:30.780> to

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
air-to-air missiles and there's going to

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.780 
air-to-air missiles and there's going to
be<00:04:30.900> a<00:04:30.990> bunch<00:04:31.199> of<00:04:31.320> other<00:04:31.470> little<00:04:32.130> fun<00:04:32.400> weapons

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
be a bunch of other little fun weapons

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.490 
be a bunch of other little fun weapons
to<00:04:32.910> play<00:04:33.060> around<00:04:33.300> with<00:04:33.540> different<00:04:33.780> primary

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
to play around with different primary

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.040 
to play around with different primary
cannons<00:04:35.160> so<00:04:35.340> instead<00:04:35.580> of<00:04:35.639> having<00:04:35.820> dual<00:04:36.600> mini

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
cannons so instead of having dual mini

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.080 
cannons so instead of having dual mini
guns<00:04:37.320> you'll<00:04:37.590> get<00:04:37.949> a<00:04:38.220> 25<00:04:38.729> millimeter

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
guns you'll get a 25 millimeter

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.590 
guns you'll get a 25 millimeter
explosive<00:04:40.050> round<00:04:40.290> cannons<00:04:40.889> and<00:04:41.150> those<00:04:42.150> can

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
explosive round cannons and those can

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.689 
explosive round cannons and those can
have<00:04:42.960> different<00:04:43.410> kinds<00:04:43.650> of<00:04:43.680> effects<00:04:44.040> on<00:04:44.190> armor

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
have different kinds of effects on armor

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:46.159 
have different kinds of effects on armor
and<00:04:44.880> infantry<00:04:45.030> down<00:04:45.570> below

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
and infantry down below

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.680 
and infantry down below
currently<00:04:46.830> the<00:04:47.070> mini<00:04:47.280> guns<00:04:47.520> don't<00:04:48.180> do<00:04:48.419> any

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
currently the mini guns don't do any

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.900 
currently the mini guns don't do any
damage<00:04:49.050> to<00:04:49.350> heavy<00:04:49.560> armor<00:04:50.070> so<00:04:50.310> that's<00:04:50.550> a<00:04:50.669> little

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
damage to heavy armor so that's a little

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.730 
damage to heavy armor so that's a little
bit<00:04:51.090> of<00:04:51.210> a<00:04:51.300> difference<00:04:51.630> from<00:04:52.110> battlefield<00:04:52.650> 3

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
bit of a difference from battlefield 3

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.250 
bit of a difference from battlefield 3
and<00:04:53.520> bf3<00:04:53.820> you<00:04:54.120> could<00:04:54.270> kind<00:04:54.479> of<00:04:54.540> Peck<00:04:54.840> down<00:04:55.080> at

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
and bf3 you could kind of Peck down at

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.960 
and bf3 you could kind of Peck down at
the<00:04:55.380> armor<00:04:55.680> of<00:04:55.710> a<00:04:55.860> tank<00:04:56.130> and<00:04:56.310> help<00:04:56.520> out<00:04:56.729> with

I'm really curious about because it's
something<00:06:10.440> that<00:06:10.620> it's<00:06:11.250> just<00:06:11.340> such<00:06:11.610> an

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
something that it's just such an

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.969 
something that it's just such an
important<00:06:12.300> factor<00:06:12.750> we<00:06:13.110> look<00:06:13.320> at<00:06:13.410> helicopters

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:13.979 
important factor we look at helicopters

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:16.670 
important factor we look at helicopters
right<00:06:14.160> now<00:06:14.430> without<00:06:14.700> any<00:06:15.150> jets<00:06:16.110> in<00:06:16.320> the<00:06:16.470> game

right now without any jets in the game

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.010 
right now without any jets in the game
and<00:06:16.919> they<00:06:17.310> seem<00:06:17.610> like<00:06:17.639> a<00:06:17.789> lot<00:06:18.060> of<00:06:18.180> fun<00:06:18.419> and<00:06:18.690> seem

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 
and they seem like a lot of fun and seem

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.570 
and they seem like a lot of fun and seem
like<00:06:19.050> they're<00:06:19.470> just<00:06:19.500> kind<00:06:19.889> of<00:06:19.950> overpowered

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580

rooftops<00:06:37.979> and<00:06:38.250> it's<00:06:38.400> not<00:06:38.550> to<00:06:38.700> say

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
rooftops and it's not to say

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.550 
rooftops and it's not to say
wasn't<00:06:39.240> getting<00:06:39.480> shot<00:06:39.720> down<00:06:39.900> a<00:06:39.960> lot<00:06:40.230> in<00:06:40.410> the

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
wasn't getting shot down a lot in the

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.720 
wasn't getting shot down a lot in the
little<00:06:40.830> bird<00:06:40.980> there<00:06:41.190> were<00:06:41.370> a<00:06:41.400> lot<00:06:41.700> of

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:41.730 
little bird there were a lot of

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.260 
little bird there were a lot of
organized<00:06:42.660> squads<00:06:43.050> of<00:06:43.260> RPG<00:06:43.770> laser<00:06:44.070> guys<00:06:44.400> that

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.270 
organized squads of RPG laser guys that

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.330 
organized squads of RPG laser guys that
were<00:06:45.390> just<00:06:45.420> taking<00:06:45.930> me<00:06:46.050> down<00:06:46.320> and<00:06:46.770> I<00:06:47.010> just<00:06:47.040> got

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 
were just taking me down and I just got

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.270 
were just taking me down and I just got
used<00:06:47.580> to<00:06:47.700> flying<00:06:48.090> in<00:06:48.270> a<00:06:48.390> manner<00:06:48.600> that<00:06:49.100> once<00:06:50.100> I

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.280 
used to flying in a manner that once I

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.820 
used to flying in a manner that once I
knew<00:06:50.520> if<00:06:50.790> a<00:06:50.970> squad<00:06:51.270> had<00:06:51.600> a<00:06:51.630> laser<00:06:52.110> or<00:06:52.560> an<00:06:52.680> RPG

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:52.830 
knew if a squad had a laser or an RPG

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.880 
knew if a squad had a laser or an RPG
combo<00:06:53.820> then<00:06:54.420> I<00:06:54.750> knew<00:06:55.170> to<00:06:55.290> fly<00:06:55.500> a<00:06:55.530> little<00:06:55.740> bit

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:55.890 
combo then I knew to fly a little bit

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.770 
combo then I knew to fly a little bit
more<00:06:56.160> cautiously<00:06:56.700> and<00:06:56.820> kind<00:06:57.090> of<00:06:57.150> pop<00:06:57.570> up

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:57.780 
more cautiously and kind of pop up

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.960 
more cautiously and kind of pop up
around<00:06:57.930> building<00:06:58.560> corners<00:06:59.040> at<00:06:59.220> them<00:06:59.430> and<00:06:59.640> just

00:06:59.960 --> 00:06:59.970 
around building corners at them and just

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:01.880 
around building corners at them and just
not<00:07:00.390> give<00:07:00.540> them<00:07:00.720> a<00:07:00.810> lot<00:07:00.960> of<00:07:00.990> time<00:07:01.290> to<00:07:01.440> lock<00:07:01.650> onto

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:01.890 
not give them a lot of time to lock onto

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:05.150 
not give them a lot of time to lock onto
me<00:07:02.160> so<00:07:02.720> this<00:07:03.720> mechanic<00:07:04.260> is<00:07:04.410> going<00:07:04.650> to<00:07:04.770> change

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 
me so this mechanic is going to change

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.240 
me so this mechanic is going to change
from<00:07:05.610> the<00:07:05.790> beta<00:07:06.000> to<00:07:06.270> final<00:07:06.810> battlefield<00:07:07.110> 4<00:07:07.650> but

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.250 
from the beta to final battlefield 4 but

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.090 
from the beta to final battlefield 4 but
I've<00:07:08.730> developed<00:07:09.000> sort<00:07:09.540> of<00:07:09.600> a<00:07:09.840> very<00:07:10.440> stealthy

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.100 
I've developed sort of a very stealthy

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.430 
I've developed sort of a very stealthy
approach<00:07:11.190> now<00:07:11.730> a<00:07:11.760> very<00:07:12.090> cautious<00:07:13.080> approach<00:07:13.230> to

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 
approach now a very cautious approach to

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.530 
approach now a very cautious approach to
engaging<00:07:13.950> infantry<00:07:14.610> on<00:07:14.790> rooftops<00:07:15.300> from

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:15.540 
engaging infantry on rooftops from

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.210 
engaging infantry on rooftops from
helicopters<00:07:16.169> which<00:07:16.680> hopefully<00:07:16.890> will

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:17.220 
helicopters which hopefully will

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.580 
helicopters which hopefully will
translate<00:07:17.700> over<00:07:17.880> into<00:07:18.150> the<00:07:18.690> final<00:07:19.110> launch<00:07:19.320> and

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:19.590 
translate over into the final launch and

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.440 
translate over into the final launch and
make<00:07:19.770> me<00:07:19.919> a<00:07:19.950> better<00:07:20.220> pilot<00:07:20.490> so<00:07:21.030> that<00:07:21.060> pretty

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:21.450 
make me a better pilot so that pretty

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:23.659 
make me a better pilot so that pretty
much<00:07:21.570> wraps<00:07:21.840> it<00:07:22.080> up<00:07:22.140> for<00:07:22.200> this<00:07:22.470> preview<00:07:23.070> of<00:07:23.130> the

00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:23.669 
much wraps it up for this preview of the

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:25.400 
much wraps it up for this preview of the
Scout<00:07:23.940> helicopter<00:07:24.600> I<00:07:24.630> want<00:07:24.990> you<00:07:25.169> guys<00:07:25.380> to

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:25.410 
Scout helicopter I want you guys to

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.260 
Scout helicopter I want you guys to
think<00:07:25.590> about<00:07:26.040> the<00:07:26.160> combinations<00:07:26.910> that<00:07:27.090> you

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:27.270 
think about the combinations that you

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:28.909 
think about the combinations that you
can<00:07:27.480> make<00:07:27.630> with<00:07:27.810> the<00:07:27.900> infantry<00:07:28.440> in<00:07:28.740> the

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:28.919 
can make with the infantry in the

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:31.159 
can make with the infantry in the
passenger<00:07:29.400> seats<00:07:29.730> and<00:07:30.020> some<00:07:31.020> of<00:07:31.110> the

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:31.169 
passenger seats and some of the

00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:32.780 
passenger seats and some of the
helicopter<00:07:31.740> abilities<00:07:32.250> I<00:07:32.400> think<00:07:32.580> we're<00:07:32.700> going

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:32.790 
helicopter abilities I think we're going

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:34.550 
helicopter abilities I think we're going
to<00:07:32.850> find<00:07:33.090> some<00:07:33.270> really<00:07:33.690> cool<00:07:33.870> emergent

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560 
to find some really cool emergent

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.100 
to find some really cool emergent
gameplay<00:07:34.820> coming<00:07:35.820> from<00:07:36.060> those<00:07:36.270> combinations

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:37.110 
gameplay coming from those combinations

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.560 
gameplay coming from those combinations
so<00:07:37.710> as<00:07:37.860> always<00:07:38.160> guys<00:07:38.310> thanks<00:07:38.940> for<00:07:39.060> watching<00:07:39.419> I
