husk<00:03:46.280> for<00:03:46.819> the<00:03:47.269> table<00:03:48.400> yeah<00:03:50.680> it<00:03:51.680> was<00:03:51.829> a<00:03:51.859> really

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159 
husk for the table yeah it was a really

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:53.199 
husk for the table yeah it was a really
good<00:03:52.310> exponent<00:03:52.819> son

I<00:03:53.239> think<00:03:54.079> the<00:03:54.349> Hilton<00:03:54.829> location<00:03:55.760> is<00:03:55.909> a<00:03:55.939> little

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
I think the Hilton location is a little

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.709 
I think the Hilton location is a little
better<00:03:56.389> than<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:57.620> community<00:03:58.189> ecology

00:03:58.709 --> 00:03:58.719 
better than the community ecology

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:00.970 
better than the community ecology
because<00:03:59.719> it<00:03:59.870> has<00:03:59.989> a<00:04:00.019> little<00:04:00.260> more<00:04:00.530> space<00:04:00.739> and

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
because it has a little more space and

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.159 
because it has a little more space and
