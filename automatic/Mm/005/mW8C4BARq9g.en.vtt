00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
here to the injector you want to loop it

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.459 
here to the injector you want to loop it
around<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.969> I<00:00:59.969> like<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.539> cinch<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.960> down<00:01:00.989> here

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
fuel line stays away from the head you

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.039 
fuel line stays away from the head you
don't<00:01:04.890> want<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.220> get<00:01:05.309> too<00:01:05.519> hot<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:06.270> then

release to the supply from the tank and

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.039 
release to the supply from the tank and
while<00:01:13.619> you're<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:13.920> here<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.490> might<00:01:14.670> as<00:01:14.820> well

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
while you're in here you might as well

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.190 
while you're in here you might as well
change<00:01:16.049> out<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.439> filter<00:01:16.890> right<00:01:17.070> here<00:01:17.400> and

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
change out this filter right here and

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.570

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.050 
make sure you got a clean fuel filter
you're<00:01:21.090> already<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.540> there<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:22.880> think<00:01:23.880> it's

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
you're already in there so I think it's

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.969 
you're already in there so I think it's
a<00:01:24.119> good<00:01:24.270> idea<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.540> do<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.259> did<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.740> so

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
a good idea to do that and I did that so

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.910 
a good idea to do that and I did that so
the<00:01:26.790> next<00:01:27.030> step<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.390> we're<00:01:27.600> gonna<00:01:27.659> I'm<00:01:28.650> gonna

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
the next step is we're gonna I'm gonna

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.730 
the next step is we're gonna I'm gonna
measure<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.369> piece<00:01:29.610> I'm<00:01:29.880> gonna<00:01:30.110> trim<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.140> and

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
measure this piece I'm gonna trim it and

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.929 
measure this piece I'm gonna trim it and
I'm<00:01:31.829> going<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.040> install<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:32.549> with<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.790> hose

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
I'm going to install this with the hose

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
definitely need to use a fuel line that

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.380 
definitely need to use a fuel line that
will<00:01:48.540> handle<00:01:48.689> 60<00:01:49.229> psi<00:01:49.740> they<00:01:50.549> say<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.939> fuel
