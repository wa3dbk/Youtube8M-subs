00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.110
 add 

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:17.569
 follows the topic of AIDS self-consumption is a tool that is very interesting 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.189
 but Carlos Sands who raised a company that does not have a certain 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.060
 level of unemployment 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.449
 that is to say that the silo self-consumption the great advantage that simplicity has 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:32.419
 and that percentage simplicity has as counterpart 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.650
 an inefficiency 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.080
 the floor and did not do with versions to use that same 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.840
 century 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.670
 in a balanced diet can comment 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.860
 then what the coconut of the comapa a project is a self-consumption if it comes 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.890
 interesting as a tool for companies that do not have tractors 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.730
 content personal photo perfect to manage a pen 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.730
 richi then interesting for a company that created his house 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.100
 direct staff that can handle it efficiently he is not to be 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.619
 there were doping they use massive form 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.700
 at the level of each largest company 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.700
 what incidentally the infrastructure has for Biscayan chefs 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.920
 in tractors and they do not use it because the neighbor already in operation obama nothing which 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.920
 will boost that is an album which the reason for 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.700
 the benefit will be a consumption 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.040
 basically that it will not be controlled that animal consumption percent in 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.430
 primary as in what they want because the pressures of the sirocco consumption 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.830
 in the best case 10 to 1 little boy 10 kilos of dry matter 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.390
 We had an animal farm decided to give it 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.400
 Lendra weights in that same fair mixture 5-2 to 306 kilos of dry matter are 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.590
 enough own style and that chose 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.040
 also another concept just contemplate put special attention to the one that needs to be 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.830
 pay special attention to tents not if the issue of the nuclei that 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.800
 unfortunately in the first competition atrocious the company is part of the sr 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.120
 and it is that to lower price and sell more means many times I have 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:11.779
 work or produce lower quality cores 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:14.779
 what is he saying that 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.309
 nuclei of various percent companies and we have not found a very surprise 

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:24.659
 unpleasant sense that they do not even say they have what it says to have a 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:25.689
 old age 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:30.340
 In another case, one of them has some components that are not important in the 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:33.769
 test to balance the diet and missing the most determinant as they are 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:39.079
 ramÃ³n oaks in vitamin k that before none accuses him bibm and the micro 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:40.869
 mineral and that are Basque components 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:44.569
 p that does not happen in other countries work to get companies 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.709
 all have a place and here regrettably the competition 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.930
 she lack of measurement on the part of the producers 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:58.379
 has made that in the 60 'tokyo for this company the product to product of 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:59.299
 lower quality 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.830
 although as components imported from Japan
