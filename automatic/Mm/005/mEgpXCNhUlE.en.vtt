00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.080
 I want to introduce you at this moment 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.299
 our past esport is the proof of a 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.280
 car that we did several months ago already 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.380
 it's about the new fiat qubo with which 7 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.990
 entered into a segment really 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.580
 very attractive in terms of sales as it is 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.100
 the segment of the minivans 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.320
 small with the faithful cube to which after 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.880
 accompanies the fiat or blog 7 made a 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.920
 really very interesting proposal with 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.480
 modern cars with very equipment 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.769
 important in terms of safety in 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.660
 regarding technology and in terms of 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.429
 comfort and somehow giving a 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.019
 walk forward with respect to your 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.610
 direct competitors you think what 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.950
 let's see we try for you the new fiat 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.820
 qubo and these are the images and our 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.820
 impressions of course 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.800
 Y 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.800
 the 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.820
 Clear 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.610
 and 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.610
 Y 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.120
 all right 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.030
 we present you today the fiat qubo with the 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.829
 which the Italian brand entered in this 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.259
 segment of MPVs and utilities 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:20.539
 light multipurpose dominated by 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.450
 French brands with kangoo partner and 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:25.880
 berlingo brought fresh air modernity and 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.619
 more equipment to the segment something more 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.750
 boy in his outer dimensions that 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.610
 your direct competitors have nothing 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.360
 that envy them about space 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.000
 interior and habitability 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.490
 juice is produced in bursa turkey in a 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.680
 factory of the fiat group in the psa group 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.420
 citroën peugeot that also produces the 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.060
 same brothers of this car the peugeot 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.250
 bipper and the citroën nemo 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.159
 the country arrives in passenger and 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.020
 van version called fiorino cube 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.850
 built on the fiat platform 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.100
 Italian point comes with only one option 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.859
 of motor in this case in 1.400 steels 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.619
 cubic centimeters 8 valves and 73 hp 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:05.770
 installed crosswise that also 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.420
 equips some products of the psa group 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.300
 associated with a very well connected box 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.100
 5 speed manual 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.480
 the measures of the cube are three thousand 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.820
 nine hundred fifty-nine millimeters 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.250
 long thousand 735 high and thousand 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.110
 six hundred eighty high the radius of 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.210
 turn is less than ten meters the 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.910
 capacity of the trunk is 330 liters 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.830
 although it goes up to 650 if 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.140
 we load up to the roof and it also has 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.910
 the option to refill rear seats and 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.320
 of the companion 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.480
 equipped with tires 195 55 16 something 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.030
 rumorosos en route but the excellent 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.020
 grip the help that as you see 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.270
 images we had to use 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.220
 unfortunately, it is not of use 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.900
 temporary if it is of a measure less than 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.569
 which equips the series car and with 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.879
 sheet metal rim 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.680
 the cube's weight is one thousand and eighty 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:56.560
 kilos and tank capacity 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.010
 fuel is 45 liters good for the 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.810
 scanty city for the route an ideal car 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.730
 for city ​​use with a position of 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.099
 handling very comfortable with easy access to 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.700
 Agile traffic controls and outstanding 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:11.650
 maneuverability however it hurts if 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.170
 you understand what I want to tell you the route 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.639
 it's not your strong we travel to the 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.040
 Atlantic coast and at times with 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:19.900
 side wind or against was remarkable 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.480
 the lack of a few more ponies and something 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.519
 more torque under the hood no doubt 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.260
 some the car was conceived for 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.549
 work in cities to 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.549
 transport families in the 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.750
 cities I must say that I am a user of 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.579
 minivans more than a decade ago 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.340
 because he rescued his habitability 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:38.919
 ability to load still in the version 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.870
 passengers sum and not weakness are 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:42.790
 Very practical low cost vehicles 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.469
 maintenance particularly 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.650
 I prefer versus cars are given 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:50.500
 by price equipment and benefits 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.939
 similar in the case of the fiat qubo the 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.009
 Italian company presents us with a 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:55.689
 very equipped vehicle in terms of 

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:57.729
 comfort elements electric mirrors 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:00.129
 audio systems with mp3 player 

00:03:57.729 --> 00:04:02.109
 and bluetooth air conditioning direction 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:03.939
 hydraulic computer on board with the 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.879
 contracts centralized locking tires 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:09.370
 address with a very modern design and 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:11.510
 very functional apart from excellent 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.790
 termination 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.799
 in terms of security it has also given 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.959
 a quality jump with four airbags 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.709
 brakes with abs distributed electronically in 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.449
 braking 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.520
 seat belts and head restraints 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:25.250
 for the five passengers in addition to 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.380
 isofix hooks by experience I can 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.970
 say that the cube's stability though 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.430
 a priori it can be supposed the opposite 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.830
 is superlative even in extreme situations 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.590
 the same goes for its competitors 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.120
 direct talking about these should 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.650
 look closely at the evolution of 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.729
 closing sales in the segment given that 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.190
 the Italians have put themselves in the 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.080
 market two vehicles with the played and more 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.479
 recently with twice as much as 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.919
 comfort and safety equipment 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.900
 more modern design and architecture 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:52.490
 construction has serious advantages 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.160
 competitive both the versions 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.660
 passengers like the football versions 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.150
 fiat up here the segment with two 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.940
 similar vehicles but different as 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.950
 to meet all needs 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.470
 the question that came up during this 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.780
 proof was because fiat that has 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.120
 very efficient yes modern engines say 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.569
 and electronic management does not offer this 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.610
 alternative in these vehicles 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:17.589
 I think these two minivans both 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.659
 the proven cube as the double slope 

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:21.369
 they will give the Italian brand something 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:22.689
 more than market share in the 

00:05:21.369 --> 00:05:24.729
 as the country's economy and 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:28.240
 practically the value of the dollar is not 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:30.819
 unravel the design by modernity breaks 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.469
 the molds of the classic thing sets it apart 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:34.360
 has adherents and detractors 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:36.099
 obviously particularly to me 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.869
 it is extractive except for the 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:40.659
 solution applied to the windows 

00:05:37.869 --> 00:05:42.909
 backs undoubtedly a debatable topic and 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:45.819
 subjective but that for a reason or for 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:47.589
 the other attracts all eyes is a 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:50.080
 practical car a car with a very good 

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:51.580
 walk with a smooth walk so much in the 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.369
 city as in the route although as you 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.409
 I said on the route it cost him especially 

00:05:54.369 --> 00:05:59.139
 the moments of the overpass lift 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:59.800
 turns take a bit of clean if you have 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:02.680
 With the wind against 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.149
 obviously with more reason I insist the car 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.399
 he does not feel comfortable on the road but he 's 

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:07.779
 a very practical ideal car for 

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:09.849
 family for the one who has to 

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:11.469
 transport things so you have family 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:13.959
 big or who has dogs or whatever 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:15.580
 habitability and load capacity 

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:17.469
 of this minivan vehicle is 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.300
 really amazing is one of his 

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:22.210
 great advantages over sedan 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.550
 of passengers and certainly some party 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.720
 presented with the cube that we are 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.400
 testing now and with the double that 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.310
 we will test in two weeks 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.530
 really very attractive vehicles both 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.849
 for those who want to use them as 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.770
 passenger vehicle so that 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:37.770
 want to use it as a work vehicle 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.310
 i
