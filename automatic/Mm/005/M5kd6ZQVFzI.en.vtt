now<00:02:25.750> what<00:02:26.200> makes<00:02:26.410> these<00:02:26.590> gloves

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
now what makes these gloves

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.780 
now what makes these gloves
is<00:02:28.620> rather<00:02:29.620> is<00:02:30.129> this<00:02:30.700> rubber<00:02:31.800> netting<00:02:32.800> you<00:02:33.040> see

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
is rather is this rubber netting you see

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.619 
is rather is this rubber netting you see
all<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.120> way<00:02:34.239> over<00:02:34.269> and<00:02:35.970> what<00:02:36.970> this<00:02:37.209> netting

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
all the way over and what this netting

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.839 
all the way over and what this netting
does<00:02:37.840> is<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.170> gives<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:38.560> grip<00:02:38.860> but<00:02:39.280> also<00:02:39.459> in

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
does is a gives you grip but also in

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.880 
does is a gives you grip but also in
that<00:02:40.030> situation<00:02:40.840> where<00:02:40.989> the<00:02:41.080> glove<00:02:41.379> is<00:02:41.590> wet

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
that situation where the glove is wet

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.360 
that situation where the glove is wet
and<00:02:44.220> normally<00:02:45.220> a<00:02:45.430> wet<00:02:46.239> glove<00:02:46.569> is<00:02:46.780> slippery

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
and normally a wet glove is slippery

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.869 
and normally a wet glove is slippery
monofilament<00:02:48.370> is<00:02:48.760> slippery<00:02:49.060> when<00:02:49.480> wet<00:02:49.510> look

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
monofilament is slippery when wet look

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.350 
monofilament is slippery when wet look
now<00:02:51.879> have<00:02:52.349> this<00:02:53.349> layer<00:02:54.160> rubber<00:02:54.700> here<00:02:55.120> there's

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
now have this layer rubber here there's

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.449 
now have this layer rubber here there's
a<00:02:55.420> netting<00:02:55.810> so<00:02:56.500> even<00:02:56.860> though<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.040> glove<00:02:57.280> is

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
a netting so even though the glove is

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.800 
a netting so even though the glove is
wet<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:59.650> get<00:02:59.799> grab<00:03:00.760> it<00:03:00.940> and<00:03:01.090> you<00:03:01.239> get<00:03:01.420> a<00:03:01.450> good

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
wet you get grab it and you get a good

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.270 
wet you get grab it and you get a good
grip<00:03:03.000> take<00:03:04.000> a<00:03:04.030> wrap<00:03:04.360> and<00:03:04.780> you<00:03:05.019> got<00:03:05.230> a<00:03:05.260> good<00:03:05.560> grip

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
regardless of being wet or whatever so I

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.229 
regardless of being wet or whatever so I
highly<00:03:11.470> recommend<00:03:11.500> this<00:03:12.040> not<00:03:12.610> only<00:03:12.760> offshore
