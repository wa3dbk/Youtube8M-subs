00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 with the technician commented jose and I have 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.299
 puntocom fanatic and today I want to talk to you 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.460
 of inexperience instead of bay with a 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.700
 problem that I had with lake pro under the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.700
 video 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.980
 As you know in October of the year 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.260
 past acquire this camera bought it 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.330
 hero 4 I'm using it now for 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.950
 my revised quadrocopters yes 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.260
 the files for remote second 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.230
 using this accessory that placed it 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.520
 in my head and the truth is that it looks 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.650
 much better than the lenses 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.000
 unfortunately the lenses and the 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.379
 crap right now you have 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.530
 could see the quality and the difference 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:45.080
 well the thing that I had a moment 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:49.970
 this accessory they place it in the 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:52.430
 front of this camera and 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.260
 right in the lens and unfortunately in 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.839
 an opportunity when I retire it came out 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.420
 with all this part of the cause all the 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:01.670
 front all this plastic that 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.040
 you come out with all those and up 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.320
 now yes here you can see that it is 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.790
 here inside I tried to remove it and 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.240
 unfortunately this can not be 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:15.290
 accessory I acquired it then it is not 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.690
 original bought in that sense there's 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.020
 you can see that it is inside no 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.480
 this part of here then in the end not 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.230
 I had time I did not have time and I decided 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:30.740
 sometimes it's going to acquire me acquire one of 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.420
 the guarantees in which two by two 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.880
 years which are a problem you 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.280
 falls you break it goes simply sometimes 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.830
 go with the camera broken and or just repair 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.070
 against the replaces then I decided to go 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.630
 with my guarantee and they said good we're going to 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.710
 the camera if it's supposed to be 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.120
 something that is broken that can not be 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.460
 replace we will give you a new 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.800
 then they saw that there was indeed 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.980
 something that had come out in its place and 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.240
 they took me a new box a go pro 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.620
 new emission other people all the 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.900
 Advisors to give you the new camera 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.520
 drowned in the new box I said no 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.070
 I just bring the camera and I brought 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.870
 the piece where it has supposedly been 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.700
 stayed in the front of the lens 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.050
 then they said we were going to before art 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.850
 simply the flesh that opened the 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.400
 box with a pain but hey they gave me 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.200
 the new camera and the interesting thing about this 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.660
 is that you have the guarantee of 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.910
 company bought for a year and there I 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.700
 I logically the other guarantee should 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.980
 be they used the guarantee of the 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.470
 he bought and how interesting he gave him is 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.110
 that at the moment they give me 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.750
 or they make the change of the old camera by 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.760
 a new camera figures like I'm 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.820
 buying a new camera but zero 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.200
 cost and that same day Sunday I had a 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.310
 offer that if I bought myself a 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.850
 bought they gave me 50 dollars in a gif 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:50.060
 card the best buy so I went with my 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.190
 broken camera they gave me a new camera and 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.500
 On top of all that they gave me a 10 card 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.700
 of 50 or gestures of the best gift the 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.620
 father's day that was used of the day 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.600
 next is father's day but the 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.610
 truth is that I thought it was incredible 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.530
 service my guarantee I still keep it 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.100
 I paid which means that it becomes me 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.540
 break the camera I still have the 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.040
 guarantee that they will replace me for 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.209
 a new camera used at the time of 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.560
 put in the new ones they told me we're going to 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.780
 start again from scratch and you have two 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.670
 years then the war that that guy 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.100
 of services we do not see in others 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.660
 places if I'm wrong for example 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.540
 because it would be interesting that people 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.459
 know which country is really what one 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.320
 they treat like this or what stores in the background 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.950
 they treat their clients in the way they 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:33.080
