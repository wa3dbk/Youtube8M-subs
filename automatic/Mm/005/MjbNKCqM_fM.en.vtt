sounds<00:00:13.500> like<00:00:13.590> it<00:00:13.710> would<00:00:13.799> be<00:00:13.889> really

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
sounds like it would be really

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.099 
sounds like it would be really
overwhelming<00:00:14.400> but<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.330> doesn't<00:00:15.570> have<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.780> be

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
overwhelming but it doesn't have to be

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.380 
overwhelming but it doesn't have to be
in<00:00:16.710> my<00:00:16.890> opinion<00:00:17.130> it's<00:00:17.400> actually<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.090> one

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
in my opinion it's actually the one

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.880 
in my opinion it's actually the one
thing<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:18.810> can<00:00:19.050> do<00:00:19.260> that<00:00:19.470> will<00:00:19.619> make<00:00:19.770> your
