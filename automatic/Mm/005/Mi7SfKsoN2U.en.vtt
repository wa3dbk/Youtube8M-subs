00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.470
 ah 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.279
 after the dark time called of 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.470
 an average of the bubonic plague as 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.300
 Brugal shows in the triumph of the 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.700
 death where more than half of the 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.590
 European population is dead and the 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.170
 popular belief is that God is 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.030
 punishing that the church governs the 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.940
 knowledge what limits the expansion 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.550
 of this that man worships the sacred and 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.290
 fight against the son of the devil where 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.440
 the pantocrator and the religious figures 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.550
 They are flat and dehumanized being 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.550
 human relationship 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.130
 and then the creation of miguel angel 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.770
 had feminine features as we can see 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.870
 in God's clothes minimizes the role of 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.190
 the male so much that the penis in 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.650
 representative member of the 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.190
 masculinity is painted disproportion 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.190
 of the body 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.760
 the human is little interested if he reaches 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.640
 goodbye why your position is indifferent 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.610
 the Renaissance artist leave nothing to 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.770
 random everything is calculated full of 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.770
 symbolism the paintings are stories 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.020
 complete 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.000
 in rebirth the human being is 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.830
 perfect and divine within your own 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.650
 imperfection and humanity 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.930
 intelligence governs art and 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.820
 new techniques and styles emerge as 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.700
 can see in the three-dimensional character 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:44.570
 from the Sistine Chapel there it seems that 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.330
 there are columns curtains pictures where alone 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.800
 there is a smooth wall the church and its 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.740
 rules become at least 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.110
 important as miguelángel exemplifies 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.480
 in his bassinet when turning to the side 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.800
 contrary to the commandments the curtain 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.520
 falls off 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.520
 and in the divine there is tracing technique 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.520
 thought 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.300
 in the rebirth god is imperfect and 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.420
 human within his own perfection and 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.680
 divinity religious art forgets in its 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.020
 mostly the aureolas 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.300
 God is another in us simulated 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.110
 not even the wars between good and 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.360
 the evil 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.660
 the fantastic elements prevail 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.550
 fight with the dragons is over 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.060
 Jesus is born between humanity and 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.790
 mix between the human tide 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.020
 the virgin is not crowned with gold but 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:41.260
 with flowers she is a complete woman 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:43.810
 Breastfeeding plays and loves teaches marry 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:48.569
 they shine all their glory and thus they are created 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.569
 many icons that are common today 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:56.250
 man suffers his humanity and finds 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.250
 pleasure in femininity 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.340
 we are children of man not of god 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:05.819
 the kings prostrate themselves before the 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.870
 rebirth barbarism is over 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.870
 we have been reborn 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.430
 Knowledge is available to everyone 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.130
 thanks to the invention of a German 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.630
 guttenberg first prints the bible the 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.050
 divine comedy and the elements 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.120
 religious persist the letter company is 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.180
 becomes the largest invention of the 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.520
 humanity sir francis bacon exemplifies 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.069
 the statistics john milton us 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.730
 presents the new devil in paradise 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:42.290
 lost light and fierce human repentant 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.739
 penitent of the drawings of 2 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.019
 milton creates an immortal phrase better 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.250
 reign in hell to serve in the 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.130
 sky 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.470
 in the Machiavelli public policy the 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.100
 prince and affirms that the end justifies 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.100
 the means 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.409
 Jon Marlowe and his characters are 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:09.409
 openly homosexuals is no longer the 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:12.349
 soul what matters but the thought 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:15.019
 the copernic polish declares that we are not 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:17.269
 the center of the universe and galileo the 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:20.419
 father of astronomy states that 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:23.419
 we turn around the sun the inquisition 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:26.840
 he condemns him and he says forever and without 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:29.150
 But twine moves and its basilica 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.210

 drives the arts the railing the monk 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:45.190
 Dominican counterattacks books and 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.190
 works 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:51.710
 de medici resigns and shortly after 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:55.330
 railing is burned at the stake nothing 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:58.150
 stops the rebirth 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:01.150
 in england shakespeare and his work 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:04.060
 they address the feelings you define the 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:08.099
 love the balconies are not the ones 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:13.050
 the human himself struggles with his soul and his 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:13.050
 Thought is to be or not to be 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.380

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.150
 Is in sight

 cervantes enrique is Spanish with 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.899
 his quixote and nothing is already the same 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:28.029
 the mills are giant and the Quixote and 

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:30.539
 sancho pasa are part of our 

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:30.539
 present 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.389
 the man is in his mature age so he 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.389
 perceive 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:47.020
 and profane love is much freer than 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.960
 the sacred tiziana painting that gives us 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.690
 also venvin de orvin and her dress 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:56.410

 meat the gods we wish the woman has 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.910
 triumphed over the man who is 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:04.630
 exhausted from the annoying war so 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:07.660
 divine annoying with the father so much that 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:10.120
 humanized his son is dead now the 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.760
 mother is the one who governs man 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:15.400
 Renaissance knows everything he studies 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:18.010
 all the best example of this is david 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.260
 who without leaving aside his symbolism 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:22.660
 women and religion as

 new techniques with sfumato 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:31.670
 and geoconda that becomes a 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.670
 symbolism of all time
