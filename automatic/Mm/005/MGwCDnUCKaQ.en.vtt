00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
don't have to worry about it fighting

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.979 
don't have to worry about it fighting
with<00:02:07.710> your<00:02:07.860> bass<00:02:08.039> guitar<00:02:08.399> or<00:02:08.580> kick<00:02:08.789> drum<00:02:09.090> these

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
with your bass guitar or kick drum these

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.370 
with your bass guitar or kick drum these

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
also work really well on guitar cabs

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.400 
also work really well on guitar cabs
and<00:02:13.550> so<00:02:14.550> they're<00:02:14.700> kind<00:02:14.880> of<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:15.030> workhorse<00:02:15.410> you

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
and so they're kind of a workhorse you

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.140 
and so they're kind of a workhorse you
have<00:02:16.590> this<00:02:16.890> hard<00:02:17.160> mount<00:02:17.400> here<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:17.880> if<00:02:18.000> you're

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
have this hard mount here so if you're

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.540 
have this hard mount here so if you're
in<00:02:18.210> a<00:02:18.270> home<00:02:18.450> studio<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:19.650> can<00:02:19.800> use<00:02:20.010> this<00:02:20.160> on<00:02:20.340> any

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
in a home studio you can use this on any

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.340 
in a home studio you can use this on any
mic<00:02:20.790> stand<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.440> they<00:02:22.440> also<00:02:22.620> have<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:25.170> rim

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
mic stand and they also have the rim

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.090 
mic stand and they also have the rim
mounts<00:02:25.770> they<00:02:26.490> do<00:02:26.550> have<00:02:27.120> rubber<00:02:28.110> reinforcement

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
mounts they do have rubber reinforcement

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.910 
mounts they do have rubber reinforcement
here<00:02:29.250> so<00:02:29.460> it<00:02:29.550> grips<00:02:29.790> well<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:31.470> microphone

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
here so it grips well and the microphone

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.740 
here so it grips well and the microphone
just<00:02:32.100> attaches<00:02:32.550> right<00:02:32.760> here<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.240> you<00:02:33.390> do<00:02:33.570> have

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
just attaches right here and you do have

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.650 
just attaches right here and you do have
a<00:02:33.810> little<00:02:34.170> bit<00:02:34.290> of<00:02:34.410> adjustment<00:02:34.830> here<00:02:35.360> so<00:02:36.360> that

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
a little bit of adjustment here so that

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.630 
a little bit of adjustment here so that
you<00:02:36.810> can<00:02:37.020> kind<00:02:37.260> of<00:02:37.470> set<00:02:38.040> whether<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.460> want

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
you can kind of set whether you want

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.940 
you can kind of set whether you want
more<00:02:38.820> closely<00:02:39.180> might<00:02:39.630> force<00:02:40.020> a<00:02:40.170> rock<00:02:40.500> or<00:02:40.740> punk

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
more closely might force a rock or punk

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.340 
more closely might force a rock or punk
or<00:02:41.370> if<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.120> want<00:02:42.270> it<00:02:42.330> back<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.570> little<00:02:42.780> bit<00:02:43.110> more

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
or if you want it back a little bit more

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.500 
or if you want it back a little bit more
for<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.620> little<00:02:43.830> bit<00:02:43.920> more<00:02:44.070> dynamic

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
for a little bit more dynamic

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.390 
for a little bit more dynamic
full-bodied<00:02:45.510> sound<00:02:45.750> for<00:02:46.140> say<00:02:46.320> country<00:02:47.280> or

really<00:02:50.610> excited<00:02:50.850> about<00:02:51.300> with<00:02:51.660> this<00:02:51.810> kit<00:02:52.080> is

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
really excited about with this kit is

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.540 
really excited about with this kit is
that<00:02:52.740> it<00:02:52.830> comes<00:02:53.300> with<00:02:54.300> two<00:02:54.690> of<00:02:54.990> these<00:02:55.890> gxl

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
that it comes with two of these gxl

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.110 
that it comes with two of these gxl
twelve<00:02:56.880> hundreds<00:02:57.330> and<00:02:58.160> it<00:02:59.160> is<00:02:59.310> removable<00:02:59.790> so

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
twelve hundreds and it is removable so

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.180 
twelve hundreds and it is removable so

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
if you don't need the windscreen you can

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.670

take it off these are actually really

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.460 
take it off these are actually really
great<00:03:04.950> microphones<00:03:05.700> these<00:03:06.090> are<00:03:06.470> probably

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
great microphones these are probably

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.020 
great microphones these are probably
some<00:03:07.740> of<00:03:07.770> the<00:03:07.890> most<00:03:08.040> impressive<00:03:08.400> budget

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
some of the most impressive budget

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.430 
some of the most impressive budget
microphones<00:03:09.450> that<00:03:09.570> i've<00:03:09.690> personally<00:03:09.960> used

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
microphones that i've personally used

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.130 
microphones that i've personally used
not<00:03:11.130> only<00:03:11.370> do<00:03:11.490> they<00:03:11.640> sound<00:03:11.850> great<00:03:12.300> on<00:03:12.360> drums

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
not only do they sound great on drums

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.560 
not only do they sound great on drums
but<00:03:13.890> they<00:03:14.040> actually<00:03:14.370> sound<00:03:14.520> really<00:03:15.150> good<00:03:15.360> on

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
but they actually sound really good on

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.030 
but they actually sound really good on
acoustic<00:03:16.110> instruments<00:03:16.650> whether<00:03:16.860> it's

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
acoustic instruments whether it's

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.000 
acoustic instruments whether it's
acoustic<00:03:17.430> guitar<00:03:17.700> mandolin<00:03:18.330> violin<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:19.650> forth

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
acoustic guitar mandolin violin so forth

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.830 
acoustic guitar mandolin violin so forth
but<00:03:20.940> definitely<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.510> straightforward

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
but definitely a straightforward

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.260 
but definitely a straightforward
no-frills<00:03:22.680> microphone<00:03:23.250> very<00:03:23.550> smooth<00:03:24.060> and

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
no-frills microphone very smooth and

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.540 
no-frills microphone very smooth and
balanced<00:03:24.750> a<00:03:24.900> little<00:03:24.990> bit<00:03:25.560> of<00:03:25.680> an<00:03:25.800> air<00:03:26.010> boost<00:03:26.310> at

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
balanced a little bit of an air boost at

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.610 
balanced a little bit of an air boost at
the<00:03:26.610> top<00:03:26.820> so<00:03:27.090> you<00:03:27.150> get<00:03:27.300> some<00:03:27.540> shimmery<00:03:28.380> Ness

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
the top so you get some shimmery Ness

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.070 
the top so you get some shimmery Ness
and<00:03:28.800> some<00:03:28.980> airiness<00:03:29.820> to<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.180> whole<00:03:30.330> overall

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
and some airiness to the whole overall

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.160 
and some airiness to the whole overall
image<00:03:31.470> of<00:03:31.560> your<00:03:31.680> drum<00:03:32.420> like<00:03:33.420> so<00:03:33.570> with<00:03:33.720> acoustic

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
image of your drum like so with acoustic

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.020 
image of your drum like so with acoustic
guitar<00:03:34.410> it<00:03:34.590> helps<00:03:34.830> like<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.160> string<00:03:35.520> attack

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
guitar it helps like the string attack

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.900 
guitar it helps like the string attack
comb<00:03:36.300> through<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:36.840> just<00:03:37.710> a<00:03:37.860> great<00:03:38.100> workhorse

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
comb through and just a great workhorse

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.810
