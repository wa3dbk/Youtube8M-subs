comes<00:01:59.300> with<00:01:59.539> it<00:01:59.690> the<00:02:00.020> microphone<00:02:00.500> and<00:02:00.860> XLR

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
comes with it the microphone and XLR

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.850 
comes with it the microphone and XLR
cable<00:02:02.030> it's<00:02:02.750> a<00:02:02.869> high<00:02:03.020> quality<00:02:03.050> microphone

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
cable it's a high quality microphone

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.639 
cable it's a high quality microphone
where<00:02:04.099> we<00:02:05.030> decided<00:02:05.539> when<00:02:06.259> we<00:02:06.349> were<00:02:06.440> going<00:02:06.590> to

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
where we decided when we were going to

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.169 
where we decided when we were going to
do<00:02:06.770> this<00:02:06.920> we<00:02:07.129> wanted<00:02:07.429> the<00:02:07.520> best<00:02:07.670> quality<00:02:07.940> of

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
do this we wanted the best quality of

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.460 
do this we wanted the best quality of
the<00:02:08.239> sound<00:02:08.390> that<00:02:08.539> we<00:02:08.629> could<00:02:08.780> possibly<00:02:08.899> get<00:02:09.289> out

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
the sound that we could possibly get out

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.410 
the sound that we could possibly get out
of<00:02:09.649> it<00:02:09.739> so<00:02:10.340> we<00:02:10.520> picked<00:02:10.940> a<00:02:11.030> really<00:02:11.180> high<00:02:11.390> quality

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
of it so we picked a really high quality

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.220 
of it so we picked a really high quality
high<00:02:12.080> fidelity<00:02:12.319> microphone

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
high fidelity microphone

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.550 
high fidelity microphone
the<00:02:14.500> echo<00:02:14.920> is<00:02:15.250> uh<00:02:15.599> you<00:02:16.599> can<00:02:16.780> change<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.349> right

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
the echo is uh you can change the right

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.680 
the echo is uh you can change the right
rate<00:02:19.019> and<00:02:20.019> the<00:02:20.680> sustained<00:02:21.299> to<00:02:22.299> give<00:02:22.480> you<00:02:22.599> an

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
rate and the sustained to give you an

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.990 
rate and the sustained to give you an
on-stage<00:02:23.140> of<00:02:23.319> bag<00:02:23.530> so<00:02:24.250> it<00:02:24.370> sounds<00:02:24.670> like<00:02:24.730> you're

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
on-stage of bag so it sounds like you're

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.539 
on-stage of bag so it sounds like you're
up<00:02:25.150> performing<00:02:25.720> on<00:02:25.870> stage<00:02:26.010> we<00:02:27.010> also<00:02:27.190> in

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
up performing on stage we also in

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.220 
up performing on stage we also in
designing<00:02:27.909> this<00:02:28.150> thing<00:02:28.390> realize<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:28.989> kids

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
designing this thing realize that kids

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.720 
designing this thing realize that kids
are<00:02:29.319> going<00:02:29.409> to<00:02:29.470> be<00:02:29.620> using<00:02:29.769> this<00:02:30.129> so<00:02:30.370> we<00:02:30.519> wanted

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
are going to be using this so we wanted

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.100 
are going to be using this so we wanted
to<00:02:30.790> make<00:02:30.879> sure<00:02:31.000> that<00:02:31.330> it<00:02:31.360> was<00:02:31.540> rugged<00:02:31.810> enough

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
to make sure that it was rugged enough

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.050 
to make sure that it was rugged enough
and<00:02:32.440> we<00:02:32.739> would<00:02:32.980> make<00:02:33.190> it<00:02:33.310> as<00:02:33.400> kid-proof<00:02:33.670> as

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
and we would make it as kid-proof as

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.699 
and we would make it as kid-proof as
possible<00:02:34.569> normally<00:02:35.230> when<00:02:35.349> something's

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
possible normally when something's

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.380 
possible normally when something's
battery-powered<00:02:36.010> has<00:02:36.400> an<00:02:36.519> alligator<00:02:36.910> clip<00:02:37.120> on

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
battery-powered has an alligator clip on

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.410 
battery-powered has an alligator clip on
it<00:02:37.590> we've<00:02:38.590> decided<00:02:39.040> instead<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:39.700> use<00:02:39.819> a<00:02:39.910> coffin

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
it we've decided instead to use a coffin

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.330 
it we've decided instead to use a coffin
where<00:02:40.930> you<00:02:41.049> just<00:02:41.230> drop<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.560> battery<00:02:41.860> into<00:02:42.069> it

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
where you just drop the battery into it

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.550 
where you just drop the battery into it
pop<00:02:45.340> it<00:02:45.519> in<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:45.819> then<00:02:46.390> you're<00:02:46.450> good<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:46.900> go<00:02:47.019> so

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
pop it in and then you're good to go so

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.020 
pop it in and then you're good to go so
there<00:02:47.739> are<00:02:47.950> no<00:02:48.150> wires<00:02:49.150> to<00:02:49.480> pull<00:02:49.660> apart<00:02:49.780> for<00:02:50.290> a

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
there are no wires to pull apart for a

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.670 
there are no wires to pull apart for a
nicely<00:02:52.030> designed<00:02:52.329> unit<00:02:52.750> we're<00:02:52.870> really<00:02:53.079> proud

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
nicely designed unit we're really proud

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.199 
nicely designed unit we're really proud
of<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:53.920> way<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.160> engineers<00:02:54.579> got<00:02:55.090> together

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
of the way the engineers got together

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:06.600 
of the way the engineers got together
and<00:02:55.540> put<00:02:55.930> this<00:02:56.049> thing<00:02:56.230> together<00:02:56.410> for<00:02:56.799> us

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610
