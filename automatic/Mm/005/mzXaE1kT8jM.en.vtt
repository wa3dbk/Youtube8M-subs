00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.090
 Strong in the coming are the compact SUVs or even cross-over noted ones 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.649
 Combination van and SUV 

00:00:11.649 --> 00:00:15.289
 With the Antara, Opel wants to play a leading role in this highly competitive segment 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.619
 pioneers here are the Asians strictly speaking is the Antara 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.509
 also a far east car is therefore built by Chevrolet in Korea 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.310
 but now the Russelsheimer can offer their new cheap the 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.440
 Four-cylinder petrol engine is already from 26 thousand 850 euros the interesting 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.880
 This model is more expensive thirty thousand 765 euros 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.650
 who his data 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.200
 Top speed 180 km / h 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.780
 starting from zero to one hundred in ten point three seconds is okay 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.200
 so that is the 150 hp Seva in the field of competition 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.290
 the brother model of the identical Chevrolet Captiva is in the 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.059
 Diesel version still around 2000 euros cheaper 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.059
 but has a poorer features 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.890
 the competition comes from Far East the Kia Sorento the most exported car of the 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.240
 Korean brand had about 20 hp more power 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.050
 The BMW x3 Opel wants to defy especially because the Bayern sales king 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.990
 in the compact SUVs, it impresses with the harmonious interaction of 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.040
 Steering circuit and x3 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.990
 only the price provides for sweats because of the base model 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.990
 starts first 35 000 expensive 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.770
 the greatest shortcoming of the Antara is its engine 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.290
 Although his 150 hp are sufficient and fast to move forward but the momentum 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.229
 is missing 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.420
 often in mountain driving where you more often than expected in the second gear 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.770
 switching back from the body has made Opel rather simple that fine 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.920
 drawn brand face immediately reminds of asthma and COPD 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.100
 large Opel flash and wide chrome struts 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.880
 with four meters 57 length, the five-door Antara is slightly larger than 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.729
 Many of his classmates eye-catching the bulky grills the 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:13.030
 Crease on the hood and the side air inlets since the Antara 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.489
 consistently designed as a five-seater, it has plenty of room in the 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.770
 Interior fittings and the slim center console are clear 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.330
 just designed the Navi is a bit awkward to use the material mix 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.700
 made of shiny plastic in the look of alu and wood in the deeds acts at first 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.939
 Look high but it is not really 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:34.869
 the leather rear seat is split and the trunk with 370 folds 

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:38.269
 to 1000 420 liters of this class appropriate 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.030
 Google provides the band Corser optionally a bicycle holder of the all too clear there 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.449
 from the rear bumper extends 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:50.109
 DAPD 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.109
 tip 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.540
 the proportions have quite sporty suspension 

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:02.889
 with little lateral inclination is also on winding country roads quickly 

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:06.869
 for Opel shows a similar whopping roadholding as the x3 

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:11.950
 the korean common-rail engines can not shine at our 

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:14.909
 Test drive on the highway and highway consumed the Opel city 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:16.540
 Lichy new com than seven liters 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.299
 say and write 2 liters above the factory 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:24.189
 Small is not a little mobile and that is not enough for the rival BMW x3 2 4 0 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:27.189
 think 

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:34.579
 as a true off-roader the Antara was certainly not built as well as 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.659
 most of his competitors 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.659
 he has no differential locks and no terrain reduction 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:44.709
 20 centimeters of ground clearance and a book sprung suspension same 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.709
 Bumps in the self-supporting body look good 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.499
 the four-wheel drive is only switched on when needed and can be infinitely variable 

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:55.499
 Send 50 percent of the drive power to the rear axle 

00:03:56.259 --> 00:04:00.159
 the sturdy protective strips in front and at the sides would be rockfalls 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:03.159
 from 

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:08.899
 because even the SP and Anne Berg decelerate belong to the scope of delivery 

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:12.289
 the day after one of the safest SUVs on the market 

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:15.289
 as long as the driver stays away from heavy terrain 

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:20.609
 the Russelsheimer have at least made every effort the soft tissue like 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.309
 to appear more than ever as Opel 

00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:26.539
 with this one interior and driving behavior they succeeded in doing so 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:29.769
 the rather loud engines that come from the Chevrolet Captiva was from 

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:31.650
 impossible in the first place 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.990
 the engine is due to its bad on the weak spot in the Opel 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:41.869
 so the Antara remains a compliant a fancier and everyday use Allradler 

00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:45.830
 on the one hand a not so bad Opel on the other side
