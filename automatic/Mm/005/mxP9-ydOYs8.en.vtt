00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 the guys alright but bring games 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:10.309
 my breasts a daily analysis of the wait 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.309
 up to two ultra annual 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.930
 The first highlight of it is that it is a 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.570
 ahead of six inches of sony from the 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.210
 chip with his name already said and that has 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.430
 a 3 megapixel camera with a flash 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.279
 button dedicated to it also its tightening 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.630
 those already start the camera and a social 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.180
 for you now that she has the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.280
 legal effects is also that I am 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.920
 showing some effects she has to 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.070
 You're the right time to choose from 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.260
 here and he takes a part of the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.320
 the screen being filmed is not that it 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.620
 is looking to take pictures and he also 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.610
 makes it a very cool scenario for 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.350
 you use 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.719
 besides we have this other effect 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.770
 here I do not even use the camera 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.359
 and it has good effects. 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.309
 Weird legal at the same time as 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.530
 You're going to see another one that I'm 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.720
 passing here from the side and if I put 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.119
 here in classic for example he 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.360
 leaves with make it here but 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.970
 for the girls of course but you can 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.680
 We do some cool things here. 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.820
 another legal effect that we have 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.790
 paulo shift hoax that I take a photo 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.619
 here the squeeze and he takes several photos to the 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.409
 same time and we can choose the 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.750
 better and here you are seeing design 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.470
 it being pretty well is also very thin 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.810
 and finished in black piano behind 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.150
 the only negative point of this is that it 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.640
 It is full of fingerprints to the screen 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.220
 You can see the marks there. 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.979
 a very easy to clean screen behind 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.290
 worse it gets full of brand even in the 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.530
 black piano but it's nothing to bother 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.630
 no negative point is just something that gives 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.270
 I work there too. 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.219
 another highlight of him is that behind him 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.799
 there's a sound bar I can 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.020
 show you closer now that 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.469
 It has a very strong sound and I'm going to show it 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.509
 for you a potential of her with the game 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.420
 that I found the sky force that it goes 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.580
 help too 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.599
 show the full potential of the processor 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:19.000
 quadcore it has 1.4 ghz and 1 gb 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.190
 ram memory and we are giving a 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.620
 continue here in the game I'll show you 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.830
 you as he is fluid is not a limit 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.650
 so heavy, but it requires a lot 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.800
 the processor and graphics and there 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.410
 underneath the water is quite perfect nÃ© port 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.239
 enough and now I'm going to increase here 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.430
 side when we are authorities goal 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:43.830
 motion and give the man time to 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.830
 you hear the potential of his sound 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.260
 Finding his screen for you with 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.239
 details now is a hd screen of 6 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.970
 inch as she had already said but she 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.950
 counts on the technology bravia trillo - 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.890
 which gives much more detail 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.290
 the screen is very good, or just wait 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.810
 up to two other dual is a well manufacturer 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.269
 great with the good big name but also 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.670
 with a very affordable price he can 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.010
 be a rocket with all features 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.690
 had speeches they must have even surpassed 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.609
 some expectations 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.130
 even so she has a very good price 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.720
 I personally really liked him. 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.630
