00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.509
 according to the medical college a report 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.000
 Audit of the box reveals 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.530
 deficiencies in specialties and asks 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.530
 explanations to the path 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.039
 the alarm has been on for 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.240
 several years and still do not look good 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.609
 results on the subject of 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.470
 specialists already heads more than 1,000 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.460
 doctors who will stick to the function in 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.739
 three years 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.360
 touring in that eleven has the last 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:32.460
 House audit report on 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.710
 the specialties mainly in 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.269
 radiotherapy and emphasizes the bad 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.800
 administration of cen days during 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:39.660
 previous address of doctor daniel 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.420
 rodrÃ­guez 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.330
 and that report in general what it says is 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.670
 that there is bad planning that does not 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.739
 there is a coordination between paths and 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.850
 university of costa rica here I do not 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.050
 I'm saying that the university of 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.500
 Costa Rica should not train specialists 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.989
 not us what I'm saying is that 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.340
 if you have the ability to form 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.350
 this service just like the university 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.430
 of costa rica and then that report what 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:09.180
 that leaves in to see clearly is that 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.979
 it draws attention that you have to take 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.320
 actions on administrative startup 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.810
 because they are practically not 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.759
 controlling the quality of training 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.320
 of the specialists the same the 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.940
 university cost less would be 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.930
 retiring in the next three years 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:28.649
 about 1500 doctors just under 800 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.140
 they are specialists then we are before 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.180
 a serious crisis because the specialist 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.670
 can not be formed in a week are 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.280
 minimum of four years the measures 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.740
 urgent needs to be taken today so that 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.050
 within four years we have the 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.910
 minimum amount of those who retire 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.140
 unofficially we got a part 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.909
 of the omitted report 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.710
 original where another of the 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.840
 points that the audit requested that 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.729
 corrected indicate that the box should 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.470
 Request explanations from the former director 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.360
 of sendai daniel rodrÃ­guez on the 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.220
 performances of officials 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.869
 responsible for ensuring the effective 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.000
 execution of the agreement signed between the 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.250
 house and the university of costa rica for 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.290
 the training of specialists according to 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.530
 data of the current director Ã¡lvaro salas 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:14.160
 the missing of 1,248 specialists and 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.350
 we are working to have them in 2015 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.780
 the deficit of specialists feels 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.910
 much what people often 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.910
 requires cardiology 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:28.659
 endocrinology orthopedics surgery 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:30.489
 etcetera of waiting lists is not 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:32.739
 They make you wait for an appointment like 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.719
 a surgery currently at 53 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.609
 specialties and subspecialties that 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:38.560
 there is neurosurgery that lasts the longest 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:40.030
 6 in total for this August is expected 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.950
 that 200 doctors already have their 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.700
 specialty and start a contest for 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.700
 81 seats
