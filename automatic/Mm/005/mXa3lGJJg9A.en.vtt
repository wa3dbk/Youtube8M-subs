00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.540
 in the collection with the has a lot that 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.090
 see with the artistic movements that 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.590
 they arose at the beginning of the 20th century is 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.210
 a time when art breaks with 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.910
 everything established and movements arise 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.610
 like neoplasticism cubism or the 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.800
 suprematism are movements that assume 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.840
 the true cultural revolution 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.550
 we are not talking only about painting 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.739
 these new trends that praise in 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.809
 other disciplines such as architecture and 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.460
 the design an example within the 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.230
 neoplasticism is like the architect 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.629
 riet vell led to the three dimensions 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.890
 mondrian pictures creating 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.890
 interior buildings 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.699
 our collection is based on the 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.339
 suprematism that arose with the works of 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.379
 malÃ©vich and also some aspects of the 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:05.750
 cubism and classicism this movement 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.790
 promoted a geometric simplicity 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.060
 eliminating all the remaining elements 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.250
 and getting very simple shapes and 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.440
 very strong the result that 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.420
 we sought was to create the visual illusion 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.630
 that these wood blocks these 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.910
 geometric bodies were cut and they 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.670
 overlapping each other for this we generated 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.050
 several modules to be able to get 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.180
 very varied compositions 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.460
 we have accentuated the depth that there is 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.620
 among them using different lathes 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.780
 of varnish that we have dedicated an effort 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.910
 very big to get the three shades of 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.010
 most suitable wood especially to 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.800
 get also a superficial appearance 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.420
 The most natural thing possible for us is 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.770
 fundamental that is when you are 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.170
 passing his hand over the furniture 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.170
 feel that you are touching natural wood 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.909
 i 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.090
 within the proposed compositions 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.710
 initially we have reached the 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.140
 Selection shown in the catalog 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.819
 we try to cover different needs 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.010
 for most users 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:15.420
 definitive are different queues that are 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.420
 adapt to any user 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.370
 little by little we were realizing 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.260
 the great strength that this had 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.930
 collection and that we could design more 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.060
 elements to accompany that 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.710
 they were completing the collection in their 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.070
 crack the protagonism the compositions 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.410
 behind 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.870
 in this national way the objects like 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.850
 a table and dining chair with sofa its 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.780
 armchair of luck can work for 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:41.650
 Independently to parador tables 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.650
 inclusion center 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.480
 is so based on art that we can 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.390
 say the final result was halfway 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.100
 path between art and design is not 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.110
 it's not a sculpture it's an object 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.490
 like a sculpture is a collection 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.490
 complex based on simplicity 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.470
 do not 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.930
 i 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.930
 yes 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.930
 and
