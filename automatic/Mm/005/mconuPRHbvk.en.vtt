landscaping here I just think it looks
perfect<00:02:27.280> but<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:28.430> is<00:02:28.519> too<00:02:28.700> selfish<00:02:29.150> but<00:02:29.360> that

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
perfect but it is too selfish but that

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.150 
perfect but it is too selfish but that
allowed<00:02:30.440> to<00:02:30.620> say<00:02:30.830> that<00:02:32.350> there's<00:02:33.350> a<00:02:33.500> bunker<00:02:33.709> it

allowed to say that there's a bunker it
works<00:02:34.549> brown<00:02:36.910> but<00:02:37.910> it<00:02:38.060> does<00:02:38.269> this<00:02:38.690> left<00:02:38.870> overs

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
works brown but it does this left overs

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.530
