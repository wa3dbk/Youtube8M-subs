 lee 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.680
 this factory is the most important 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.390
 for kraft in terms of pastry 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.250
 industrial and we have four lines of 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.920
 production so in factory here the bread 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.900
 prosperous spice van damme 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.680
 we also make everything that is mini 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:43.530
 roll and the famous him the bear with 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.239
 a novelty that came out on 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.470
 this same production line that is 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.470
 the croll milk hacker 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.740
 it's a real success that is not denied 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.570
 because in January of this year we 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.580
 produced 0 tons at the end of this 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.720
 year we will produce 1200 tons and 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.300
 next year we are going very 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.300
 certainly exceed 2000 tons 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.409
 in a few figures 1 factory is more 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.210
 12000 tonnes of cakes produced by 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.979
 year then twelve thousand tons is a little 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.720
 abstract I just gave you a 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.390
 number is the number of options 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.729
 manufactures in one hour is 31 min 31 me 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.360
 for his 7 days out of 7 are made to 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.360
 besançon 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.680
 besano's factory has enough pride of 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.350
 able to produce cakes of very 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.690
 high quality with his collaborators 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.520
 who are present every day since 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.120
 many years is again not 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.620
 average 5 to 10 per year for 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.610
 make good products that 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.730
 correspond to the tastes of 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.730
 consumers 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.890
 and so we set up what we 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.530
 call the trades workshop where we go 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.780
 to have old ones we will help them 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.730
 formalize their know-how and to 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.519
 better forward it tomorrow is 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.519
 today for young people 40 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.750
 the milk to anyone shock and a cake 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.599
 which will not be sold in France 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.150
 but also in germany in austria at 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.760
 portugal in italy in spain so 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.120
 really the besançon factory with its 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.640
 collaborators is at the heart of 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.640
 kraft group strategy in French 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.920
 I believe that in these times of God we 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.250
 regularly hears bad 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.890
 new 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.960
 we still need to continue 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.120
 pleasure and do not hesitate to eat so 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.130
 all the cakes that can be produced at 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.220
 within besançon and brings a little bit of 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.220
 softness 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.720
 or
