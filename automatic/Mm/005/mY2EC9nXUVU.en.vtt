00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.250
 Hello everyone, windows 8 channel and you 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.350
 the topic of today's video lesson is like 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.180
 restore windows 8 system for 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.430
 restore windows 8 system to 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.869
 there are two ways one way is 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.000
 restore from restore point 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.460
 which we previously created in 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.080
 the system itself and the second way is 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.080
 external recovery 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.789
 bootable disk or bootable 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.680
 flash drives and so we consider the first 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.180
 recovery from point option 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.300
 recovery in order for it 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.030
 run and hover over 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.760
 pen and click the right button 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.059
 mice choose point system here we are 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.100
 we select the system protection and then we 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.499
 First we select the drive we want. 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.710
 restore but system respectively 

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:56.659
 while system recovery should 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.559
 be included with us it can be done 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:59.690
 tuning 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.280
 exclude system protection so that the system 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.330
 could create points herself 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.430
 restore and store them select 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:12.530
 here the amount of memory allocated for 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:16.009
 storage here and also can manually point 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.380
 recovery create if we do all this 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.509
 set up then we just press restore 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.909
 click next select point here 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.939
 restore which we can click 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.080
 far and after that we press ready and 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.710
 system 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.030
 automatically start the process 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.460
 recovery after which on 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.070
 will reboot and 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.160
 who will come the state in which it was 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.530
 Now this number and here now in this time, 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.390
 there is actually this 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.950
 point recovery 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.910
 restore it all happens very much 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.130
 just no data of yours 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.530
 some may suffer 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.120
 programs that have already been installed 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.430
 after the 15th day 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.630
 that is, after creating this point but all 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:03.070
 what was up will remain intact and 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.310
 so it was the first way the second way 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.179
 this is recovery using external 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.710
 usb drive or cd with 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.410
 installation windows for this 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.420
 we hover the mouse right top 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.030
 a corner of us opens a popup menu 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.740
 we select here the parameters further we choose 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.390
 change computer settings 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.400
 Next, select the update and 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.890
 recovery and here we choose 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.570
 recovery recovery point we 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.220
 we choose not the highest 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.470
 restore your computer without deleting 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.330
 file actually there are three 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.120
 options 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:44.860
 the choice but the choice you choose the very first 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:48.880
 and here the system will offer us to install 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.680
 carrier to be used 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.120
 recovery system as a rule 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.360
 this is either a cd or 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.520
 usb flash drive with windows 8 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.970
 that is, you connect it to a computer and 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.550
 further follow the prompts that go 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:09.300
 on the screen after which the computer will 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:13.480
 recover already from of 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:17.290
 this external drive on which 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.780
 you have an image with some 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.330
 programs can be 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.310
 Well, as if coal is lost and we, that is, we 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.840
 the program installed some and on 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:31.180
 path for example these programs can be 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.640
 That is, what is this photo video data 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.190
 so they may not be affected and 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:40.300
 new programs that installed them 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:43.030
 will have to be reinstalled here 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.489
 Basically, this is all about the process. 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.610
 recovery windows with you was the channel 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.230
 about windows 8 all for now and remember that 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.700
 any problem can be solved 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.700
 the main thing is to know how
