over 10 megabits per second on a CMT in
the<00:04:11.609> city<00:04:11.849> so<00:04:12.569> that's<00:04:12.780> something<00:04:12.989> to<00:04:13.109> keep<00:04:13.199> in

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
saturated you know I've got a bunch of

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.150 
saturated you know I've got a bunch of
people<00:04:29.720> on<00:04:29.960> LTE<00:04:30.290> they<00:04:30.500> kind<00:04:30.650> of<00:04:30.680> migrated

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
people on LTE they kind of migrated

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.430 
people on LTE they kind of migrated
quickly<00:04:31.490> both<00:04:31.940> carriers<00:04:32.360> tell<00:04:32.660> me<00:04:32.810> that<00:04:33.350> in

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
quickly both carriers tell me that in

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.409 
quickly both carriers tell me that in
the<00:04:33.500> charlie<00:04:33.770> metro<00:04:33.919> area<00:04:34.340> they<00:04:35.000> might<00:04:35.210> create

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
the charlie metro area they might create

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.300 
the charlie metro area they might create
a<00:04:35.450> relatively<00:04:35.870> quickly<00:04:36.200> so<00:04:36.500> that's<00:04:36.680> over<00:04:37.220> to

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
a relatively quickly so that's over to

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.220 
a relatively quickly so that's over to
LTE<00:04:37.610> so<00:04:37.880> that's<00:04:38.000> something<00:04:38.210> to<00:04:38.540> keep<00:04:39.020> in<00:04:39.169> mind

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
LTE so that's something to keep in mind

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.420 
LTE so that's something to keep in mind
now<00:04:39.470> let's<00:04:39.620> look<00:04:39.680> at<00:04:39.830> the<00:04:39.889> camera<00:04:40.220> here<00:04:40.340> you

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
now let's look at the camera here you

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.090 
now let's look at the camera here you
get<00:04:40.520> an<00:04:40.580> eight<00:04:40.700> megapixel<00:04:40.850> camera<00:04:41.570> with<00:04:41.600> 1080p

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
get an eight megapixel camera with 1080p

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.530 
get an eight megapixel camera with 1080p
HD<00:04:43.100> video<00:04:43.220> recording<00:04:43.730> not<00:04:44.210> going<00:04:44.330> to<00:04:44.389> be<00:04:44.450> the

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
HD video recording not going to be the

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.610 
HD video recording not going to be the
best<00:04:44.660> in<00:04:44.780> the<00:04:44.900> world<00:04:44.990> especially<00:04:45.260> when<00:04:45.560> you

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
best in the world especially when you

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.840 
best in the world especially when you
look<00:04:45.710> at<00:04:45.860> some<00:04:45.980> of<00:04:46.040> the<00:04:46.130> devices<00:04:46.310> and<00:04:46.669> I<00:04:46.700> know<00:04:46.760> I

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
look at some of the devices and I know I

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.280 
look at some of the devices and I know I
keep<00:04:47.030> referencing<00:04:47.300> these<00:04:47.720> two<00:04:47.900> but<00:04:48.050> these<00:04:48.169> are

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
keep referencing these two but these are

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.379 
keep referencing these two but these are
the<00:04:48.320> two<00:04:48.470> kind<00:04:48.680> of<00:04:48.740> flagships<00:04:49.430> right<00:04:50.060> now<00:04:50.330> the

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
the two kind of flagships right now the

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.280 
the two kind of flagships right now the
one<00:04:50.780> x<00:04:51.020> /<00:04:51.710> evo<00:04:52.130> 4g<00:04:52.550> LTE<00:04:52.910> in<00:04:53.300> terms<00:04:53.690> of<00:04:53.810> camera

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
one x / evo 4g LTE in terms of camera

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.280 
one x / evo 4g LTE in terms of camera
and<00:04:54.410> then<00:04:54.710> the<00:04:54.800> galaxy<00:04:55.160> s3<00:04:55.700> and<00:04:56.630> you<00:04:57.110> know<00:04:57.200> for

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
and then the galaxy s3 and you know for

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.870 
and then the galaxy s3 and you know for
the<00:04:57.320> most<00:04:57.380> part<00:04:57.590> both<00:04:57.800> of<00:04:57.919> those<00:04:58.040> are<00:04:58.310> killer

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
the most part both of those are killer

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.700 
the most part both of those are killer
devices<00:04:59.510> with<00:04:59.690> some<00:04:59.810> killer<00:05:00.020> camera<00:05:00.410> settings

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
devices with some killer camera settings

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.170 
devices with some killer camera settings
this<00:05:01.040> one's<00:05:01.220> okay<00:05:01.340> it's<00:05:01.669> not<00:05:01.730> the<00:05:01.850> best<00:05:01.940> in<00:05:02.120> the

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
this one's okay it's not the best in the

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.370 
this one's okay it's not the best in the
world<00:05:02.300> next<00:05:02.570> time<00:05:02.750> I<00:05:02.810> bring<00:05:02.990> over<00:05:03.169> the<00:05:03.260> galaxy

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380

world next time I bring over the galaxy
s3<00:05:03.919> that<00:05:04.070> I<00:05:04.100> have<00:05:04.220> laying<00:05:04.490> right<00:05:04.640> here<00:05:04.700> so<00:05:04.880> we

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
s3 that I have laying right here so we

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.580 
s3 that I have laying right here so we
can<00:05:05.090> do<00:05:05.660> something<00:05:05.840> like<00:05:05.990> the<00:05:06.050> sprint<00:05:06.320> logo

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
can do something like the sprint logo

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.320 
can do something like the sprint logo
take<00:05:06.770> a<00:05:06.800> look<00:05:07.040> at<00:05:07.100> it<00:05:07.130> where<00:05:07.880> you<00:05:08.000> do<00:05:08.120> see<00:05:08.300> a

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
take a look at it where you do see a

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.390 
take a look at it where you do see a
benefit<00:05:08.660> here<00:05:08.810> really<00:05:09.080> beautiful<00:05:09.560> HD<00:05:09.980> display

and of course I've got this front logo
that<00:05:12.320> I<00:05:12.350> just<00:05:12.530> took<00:05:12.620> a<00:05:12.680> picture<00:05:12.890> of<00:05:13.160> and<00:05:13.430> you

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
that I just took a picture of and you

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.610 
that I just took a picture of and you
can<00:05:14.000> see<00:05:14.210> relatively<00:05:14.930> clear<00:05:15.200> not<00:05:15.350> clear<00:05:15.590> right

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
can see relatively clear not clear right

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.670 
can see relatively clear not clear right
now<00:05:15.740> will<00:05:16.040> sleep<00:05:16.190> or<00:05:16.370> to<00:05:16.460> load<00:05:16.669> there<00:05:17.210> we<00:05:17.390> go

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
now will sleep or to load there we go

brothel clear zoomed in you can really

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.460 
brothel clear zoomed in you can really
see<00:05:20.120> and<00:05:20.419> it's<00:05:20.570> pretty<00:05:20.750> decent<00:05:20.930> you<00:05:21.169> can<00:05:21.320> see

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
see and it's pretty decent you can see

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.900 
see and it's pretty decent you can see
kind<00:05:21.650> of<00:05:21.770> even<00:05:21.919> the<00:05:22.010> granular<00:05:22.460> stuff<00:05:22.729> like

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
kind of even the granular stuff like

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.670 
kind of even the granular stuff like
little<00:05:23.150> specks<00:05:23.450> of<00:05:23.600> dirt<00:05:23.840> on<00:05:24.080> the<00:05:24.500> back<00:05:24.650> of

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
little specks of dirt on the back of

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.129 
little specks of dirt on the back of
this<00:05:24.950> white<00:05:25.220> case<00:05:25.580> and<00:05:26.030> overall<00:05:26.960> that's

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:27.139 
this white case and overall that's

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:29.350 
this white case and overall that's
relatively<00:05:27.760> impressive<00:05:28.760> so<00:05:28.880> a<00:05:28.910> decent<00:05:29.270> camera

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
relatively impressive so a decent camera
