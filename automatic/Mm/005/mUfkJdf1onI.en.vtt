Wi-Fi<00:02:54.450> range<00:02:54.720> of<00:02:54.990> the<00:02:55.709> era<00:02:56.160> trunk<00:02:56.700> 2.0<00:02:57.360> is<00:02:57.450> very

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
Wi-Fi range of the era trunk 2.0 is very

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.490 
Wi-Fi range of the era trunk 2.0 is very
very<00:02:57.990> limited<00:02:58.370> then<00:02:59.370> some<00:02:59.670> of<00:02:59.820> you<00:02:59.940> has

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
very limited then some of you has

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.559 
very limited then some of you has
suggested<00:03:01.500> that<00:03:01.560> getting<00:03:02.130> an<00:03:02.310> Wi-Fi<00:03:03.090> range

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
suggested that getting an Wi-Fi range

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.650 
suggested that getting an Wi-Fi range
extender<00:03:04.190> can<00:03:05.190> boost<00:03:05.430> up<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.790> range<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.300> up<00:03:06.480> to

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
extender can boost up the range to up to

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:13.190 
extender can boost up the range to up to
you<00:03:07.010> 1000<00:03:08.010> feet<00:03:08.810> so<00:03:09.810> I<00:03:11.150> have<00:03:12.150> here<00:03:12.480> with<00:03:12.690> me<00:03:12.959> is

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
HW r en to range extender Pro I will

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.870 
HW r en to range extender Pro I will
give<00:03:33.490> it<00:03:33.670> a<00:03:33.790> try

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
give it a try

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:45.970 
give it a try
report<00:03:36.880> to<00:03:37.330> you<00:03:37.480> guys

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980
