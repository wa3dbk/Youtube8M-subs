00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
million and then 100 years later how

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.670 
million and then 100 years later how
many<00:00:46.180> probably<00:00:47.180> around<00:00:47.510> a<00:00:47.600> thousand<00:00:47.989> or<00:00:48.110> so<00:00:48.290> so

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
many probably around a thousand or so so

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.439 
many probably around a thousand or so so
they<00:00:48.830> came<00:00:49.309> very<00:00:49.489> close<00:00:49.730> to<00:00:49.820> being<00:00:49.940> extinct

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
they came very close to being extinct

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.350 
they came very close to being extinct
very<00:00:50.690> close<00:00:50.930> yes<00:00:51.199> you<00:00:51.530> have<00:00:51.680> a<00:00:51.710> large<00:00:52.670> holding

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
very close yes you have a large holding

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.360 
very close yes you have a large holding
facility<00:00:53.900> yes<00:00:54.110> because<00:00:54.530> what<00:00:54.860> happens<00:00:55.190> here

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
facility yes because what happens here

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.150 
facility yes because what happens here
is<00:00:55.489> you<00:00:55.670> raise<00:00:56.210> the<00:00:56.480> Bison<00:00:56.870> wild<00:00:57.440> and<00:00:57.590> then<00:00:57.920> you

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
is you raise the Bison wild and then you

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.799 
is you raise the Bison wild and then you
disperse<00:00:58.699> them<00:00:59.000> around<00:00:59.180> the<00:00:59.390> earth<00:00:59.510> is<00:00:59.780> that

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
disperse them around the earth is that

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.119 
disperse them around the earth is that
correct<00:01:00.170> that's<00:01:00.379> correct<00:01:00.500> so<00:01:00.920> we're<00:01:01.040> gonna
