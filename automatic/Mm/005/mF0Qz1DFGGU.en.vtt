 gambling presents 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.760
 [music] 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:23.540
 assassin's creed 3 liberation 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.369
 released on playstation vita towards the end 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:29.040
 2012 was probably one of 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.520
 The most ambiguous parts of the famous 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.590
 series 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.960
 in yubisoft promised to create you 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.660
 assassin's creed full gameplay 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.270
 portable console and promise in 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.149
 Generally kept back however the game was 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.160
 overflowed with bugs which franchise 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.430
 seemingly stepped back in times 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.260
 the second part however on sony's prototype 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.320
 that time was for the most part 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.600
 beggar and the game sold a good circulation 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.420
 largely due to this 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.140
 Yubisoft decided to move the game to large 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.450
 platforms 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.970
 promising to correct the main disadvantages 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.519
 besides muddy graphics and project 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.189
 abounded in gods and problems with sound 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.110
 plus a boring plot and monotonous 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.760
 tasks 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.230
 overcome old diseases to developers 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.810
 only partially succeeded 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.380
 graphics really lifted to new 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.540
 level 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.170
 coming close to the third part 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.960
 so the hd prefix game is quite 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.060
 deserved besides high resolution 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.640
 texture developers and serious 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.740
 changed the color palette so that 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.240
 the game world no longer looks like this 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.410
 gray and depressed but many 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.110
 characters 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:44.020
 despite the new textures remained 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.170
 square with updated surroundings they 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.610
 contrasted very noticeably disappearing 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.460
 the sound is also overcome 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.680
 can not you say about other mistakes heroine 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.530
 can still suddenly go under 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.160
 the ground get stuck in the wall or float by 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.800
 to air 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.590
 but now at least the frame rate is not 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.229
 however, many players fail 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.290
 would be willing to endure but that is boring 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.869
 the plot is hardly with this developers too 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:14.019
 planned to handle adding tasks 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.940
 who plug holes in the whole script 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.910
 the story of course remains the same 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.790
 still new 18th century orleans 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.580
 still plentiful as a daughter of a slave and 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.180
 noble lord is still fighting for 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.310
 freedom of the black population of america 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.160
 version for the species sinned illogical 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.680
 building stories of Avellino in the fight for 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.410
 slave freedom was actually practiced 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.519
 It is not clear how she helped her father in 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.610
 doing business 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.080
 eliminated competitors helped 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.590
 smugglers in the swamps got into 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.850
 political intrigue and only occasionally 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.250
 contributed to the escape from the plantation 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.910
 a couple of other slaves from the next 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.400
 grandees 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.100
 yes and traditional confrontation 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.440
 asasinov and templar in the game almost not 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.190
 there were additional tasks not 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.440
 corrected 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.049
 and it is impossible to fix as a whole 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.200
 bad pair scenarios and fresh missions 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.790
 look for these missions with a magnifying glass yes 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.549
 and especially interesting 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.219
 call it all too snooping and long 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:18.069
 running around the city in the rest of the same game 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:20.890
 Changes have not undergone retaining and pluses 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.469
 and cons plan and kill key 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.409
 opponents are interested in this in a series not 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:29.170
 take away and now engage in parkour in the new 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:31.750
 Orleans are almost entirely composed 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.689
 from the two-story wooden boxes boring 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.450
 change the mask pretending to be a slave 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:40.180
 penetrate the plantation and the secular ladies 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.879
 to get to the ball it captures 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.709
 and perform side quests as before 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:47.620
 bothers after an hour 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.889
 game like 2 years ago can not be called 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.989
 bad but today amid a huge and 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:55.209
 polished assassin's creed 4 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.939
 liberation loses frankly 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:01.030
 the modest size of the world no matter how not cool 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:03.359
 go to no comparison with scale 4 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.359
 part 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.419
