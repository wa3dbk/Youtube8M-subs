00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
good and it's probably the best time to

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:36.229 
good and it's probably the best time to
fly<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.619> got<00:00:28.769> my<00:00:28.859> battery<00:00:29.279> in<00:00:29.400> there<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:35.239> got

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.030 
fly so I got my battery in there I got
my<00:00:37.399> dual<00:00:38.399> rates<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.730> Expo<00:00:38.969> down<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.360> 60<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.590> my

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
my dual rates and Expo down to 60 and my

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.819 
my dual rates and Expo down to 60 and my
Expo<00:00:41.579> at<00:00:41.879> 35<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:42.840> I've<00:00:42.960> dumbed<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.320> down<00:00:43.379> pretty

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
Expo at 35 so I've dumbed it down pretty

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.180 
Expo at 35 so I've dumbed it down pretty
good<00:00:44.390> cuz<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.350> first<00:00:46.590> flight<00:00:46.860> I

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
good cuz this is the first flight I

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.670 
good cuz this is the first flight I
think<00:00:47.969> normally<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.570> should<00:00:48.690> have<00:00:48.840> be<00:00:48.960> at<00:00:49.050> 70

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
think normally you should have be at 70

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.569 
think normally you should have be at 70
at<00:00:50.280> low<00:00:50.520> rate<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.239> hundred<00:00:51.719> at<00:00:52.399> four<00:00:53.399> eight

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
at low rate and a hundred at four eight

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.740 
at low rate and a hundred at four eight
and<00:00:54.199> my<00:00:55.199> bad<00:00:55.559> replacement<00:00:56.420> I'm<00:00:57.420> going<00:00:57.690> a

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
little up this way because apparently if

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.470
