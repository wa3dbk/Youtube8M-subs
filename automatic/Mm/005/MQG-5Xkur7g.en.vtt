six<00:03:20.849> episodes<00:03:21.239> I<00:03:21.510> believe<00:03:23.090> and<00:03:24.090> here's<00:03:24.599> this<00:03:24.810> -

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
six episodes I believe and here's this -

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.309 
six episodes I believe and here's this -
nice<00:03:25.859> that<00:03:26.069> they<00:03:26.160> have<00:03:26.269> you<00:03:27.269> know<00:03:27.389> part<00:03:28.109> work

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
nice that they have you know part work

on<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.739> disc<00:03:28.919> itself<00:03:29.250> not<00:03:29.489> like<00:03:29.639> Paramount's

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
on the disc itself not like Paramount's

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.770 
on the disc itself not like Paramount's
but<00:03:31.579> it's<00:03:32.579> probably<00:03:32.879> more<00:03:33.090> expensive<00:03:33.269> to<00:03:33.660> do

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
but it's probably more expensive to do

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.839 
but it's probably more expensive to do
