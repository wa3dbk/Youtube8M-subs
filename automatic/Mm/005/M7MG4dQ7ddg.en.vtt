00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.819
 The appendixes are stories of people who claim to have been kidnapped by 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:09.979
 bear crew 

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:13.189
 usually those responsible for those actions 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:15.929
 they carefully select their victims 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.460
 and to top it up they submit it to a follow-up 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.460
 from the earliest age 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.050
 many of the alleged abductees are 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.929
 days later they will be used as 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:29.179
 rental mothers 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.640
 and it's a veto will disappear after a few weeks 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.640
 for hygiene surprise placed 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.120
 a typical case of both 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.370
 is to go arm 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.760
 protagonist of him 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.750
 who claimed to have been employed as 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.730
 his mother rented nine times 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.080
 as the fetus said precociously distracted 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.310
 he was taken to the planet of his kidnappers with the aim of creating 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.990
 a hybrid race 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.870
 that ensure the survival of your species 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.940
 idea that subscribes completely the Spanish investigator Antonio Rivera 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.100
 that explain in this way the accused interest in genetics that 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.100
 Show visitors during the assault 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.170
 It also seems to corroborate this fact what the specialist pointed jobs who 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.170
 it is called presentation ceremony 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.950
 it's a second hijacking showing jalapos been 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.060
 a girl generally of human aspect 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.350
 fruit of the 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.880
 previous genetic experimentation and what the act immediately identifies as 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.920
 already worthy recognized world specialist in matters govern 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.030
 I think these experiences are part of a system of 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.640
 and it has an effect on our system 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.800
 of beliefs 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.550
 influencing what we call 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.270
 our spiritual life 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.450
 as a fence mechanism for the development of human intelligence 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.710
 this is the goal 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.710
 or on the contrary there is a second intention 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.230
 an extraterrestrial invasion of camps 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.109
 I think it's soon 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:12.060
 we will know the network
