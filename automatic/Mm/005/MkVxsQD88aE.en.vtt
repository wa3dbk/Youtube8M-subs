00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
tight on the horse's leg it's tight but

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.039 
tight on the horse's leg it's tight but
it's<00:01:37.950> not<00:01:38.070> too<00:01:38.280> tight<00:01:38.520> because<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:39.630> can<00:01:39.840> just

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
it's not too tight because you can just

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.649

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
actually pull it you can see that it

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.170 
actually pull it you can see that it
moves<00:01:42.990> away<00:01:43.170> gets<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.799> lot<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.009> gift<00:01:44.399> all<00:01:44.970> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
moves away gets a lot of gift all the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.300 
moves away gets a lot of gift all the
material<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.659> perforated<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.860> it's<00:01:47.070> real

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
material is perforated and it's real

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.429 
material is perforated and it's real
flexible<00:01:47.820> that's<00:01:48.030> why<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.240> boots<00:01:49.110> are<00:01:49.290> so

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
flexible that's why the boots are so

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.870
