00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.819 

at<00:00:00.510> this<00:00:00.719> point<00:00:00.930> we've<00:00:01.140> named<00:00:01.439> all<00:00:01.650> of<00:00:01.680> the

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
at this point we've named all of the

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.740 
at this point we've named all of the
bones<00:00:01.979> in<00:00:02.159> our<00:00:02.250> armature<00:00:02.639> and<00:00:03.000> I've<00:00:03.449> switched

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
bones in our armature and I've switched

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.200 
bones in our armature and I've switched
back<00:00:04.020> to<00:00:04.049> the<00:00:04.319> object<00:00:04.440> mode<00:00:05.009> one<00:00:06.000> thing<00:00:06.150> that's

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
back to the object mode one thing that's

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.639 
back to the object mode one thing that's
worth<00:00:06.420> checking<00:00:06.960> at<00:00:07.020> this<00:00:07.140> point<00:00:07.350> is<00:00:07.470> what

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
worth checking at this point is what

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.410 
worth checking at this point is what
exactly<00:00:08.099> is<00:00:08.189> your<00:00:08.250> armature<00:00:08.580> name<00:00:09.000> if<00:00:09.300> you

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
exactly is your armature name if you

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.810 
exactly is your armature name if you
look<00:00:09.570> at<00:00:09.719> in<00:00:09.840> links<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.200> materials<00:00:10.820> you'll

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
look at in links and materials you'll

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.230 
look at in links and materials you'll
see<00:00:12.090> that<00:00:12.300> it<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:13.370> is<00:00:14.370> something<00:00:14.969> that<00:00:15.059> can

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
see that it is is something that can

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.040 
see that it is is something that can
call<00:00:15.389> OB<00:00:15.960> colon<00:00:16.590> armature<00:00:17.190> right<00:00:18.090> there<00:00:18.420> that

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
call OB colon armature right there that

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.939 
call OB colon armature right there that
is<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.500> name<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:20.220> your<00:00:20.730> armature<00:00:21.800> you<00:00:22.800> can

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
is the name of your armature you can

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.320 
is the name of your armature you can
leave<00:00:23.130> an<00:00:23.279> armature<00:00:23.550> for<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.880> purposes<00:00:24.269> of

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
leave an armature for the purposes of

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.599 
leave an armature for the purposes of
this<00:00:24.449> i'm<00:00:24.810> going<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.260> change<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.800> skeletons

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
this i'm going to change it to skeletons

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.730 
this i'm going to change it to skeletons
we<00:00:27.150> have<00:00:27.330> no<00:00:27.539> ambiguity<00:00:28.170> about<00:00:28.230> what's<00:00:28.560> going

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
we have no ambiguity about what's going

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.030 
we have no ambiguity about what's going
on<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.699> my<00:00:29.849> armature<00:00:30.300> now<00:00:30.779> named<00:00:31.080> skeleton<00:00:31.890> in

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
on so my armature now named skeleton in

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.520 
on so my armature now named skeleton in
fact<00:00:32.730> if<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.059> scroll<00:00:33.960> up<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.200> look<00:00:34.260> at<00:00:34.350> my

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
fact if you scroll up and look at my

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.110 
fact if you scroll up and look at my
outline<00:00:34.920> you'll<00:00:35.219> see<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.579> now<00:00:35.790> have<00:00:36.000> an

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
outline you'll see that I now have an

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.310 
outline you'll see that I now have an
object<00:00:36.480> called<00:00:36.660> skeleton<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.620> there<00:00:38.010> and

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
object called skeleton and there and

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.450 
object called skeleton and there and
it's<00:00:40.320> going<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.500> be<00:00:40.559> really<00:00:40.860> useful<00:00:41.100> about

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
it's going to be really useful about

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.580 
it's going to be really useful about
this<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.790> second<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.450> once<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:42.930> go<00:00:43.290> back<00:00:43.530> in

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
this in a second is once I go back in

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.959 
this in a second is once I go back in
here<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.250> select<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.969> body<00:00:45.710> the<00:00:46.710> body<00:00:46.969> is

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
here and select the body the body is

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.250 
here and select the body the body is
once<00:00:48.570> selected<00:00:48.870> needs<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:50.070> have<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:51.260> armature

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
once selected needs to have the armature

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.330 
once selected needs to have the armature
the<00:00:53.100> armature<00:00:53.640> are<00:00:54.590> attached<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.129> as<00:00:56.309> a

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
the armature are attached to it as a

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.010 
the armature are attached to it as a
modifier<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.300> I'm<00:00:57.390> going<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.629> go<00:00:57.750> down<00:00:57.989> and

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
modifier so I'm going to go down and

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.920 
modifier so I'm going to go down and
under<00:00:58.559> modifiers<00:00:59.160> I'm<00:00:59.640> going<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.690> add<00:01:00.870> a

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
under modifiers I'm going to add a

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.160 
under modifiers I'm going to add a
modifier<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:02.280> we<00:01:02.820> add<00:01:03.000> an<00:01:03.149> armature<00:01:03.570> modifies

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
modifier and we add an armature modifies

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.710 
modifier and we add an armature modifies
the<00:01:04.379> last<00:01:04.619> option<00:01:04.830> on<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> list<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.760> down

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
the last option on the list and down

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.390 
the last option on the list and down
here<00:01:06.990> remember<00:01:07.380> how<00:01:07.530> our<00:01:07.680> armatures<00:01:08.159> name

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
here remember how our armatures name

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.940 
here remember how our armatures name
started<00:01:08.790> off<00:01:08.880> kobe<00:01:09.390> i'm<00:01:10.260> actually<00:01:10.470> going<00:01:10.770> to

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
that was our hint right here that that

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.630 
that was our hint right here that that
was<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.140> name<00:01:13.290> we<00:01:13.320> wanted<00:01:13.619> remember<00:01:14.610> i

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
was the name we wanted remember i

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.450 
was the name we wanted remember i
renamed<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.530> skeleton<00:01:16.530> if<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:17.130> did<00:01:17.310> not

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
renamed it to skeleton if you did not

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.920 
renamed it to skeleton if you did not
rename<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.030> if<00:01:18.119> yours<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.420> still<00:01:18.570> just<00:01:18.720> named

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
rename it if yours is still just named

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.600 
rename it if yours is still just named
armature<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.530> would<00:01:19.650> type<00:01:19.770> armature<00:01:20.400> right

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
armature you would type armature right

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.100

objects<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.630> armature<00:01:55.140> actually<00:01:55.500> needs<00:01:55.649> to

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
objects the armature actually needs to

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.410 
objects the armature actually needs to
be<00:01:55.770> applauded<00:01:56.040> individually<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.939> each<00:01:56.969> of

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
be applauded individually to each of

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.240 
be applauded individually to each of
these<00:01:57.570> objects<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.770> I'm<00:01:58.860> actually<00:01:58.950> going<00:01:59.189> to

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
these objects so I'm actually going to

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.069 
these objects so I'm actually going to
go<00:01:59.310> ahead<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.880> as<00:02:00.450> an<00:02:00.540> example<00:02:00.780> where<00:02:00.899> I'm

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
go ahead and as an example where I'm

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.679 
go ahead and as an example where I'm
going<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.320> select<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.770> head<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.390> when<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.420> go

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
going to select the head and when I go

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.679 
going to select the head and when I go
back<00:02:03.869> down<00:02:04.110> here<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.070> head<00:02:05.399> I'm<00:02:06.299> going<00:02:06.630> to

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
back down here to the head I'm going to

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.270 
back down here to the head I'm going to
do<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.899> same<00:02:07.140> thing<00:02:07.380> again<00:02:07.619> I'm<00:02:07.799> going<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.009> add

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
do the same thing again I'm going to add

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.230 
do the same thing again I'm going to add
a<00:02:09.060> modifier<00:02:09.379> to<00:02:10.379> add<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.619> armature<00:02:11.370> modifier

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
a modifier to add that armature modifier

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.210 
a modifier to add that armature modifier
and<00:02:12.900> once<00:02:13.050> again<00:02:13.200> when<00:02:13.500> asked<00:02:13.680> I'm<00:02:13.890> going<00:02:14.100> to

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
and once again when asked I'm going to

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.370 
and once again when asked I'm going to
use<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.850> skeleton<00:02:15.570> armature<00:02:15.990> so<00:02:16.140> it's<00:02:16.260> the

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
use the skeleton armature so it's the

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.100 
use the skeleton armature so it's the
same<00:02:16.650> armature<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.850> attached<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.450> head<00:02:18.780> as

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
same armature is attached to the head as

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.830 
same armature is attached to the head as
is<00:02:19.770> attached<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.460> body<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:21.450> way<00:02:21.630> when<00:02:21.810> I

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
is attached to the body that way when I

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.990 
is attached to the body that way when I
move<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.350> head<00:02:22.590> it's<00:02:22.860> attached<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.490> body<00:02:23.700> and

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
move the head it's attached the body and

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.210 
move the head it's attached the body and
we're<00:02:24.120> all<00:02:24.240> happy<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:24.870> again<00:02:25.860> I'm<00:02:25.980> going<00:02:26.130> to

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
we're all happy and again I'm going to

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.340 
we're all happy and again I'm going to
turn<00:02:26.400> off<00:02:26.460> and<00:02:26.880> whoop<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:27.300> we<00:02:27.390> are<00:02:27.540> only<00:02:27.780> having

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
turn off and whoop so we are only having

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.800 
turn off and whoop so we are only having
this<00:02:28.620> move<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.640> head<00:02:29.760> using<00:02:29.970> vertex<00:02:30.480> groups

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
this move the head using vertex groups

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.080 
this move the head using vertex groups
and<00:02:31.650> I'll<00:02:31.800> do<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.070> same<00:02:32.400> thing<00:02:32.610> again<00:02:32.820> for

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
and I'll do the same thing again for

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.780 
and I'll do the same thing again for
both<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.480> feet<00:02:33.780> so<00:02:34.140> every<00:02:34.710> part<00:02:35.040> of<00:02:35.160> my<00:02:35.370> model

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
both the feet so every part of my model

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.040 
both the feet so every part of my model
is<00:02:36.200> modified<00:02:37.200> by<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:38.300> skeleton<00:02:39.300> armature<00:02:39.810> and

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
is modified by the skeleton armature and

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.410 
is modified by the skeleton armature and
the<00:02:40.890> next<00:02:41.070> thing<00:02:41.280> we'll<00:02:41.490> do<00:02:41.670> is<00:02:41.850> we'll<00:02:42.030> start

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
the next thing we'll do is we'll start

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.180 
the next thing we'll do is we'll start
actually<00:02:42.660> connecting<00:02:43.290> vertex<00:02:43.710> groups<00:02:43.950> to

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
actually connecting vertex groups to

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.880 
actually connecting vertex groups to
this<00:02:44.400> armature
