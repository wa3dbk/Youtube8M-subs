00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
that much anymore it was actually the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.390 
that much anymore it was actually the
class<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:07.020> played<00:01:07.380> mostly<00:01:08.160> in<00:01:08.340> the

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
class that I played mostly in the

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.240 
class that I played mostly in the
beginning<00:01:08.790> but<00:01:08.820> as<00:01:09.690> some<00:01:10.500> people<00:01:10.830> pointed<00:01:11.160> out

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
beginning but as some people pointed out

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.040 
beginning but as some people pointed out
that<00:01:11.400> should<00:01:11.580> use<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.880> shield<00:01:12.150> more<00:01:12.420> but<00:01:13.020> i

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
that should use the shield more but i

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.600 
that should use the shield more but i
don't<00:01:13.380> really<00:01:13.590> like<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:14.070> i<00:01:14.250> don't<00:01:14.430> have<00:01:14.580> it

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.320 
upgraded and the thing about the sheet
is<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.340> slows<00:01:17.550> me<00:01:17.760> down<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.180> is

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
is that it slows me down and that is

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.180 
is that it slows me down and that is
something<00:01:18.510> i<00:01:18.780> really<00:01:19.200> hate<00:01:19.650> i<00:01:19.680> know<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.100> a

that<00:04:30.710> even<00:04:31.490> though<00:04:31.700> we<00:04:31.820> are<00:04:31.910> repairing<00:04:32.240> it<00:04:32.570> as

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
that even though we are repairing it as

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.840 
that even though we are repairing it as
much<00:04:33.080> as<00:04:33.110> we<00:04:33.260> can<00:04:33.560> we<00:04:34.220> don't<00:04:34.400> have<00:04:34.610> anybody
