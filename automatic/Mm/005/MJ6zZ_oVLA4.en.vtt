against<00:02:13.220> this<00:02:13.370> castle

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
against this castle

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.220 
against this castle
but<00:02:14.030> it<00:02:14.120> really<00:02:14.270> won't<00:02:14.450> do<00:02:14.630> a<00:02:14.660> whole<00:02:14.960> lot<00:02:14.990> of

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
but it really won't do a whole lot of

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.270 
but it really won't do a whole lot of
damage<00:02:15.410> even<00:02:15.710> though<00:02:15.860> it's<00:02:15.950> super<00:02:16.190> effective

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
damage even though it's super effective

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.450 
damage even though it's super effective
because<00:02:16.760> of<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.660> sunny<00:02:17.870> day<00:02:18.110> it<00:02:18.680> does<00:02:18.980> weaken

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
because of the sunny day it does weaken

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.780 
because of the sunny day it does weaken
water<00:02:20.030> attacks<00:02:20.450> by<00:02:20.720> half<00:02:21.170> I<00:02:21.620> think<00:02:22.400> it's<00:02:22.580> half

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
water attacks by half I think it's half

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.010 
water attacks by half I think it's half
I'm<00:02:22.940> not<00:02:23.060> exactly<00:02:23.330> a<00:02:23.480> hundred<00:02:23.750> percent<00:02:23.810> sure

I'm not exactly a hundred percent sure
exactly<00:02:24.800> what<00:02:25.040> it<00:02:25.130> is<00:02:25.900> but<00:02:26.900> nls<00:02:27.260> I'm<00:02:27.410> gonna

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
exactly what it is but nls I'm gonna

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.640 
exactly what it is but nls I'm gonna
still<00:02:27.710> keep<00:02:27.740> going<00:02:28.070> on<00:02:28.190> and<00:02:28.910> using<00:02:29.210> the<00:02:29.840> the

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
still keep going on and using the the

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.399 
so anyway I'm gonna go ahead and go with
an<00:05:40.580> extreme<00:05:40.880> speed<00:05:41.120> my<00:05:41.330> arcanine<00:05:41.750> kind<00:05:42.289> of<00:05:42.349> a

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:42.409 
an extreme speed my arcanine kind of a

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:44.770 
an extreme speed my arcanine kind of a
stupid<00:05:42.560> move<00:05:42.830> online<00:05:42.979> part<00:05:43.280> I<00:05:43.370> guess<00:05:43.580> I<00:05:43.789> didn't

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
stupid move online part I guess I didn't

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.629 
stupid move online part I guess I didn't
really<00:05:44.930> think<00:05:45.229> that<00:05:45.380> the<00:05:45.650> extreme<00:05:46.219> speed<00:05:46.430> was

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 
really think that the extreme speed was

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:48.610 
really think that the extreme speed was
weak<00:05:46.909> against<00:05:47.419> or<00:05:47.599> wasn't<00:05:48.110> really<00:05:48.349> gonna<00:05:48.440> do<00:05:48.590> a

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
weak against or wasn't really gonna do a

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.839 
weak against or wasn't really gonna do a
lot<00:05:48.770> of<00:05:48.800> damage<00:05:49.009> against<00:05:49.340> the<00:05:49.520> lucario

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:49.849 
lot of damage against the lucario

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:50.850 
lot of damage against the lucario
probably<00:05:50.330> should<00:05:50.449> have<00:05:50.509> seen<00:05:50.690> that<00:05:50.719> coming

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
probably should have seen that coming

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.930 
probably should have seen that coming
but<00:05:51.860> he's<00:05:51.979> going<00:05:52.099> to<00:05:52.159> go<00:05:52.250> ahead<00:05:52.310> and<00:05:52.430> go<00:05:52.639> for

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
but he's going to go ahead and go for

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.430 
but he's going to go ahead and go for
another<00:05:53.000> hurricane<00:05:53.300> doesn't<00:05:53.780> exactly<00:05:54.110> kill
