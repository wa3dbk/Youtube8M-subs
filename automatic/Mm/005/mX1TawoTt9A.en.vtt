00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.630
 notions quite something 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.240
 different mine with the cows 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:29.310
 is there such a thing and indeed there is 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:32.160
 so-called balls and what that in the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.940
 practice with tea cups has to do that 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.160
 we'll show you right now 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.329

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.239

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.219
 the coo of your chest just like 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.500
 We humans also have the cows on 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.660
 breast box your bets 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.660
 what is noticeable in the ribbed bows 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:01:02.460
 between the councils always small valleys 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:04.559
 are it goes up and down that is now 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:10.650
 the first part of the first part of the 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:13.100
 box and the cake at the ku and 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.810
 Now it's up to you guys to go through 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.509
 boggy ground always run the 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.119
 same pace have rhythm and 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:25.140
 This also creates so-called 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.840
 Nativity scenes and that's what people have 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.140
 apparently earlier from the anatomy of the co 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.240

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.960

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.619
 how the cures look now 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:41.760
 Here you can already see how the cows 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.680
 have formed a rib 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:49.300
 if it rained you can do that 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:53.759
 Also good at recognizing that the cribs 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:57.750
 valleys full of water and the heights 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:04.270
 come out like so little ones 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:07.530
 you can see so-called third ones 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.530
 how they came into existence
