00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.620
 tutorial this time will not be a guardian 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.580
 to the Japanese, yes, it will be back 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:16.070
 something very sweet and practically 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.830
 this kinder cereals 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:23.310
 yesterday I put a picture on facebook sta 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.779
 practically depopulated a girl has me 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.699
 asked to do the tutorial and then 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.710
 subsequently many other girls 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.289
 linked to pleasure a tutorial let us 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.800
 see how he showed them as athletes 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.260
 the paper on the ant as you did a 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.790
 make this technique so much from a 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.500
 the other tutorial I will show you too 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.030
 another technique and you will hopefully take them 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.040
 also entered this time will be the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.510
 Dr. spoke because I want to make you 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.300
 understand the old certain steps 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.820
 I do hope that I like it all 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:56.969
 and I hope this killer grains a lot 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:01:01.379
 tasty one thing I wanted to tell you I was in 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.460
 mind video let's call them video 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.460
 utility 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.189
 the clean video call because for me 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.350
 I said they can be useful to you where 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.060
 I explain to you let's say certain things on 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.220
 film distracts you example a girl does 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.350
 but he asked me how to get the 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.090
 hill for the little dolls and so on 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.490
 etc. I wanted to show even 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.740
 various ways of the world or as 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.750
 create various color seeds like 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.500
 mix the various colors to obtain them 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.600
 others as is done for example 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.300
 the cookie that many girls for 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.150
 example do not know how to create it from scratch 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.660
 instead there is a very simple way 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.550
 because the color disagrees and so on 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.430
 etc. lots of many others 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:45.130
 advice if we say this if this 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.140
 like leave a comment below 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.369
 if this beginning yesterday told where styles 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.520
 what use do you like or as always 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.619
 let me understand how below with 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.910
 requests after the car what if you want 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.680
 sign up that one post should suffice one 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:15.489
 see you at the next video 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:17.950
 she beat smiles bank then girls 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:22.330
 let's start with laying out a sheet of 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.130
 brown smoke equal to the puff of 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.910
 paper let's say we printed it in 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.530
 precedence of the kinder cereals lo 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.730
 we rest on and cut for 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:37.239
 the precisely the same form as the print 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:41.670
 which we did then giving the shape 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.670
 same as the serial killer 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.750
 so here's the secret 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.510
 trick how we want to call it that 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.960
 I told you before, that is, to take 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.950
 practically waste smoke and what 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.970
 do we practically roll out a puff pastry 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.510
 always the same as what we have 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:22.260
 done first and cut the part we say 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.150
 final of the kinder cereals for then 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.180
 apply this waste smoke to us 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.100
 it will help us to save up 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.530
 because this part we say will come 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:42.400
 covered by white sheet like 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:44.110
 you will see later and it is doing the classics 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.950
 drawings that are on the finger 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.950
 serial killers 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.300
 then spread a white sheet 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.720
 then making it coincide we say with the 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.410
 final part where I put the first one 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.410
 waste 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:39.130
 let's lean over let's fit together 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:42.080
 and we close because of this part 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:45.050
 let's say the part that is closed 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:51.740
 will then be covered by the paper with the 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:55.070
 written serial killer precisely then i 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.590
 my name is kinder 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.990
 cereals to apply that cream to you 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.360
 will be done with the first white and then 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:06.460
 we make cereals we are inside with 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.460
 hazelnut color fimo 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:59.830
 ok now the application of the card 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.710
 I use vinavil and the star 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:06.550
 directly on the wire to be cooked 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:08.950
 because it turns out to me we say easier and 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.930
 then cooking is much more solid 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.510
 or you can do it even after the 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.770
 then extend the vinavil e 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:18.880
 attack us 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:22.810
 the common card papers we say from 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:25.450
 printer and then after passing a layer 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:28.840
 of glossy varnish 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:32.140
 I normally have things in the oven at 100 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:35.020
 110 grates for 10 minutes 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:37.360
 ok the kinder cereal is ready i hope you 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.420
 tutorial you enjoyed and see you at 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.420
