missed out a lot of school I think with

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.600 
missed out a lot of school I think with
that<00:02:28.140> comes<00:02:28.799> with<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:28.980> lot<00:02:29.099> of<00:02:29.160> her<00:02:29.340> and

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
that comes with a lot of her and

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.420 
that comes with a lot of her and
normality<00:02:30.599> but<00:02:30.630> um<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:31.230> don't<00:02:32.010> regret<00:02:32.190> that

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
normality but um I don't regret that

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.670 
normality but um I don't regret that
really<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.880> be<00:02:32.970> honest<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.269> never<00:02:33.330> really

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
really to be honest I never really

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.350 
really to be honest I never really
enjoyed<00:02:34.680> school<00:02:34.980> that<00:02:35.160> much<00:02:35.310> so<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:35.880> think<00:02:36.090> was

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
enjoyed school that much so I think was

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.110 
enjoyed school that much so I think was
quite<00:02:36.510> lucky<00:02:36.690> I<00:02:39.019> think<00:02:40.019> it's<00:02:40.440> I<00:02:41.010> think<00:02:41.910> it's

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
quite lucky I think it's I think it's

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.479 
quite lucky I think it's I think it's
difficult<00:02:42.299> to<00:02:42.540> talk<00:02:42.660> about<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:43.260> know<00:02:43.489> the

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
difficult to talk about you know the

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.229 
difficult to talk about you know the
things<00:02:44.730> that<00:02:44.819> we<00:02:44.940> missed<00:02:45.269> when<00:02:46.069> we<00:02:47.069> gained<00:02:47.849> so

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
things that we missed when we gained so

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.170 
things that we missed when we gained so
much<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:48.870> know<00:02:48.959> I<00:02:49.170> think<00:02:49.670> we<00:02:50.670> probably<00:02:50.819> had<00:02:51.090> to

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
much you know I think we probably had to

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.690 
much you know I think we probably had to
grow<00:02:51.360> up<00:02:51.390> a<00:02:51.840> lot<00:02:52.079> quicker<00:02:52.349> than<00:02:52.700> normal

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
grow up a lot quicker than normal

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.610 
grow up a lot quicker than normal
children<00:02:53.910> words<00:02:54.780> we<00:02:55.049> had<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.230> lot<00:02:55.410> more

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
children words we had a lot more

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.589 
children words we had a lot more
responsibilities<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.459> essentially<00:02:57.060> we<00:02:57.180> were

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
responsibilities and essentially we were

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.740 
responsibilities and essentially we were
we<00:02:57.870> were<00:02:57.959> working<00:02:58.470> from<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:59.480> why<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:00.510> was<00:03:00.690> still

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
we were working from and why I was still

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.979 
we were working from and why I was still
ten<00:03:01.110> eleven<00:03:01.440> years<00:03:01.470> old<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:02.690> so<00:03:03.690> I<00:03:03.720> think<00:03:03.900> in

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
ten eleven years old and so I think in

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.620 
ten eleven years old and so I think in
that<00:03:04.079> sense<00:03:04.489> that<00:03:05.489> was<00:03:05.639> difficult<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.359> it<00:03:06.480> was

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
that sense that was difficult and it was

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.610 
that sense that was difficult and it was
a<00:03:06.900> lot<00:03:07.319> of<00:03:07.410> pressure<00:03:07.650> but<00:03:08.780> suddenly<00:03:09.780> I<00:03:10.200> only

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
a lot of pressure but suddenly I only

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.629 
a lot of pressure but suddenly I only
feel<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:11.220> I<00:03:11.400> I<00:03:12.680> just<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.980> experience<00:03:14.400> been

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
feel that I I just the experience been

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:19.039 
feel that I I just the experience been
so<00:03:14.670> amazing<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.329> so<00:03:15.989> unique<00:03:16.380> and<00:03:16.680> I<00:03:17.780> it's<00:03:18.780> been

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
so amazing and so unique and I it's been

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:28.590 
so amazing and so unique and I it's been
it's<00:03:19.410> been<00:03:19.500> incredible<00:03:20.310> really<00:03:20.579> um<00:03:21.769> yeah

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.530 

never<00:03:29.600> say<00:03:29.900> never<00:03:30.140> but<00:03:30.620> I<00:03:31.370> would<00:03:31.910> hope<00:03:32.180> I<00:03:32.450> would

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
August I'm going to university in the

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.230 
August I'm going to university in the
States<00:05:00.229> so<00:05:00.640> I'm<00:05:01.640> very<00:05:02.570> I'm<00:05:03.110> very<00:05:04.000> excited<00:05:05.000> and

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
States so I'm very I'm very excited and

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.190 
States so I'm very I'm very excited and
looking<00:05:05.540> forward<00:05:05.870> to<00:05:06.700> a<00:05:07.750> bit<00:05:08.750> of<00:05:08.870> normality

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
looking forward to a bit of normality

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:15.340 
looking forward to a bit of normality
for<00:05:09.680> a<00:05:09.800> while<00:05:09.979> we<00:05:10.280> nice<00:05:10.460> um<00:05:11.950> but<00:05:14.110> by<00:05:15.110> no<00:05:15.169> means

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
for a while we nice um but by no means

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.550 
for a while we nice um but by no means
means<00:05:16.010> that<00:05:16.600> by<00:05:17.600> going<00:05:17.810> to<00:05:17.900> university<00:05:18.440> I'm

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
means that by going to university I'm

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.090 
means that by going to university I'm
never<00:05:18.770> going<00:05:19.010> to<00:05:19.070> work<00:05:20.030> again<00:05:20.229> or<00:05:21.229> act<00:05:21.590> again<00:05:21.890> I

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
never going to work again or act again I

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.640 
never going to work again or act again I
think<00:05:22.250> a<00:05:22.940> lot<00:05:23.570> of<00:05:23.600> confusion<00:05:24.169> in<00:05:24.260> the<00:05:24.350> media

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
think a lot of confusion in the media

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.510 
think a lot of confusion in the media
that<00:05:24.919> because<00:05:25.280> I'm<00:05:25.400> going<00:05:25.550> to<00:05:25.640> university

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
that because I'm going to university

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.150 
that because I'm going to university
that<00:05:28.520> happening<00:05:29.090> is<00:05:29.180> kind<00:05:29.419> of<00:05:29.890> well<00:05:30.890> a

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
that happening is kind of well a

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.640 
that happening is kind of well a
university<00:05:32.090> is<00:05:32.180> mutually<00:05:32.600> exclusive<00:05:33.110> I<00:05:33.320> can't

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
university is mutually exclusive I can't

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.430 
university is mutually exclusive I can't
act<00:05:34.100> as<00:05:34.460> well<00:05:34.640> as<00:05:34.700> a<00:05:35.360> study<00:05:35.750> at<00:05:36.020> the<00:05:36.050> same<00:05:36.229> time

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
act as well as a study at the same time

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.010 
act as well as a study at the same time
and<00:05:36.740> I<00:05:37.030> seem<00:05:38.030> to<00:05:38.120> have<00:05:38.210> managed<00:05:38.479> it<00:05:38.570> okay<00:05:38.870> up

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
and I seem to have managed it okay up

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.460 
and I seem to have managed it okay up
until

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
until

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.430 
until
this<00:05:39.770> point<00:05:40.070> so<00:05:40.430> that's<00:05:41.000> what<00:05:41.210> I<00:05:41.240> hope<00:05:42.110> they

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
this point so that's what I hope they

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.630 
this point so that's what I hope they
continue<00:05:42.590> to<00:05:42.890> do<00:05:43.130> and<00:05:43.570> you<00:05:44.570> know<00:05:44.690> and
