00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 in the face of everybody here wolf dog 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.290
 and from we are a new type of video 1 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.349
 video because then I was thinking 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.700
 I'm not saying ok the woman for a moment 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.970
 fatah blade runner from a certain point of 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.760
 view for what concerns maybe the first ones 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:24.810
 seven eight minutes of play they did 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:30.390
 and also the blog undergone something of f 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:32.880
 no longer detaches more than 115 to dress me which 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.190
 it was time I forget I must count 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.129
 to directly change 15 between style 80 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.079
 so I said but I would like to do a 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.469
 total reversal of the runes then 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.329
 boys redo with you you do 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.789
 with you I tell you why I believe they are 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.320
 these you want wings then guys don't 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.070
 it pays more to skip this blog 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.680
 what i think 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.820
 according to me it is worthwhile to discard infinitives 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:01.260
 to ok infinite etc and as a second o 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.640
 panton dancer or the ghost breed la 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.350
 science fiction is the same good then 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.570
 however since you need more 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.240
 nardini advises the ideas then the 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.890
 swiss para less you also have much damage 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:17.400
 however, unfortunate guests are ghost blades 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.670
 panton dancer and what the fuck was missing 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.000
 cosplay finally of phantom dancer and the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.340
 swiss for however endless panton denzel e 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.560
 gosling does not give the 100 200 reflects 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.240
 so guys I thought how 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.400
 the it and maybe the thing I have to do also 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.110
 nearly instead of making you a vampire 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.930
 shopper you make yourself those ten 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.460
 or maybe a man a new kind of thing 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.930
 you can start with log sword and potions 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.000
 because I think he went that year 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.690
 well don't go well as you say 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.040
 in fact I don't use it almost then 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.979
 change according to me should put 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:55.540
 it is still worthwhile to criticize 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.979
 in the fifth sense perhaps only one go 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:04.780
 well I don't know that then also for speed 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:08.940
 need no that is fine in the max there 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:11.050
 we put all of armored penetration 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.000
 left remaining we owe the critic e 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.239
 then we do swiss things for the weapon 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.180
 that is, we do not need so much black 12 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.530
 attack speed then all armor for how much 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.850
 regards the speech you do not believe seen 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.140
 that button in any case all stancich 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.170
 resists no use but then we put ourselves 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.400
 mitch crisis for our torments 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:35.050
 growth at level 28 3 then we put ourselves 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.489
 a bit of atac sfid yes then i don't know if 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.370
 there are straight runes chances go 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:43.810
 well immediately boy I would n't have suffered if 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:47.370
 there are the runes with chris jones not me 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:51.370
 I remember if they were there, they were kind of pip 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:54.760
 yes oh well by the fans that fucking cloth it 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.739
 Stop the attack even though many do not 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:02.230
 count a cock then it pays 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:06.340
 put atac speed ok bye already are me 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.330
 i am able adc udc adc there is no know 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:15.170
 disappeared 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:17.810
 here it is here we are here I believe that 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.650
 these are the perfect semi runes 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.900
 that sciences could go now 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.360
 maybe we should turn it into 4 in 5 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:32.060
 therefore having waited a moment you have the 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:37.160
 conscience 42 marx crypt chance 0 93 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:42.970
 then we do so we do so so 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:46.160
 or at 6.5 my one click shanks here ok 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:49.640
 easily another 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:55.850
 so it goes to 5.6 so low because mi 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:58.790
 apparently they go according to how ok so 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.470
 to the seven goals of the match 7 armor feels 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.910
 second launch pilot 10 beta gdansk 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.260
 beginning with the Cosworth striped 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.810
 register armor plus that of the master 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.730
 inseriva 22 of harmony 3d more weapons 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.900
 so I think they are perfect 53 of 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.810
 sciences that maybe nearly can though 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:16.340
 pier casini digos saw for type 8 purposes 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.840
 plus 58 plus 6 14 clay useless chance 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.130
 which are not really few 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.430
 so first take-off instead of being done 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.430
 maybe 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:28.730
 precisely washing machine for the disabled is 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.950
 the void cosplay italy you do 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.720
 infin 10 then panton dance and roll ghost 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.250
 however nevertheless blade will do as before 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.130
 go to you do the species after the 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.330
 swiss for why the species is anyway 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.810
 much stronger than the suite what 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.330
 I think 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.950
 indeed I believe that today this video can 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.630
 end up with a lot of graphics 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.210
 to show my runes and what 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.680
 I thought of my miron so at least 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.120
 we did it and see what 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.620
 you also think I believe that these 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.480
 let them be really reasoned 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.220
 so on those classes let me know in the 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.990
 comments what you think 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.110
 and to all dog boys 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.110
 wolf
