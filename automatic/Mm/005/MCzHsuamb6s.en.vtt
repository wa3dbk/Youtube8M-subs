there's<00:02:22.250> three<00:02:22.579> plants<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:24.170> yes<00:02:24.379> I<00:02:24.560> could

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
there's three plants and yes I could

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.959 
there's three plants and yes I could
probably<00:02:24.859> get<00:02:25.040> another<00:02:25.159> one<00:02:25.430> out<00:02:25.579> of<00:02:25.609> this

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:25.969 
probably get another one out of this

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:29.020 
probably get another one out of this
potato<00:02:26.299> maybe<00:02:27.109> two<00:02:27.349> more<00:02:27.549> for<00:02:28.549> what<00:02:28.670> I<00:02:28.700> end<00:02:28.909> up

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
potato maybe two more for what I end up

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.429 
potato maybe two more for what I end up
with<00:02:29.090> is<00:02:30.370> two<00:02:31.370> four<00:02:31.819> six<00:02:32.269> seven<00:02:33.019> plants

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:33.439 
with is two four six seven plants

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.649 
with is two four six seven plants
possible<00:02:34.189> here<00:02:34.370> out<00:02:35.030> of<00:02:35.209> four<00:02:35.420> potatoes

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:35.659 
possible here out of four potatoes

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:37.869 
possible here out of four potatoes
instead<00:02:36.109> of<00:02:36.200> four<00:02:36.379> plants<00:02:36.769> and<00:02:37.219> I<00:02:37.519> also<00:02:37.670> have

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
instead of four plants and I also have

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.119 
instead of four plants and I also have
all<00:02:38.030> this<00:02:38.150> potato<00:02:38.480> that<00:02:38.629> I<00:02:38.719> can<00:02:38.930> fry<00:02:39.859> up<00:02:39.889> and

all this potato that I can fry up and

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.559 
all this potato that I can fry up and
eat<00:02:41.109> my<00:02:42.109> next<00:02:42.409> step<00:02:42.620> is<00:02:42.799> to<00:02:42.920> take<00:02:43.099> these

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
eat my next step is to take these

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.080 
eat my next step is to take these
individual<00:02:44.569> plants<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:45.549> place<00:02:46.549> them<00:02:46.790> in<00:02:46.939> my

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
individual plants and place them in my

out give yourself some room now what I
do<00:03:02.719> now<00:03:02.989> is<00:03:03.260> I<00:03:03.379> place<00:03:03.680> these<00:03:03.919> because<00:03:04.519> the

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
do now is I place these because the

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.449 
do now is I place these because the
moist<00:03:05.719> end<00:03:05.989> has<00:03:06.169> to<00:03:06.319> dry<00:03:06.560> in<00:03:06.769> order<00:03:07.159> for<00:03:07.370> this

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
moist end has to dry in order for this

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:08.770 
moist end has to dry in order for this
to<00:03:07.519> work<00:03:07.669> you<00:03:08.090> don't<00:03:08.180> want<00:03:08.389> these<00:03:08.510> things

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:49.699 
got some nice strong sheets coming off

00:03:49.699 --> 00:04:03.390 
got some nice strong sheets coming off
of<00:03:49.729> them<00:03:49.970> and<00:03:50.139> nice<00:03:51.139> roots<00:03:51.530> getting<00:03:51.799> started

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.369 

by<00:04:03.940> the<00:04:04.000> way<00:04:04.150> I<00:04:04.180> did<00:04:04.390> trim<00:04:04.659> the<00:04:04.780> edges<00:04:04.959> of<00:04:05.260> my

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
by the way I did trim the edges of my

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.020 
by the way I did trim the edges of my
chunks<00:04:05.709> up<00:04:05.860> a<00:04:05.950> little<00:04:06.099> bit<00:04:06.280> so<00:04:06.640> they'd<00:04:06.790> fit

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
chunks up a little bit so they'd fit

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.930 
chunks up a little bit so they'd fit
well<00:04:07.239> into<00:04:07.480> little<00:04:07.780> egg<00:04:07.989> holders<00:04:08.790> so<00:04:09.790> what

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
well into little egg holders so what

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.759 
well into little egg holders so what
I'll<00:04:10.060> do<00:04:10.209> when<00:04:10.330> it<00:04:10.450> comes<00:04:10.629> time<00:04:10.840> to<00:04:10.900> plant<00:04:11.290> is

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
I'll do when it comes time to plant is

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.190 
I'll do when it comes time to plant is
I'll<00:04:11.980> simply<00:04:12.390> cut<00:04:13.390> the<00:04:13.540> sections<00:04:13.989> of<00:04:14.080> the

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
I'll simply cut the sections of the

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.629 
I'll simply cut the sections of the
carton<00:04:14.560> and<00:04:16.229> free<00:04:17.229> each<00:04:17.380> plant<00:04:17.739> while<00:04:18.340> leaving

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
carton and free each plant while leaving

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.490 
carton and free each plant while leaving
them<00:04:18.970> in<00:04:19.150> the<00:04:19.239> soil<00:04:19.720> that<00:04:19.930> they're<00:04:20.079> currently

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
them in the soil that they're currently

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.070 
them in the soil that they're currently
rooting<00:04:21.220> into<00:04:21.600> that's<00:04:22.600> going<00:04:22.810> to<00:04:22.870> give<00:04:22.960> me<00:04:22.990> a

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
rooting into that's going to give me a

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:34.379 
rooting into that's going to give me a
nice<00:04:23.229> start<00:04:23.590> on<00:04:23.710> these<00:04:23.830> potatoes

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.960
