00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.620
 feature of aerated concrete is high 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.180
 permeable this material is not 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.400
 it is recommended to use cases 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.809
 coupled with high humidity altogether 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.150
 another thing is foam concrete 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.950
 possessing mapped us from gas silicate 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.269
 the characteristics of this material is water 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.060
 practically does not absorb 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.619
 To be precise, foam can 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.960
 soak up water no more than five 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.640
 percent of its volume however 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.640
 determine what material is in front of you 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.640
 to the naked eye it is difficult i 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.090
 would like to tell foam and aerated concrete 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.500
 these materials are very similar to those materials 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.809
 which he showed i said it 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.030
 foam block but in order to check that 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.210
 what i said they look so much like i 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.660
 himself in general in this until the end now is not 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.030
 sure need to omit this stuff in 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.699
 water and see how it absorbs and and 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.449
 Now we will spend with you a simple 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.969
 experiment 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:04.309
 Here we gently slowly omit 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:09.080
 material water now 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:13.979
 Rain rarely literally minutes if 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:16.460
 aerated concrete it will be very good 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.560
 get wet now we'll wait a couple of minutes 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.560
 pull out the bow and smash it 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.009
 if it is aerated concrete it is very strong 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.750
 no wet water if this block 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.930
 there is no water for a maximum of 5 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.570
 millimeters well 25 thing is that 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.960
 aerated concrete has the so -called open 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.900
 pores 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.799
 these forms of water intensively comes 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.770
 inside foam concrete has closed pores and 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.299
 let water inside 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.579
 the disadvantage of aerated concrete is that 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.460
 house made of him 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:52.619
 In case of leakage, we will allow roofs or 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.140
 pipe leaks that are per piece minced 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.280
 wall heating pipe water pipe 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.890
 even some kind of sewer drain 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.490
 long working can wet you 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.050
 whole wall 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:10.610
 it is very unpleasant here 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:16.070
 now we pull out and break the block then 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:19.130
 it will be seen what kind of material here it is 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:25.150
 so well absorbs all your water 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.150
 bubbled like a blotter 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:46.460
 watch out here look at this foam block 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.900
 u not so much wet even though 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.770
 need to hold it in 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.660
 and more well, until we do to 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.440
 abruptly their conclusions we will leave well in 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:01.990
 bucket and at the end of the shooting we will see what 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.990
 run out I drop it back 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.610
 used settings after 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.250
 some time let's see everything 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:17.140
 foam or aerated concrete 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:19.330
 I even confess myself to 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.240
 Today it is not clear that we 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.580
 found the settings but because like this 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.690
 product potyazhelela I see it 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.610
 saturated with water 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:38.160
 Now we will open it and see 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:40.360
 as far as he can see from the engorged with water 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.530
 if he stands in this water 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:47.800
 a couple of hours he was wet there is no up 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:51.100
 grounds so we see that this 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.710
 foam concrete is gas gas gas silicate 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.950
 with open and clean porous structure 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.750
 how intensely he absorbed himself 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:03.100
 moisture 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:08.190
 we heard the sound he makes when 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.190
 absorption it practically works like
