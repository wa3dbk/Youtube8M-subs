00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:13.380
 spoons candles 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.120
 but here what I did while they were given 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.800
 list of materials is nothing else to do the 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.470
 circle that is where we are going to take it out 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.769
 all the filling 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.560

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:27.259
 we can put in and take out the candle too 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.080
 may be with figurines and here the 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:34.259
 most beautiful side 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.259
 and we make the ojito 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.960
 the other eyes by the mouth if also 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.170
 irregular with some teeth whether 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.170
 classics 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.640
 but in the calm that with that we have it 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.640
 what to do with a tincture half child 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.079

 I adore that if we adore friends and only 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:14.130
 I think we heard we would be better 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.580
 but do not have an electric action for 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.500
 ali rose you act there was not a saw 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.500
 electric for your disguise 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.960
 Oh God 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.700

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.920

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.880
 beware the children here lived 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.070
 because she is a true expert 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.520
 kamikaze not if you have to be careful 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.520
 because it is 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:02:00.220
 right now is a free jump 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.680
 We put a knife here in your kitchen 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.420
 cooking works better 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.860
 nothing else here rose as his 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.619
 pampered of sorrows takes them to 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.619
 all true us on the street 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.020
 it occurs to me that we can put 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.990
 up different remarkable faces like a 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.930
 personality to the zucchini 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.540
 and put them in the garden in a few 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.540
 stairs, look at me since I was little 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.409
 I do this with my parents 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.409
 and it's something 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.550
 although not what was not left 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:44.710
 and a spoon we take out 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:47.410
 the fruit leave them hollow completely 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.900
 back so that over time I'm going to 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.650
 help inviting 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.650
 the surplus 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:03:01.610
 so prepare us a rich rich country 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.110
 the vanilla manabita now they have me 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.590
 without eating sra 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:10.129
 working from sun to shadow 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.129
 I do not know what 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.850
 today 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.910
 do not 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.910
 let's see 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.480
 apart they last a lot noble that is going to 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.489
 spoil quickly is a fruit that 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.750
 since we took everything inside it 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:40.780
 is what is most perishable 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.780
 and the cascarita lasts a very good time 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.470
 well lets just say we have everything what 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:50.510
 good that they brought it a size 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.160
 family because it would not have happened 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.620
 this is why listening is weaker than 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.600
 if not good and I look like the magician this 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.070
 the works with the thought of the agro of 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.070
 the economic kitchen rice 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:08.049
 and we are finishing 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.879
 we already have to have several lists of 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:12.099
 you are blessed that always take us out of 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:15.239
 difficulties and are the ones that we are going to introduce 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.239
 for our lamp 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:25.700
 in the middle of tiny but 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.700
 small but overweight 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.350
 let's do 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:48.940
 the supercombined pumpkin and the 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:48.940
 Kitchen squash are less 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:58.000
 elche that put a little 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.000
 because if we can not break him 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.580
 I'm going to break the cutter and then 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.680
 we got one 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.199
 look here we have one that I love you 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:12.879
 showing 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:15.729
 obviously without cause this left us with 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:19.169
 faces and a half what I can help them 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.169
 as different personalities 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:27.719
 and so it is very easy 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.100
 yes 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:37.800
 what do you think while I just finished 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:40.510
 chambear we go to the step by step 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.100
 back at the top a circle 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.950
 which will be the cover of our lamp and 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:47.350
 cut with the help of the spoon takes out the 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.630
 Fill up to clean completely back 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.520
 to the face and report it with the cutter 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.450
 finally enter the candle and you 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.450
 lamp will be ready 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.009
 and while martÃ­n still has a 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.009
 fight 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:08.290
 our pumpkin lamp is ready 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:16.650
 and if you like with this image 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:16.650
