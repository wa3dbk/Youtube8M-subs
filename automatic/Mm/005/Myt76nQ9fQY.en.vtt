00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.060 

it's<00:01:26.760> playing<00:01:27.090> pretty<00:01:27.330> good<00:01:27.770> let's<00:01:28.770> see<00:01:28.890> if<00:01:28.980> I

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
it's playing pretty good let's see if I

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.070 
it's playing pretty good let's see if I
can<00:01:29.250> make<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.550> to<00:01:29.670> all<00:01:29.790> three<00:01:30.090> screens<00:01:32.840> yeah<00:01:33.840> we

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
can make it to all three screens yeah we

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.930 
can make it to all three screens yeah we
have<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.290> collect<00:01:34.620> 40-something<00:01:35.520> hearts<00:01:35.790> I

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
have to collect 40-something hearts I

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.530 
have to collect 40-something hearts I
think<00:01:37.550> that's<00:01:38.550> one<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.940> reasons<00:01:39.300> I'm<00:01:39.390> that

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
think that's one of the reasons I'm that

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.420 
think that's one of the reasons I'm that
big<00:01:39.810> fan<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.440> game<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.830> it<00:01:40.980> just<00:01:41.160> seems<00:01:41.370> to
