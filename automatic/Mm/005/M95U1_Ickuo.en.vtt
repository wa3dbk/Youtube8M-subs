right<00:01:34.719> here<00:01:34.899> as<00:01:35.020> you<00:01:35.049> can<00:01:35.140> tell<00:01:35.380> this<00:01:35.530> guy<00:01:35.770> is

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
right here as you can tell this guy is

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.340 
right here as you can tell this guy is
up<00:01:36.130> here<00:01:36.490> you<00:01:36.759> know<00:01:36.880> he<00:01:37.479> does<00:01:37.869> get<00:01:38.110> knifed

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
eventually but it's an OK spot you know

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:42.660 
eventually but it's an OK spot you know
if<00:01:40.630> you<00:01:40.750> position<00:01:41.259> yourself<00:01:41.350> well<00:01:41.860> you<00:01:42.100> should

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
if you position yourself well you should

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.639 
if you position yourself well you should
be<00:01:42.850> okay<00:01:43.210> and<00:01:43.390> right<00:01:43.899> here<00:01:44.140> is<00:01:44.229> that<00:01:44.409> glitch

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
be okay and right here is that glitch

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:46.740 
be okay and right here is that glitch
spot<00:01:44.979> and<00:01:45.219> they<00:01:45.700> lasted<00:01:46.090> here<00:01:46.299> for<00:01:46.509> quite<00:01:46.719> a

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
spot and they lasted here for quite a

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.899 
spot and they lasted here for quite a
while<00:01:47.020> but<00:01:47.619> as<00:01:47.770> you'll<00:01:47.979> see<00:01:48.219> they<00:01:48.609> do<00:01:48.759> get

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
while but as you'll see they do get

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.279 
while but as you'll see they do get
knifed<00:01:49.149> and<00:01:49.390> I'm<00:01:49.539> I<00:01:49.840> believe<00:01:50.079> there's

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
knifed and I'm I believe there's

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.740 
knifed and I'm I believe there's
probably<00:01:50.770> one<00:01:51.039> position<00:01:51.460> where<00:01:52.270> you<00:01:52.600> are

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
probably one position where you are

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.410 
probably one position where you are
pretty<00:01:53.380> much<00:01:53.590> in<00:01:53.859> vulnerable<00:01:54.609> which<00:01:55.060> this<00:01:55.240> guy

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
pretty much in vulnerable which this guy

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.910 
pretty much in vulnerable which this guy

didn't get into but as you can tell he

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.889 
didn't get into but as you can tell he
