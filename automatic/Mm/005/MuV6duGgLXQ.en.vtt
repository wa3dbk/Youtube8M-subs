 not so much it may be so if we 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.410
 together look at the list of 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.650

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.620
 mother nature gifts 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.570
 this product is not bad for the 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.939
 skin but it's disgusting for 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.400
 the environment so why not

 look rather we find everything and 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.189
 first for the complexion know that the 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.009
 organic makeup uses powders 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.439
 mineral and non- synthetic and that 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.470
 in the case of foundation, use 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.090
 also oils of care oils 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.829

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.939
 Shea Butter 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.159
 the same for lighthouses 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.400

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.780
 enriched with moisturizers it can 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.920
 to be the sweet almond it can be the 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.500
 Shea Butter 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.549
 as for the pigments it is really about 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.009
 mineral or vegetable pigments here too 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.479
 of course, the colors are very small 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.439
 little more natural but today it 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.740

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.020
 the ben lips you see like me that 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.390

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.600

 the gloss or the mascara the mascara it is 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.810
 a little bit more complicated to 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.819
 find certified organic or ecological 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.930
