00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
this wait if you do because they don't

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.159 
this wait if you do because they don't

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 
you have minus 8 which is really bad but

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:16.929 
you have minus 8 which is really bad but
it<00:06:15.259> doesn't<00:06:15.289> matter<00:06:15.679> that<00:06:15.800> much<00:06:16.219> to<00:06:16.879> be

00:06:16.929 --> 00:06:16.939 
it doesn't matter that much to be

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:18.159 
it doesn't matter that much to be
perfectly<00:06:17.300> honest<00:06:17.569> if<00:06:17.839> you've<00:06:17.959> got<00:06:18.139> a

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:18.169 
perfectly honest if you've got a

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:19.959 
perfectly honest if you've got a
popularity<00:06:18.770> to<00:06:18.830> do<00:06:18.949> it<00:06:19.099> then<00:06:19.759> I<00:06:19.819> would

00:06:19.959 --> 00:06:19.969 
popularity to do it then I would

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:33.820 
popularity to do it then I would
recommend<00:06:20.119> doing<00:06:20.779> it<00:06:32.199> get<00:06:33.199> the<00:06:33.409> supplies

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
recommend doing it get the supplies

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.609 
recommend doing it get the supplies
stored<00:06:34.719> and<00:06:35.719> there<00:06:35.839> we<00:06:35.899> go<00:06:35.990> that's<00:06:36.139> level<00:06:36.349> 1

00:06:36.609 --> 00:06:36.619 
stored and there we go that's level 1

00:06:36.619 --> 00:06:38.630 
stored and there we go that's level 1
that's<00:06:37.039> how<00:06:37.219> embarrassingly<00:06:37.789> easy<00:06:37.939> it<00:06:38.300> is

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:38.640 
that's how embarrassingly easy it is

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:45.270 
that's how embarrassingly easy it is
