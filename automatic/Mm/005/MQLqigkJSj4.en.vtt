hi everyone Matt cliff Kowski here with
Lightroom<00:00:06.390> killer<00:00:06.750> tips<00:00:07.050> and<00:00:07.259> this<00:00:07.799> time

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
Lightroom killer tips and this time

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.440 
Lightroom killer tips and this time
we're<00:00:08.130> going<00:00:08.219> to<00:00:08.280> take<00:00:08.430> a<00:00:08.460> look<00:00:08.700> at<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:08.910> at<00:00:09.330> a

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
we're going to take a look at a at a

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.839 
we're going to take a look at a at a
trick<00:00:09.719> that<00:00:09.750> I<00:00:09.930> use<00:00:10.110> all<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.410> time<00:00:10.740> when<00:00:11.730> it

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
trick that I use all the time when it

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.790 
trick that I use all the time when it
comes<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.240> working<00:00:12.660> with<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.200> sky<00:00:13.500> in<00:00:13.679> an

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:13.800 
comes to working with the sky in an

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.799 
comes to working with the sky in an
image<00:00:14.040> because<00:00:14.250> there's<00:00:15.090> a<00:00:15.179> tool<00:00:15.540> that<00:00:15.660> we

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
image because there's a tool that we

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.660 
image because there's a tool that we
have<00:00:15.840> called<00:00:16.200> the<00:00:16.259> graduated<00:00:16.830> filter<00:00:17.189> what

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
have called the graduated filter what

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.280 
have called the graduated filter what
the<00:00:17.730> graduated<00:00:18.210> filter<00:00:18.509> does<00:00:18.689> is<00:00:18.930> it

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:19.290 
the graduated filter does is it

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.979 
the graduated filter does is it
simulates<00:00:19.710> using<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.460> neutral<00:00:20.939> density

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:20.989 
simulates using a neutral density

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:23.300 
simulates using a neutral density
graduated<00:00:21.989> filter<00:00:22.320> in<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.529> field<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:23.070> we<00:00:23.099> had

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
graduated filter in the field so we had

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.550 
graduated filter in the field so we had
those<00:00:23.520> you<00:00:24.060> know<00:00:24.119> square<00:00:24.570> plastic<00:00:24.930> filters

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
those you know square plastic filters

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.530 
those you know square plastic filters
and<00:00:25.739> you<00:00:25.800> could<00:00:25.950> hold<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.279> over<00:00:26.399> in<00:00:27.119> front<00:00:27.450> of

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:27.540 
and you could hold it over in front of

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.690 
and you could hold it over in front of
the<00:00:27.630> lens<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.349> would<00:00:28.500> darken<00:00:28.860> the<00:00:28.950> sky<00:00:29.189> and

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:29.700 
the lens and it would darken the sky and

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.010 
the lens and it would darken the sky and
it<00:00:29.820> was<00:00:29.939> clear<00:00:30.210> at<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.390> bottom<00:00:30.689> so<00:00:30.899> the

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 
it was clear at the bottom so the

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.540 
it was clear at the bottom so the
foreground<00:00:31.410> would<00:00:31.680> stay<00:00:31.919> you<00:00:32.130> know<00:00:32.220> just<00:00:32.460> just

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
foreground would stay you know just just

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.860 
foreground would stay you know just just
the<00:00:32.910> same

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
the same

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.750 
the same
they<00:00:34.290> were<00:00:34.350> great<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.010> problem<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.699> I

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
they were great the problem that I

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.220 
they were great the problem that I
always<00:00:36.000> had<00:00:36.239> with<00:00:36.420> them<00:00:36.539> in<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.780> field<00:00:37.019> and

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
always had with them in the field and

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.360 
always had with them in the field and
that<00:00:37.320> you'll<00:00:37.410> have<00:00:37.559> with<00:00:37.710> them<00:00:37.890> inside<00:00:38.250> of

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
that you'll have with them inside of

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.490 
that you'll have with them inside of
Lightroom<00:00:38.489> or<00:00:38.760> Photoshop<00:00:38.820> 2<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:40.260> if

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
Lightroom or Photoshop 2 is that if

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.169 
Lightroom or Photoshop 2 is that if
you're<00:00:41.309> not<00:00:41.489> out<00:00:41.640> in<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.789> middle<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.120> the

00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:42.179 
you're not out in the middle of the

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:44.209 
you're not out in the middle of the
ocean<00:00:42.359> and<00:00:42.750> taking<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.260> picture<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:43.859> the

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
ocean and taking a picture so that the

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.160 
ocean and taking a picture so that the
hore<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.760> horizon<00:00:45.179> line<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.449> the<00:00:45.629> only<00:00:45.960> thing

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
hore the horizon line is the only thing

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.139 
hore the horizon line is the only thing
that's<00:00:46.350> there<00:00:46.559> typically<00:00:47.339> you'll<00:00:47.579> have<00:00:47.730> trees

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
that's there typically you'll have trees

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.180 
that's there typically you'll have trees
or<00:00:48.449> mountains<00:00:48.660> or<00:00:48.989> something<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.890> kind<00:00:50.070> of

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
or mountains or something that kind of

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.979 
or mountains or something that kind of
come<00:00:50.489> up<00:00:50.519> over<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.059> horizon<00:00:51.210> line<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.719> those

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
come up over the horizon line and those

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.900 
come up over the horizon line and those
get<00:00:52.230> darkened<00:00:52.679> too<00:00:52.890> well<00:00:53.339> we've<00:00:53.519> got<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.730> great

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
get darkened too well we've got a great

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.029 
get darkened too well we've got a great
little<00:00:54.179> trick<00:00:54.420> here<00:00:54.480> too<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.350> help<00:00:55.559> fix<00:00:55.829> that

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
little trick here too to help fix that

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.069 
little trick here too to help fix that
I'll<00:00:56.609> go<00:00:56.789> ahead<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.089> just<00:00:57.239> just<00:00:57.539> develop<00:00:57.960> this

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
I'll go ahead and just just develop this

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.599 
I'll go ahead and just just develop this
photo<00:00:58.289> from<00:00:58.499> scratch<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.129> can<00:00:59.280> see<00:00:59.460> where

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
photo from scratch and you can see where

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.090 
photo from scratch and you can see where
we<00:00:59.730> go<00:00:59.879> with<00:01:00.089> it<00:01:00.440> overall<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.559> would<00:01:01.710> make<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.039> a

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
we go with it overall I would make it a

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.250 
we go with it overall I would make it a
little<00:01:02.249> bit<00:01:02.399> warmer<00:01:02.760> with<00:01:02.909> the<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.899> white

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
little bit warmer with the the white

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.399 
little bit warmer with the the white
balance<00:01:04.470> sliders<00:01:05.339> here<00:01:05.930> exposure<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.259> a

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
balance sliders here exposure this is a

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.289 
balance sliders here exposure this is a
tough<00:01:07.680> one<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.920> move<00:01:08.220> right<00:01:08.460> now<00:01:08.610> because<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
tough one to move right now because the

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.330 
tough one to move right now because the
sky<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.689> too<00:01:10.049> bright<00:01:10.290> we<00:01:10.530> could<00:01:10.680> darken<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.189> but

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
sky is too bright we could darken it but

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.130 
sky is too bright we could darken it but
the<00:01:11.430> foreground<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:11.939> too<00:01:12.060> dark<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.420> we<00:01:12.689> would

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
the foreground is too dark so we would

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.050 
the foreground is too dark so we would
brighten<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:13.710> when<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:13.950> happens<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.610> just

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
brighten it so when that happens I just

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.450 
brighten it so when that happens I just
jump<00:01:15.420> over<00:01:15.630> here<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.840> highlights<00:01:16.380> pull<00:01:17.220> down

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
jump over here to highlights pull down

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.270 
jump over here to highlights pull down
the<00:01:17.700> sky<00:01:17.970> go<00:01:18.899> over<00:01:19.049> here<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.229> shadows<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.920> open

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
the sky go over here to shadows and open

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.389 
the sky go over here to shadows and open
up<00:01:20.369> some<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.729> foreground<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.390> little<00:01:21.630> bit

whites<00:01:23.399> and<00:01:23.549> blacks<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.939> just<00:01:24.119> hold<00:01:24.299> down<00:01:24.329> my

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
whites and blacks I just hold down my

specks atlas' looking good at a little

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.499 
specks atlas' looking good at a little
clarity<00:01:43.110> for<00:01:43.380> some<00:01:43.710> contrast<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.850> detail<00:01:45.090> and

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
clarity for some contrast and detail and

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.260 
clarity for some contrast and detail and
then<00:01:45.990> finally<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.530> use<00:01:46.680> saturation<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.969> just

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
then finally I use saturation to just

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.120 
then finally I use saturation to just
kind<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.630> just<00:01:49.109> kind<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.380> enhance<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.859> colors

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
kind of just kind of enhance the colors

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.599 
kind of just kind of enhance the colors
a<00:01:50.159> little<00:01:50.369> bit<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:51.270> here<00:01:51.659> we<00:01:51.780> are<00:01:51.899> left<00:01:52.229> with

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:52.609 
a little bit so here we are left with

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:55.789 
a little bit so here we are left with
really<00:01:53.609> still<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.479> me<00:01:54.869> what<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.170> still<00:01:55.649> too

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
really still to me what is still too

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.709 
really still to me what is still too
much<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.159> bright<00:01:56.399> sky<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.880> could<00:01:57.420> bring<00:01:57.600> the

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
much of a bright sky I could bring the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.480 
much of a bright sky I could bring the
exposure<00:01:58.109> down<00:01:58.380> but<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.920> darkens<00:01:59.399> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
exposure down but that darkens the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.639 
exposure down but that darkens the
entire<00:01:59.909> photo<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.570> what<00:02:00.750> we<00:02:00.869> would<00:02:01.079> do<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.439> we'd

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
entire photo so what we would do is we'd

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.620 
entire photo so what we would do is we'd
go<00:02:01.859> grab<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.340> graduated<00:02:02.909> filter<00:02:03.210> here<00:02:03.479> and

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
go grab the graduated filter here and

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.599 
go grab the graduated filter here and
I'm<00:02:04.530> going<00:02:04.679> to<00:02:04.710> double<00:02:05.009> click<00:02:05.039> on<00:02:05.429> the<00:02:05.579> word

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:05.609 
I'm going to double click on the word

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:08.120 
I'm going to double click on the word
effect<00:02:06.270> which<00:02:06.810> sets<00:02:07.109> all<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.679> sliders<00:02:08.100> to

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
effect which sets all of the sliders to

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.070 
effect which sets all of the sliders to
zero<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.789> then<00:02:09.210> just<00:02:09.390> bring<00:02:09.509> my<00:02:09.690> exposure

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
zero and then just bring my exposure

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.020 
zero and then just bring my exposure
slider<00:02:10.320> toward<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.920> left<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.370> then<00:02:11.820> what

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
slider toward the left and then what

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.670 
slider toward the left and then what
I'll<00:02:12.120> do<00:02:12.240> is<00:02:12.270> just<00:02:12.390> drag<00:02:12.810> downward<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:13.560> watch

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
I'll do is just drag downward and watch

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.480 
I'll do is just drag downward and watch
what<00:02:13.920> happens<00:02:14.040> here

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
what happens here

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.160 
what happens here
so<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:15.600> does<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.960> really<00:02:16.380> good<00:02:16.680> job

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
so it does a really good job

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.670 
so it does a really good job
of<00:02:17.230> kind<00:02:17.980> of<00:02:18.069> toning<00:02:18.490> down<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.760> sky<00:02:19.750> this<00:02:20.620> is

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
of kind of toning down the sky this is

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.970 
of kind of toning down the sky this is
before<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.480> that's<00:02:22.480> after<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:23.410> problem<00:02:23.830> that

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
before and that's after the problem that

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.920 
before and that's after the problem that
we<00:02:24.130> have<00:02:24.310> is<00:02:24.580> that<00:02:25.150> if<00:02:25.330> you<00:02:25.450> look<00:02:25.690> what's

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
we have is that if you look what's

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.720 
we have is that if you look what's
happening<00:02:26.319> it's<00:02:26.440> it's<00:02:26.739> not<00:02:26.950> only<00:02:27.220> darkening

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
happening it's it's not only darkening

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.030 
happening it's it's not only darkening
the<00:02:27.910> sky<00:02:28.180> but<00:02:28.780> it's<00:02:28.900> also<00:02:29.050> darkening<00:02:29.680> look<00:02:29.920> it

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
the sky but it's also darkening look it

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.430 
the sky but it's also darkening look it
look<00:02:30.190> how<00:02:30.340> dark<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:31.390> tree<00:02:31.690> line<00:02:31.930> over<00:02:31.959> here

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
look how dark the tree line over here

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.770 
look how dark the tree line over here
got<00:02:32.620> so<00:02:33.340> that's<00:02:33.580> where<00:02:33.880> we<00:02:34.000> can<00:02:34.150> jump<00:02:34.450> in<00:02:34.600> here

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
got so that's where we can jump in here

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.870 
got so that's where we can jump in here
with<00:02:34.959> shadows<00:02:35.410> and<00:02:35.440> this<00:02:35.650> is<00:02:35.860> this<00:02:36.100> is<00:02:36.310> what<00:02:36.850> I

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
with shadows and this is this is what I

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.160 
with shadows and this is this is what I
find<00:02:37.180> one<00:02:37.360> of<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.480> little<00:02:37.720> things<00:02:37.930> that<00:02:37.989> a<00:02:38.080> lot

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
find one of the little things that a lot

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.140 
find one of the little things that a lot
of<00:02:38.290> people<00:02:38.650> miss<00:02:38.860> is<00:02:39.040> because<00:02:39.280> we<00:02:39.430> think<00:02:39.670> we

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
of people miss is because we think we

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.790 
of people miss is because we think we
get<00:02:40.239> stuck<00:02:40.540> on<00:02:40.690> well<00:02:41.200> I<00:02:41.230> want<00:02:41.470> to<00:02:41.530> bring<00:02:41.680> the

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
get stuck on well I want to bring the

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.130 
get stuck on well I want to bring the
exposure<00:02:42.100> down<00:02:42.370> on<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.700> sky<00:02:42.970> but<00:02:43.600> it<00:02:43.810> does

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
exposure down on the sky but it does

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.479 
exposure down on the sky but it does
have<00:02:44.380> those<00:02:44.590> negative<00:02:44.980> effects<00:02:45.250> when<00:02:45.400> you

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
have those negative effects when you

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.759 
have those negative effects when you
just<00:02:45.610> come<00:02:45.760> over<00:02:45.790> here<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.150> shadows<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:46.900> open

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
just come over here to shadows and open

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.449 
just come over here to shadows and open
up<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:48.700> shadows<00:02:48.970> on<00:02:49.450> whatever<00:02:50.170> got<00:02:50.739> darker<00:02:51.280> as

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
up the shadows on whatever got darker as

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.820 
up the shadows on whatever got darker as
a<00:02:51.489> result<00:02:52.060> because<00:02:52.900> it's<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.319> shadows

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
a result because it's the shadows

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.710 
a result because it's the shadows
because<00:02:54.340> it's<00:02:54.489> not<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.940> bright<00:02:55.209> parts<00:02:55.540> of<00:02:55.660> the

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
because it's not the bright parts of the

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.660 
because it's not the bright parts of the
photos<00:02:56.049> shadow<00:02:56.380> slider<00:02:56.680> only<00:02:57.130> works<00:02:57.340> on<00:02:57.489> those

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
photos shadow slider only works on those

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.509 
photos shadow slider only works on those
dark<00:02:57.970> deep<00:02:58.630> shadows<00:02:59.170> because<00:02:59.980> of<00:03:00.160> that<00:03:00.250> it

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
dark deep shadows because of that it

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.360 
dark deep shadows because of that it
leaves<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.209> sky<00:03:01.530> totally<00:03:02.530> alone<00:03:02.769> so<00:03:03.040> look<00:03:03.220> I'm

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
leaves the sky totally alone so look I'm

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.680 
leaves the sky totally alone so look I'm
going<00:03:03.459> to<00:03:03.519> move<00:03:03.670> this<00:03:03.850> the<00:03:04.209> shadow<00:03:04.390> slider

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
going to move this the shadow slider

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.449 
going to move this the shadow slider
back<00:03:04.959> and<00:03:05.140> forth<00:03:05.380> the<00:03:05.530> sky<00:03:05.739> doesn't<00:03:06.100> change<00:03:06.280> at

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
back and forth the sky doesn't change at
