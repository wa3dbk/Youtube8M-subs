Tanner's<00:00:07.049> video<00:00:07.610> there<00:00:08.610> was<00:00:08.670> one<00:00:08.849> guy<00:00:08.970> using<00:00:09.269> a

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
Tanner's video there was one guy using a

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.970 
Tanner's video there was one guy using a
random<00:00:09.690> shot<00:00:09.870> gun<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.320> shooting<00:00:10.650> fully

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
random shot gun and shooting fully

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.310 
random shot gun and shooting fully
automatic<00:00:11.400> so<00:00:11.610> our<00:00:12.389> experience<00:00:12.750> how<00:00:13.080> does<00:00:13.139> he

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
automatic so our experience how does he

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.230 
automatic so our experience how does he
do<00:00:13.469> that<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:14.099> found<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.639> couple<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:15.000> ways<00:00:15.210> to

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
do that and I found a couple of ways to

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.180 
do that and I found a couple of ways to
do<00:00:15.540> it

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 
do it

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.660 
do it
one<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:18.240> you<00:00:18.840> should<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.590> reload<00:00:20.430> and

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
one is the you should you reload and

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.340 
one is the you should you reload and
then<00:00:20.789> cancel<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.270> reload<00:00:21.539> by<00:00:21.689> sprinting<00:00:22.170> so

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
then cancel the reload by sprinting so

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.370 
then cancel the reload by sprinting so
it<00:00:22.410> looks<00:00:22.590> like<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:23.720> but<00:00:24.720> that's<00:00:24.840> not<00:00:25.109> really

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
it looks like this but that's not really

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.800 
it looks like this but that's not really
fast<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.980> there's<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.670> much<00:00:27.210> faster<00:00:27.480> way<00:00:27.750> so

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
fast and there's a much faster way so

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.890 
fast and there's a much faster way so
other<00:00:28.019> way<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:29.330> hold<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.480> fire<00:00:30.660> button

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
other way is to hold the fire button

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
other way is to hold the fire button
spam<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.859> reload<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.989> switch<00:00:33.989> guns<00:00:34.649> like

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
spam the reload and switch guns like

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.310 
spam the reload and switch guns like
this<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.280> I'm<00:00:35.700> not<00:00:35.940> gonna<00:00:36.360> do<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.780> I'm<00:00:37.020> gonna

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
this so I'm not gonna do it I'm gonna

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.160 
this so I'm not gonna do it I'm gonna
try<00:00:37.469> oh<00:00:38.210> it's<00:00:39.210> gonna<00:00:39.360> happen<00:00:39.600> sweetheart<00:00:39.690> for

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
try oh it's gonna happen sweetheart for

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.750 
try oh it's gonna happen sweetheart for
me<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.350> do<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.559> on<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.800> PC<00:00:41.100> because<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.489> switch

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
me to do it on the PC because I switch

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.560 
me to do it on the PC because I switch
downs<00:00:42.000> with<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.780> scroll<00:00:43.770> wheel<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.190> then<00:00:44.570> I'm

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
downs with a scroll wheel and then I'm

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.229 
downs with a scroll wheel and then I'm
gonna<00:00:45.690> have<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.930> do<00:00:46.320> all<00:00:46.469> those<00:00:46.760> it<00:00:47.760> messes<00:00:48.120> up

gonna have to do all those it messes up

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.260 
gonna have to do all those it messes up
my<00:00:48.270> aim<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.809> stuff<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.649> had<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.430> change<00:00:50.969> the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
my aim and stuff so I had to change the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.630 
my aim and stuff so I had to change the
hand<00:00:51.719> placement<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.649> mouse<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.219> stuff<00:00:53.370> so

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
hand placement of the mouse and stuff so

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.720 
hand placement of the mouse and stuff so
what<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.390> did<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.840> made<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:55.020> macro<00:00:55.530> for<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.160> it

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
what I did I made a macro for it and it

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.790 
what I did I made a macro for it and it
does<00:00:56.910> all<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.300> by<00:00:57.480> itself<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.469> how

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
does all of it by itself and this is how

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.660 
does all of it by itself and this is how
powerful<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.640> just<00:00:59.940> watch<00:01:01.309> all<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
powerful it is just watch all of the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.729 
powerful it is just watch all of the
eight<00:01:02.760> shells<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.420> resin<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.870> like<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.290> second

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
eight shells in resin and like a second

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.920 
eight shells in resin and like a second
half<00:01:04.949> second<00:01:05.339> base<00:01:05.489> piece<00:01:05.700> oh<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.720> works

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
half second base piece oh and it works

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.250 
half second base piece oh and it works
with<00:01:07.110> all<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:08.390> semi-automatic<00:01:09.390> weapons<00:01:10.020> and

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
with all the semi-automatic weapons and

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.800 
with all the semi-automatic weapons and
you<00:01:10.920> can<00:01:11.070> make<00:01:12.140> you<00:01:13.140> can<00:01:13.170> make<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:14.360> macro<00:01:15.360> for

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
you can make you can make the macro for

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.270 
you can make you can make the macro for
pretty<00:01:16.080> much<00:01:16.170> every<00:01:16.500> Mouse<00:01:16.680> which<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.070> can

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
pretty much every Mouse which you can

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.469 
pretty much every Mouse which you can
that<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.299> programmable<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:20.210> you<00:01:21.210> can<00:01:21.360> also

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
that is programmable and you can also

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.480 
that is programmable and you can also
click<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:21.960> consoles<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.189> do<00:01:23.310> this

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
click on consoles you can do this

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.420 
click on consoles you can do this
without<00:01:24.299> it's<00:01:24.810> gonna<00:01:25.020> be<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.320> bit<00:01:25.560> bit<00:01:26.130> slower

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
without it's gonna be a bit bit slower

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.600 
without it's gonna be a bit bit slower
but<00:01:26.880> pretty<00:01:27.570> much<00:01:27.720> almost<00:01:28.530> like<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:28.979> just<00:01:29.460> by

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
but pretty much almost like this just by

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.520 
but pretty much almost like this just by
using<00:01:29.850> your<00:01:30.030> controller<00:01:30.450> button<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:31.110> PC<00:01:31.439> it's

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
using your controller button on PC it's

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.440 
using your controller button on PC it's
gonna<00:01:31.680> it's<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.310> bit<00:01:32.579> harder<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:32.970> do<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.299> so

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
gonna it's a bit harder to do it so

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.359 
gonna it's a bit harder to do it so
that's<00:01:33.570> why<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.780> made<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.960> macro<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.799> don't

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
that's why I made a macro and I don't

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.710 
that's why I made a macro and I don't
know<00:01:35.549> if<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:35.939> get<00:01:36.030> banned<00:01:36.299> for<00:01:36.509> using

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
know if you can get banned for using

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.520 
know if you can get banned for using
this<00:01:37.850> because<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:39.060> don't<00:01:39.360> see<00:01:39.450> twitching<00:01:40.200> it's

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
this because I don't see twitching it's

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.010 
this because I don't see twitching it's
not<00:01:40.710> like<00:01:41.130> you're<00:01:41.360> hacking<00:01:42.360> or<00:01:42.689> something

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
not like you're hacking or something

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.960 
not like you're hacking or something
that<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.290> know<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.619> might<00:01:43.829> get<00:01:44.009> banned

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
that I know you might get banned

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.630 
that I know you might get banned
I'm<00:01:45.270> not<00:01:45.450> sure<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:46.009> again<00:01:47.009> with<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.369> SMR

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
I'm not sure so again with the SMR

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.590 
I'm not sure so again with the SMR
and<00:01:50.640> also<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.180> works<00:01:51.390> with<00:01:51.540> pistols<00:01:53.150> and<00:01:54.150> I

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
and also it works with pistols and I

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.450 
and also it works with pistols and I
don't<00:01:54.750> know<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:55.080> is<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.350> just<00:01:55.890> crazy<00:01:56.250> old

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
don't know this is that just crazy old

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.680 
don't know this is that just crazy old
power<00:01:56.760> and<00:01:57.330> it<00:01:58.170> should<00:01:58.440> get<00:01:58.590> past<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.220> you<00:01:59.700> can

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
power and it should get past so you can
