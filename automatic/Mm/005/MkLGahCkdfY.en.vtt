00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.750 
hair and go left back I've gone at for
Luke<00:01:03.660> Shaw<00:01:03.899> they<00:01:04.830> kind<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.129> mix<00:01:05.309> up<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.580> bit

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
Luke Shaw they kind of mix up a bit

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.070 
Luke Shaw they kind of mix up a bit
there<00:01:06.119> could<00:01:06.299> be<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.420> chance<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.750> could<00:01:06.930> get

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
there could be a chance that could get

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.020 
there could be a chance that could get
someone<00:01:07.260> else<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.619> they<00:01:07.799> could<00:01:08.040> play<00:01:08.280> dolly

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
someone else in they could play dolly

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.000 
someone else in they could play dolly
blin<00:01:09.299> there<00:01:09.570> they<00:01:10.080> mix<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.439> up<00:01:10.500> she<00:01:10.740> was<00:01:10.799> very

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
blin there they mix it up she was very

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.740 
blin there they mix it up she was very
injury<00:01:11.369> prone<00:01:11.610> but<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:11.909> do<00:01:12.000> think<00:01:12.330> they<00:01:12.510> want

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
injury prone but I do think they want

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.570 
injury prone but I do think they want
him<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.049> be<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.680> starter<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.280> position

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
him to be the starter in that position

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.030 
him to be the starter in that position
so<00:01:15.060> I've<00:01:15.210> kept<00:01:15.479> him<00:01:15.630> there<00:01:15.810> left<00:01:16.650> center<00:01:16.799> back

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
so I've kept him there left center back

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.260 
so I've kept him there left center back
there's<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.310> few<00:01:17.490> players<00:01:17.700> for<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.060> role

a sort player you could really see going
to<00:01:57.960> unite<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.259> think<00:01:58.590> he'd<00:01:58.710> suit<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.040> system

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
to unite I think he'd suit the system

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.649 
to unite I think he'd suit the system
well<00:01:59.579> he's<00:01:59.700> pretty<00:01:59.909> slowly<00:02:00.180> defensively

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
well he's pretty slowly defensively

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.600 
well he's pretty slowly defensively
quality<00:02:01.140> going<00:02:01.320> forward<00:02:01.649> really<00:02:02.100> quick<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.549> I

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
quality going forward really quick and I

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.920 
quality going forward really quick and I
think<00:02:02.790> he'd<00:02:02.909> be<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> huge<00:02:03.390> sign<00:02:03.659> in<00:02:03.810> for

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
think he'd be a huge sign in for

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.709 
think he'd be a huge sign in for
Manchester<00:02:04.409> United<00:02:04.610> then<00:02:05.610> in<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.210> left

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:48.990 
I'm not sure how the balance would work
in<00:02:47.590> this<00:02:47.650> midfield<00:02:48.099> without<00:02:48.639> a<00:02:48.669> true

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
in this midfield without a true

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.429 
in this midfield without a true
defensive<00:02:49.329> midfielder<00:02:49.930> in<00:02:50.079> there<00:02:50.260> maybe

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:50.439 
defensive midfielder in there maybe

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:52.259 
defensive midfielder in there maybe
that's<00:02:50.650> where<00:02:50.859> blin<00:02:51.069> comes<00:02:51.370> in<00:02:51.609> but<00:02:51.819> something

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
that's where blin comes in but something

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.599 
that's where blin comes in but something
along<00:02:52.419> those<00:02:52.540> lines<00:02:52.659> but<00:02:53.319> vaguely<00:02:53.799> that's<00:02:54.430> how

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
along those lines but vaguely that's how

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.420 
along those lines but vaguely that's how
it<00:02:54.760> could<00:02:54.909> be<00:02:55.200> then<00:02:56.200> going<00:02:56.470> into<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:57.099> right

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
it could be then going into the right

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.459 
it could be then going into the right
midfield<00:02:58.060> position<00:02:58.239> I<00:02:58.629> think<00:02:58.989> it<00:02:59.109> will<00:02:59.169> be<00:02:59.260> one

00:02:59.459 --> 00:02:59.469 
midfield position I think it will be one

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:01.619 
midfield position I think it will be one
matter<00:02:59.739> over<00:02:59.980> there<00:03:00.219> since<00:03:00.760> summer<00:03:01.090> he's<00:03:01.450> been

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
matter over there since summer he's been

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:03.539 
matter over there since summer he's been
since<00:03:02.139> January<00:03:02.680> even<00:03:02.859> he's<00:03:03.010> been<00:03:03.159> absolutely

since January even he's been absolutely

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.459 
since January even he's been absolutely
fantastic<00:03:03.700> he<00:03:04.480> played<00:03:04.719> on<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:04.959> right<00:03:05.139> for<00:03:05.409> a

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:05.469 
fantastic he played on the right for a

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:07.619 
fantastic he played on the right for a
long<00:03:06.099> time<00:03:06.400> for<00:03:06.639> Chelsea<00:03:07.000> he's<00:03:07.180> one<00:03:07.450> of<00:03:07.569> the

is<00:03:08.799> no<00:03:09.069> doubt<00:03:09.370> in<00:03:09.400> that<00:03:09.639> and<00:03:10.150> I<00:03:10.239> think<00:03:10.299> you'd<00:03:10.540> be

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
insane not to put him in the squad and I

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.559 
insane not to put him in the squad and I

he<00:03:44.979> is<00:03:45.069> still<00:03:45.280> one<00:03:45.519> of<00:03:45.549> like<00:03:45.849> the<00:03:45.879> best

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
he is still one of like the best

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.699 
he is still one of like the best
footballers<00:03:46.750> in<00:03:46.780> the<00:03:46.989> world<00:03:47.139> he<00:03:47.319> hasn't<00:03:47.620> had

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
footballers in the world he hasn't had

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.319 
footballers in the world he hasn't had
the<00:03:47.829> best<00:03:48.040> season<00:03:48.220> but<00:03:48.759> I<00:03:48.790> think<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.090> best

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
the best season but I think the best

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.059 
the best season but I think the best
thing<00:03:49.419> to<00:03:49.540> look<00:03:49.750> at<00:03:49.930> is<00:03:49.989> and<00:03:50.349> again<00:03:50.709> some

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:52.559 
thing to look at is and again some
people<00:03:51.340> probably<00:03:51.489> disagree<00:03:52.150> with<00:03:52.269> me<00:03:52.389> but

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
people probably disagree with me but

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.170 
people probably disagree with me but
last<00:03:53.139> year<00:03:53.439> measurers<00:03:54.400> it<00:03:54.579> wasn't<00:03:54.939> the<00:03:55.030> most

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
last year measurers it wasn't the most

last year measurers it wasn't the most
sailed<00:03:55.479> player<00:03:55.720> he<00:03:55.900> wasn't<00:03:56.229> that<00:03:56.349> consistent

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:56.919 
sailed player he wasn't that consistent

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:58.559 
sailed player he wasn't that consistent
he<00:03:56.979> was<00:03:57.099> good<00:03:57.310> to<00:03:57.430> start<00:03:57.669> off<00:03:57.790> with<00:03:57.970> and<00:03:58.150> faded

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
he was good to start off with and faded

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:59.789 
he was good to start off with and faded
a<00:03:58.659> lot<00:03:58.840> towards<00:03:59.199> a<00:03:59.259> second<00:03:59.530> half<00:03:59.620> of<00:03:59.739> the

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
a lot towards a second half of the

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.280 
a lot towards a second half of the
season<00:03:59.949> kind<00:04:00.310> of<00:04:00.430> similarly<00:04:00.790> to<00:04:01.359> DeMaria<00:04:01.720> but

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
season kind of similarly to DeMaria but

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.429 
season kind of similarly to DeMaria but
this<00:04:03.099> since<00:04:03.579> January<00:04:04.030> ezzo<00:04:04.540> has<00:04:04.689> been<00:04:04.870> amazing

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:05.439 
this since January ezzo has been amazing

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:07.379 
this since January ezzo has been amazing
and<00:04:05.530> I<00:04:05.650> do<00:04:05.709> believe<00:04:06.220> di<00:04:06.699> Maria<00:04:06.849> is<00:04:07.150> going<00:04:07.329> to

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:07.389 
and I do believe di Maria is going to

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:08.849 
and I do believe di Maria is going to
come<00:04:07.540> good<00:04:07.720> for<00:04:07.840> United<00:04:08.229> I<00:04:08.319> don't<00:04:08.650> think

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
come good for United I don't think

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:10.080 
come good for United I don't think
they're<00:04:08.949> gonna<00:04:09.040> offload<00:04:09.250> him<00:04:09.519> and<00:04:09.669> I<00:04:09.699> do<00:04:09.759> think

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
they're gonna offload him and I do think

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.429 
they're gonna offload him and I do think
it's<00:04:10.299> going<00:04:10.389> to<00:04:10.479> come<00:04:10.659> good<00:04:10.840> next<00:04:11.139> year<00:04:11.290> and

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:11.439 
it's going to come good next year and

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:13.830 
it's going to come good next year and
have<00:04:11.859> an<00:04:11.889> absolutely<00:04:12.579> sensational<00:04:13.150> season<00:04:13.569> so

go<00:05:24.520> I<00:05:24.550> feel<00:05:24.820> like<00:05:24.940> he<00:05:25.120> works<00:05:25.360> their<00:05:25.570> system<00:05:25.900> too

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
go I feel like he works their system too

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.990 
go I feel like he works their system too
much<00:05:26.260> but<00:05:26.500> every<00:05:26.979> year<00:05:27.010> he<00:05:27.370> gets<00:05:27.550> linked<00:05:27.820> away

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
much but every year he gets linked away

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.909 
much but every year he gets linked away
and<00:05:28.389> he<00:05:28.479> is<00:05:28.570> heavily<00:05:28.900> linked<00:05:29.260> with<00:05:29.350> United<00:05:29.830> and

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
and he is heavily linked with United and

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:31.590 
and he is heavily linked with United and
I<00:05:29.950> feel<00:05:30.160> that<00:05:30.280> if<00:05:30.400> he<00:05:30.520> was<00:05:30.669> to<00:05:30.850> go<00:05:30.970> he'd<00:05:31.419> get

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
I feel that if he was to go he'd get

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.000 
I feel that if he was to go he'd get
that<00:05:31.750> striker<00:05:32.080> or<00:05:32.169> Rooney<00:05:32.590> would<00:05:32.710> probably

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
that striker or Rooney would probably

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.040 
that striker or Rooney would probably
