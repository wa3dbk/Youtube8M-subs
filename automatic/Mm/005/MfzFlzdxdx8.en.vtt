00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.190 
like that and he's just a lethal strike
and<00:02:11.430> my<00:02:11.550> opinion<00:02:11.879> on<00:02:11.970> this<00:02:12.090> game

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
and my opinion on this game

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.290 
and my opinion on this game
so<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.860> next<00:02:13.950> question<00:02:14.190> is<00:02:14.520> what<00:02:15.060> do<00:02:15.209> you

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
so the next question is what do you

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.750 
so the next question is what do you
think<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.629> wigan<00:02:16.110> athletic<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:16.800> Victor<00:02:17.280> Moses

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
think of wigan athletic and Victor Moses

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.339 
think of wigan athletic and Victor Moses
um<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:19.110> be<00:02:19.230> honest<00:02:19.620> nothing<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.870> don't<00:02:21.870> actually

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
um to be honest nothing I don't actually

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.770 
um to be honest nothing I don't actually
know<00:02:22.590> him<00:02:22.950> in<00:02:23.190> real<00:02:23.220> life<00:02:23.760> I<00:02:24.060> only<00:02:24.269> know<00:02:24.540> his

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
know him in real life I only know his

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.380 
know him in real life I only know his
card<00:02:25.110> in<00:02:25.440> FIFA<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.370> know<00:02:26.640> that<00:02:26.819> he's<00:02:27.030> got<00:02:27.269> an

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
card in FIFA and know that he's got an

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.330 
card in FIFA and know that he's got an
infinitely<00:02:27.870> so<00:02:28.230> probably<00:02:28.680> he<00:02:28.739> played<00:02:29.099> pretty

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
infinitely so probably he played pretty

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.670 
infinitely so probably he played pretty
well<00:02:29.459> this<00:02:29.849> season<00:02:30.180> but<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.510> can't<00:02:30.780> really<00:02:30.930> say

well this season but I can't really say

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.759 
well this season but I can't really say
more<00:02:31.920> about<00:02:32.010> that<00:02:32.130> um<00:02:33.349> this<00:02:34.349> question<00:02:34.680> is

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
more about that um this question is

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.740 
more about that um this question is

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
that and Germany

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.770 
that and Germany
would<00:04:27.750> have<00:04:27.870> been<00:04:27.979> yea<00:04:28.979> beaten<00:04:29.340> up<00:04:29.490> as<00:04:30.090> well<00:04:30.540> by

would have been yea beaten up as well by
Spain<00:04:31.110> in<00:04:31.259> my<00:04:31.350> opinion<00:04:31.650> so<00:04:31.949> I<00:04:32.220> think<00:04:33.210> that<00:04:33.360> was

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
Spain in my opinion so I think that was

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.010 
Spain in my opinion so I think that was
quite<00:04:33.720> a<00:04:33.780> humiliating<00:04:34.410> final<00:04:35.039> and<00:04:35.220> Germany

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
quite a humiliating final and Germany

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.060 
quite a humiliating final and Germany
yeah<00:04:37.820> kept<00:04:38.820> out<00:04:39.030> of<00:04:39.060> that<00:04:39.479> mess<00:04:39.840> so<00:04:40.169> once<00:04:40.949> again

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
yeah kept out of that mess so once again

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.100 
yeah kept out of that mess so once again
Congress<00:04:41.820> to<00:04:42.030> Italy<00:04:42.360> for<00:04:42.389> beating<00:04:42.900> germany

think the French team will succeed in
the<00:05:18.900> next<00:05:19.139> world<00:05:19.380> cup<00:05:19.620> if<00:05:19.860> you<00:05:20.070> know<00:05:20.280> ddd<00:05:20.849> show

the next world cup if you know ddd show
do<00:05:21.599> you<00:05:21.690> think<00:05:21.930> players<00:05:22.169> attitude<00:05:22.710> will

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
do you think players attitude will

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.610 
do you think players attitude will
change<00:05:22.949> with<00:05:23.430> them<00:05:24.199> first<00:05:25.199> of<00:05:25.320> all<00:05:25.380> i<00:05:25.440> think

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
change with them first of all i think

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.890 
change with them first of all i think
they<00:05:25.949> played<00:05:26.370> pretty<00:05:27.120> well<00:05:27.240> a<00:05:27.419> couple<00:05:27.750> of

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
they played pretty well a couple of

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.350 
they played pretty well a couple of
games<00:05:28.110> in<00:05:28.380> this<00:05:28.830> you'll<00:05:29.220> at<00:05:29.580> least<00:05:29.610> and<00:05:30.120> i

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
games in this you'll at least and i

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.810 
games in this you'll at least and i
think<00:05:30.780> they'll<00:05:31.169> definitely<00:05:31.470> play<00:05:32.340> better<00:05:32.580> in

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
think they'll definitely play better in

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.820 
think they'll definitely play better in
the<00:05:32.970> next<00:05:33.180> one<00:05:33.539> as<00:05:33.690> well<00:05:33.930> they've<00:05:34.470> got<00:05:34.680> great

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.409 
the next one as well they've got great
individual<00:05:35.490> players<00:05:35.789> the<00:05:35.970> problem<00:05:36.300> is

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
individual players the problem is

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.860 
individual players the problem is
probably<00:05:36.930> playing<00:05:37.650> together<00:05:38.039> as<00:05:38.430> a<00:05:38.789> team<00:05:38.870> by

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
probably playing together as a team by

probably playing together as a team by
the<00:05:39.900> front<00:05:40.229> especially<00:05:40.470> there<00:05:40.919> for<00:05:41.130> players

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
the front especially there for players

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.779 
the front especially there for players
like<00:05:41.460> we<00:05:41.789> worry<00:05:41.970> Benzema<00:05:42.780> Nasri<00:05:43.789> especially

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
these three players are very good in my

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.200 
these three players are very good in my
opinion<00:05:48.020> and<00:05:49.020> of<00:05:49.800> course<00:05:49.830> i<00:05:50.099> know<00:05:50.159> ddd<00:05:50.699> Sean<00:05:50.970> I

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
opinion and of course i know ddd Sean I

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.850 
opinion and of course i know ddd Sean I
mean<00:05:51.840> who<00:05:51.990> doesn't<00:05:52.229> from<00:05:52.740> the<00:05:53.090> world<00:05:54.090> cup<00:05:54.330> 1998

um I think on the pitch he had a great

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.290 
um I think on the pitch he had a great
personality<00:06:00.389> was<00:06:01.110> very<00:06:01.919> down<00:06:02.159> to<00:06:02.370> earth<00:06:02.400> so<00:06:03.000> if

personality was very down to earth so if

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.469 
personality was very down to earth so if

much<00:06:36.510> self-taught<00:06:37.050> I<00:06:37.229> mean<00:06:37.409> I<00:06:37.529> watched<00:06:37.860> some

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 
videos and that basically got me into

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.110 
videos and that basically got me into
trading<00:06:42.659> with<00:06:43.530> the<00:06:43.560> 59th<00:06:44.340> minute<00:06:44.460> technique
