00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
therefore hit an objective which I am

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.819 
therefore hit an objective which I am
not<00:02:00.090> aware<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.360> now<00:02:01.200> we're<00:02:01.380> not<00:02:01.469> going<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.710> be

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
not aware of now we're not going to be

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.889 
not aware of now we're not going to be
able<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.159> kill<00:02:02.490> 10<00:02:02.729> enemy<00:02:03.090> infantry<00:02:03.390> because

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
able to kill 10 enemy infantry because

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.630 
able to kill 10 enemy infantry because
their<00:02:04.020> else<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.350> makes<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.770> blue<00:02:05.070> screen<00:02:05.310> much

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
their else it makes the blue screen much

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.359 
their else it makes the blue screen much
more<00:02:05.820> difficult<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.420> we<00:02:07.350> are<00:02:07.409> not<00:02:07.860> going<00:02:08.190> to

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
more difficult and we are not going to

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.130 
more difficult and we are not going to
capture<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.819> enemy<00:02:09.030> HQ<00:02:09.239> which<00:02:09.569> we<00:02:09.810> could<00:02:10.110> have

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
capture the enemy HQ which we could have

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.390 
capture the enemy HQ which we could have
done<00:02:10.319> actually<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.800> could<00:02:11.069> have<00:02:11.099> done<00:02:11.250> that

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
done actually I could have done that

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.130 
done actually I could have done that
fairly<00:02:11.879> easily<00:02:12.060> all<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.390> have<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.690> do<00:02:12.840> is

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
fairly easily all you have to do is

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.620 
fairly easily all you have to do is
break<00:02:13.760> while<00:02:14.760> you're<00:02:14.910> doing<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.210> Blitzkrieg

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
break while you're doing the Blitzkrieg

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.840 
break while you're doing the Blitzkrieg
so<00:02:16.260> now<00:02:16.410> just<00:02:16.920> set<00:02:17.100> up<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.310> anti-tank<00:02:17.670> base

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
so now just set up the anti-tank base

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:18.980 
so now just set up the anti-tank base
and<00:02:18.060> right<00:02:18.209> away<00:02:18.390> what<00:02:18.569> you're<00:02:18.690> going<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:18.870> do

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
and right away what you're going to do

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.630 
and right away what you're going to do
it<00:02:19.110> is<00:02:19.290> you're<00:02:19.680> gonna<00:02:19.770> start<00:02:19.920> pumping<00:02:20.490> out<00:02:20.610> a

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
it is you're gonna start pumping out a

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.580 
it is you're gonna start pumping out a
bunch<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:21.150> lead<00:02:21.330> tanks<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:21.810> you're<00:02:21.930> all<00:02:22.140> gonna

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
bunch of lead tanks and you're all gonna

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.860 
bunch of lead tanks and you're all gonna
send<00:02:22.950> them<00:02:23.040> right<00:02:23.790> in<00:02:24.030> front<00:02:24.540> of<00:02:24.810> that

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
send them right in front of that

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.840 
send them right in front of that
infantry<00:02:25.709> base<00:02:25.860> because<00:02:26.250> or<00:02:26.430> else<00:02:26.640> that

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
infantry base because or else that

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.460 
infantry base because or else that
infantry<00:02:27.360> base<00:02:27.510> is<00:02:27.690> gonna<00:02:27.780> slow<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.319> down

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
infantry base is gonna slow you down

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.160 
infantry base is gonna slow you down
enough<00:02:28.920> for<00:02:28.950> him<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.340> get<00:02:29.430> tanks<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:30.180> it<00:02:30.990> did

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
enough for him to get tanks and it did

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.100 
enough for him to get tanks and it did
that<00:02:31.380> this<00:02:31.680> time<00:02:31.980> when<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:32.790> originally<00:02:33.110> figured

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
that this time when I originally figured

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.290 
that this time when I originally figured
out<00:02:34.200> this<00:02:34.410> tactic<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:35.220> was<00:02:35.670> able<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:35.940> push

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
out this tactic I was able to push

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.840 
out this tactic I was able to push
through<00:02:36.540> into<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.170> enemy's<00:02:37.470> base<00:02:37.850> without

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
through into the enemy's base without

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.090 
through into the enemy's base without
any<00:02:39.239> issues<00:02:39.690> now<00:02:40.260> this<00:02:40.440> time<00:02:40.590> what<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:40.830> little

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
any issues now this time what a little

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.309 
any issues now this time what a little
bit<00:02:41.280> different<00:02:41.940> because<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.780> don't<00:02:42.810> want<00:02:43.230> to

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
bit different because you don't want to

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.290 
bit different because you don't want to
give<00:02:43.560> him<00:02:43.680> time<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:43.980> pump<00:02:44.340> out<00:02:44.520> any<00:02:44.730> infantry

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
give him time to pump out any infantry

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.240 
give him time to pump out any infantry
so<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.230> want<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.560> get<00:02:46.620> that<00:02:46.800> right<00:02:46.890> away<00:02:47.010> now

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
so you want to get that right away now

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.740 
so you want to get that right away now
what<00:02:47.459> you<00:02:47.610> see<00:02:47.790> me<00:02:47.910> is<00:02:48.000> doing<00:02:48.360> is<00:02:48.450> I'm<00:02:48.570> moving

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
what you see me is doing is I'm moving

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.990 
what you see me is doing is I'm moving
my<00:02:49.020> armored<00:02:49.770> anti-tank<00:02:50.310> guns<00:02:50.520> to<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.790> side

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
my armored anti-tank guns to the side

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.610 
my armored anti-tank guns to the side
because<00:02:51.840> they're<00:02:52.019> gonna<00:02:52.110> be<00:02:52.290> in<00:02:52.350> a<00:02:52.410> position

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
because they're gonna be in a position

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.110 
because they're gonna be in a position
where<00:02:53.130> they're<00:02:53.250> gonna<00:02:53.370> be<00:02:53.550> able<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.880> cut<00:02:54.000> off

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
where they're gonna be able to cut off

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.479 
where they're gonna be able to cut off
you<00:02:54.420> see<00:02:54.570> those<00:02:54.720> two<00:02:54.989> supply<00:02:55.440> well<00:02:55.890> you<00:02:56.370> don't

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
you see those two supply well you don't

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:57.500 
you see those two supply well you don't
see<00:02:56.640> them<00:02:56.760> right<00:02:56.850> now<00:02:56.910> but<00:02:57.120> there<00:02:57.300> are<00:02:57.360> two

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
see them right now but there are two

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.960 
see them right now but there are two
supply<00:02:57.870> depots<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.860> my<00:02:58.980> left<00:02:59.250> over<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.760> river

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
supply depots to my left over the river

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.090 
supply depots to my left over the river
that<00:03:00.480> feed<00:03:00.810> on<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.260> same<00:03:01.500> Road

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
that feed on the same Road

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.830 
that feed on the same Road
so<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:02.489> set<00:03:02.790> up<00:03:02.880> your<00:03:03.000> anti-tank<00:03:03.480> guns<00:03:03.720> there

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
so you set up your anti-tank guns there

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.630 
so you set up your anti-tank guns there
so<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.440> they<00:03:04.620> can<00:03:04.680> cut<00:03:05.070> off<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.250> supply

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
so that they can cut off the supply

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.600 
so that they can cut off the supply
route<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.300> that<00:03:06.900> already<00:03:07.200> removes<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:08.280> good

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
route and that already removes a good

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.420 
route and that already removes a good
amount<00:03:08.880> of<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.470> ai's<00:03:10.470> funding<00:03:11.010> which<00:03:11.160> makes

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
amount of the ai's funding which makes

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.430 
amount of the ai's funding which makes
it<00:03:11.580> that<00:03:11.610> much<00:03:11.850> easier<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.209> take<00:03:12.390> it<00:03:12.450> down<00:03:12.720> so

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
it that much easier to take it down so

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.930 
it that much easier to take it down so
first<00:03:13.769> thing<00:03:13.950> you<00:03:13.980> want<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.280> do<00:03:14.400> is<00:03:14.519> get<00:03:14.700> rid<00:03:14.880> of

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
first thing you want to do is get rid of

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.390 
first thing you want to do is get rid of
that<00:03:15.269> infantry<00:03:15.780> base<00:03:15.930> because<00:03:16.830> that<00:03:17.100> causes

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
that infantry base because that causes

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.090 
that infantry base because that causes
the<00:03:17.760> enemy<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.239> get<00:03:18.390> some<00:03:18.690> three<00:03:18.930> units<00:03:19.410> now

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
the enemy to get some three units now

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.310 
the enemy to get some three units now
next<00:03:20.519> thing<00:03:20.640> you<00:03:20.850> want<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.090> do<00:03:21.239> is<00:03:21.630> start

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
next thing you want to do is start

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.770 
next thing you want to do is start
pressuring<00:03:23.220> now<00:03:23.640> usually<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.299> tanks<00:03:24.600> won't

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
pressuring now usually the tanks won't

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.900 
pressuring now usually the tanks won't
be<00:03:24.900> across<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.320> bridge<00:03:25.650> yet<00:03:25.920> but<00:03:26.519> I<00:03:26.700> was<00:03:26.880> a

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
be across the bridge yet but I was a

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.150 
be across the bridge yet but I was a
little<00:03:27.120> slow<00:03:27.510> on<00:03:27.540> this<00:03:27.780> one<00:03:27.959> as<00:03:28.110> I<00:03:28.230> said<00:03:28.470> so

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
little slow on this one as I said so

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.000 
little slow on this one as I said so

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
right away I'm starting to push on that

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.800 
right away I'm starting to push on that
bridge<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:32.459> you<00:03:32.670> just<00:03:33.030> want<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.239> keep<00:03:33.390> pumping

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
bridge and you just want to keep pumping

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.170 
bridge and you just want to keep pumping
out<00:03:33.930> those<00:03:34.590> lead<00:03:34.829> tanks<00:03:35.220> until<00:03:35.400> you're<00:03:35.910> close

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
out those lead tanks until you're close

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.520 
out those lead tanks until you're close
enough<00:03:36.209> that<00:03:36.630> you<00:03:36.750> can<00:03:36.900> take<00:03:37.049> a<00:03:37.079> shot<00:03:37.350> at<00:03:37.500> that

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
enough that you can take a shot at that

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.460 
enough that you can take a shot at that
tank<00:03:37.860> base<00:03:38.100> now<00:03:38.820> you<00:03:38.910> don't<00:03:39.329> want<00:03:39.600> to<00:03:39.810> take

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
tank base now you don't want to take

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.800 
tank base now you don't want to take
care<00:03:40.620> of<00:03:40.739> those<00:03:40.860> tanks<00:03:41.160> I<00:03:41.430> well<00:03:42.209> at<00:03:42.690> the

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
care of those tanks I well at the

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.330 
care of those tanks I well at the
beginning<00:03:43.019> I'm<00:03:43.170> just<00:03:43.410> taking<00:03:43.680> care<00:03:43.920> of<00:03:43.950> Tanks

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
beginning I'm just taking care of Tanks

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.160 
beginning I'm just taking care of Tanks
so<00:03:44.400> I<00:03:44.459> can<00:03:44.640> slowly<00:03:44.820> move<00:03:45.090> up<00:03:45.239> but<00:03:45.870> what<00:03:46.140> I

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
so I can slowly move up but what I

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.280 
so I can slowly move up but what I
eventually<00:03:46.290> end<00:03:47.040> up<00:03:47.220> doing<00:03:47.549> is<00:03:47.810> I<00:03:48.810> ended<00:03:49.230> up

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
eventually end up doing is I ended up

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.350 
eventually end up doing is I ended up
just<00:03:49.530> going<00:03:49.739> for<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.070> tank<00:03:50.730> base<00:03:50.970> and<00:03:51.269> you

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
just going for the tank base and you

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.449 
just going for the tank base and you
want<00:03:51.540> to<00:03:51.630> do<00:03:51.720> that<00:03:51.840> because<00:03:52.019> as<00:03:52.410> long<00:03:53.220> as<00:03:53.280> that

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
want to do that because as long as that

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.340 
want to do that because as long as that
tank<00:03:53.730> base<00:03:53.910> is<00:03:54.150> up<00:03:54.329> he's<00:03:54.630> just<00:03:54.750> gonna<00:03:55.019> be<00:03:55.200> able

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
tank base is up he's just gonna be able

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.199 
tank base is up he's just gonna be able
to<00:03:55.440> keep<00:03:55.650> pumping<00:03:55.860> out<00:03:56.190> as<00:03:56.400> many<00:03:56.610> tanks<00:03:56.880> as<00:03:57.090> you

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
to keep pumping out as many tanks as you

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.300 
to keep pumping out as many tanks as you
can<00:03:57.450> so<00:03:58.140> it's<00:03:58.320> just<00:03:58.500> gonna<00:03:58.680> end<00:03:58.799> up<00:03:59.040> being<00:03:59.160> a

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
can so it's just gonna end up being a

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.430 
can so it's just gonna end up being a
stalemate<00:03:59.549> so<00:03:59.850> what<00:04:00.000> you<00:04:00.090> want<00:04:00.269> to<00:04:00.360> do<00:04:00.480> is<00:04:01.049> keep

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
stalemate so what you want to do is keep

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.490 
stalemate so what you want to do is keep
pushing<00:04:01.680> and<00:04:02.130> go<00:04:03.120> for<00:04:03.299> that<00:04:03.390> base<00:04:03.570> now<00:04:03.840> what

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
pushing and go for that base now what

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
and a supply depot or two so now I'm

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.439 
and a supply depot or two so now I'm
doing<00:04:55.499> my<00:04:55.710> push<00:04:55.979> I've<00:04:56.400> taken<00:04:56.759> care<00:04:57.060> of<00:04:57.090> that

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
doing my push I've taken care of that

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.059 
doing my push I've taken care of that
tank<00:04:57.750> base<00:04:57.930> which<00:04:58.169> means<00:04:58.379> no<00:04:58.620> more<00:04:58.740> tanks

00:04:59.059 --> 00:04:59.069 
tank base which means no more tanks

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:01.730 
tank base which means no more tanks
which<00:04:59.310> means<00:04:59.610> no<00:05:00.120> more<00:05:00.300> resistance<00:05:00.870> this<00:05:01.590> is

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
which means no more resistance this is

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.619 
which means no more resistance this is
going<00:05:01.979> to<00:05:02.099> be<00:05:02.189> pretty<00:05:02.460> much<00:05:02.550> just<00:05:03.060> taking<00:05:03.330> down

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:03.629 
going to be pretty much just taking down

bit<00:05:37.379> longer<00:05:37.589> and<00:05:37.770> you're<00:05:37.889> gonna<00:05:38.009> have<00:05:38.159> to<00:05:38.250> go

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
bit longer and you're gonna have to go

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.459 
bit longer and you're gonna have to go
up<00:05:38.460> against<00:05:38.729> a<00:05:38.879> much<00:05:39.089> larger<00:05:39.509> tank<00:05:39.779> force<00:05:40.050> when

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:40.469 
up against a much larger tank force when

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:44.749 
up against a much larger tank force when
pushing<00:05:40.770> out<00:05:41.509> towards<00:05:42.509> him<00:05:42.750> and<00:05:43.759> that's

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 
pushing out towards him and that's

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:46.399 
pushing out towards him and that's
pretty<00:05:45.000> much<00:05:45.210> it<00:05:45.449> that's<00:05:45.629> the<00:05:45.870> tactic<00:05:46.229> just

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:46.409 
pretty much it that's the tactic just

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:48.409 
pretty much it that's the tactic just
blitzkrieg<00:05:47.159> it<00:05:47.399> seems<00:05:47.699> for<00:05:47.909> most<00:05:48.180> of<00:05:48.330> these

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 
blitzkrieg it seems for most of these

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:50.629 
blitzkrieg it seems for most of these
operation<00:05:49.139> missions<00:05:49.500> except<00:05:50.159> for<00:05:50.339> the<00:05:50.430> one

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 
operation missions except for the one

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.339 
operation missions except for the one
verse<00:05:50.909> well<00:05:51.330> not<00:05:51.539> actually<00:05:52.020> that's<00:05:52.199> not<00:05:52.259> true

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:52.349 
verse well not actually that's not true

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:54.379 
verse well not actually that's not true
but<00:05:52.680> for<00:05:53.129> one<00:05:53.310> of<00:05:53.399> the<00:05:53.550> one<00:05:53.699> verses<00:05:54.029> alls<00:05:54.210> you

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:54.389 
but for one of the one verses alls you

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:55.700 
but for one of the one verses alls you
can't<00:05:54.750> blitzkrieg<00:05:55.199> because<00:05:55.469> it's<00:05:55.620> a

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
can't blitzkrieg because it's a

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.209 
can't blitzkrieg because it's a
defensive<00:05:56.250> mission<00:05:56.550> but<00:05:57.270> right<00:05:58.080> now<00:05:58.289> what
