the agent openings are like we've Team

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.499 
the agent openings are like we've Team
of<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.189> Year<00:01:32.280> agent<00:01:32.520> openings<00:01:33.150> you're<00:01:33.360> more

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
of the Year agent openings you're more

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.580 
of the Year agent openings you're more
than<00:01:33.630> likely<00:01:33.689> going<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.079> get<00:01:34.229> some<00:01:34.409> decent

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
than likely going to get some decent

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.770 
than likely going to get some decent
decent<00:01:34.979> players<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.640> they're<00:01:36.299> obviously

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
decent players and they're obviously

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.929 
decent players and they're obviously
you're<00:01:37.439> very<00:01:37.799> very<00:01:38.040> limited<00:01:38.549> in<00:01:38.579> what<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.850> can

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
you're very very limited in what you can

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.090 
you're very very limited in what you can
do<00:01:39.240> here<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:39.960> we're<00:01:40.500> actually<00:01:40.590> not<00:01:40.770> getting

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
do here so we're actually not getting

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.990 
do here so we're actually not getting
close<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.850> elite<00:01:42.720> balls<00:01:43.049> now<00:01:43.820> but<00:01:44.820> maybe

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
close to the elite balls now but maybe

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.240 
close to the elite balls now but maybe
we<00:01:45.240> can<00:01:45.390> get<00:01:45.630> actually<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.649> don't<00:01:46.829> think<00:01:47.130> we

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
we can get actually I don't think we

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.530 
we can get actually I don't think we
need<00:01:47.340> any<00:01:47.579> players<00:01:47.729> together<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.360> probably

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
need any players together so I probably

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.030 
need any players together so I probably

I've been doing for that for the

foreseeable future well for the past in
the<00:04:06.370> foreseeable<00:04:06.819> future<00:04:07.030> so<00:04:07.959> this<00:04:08.410> is<00:04:08.440> a

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
the foreseeable future so this is a

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.170 
the foreseeable future so this is a
probably<00:04:09.160> a<00:04:09.250> low<00:04:09.400> chance<00:04:09.430> we're<00:04:09.850> gonna<00:04:09.940> hit<00:04:10.150> a

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
probably a low chance we're gonna hit a

probably a low chance we're gonna hit a
black<00:04:10.389> ball<00:04:10.600> here<00:04:10.980> straight<00:04:11.980> past<00:04:12.220> at<00:04:12.370> that

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
I slowed down way too fast that is

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.070 
I slowed down way too fast that is
ridiculous<00:04:16.900> so<00:04:17.560> yep<00:04:18.340> blackball<00:04:19.269> avoided

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
ridiculous so yep blackball avoided

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.120 
ridiculous so yep blackball avoided
