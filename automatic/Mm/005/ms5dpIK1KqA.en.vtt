00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 so you already know that from his 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.040
 remote controlled car is the problem 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.629
 over and over again that the shock absorbers 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.269
 so shipped when you with the 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.519
 on the way is that in principle 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.349
 relatively short time later the things 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.590
 have to exchange again or new 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.359
 must seal because simply from these 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.760
 seals here the oil comes out 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.359
 Of course it is not so healthy 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.760
 in particular, this can be the case in doubt 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.439
 rather expensive are remedy 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:32.399
 simply creates a simple medium 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:34.790
 For example, here from ri call this 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.380
 Let's see condoms for shock absorbers and 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.989
 these conservative ones are there for that 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.059
 here practically in these openings here 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.160
 to be taken completely until 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.120
 down the shock absorber piston 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.789
 seal 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.300
 then you can if it fits that 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.800
 rubber of the shock absorber still in the foot 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.800
 if he did not drop me in 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.090
 the foot of the shock absorber practically 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.340
 pinch and that's the whole thing 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.910
 completely protected as that looks 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.910
 we'll see you soon 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.210
 Yes 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.990
 as you notice here if I am 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.880
 then try to pull the rubber over 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.350
 it is the first attempt but here 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.000
 then you get stuck playing and that 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.220
 is a huge torture that's about it too 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.560
 get what you do in this case 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.979
 is a little bit of a game 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.369
 to take and thus just the head 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.869
 gently dampen the shock absorber 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.790
 has the property that someday 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.530
 It can also dry easily 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.880
 wash 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.420
 afterwards that should be relatively good here 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.420
 go over it 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.560
 without the whole shock absorber 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.259
 must disassemble because that's usually 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.259
 a problem lo and behold 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.210
 besides , you do not want the things 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:27.550
 destroying is also harder than me 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:41.320
 just accepted because it is now 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:42.970
 bit difficult to handle is the 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.200
 the whole thing out when it's done 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.790
 can be slightly compressed 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.400
 that there is no problem that forms 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.690
 then a nice vacuum in it 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.630
 that usually holds that pretty much 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.020
 long out I 've tested that as well 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.190
 there are still felix limit so 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.680
 another joke on the shock absorbers 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.180
 is that here a lot of dirt 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.610
 collects that means this progressive 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.110
 Suspension here is useful after here 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.340
 really sand over it is in principle 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.770
 nothing at all 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.780
 I do not really know why they are 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.280
 have thought that because the feathers 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.780
 also have about the same strength 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.210
 So it may be something else 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.890
 material at the end is a bit harder 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.150
 but basically the difference is almost 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.520
 already neglected 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.080
 Well, anyway, write one 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.030
 the cost is a bit high 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.610
 a little stupid for the user because two 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.330
 But I have to change my pen 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:34.090
 actually sausage so now that will be 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.710
 here one fixes one presses the simple one 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.710
 position and has a reasonably 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:42.280
 protected shock absorbers of the clear 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.800
 should last longer than before so after 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.660
 fiddling around for a surprisingly long time 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.120
 It looks like this now I can 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.800
 really just say a lot of play helps a lot 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.350
 you really should get a whole 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.270
 Apply quantity so that at all 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.370
 it's a bit about it 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:01.510
 more complicated than expected but that does 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.910
 nothing worth it because then they are 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.550
 damper pistons protected against sand and 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.250
 water and all sorts of cheese and me 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.660
 think that's definitely worth it 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.310
 looks the whole in the end I have 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.510
 now the old server chips ssh 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.299
 and raised again 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.420
 that somehow makes the whole thing again 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.799
 the certain character and then 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.310
 we'll go outside right away 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.760
 a round turn around baku 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.610
 how the horse writes and works well 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.200
 by the way, the channel is the button 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.889
 meanwhile somewhere below that 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.750
 Video 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.639
 I'm also looking forward to yours 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.340
 comments and i have a facebook 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.669
 page tends and weighs commentary as we 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.669
 see you later
