00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.719
 3 a top when are you hello the 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.910
 brigade at dakar 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:26.640
 what said that I lose my 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:28.680
 dogs we will try to make squares 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.150
 the rating is that it's not very 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.489
 thick so we will make the mud a little 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.380
 bigger agree and then after as 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.730
 and as we get to the middle it's 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.879
 an opportunity like that the cubes rather 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:48.090
 a corpus is cut in half for the 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:50.219
 middle bike we take sick and then 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.860
 the eardrum is a bit like that it makes 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.600
 go out all the guys do the fish and 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.930
 Sap vegetables at the same thigh are 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.280
 agree or not so well yeah it is 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.800
 so this one must be careful 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.930
 because after we will not put any 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.150
 both agree to put me a little 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.850
 because after some time if you put 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.189
 all at once it will cool super 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.210
 quickly and after that it will boil and not 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:18.060
 cook little trick for skewers 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.670
 it is to put the next ones in 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.500
 water like that they will not burn when 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.920
 we put them on the back on crutches then 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.250
 we're going to make a kid who I take a 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:35.250
 normal cloth after that which is clean 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:37.229
 and I put the cucumber in it and I 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.100
 will save them we remove all the water 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.799
 like that we 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.700
 really hold a lot of water we're going 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:49.020
 do not press too hard it will crush 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.240
 is well supported still agree it is 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.220

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.880

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:18.620
