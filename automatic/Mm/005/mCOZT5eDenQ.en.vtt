00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
which to be quite honest I think this

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.550 
which to be quite honest I think this
guy's<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.070> really<00:01:38.759> really<00:01:39.630> cool<00:01:39.810> figure<00:01:40.170> now

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
guy's a really really cool figure now

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.289 
guy's a really really cool figure now
he's<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.799> little<00:01:40.979> bit<00:01:41.100> lacking<00:01:41.369> as<00:01:41.729> far<00:01:41.790> as<00:01:42.030> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
he's a little bit lacking as far as the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.690 
he's a little bit lacking as far as the
paint<00:01:42.840> applications<00:01:43.560> go<00:01:44.220> because<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.460> mean<00:01:44.610> you

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
paint applications go because I mean you

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.490 
paint applications go because I mean you
can<00:01:44.820> see<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.060> he's<00:01:45.149> mostly<00:01:45.600> just<00:01:45.810> gray<00:01:46.140> here

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
can see that he's mostly just gray here

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.859 
can see that he's mostly just gray here
it's<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.950> little<00:01:47.070> bit<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.310> red<00:01:47.490> here<00:01:47.939> but<00:01:48.689> the

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
it's a little bit of red here but the

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.530 
it's a little bit of red here but the
the<00:01:49.290> face<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.920> do<00:01:50.250> want<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.790> point<00:01:51.149> this<00:01:51.329> out

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
the face I do want to point this out

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.620 
the face I do want to point this out
that<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.860> dead-on<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.939> what<00:01:54.390> he<00:01:54.450> looks

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
that that is dead-on to what he looks

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.690 
that that is dead-on to what he looks
like<00:01:54.750> in<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.350> cartoon<00:01:55.829> or<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.100> anime<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.430> mean

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
like in the cartoon or the anime I mean

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.929 
like in the cartoon or the anime I mean
that<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:57.090> just<00:01:57.119> fantastic<00:01:58.219> he<00:01:59.219> does<00:01:59.610> rotate

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
that is just fantastic he does rotate

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.910 
that is just fantastic he does rotate
here<00:02:00.420> his<00:02:00.659> face<00:02:00.960> starts<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.350> kind<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.590> hit<00:02:01.770> the

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
here his face starts to kind of hit the

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.190 
here his face starts to kind of hit the
side<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:03.509> really<00:02:03.689> doesn't<00:02:03.930> matter

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
side and it really doesn't matter

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.020 
side and it really doesn't matter
because<00:02:04.380> if<00:02:04.680> he<00:02:04.799> even<00:02:05.009> looked<00:02:05.399> this<00:02:05.520> way<00:02:05.759> then

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
because if he even looked this way then

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.429 
because if he even looked this way then
he's<00:02:06.210> not<00:02:06.360> gonna<00:02:06.479> be<00:02:06.600> able<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.780> see<00:02:06.960> past<00:02:07.170> there

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
he's not gonna be able to see past there

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.979 
he's not gonna be able to see past there
but<00:02:07.680> very<00:02:08.220> cool<00:02:08.940> does<00:02:09.330> have<00:02:09.479> quite<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.780> bit<00:02:09.959> of

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
but very cool does have quite a bit of

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.589 
but very cool does have quite a bit of
articulation<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:10.800> guy

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
articulation this guy

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.160 
articulation this guy
and<00:02:12.989> he<00:02:13.260> also<00:02:13.469> comes<00:02:13.859> packed<00:02:14.310> with<00:02:14.870> his<00:02:15.870> feet

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
and he also comes packed with his feet

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.199 
and he also comes packed with his feet
taken<00:02:16.859> off<00:02:17.010> so<00:02:17.370> let<00:02:17.549> me<00:02:17.609> see<00:02:17.700> if<00:02:17.790> I<00:02:17.879> can<00:02:18.060> pull

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
taken off so let me see if I can pull

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.670 
taken off so let me see if I can pull
those<00:02:18.329> off<00:02:18.480> real<00:02:18.629> quick<00:02:18.810> or<00:02:19.049> are<00:02:19.379> they<00:02:19.530> on

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
those off real quick or are they on

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.750 
those off real quick or are they on
their<00:02:19.799> own<00:02:19.889> once<00:02:20.069> they're<00:02:20.219> on<00:02:20.310> they're<00:02:20.519> not

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
their own once they're on they're not

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.940 
their own once they're on they're not
sure<00:02:21.299> I<00:02:21.540> guess<00:02:22.349> they're<00:02:22.499> on<00:02:22.620> they're<00:02:22.799> pretty

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
sure I guess they're on they're pretty

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.300 
sure I guess they're on they're pretty
good<00:02:23.099> so<00:02:23.629> they<00:02:24.629> do<00:02:24.689> come<00:02:25.079> off<00:02:25.319> and<00:02:25.829> they're

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
good so they do come off and they're

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.069 
good so they do come off and they're
like<00:02:26.609> laying<00:02:26.939> down<00:02:27.150> here<00:02:27.359> you<00:02:27.510> end<00:02:27.719> up<00:02:27.840> putting

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
like laying down here you end up putting

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:30.259 
like laying down here you end up putting
them<00:02:28.319> on<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.950> it's<00:02:29.609> where<00:02:29.849> you<00:02:30.090> know<00:02:30.150> the

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
them on and it's where you know the

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.220 
them on and it's where you know the
right<00:02:30.420> foot<00:02:30.599> goes<00:02:30.719> on<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.900> right<00:02:31.049> and<00:02:31.170> the

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
right foot goes on the right and the

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.349 
right foot goes on the right and the
left<00:02:31.349> goes<00:02:31.469> on<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.739> left<00:02:31.950> so<00:02:32.129> you<00:02:32.310> can't<00:02:32.969> mess

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.359 
left goes on the left so you can't mess

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:34.429 
left goes on the left so you can't mess
it<00:02:33.389> up<00:02:33.569> because<00:02:33.719> they<00:02:33.900> won't<00:02:34.019> fit<00:02:34.260> on<00:02:34.290> there

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
it up because they won't fit on there

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.949 
it up because they won't fit on there
anyways<00:02:35.219> but<00:02:35.909> as<00:02:36.000> far<00:02:36.180> as<00:02:36.209> articulation<00:02:36.840> with

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
anyways but as far as articulation with

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.750 
anyways but as far as articulation with
this<00:02:37.079> gun<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.500> showed<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.189> head<00:02:38.340> he<00:02:38.549> does

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
this gun I showed you the head he does

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.110 
this gun I showed you the head he does
rotate<00:02:39.019> here<00:02:40.019> so<00:02:40.409> his<00:02:40.709> suit<00:02:41.099> actually<00:02:41.430> rotates

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
rotate here so his suit actually rotates

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.420 
rotate here so his suit actually rotates
which<00:02:42.359> is<00:02:42.510> really<00:02:42.870> cool<00:02:43.079> I<00:02:43.319> can<00:02:43.799> move<00:02:43.919> that<00:02:44.129> way

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
which is really cool I can move that way

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.059 
which is really cool I can move that way
as<00:02:44.700> well<00:02:45.090> this<00:02:45.659> arm<00:02:45.959> he<00:02:46.260> does<00:02:46.530> have<00:02:46.739> quite<00:02:47.010> a

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
as well this arm he does have quite a

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.429 
as well this arm he does have quite a
bit<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.549> you<00:02:48.450> know<00:02:48.480> movement<00:02:48.540> there<00:02:49.139> so<00:02:49.319> this

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:49.439 
bit of you know movement there so this

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:51.649 
bit of you know movement there so this
goes<00:02:49.650> back<00:02:49.889> and<00:02:50.129> forth<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.730> it's<00:02:51.239> hindered<00:02:51.569> a

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
goes back and forth and it's hindered a

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.569 
goes back and forth and it's hindered a
little<00:02:51.900> bit<00:02:52.019> just<00:02:52.199> because<00:02:52.500> this<00:02:53.010> piece<00:02:53.280> comes

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
little bit just because this piece comes

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.189 
little bit just because this piece comes
down<00:02:53.819> but<00:02:54.120> that's<00:02:54.359> as<00:02:54.480> far<00:02:54.510> as<00:02:54.689> it<00:02:54.840> can<00:02:54.900> go<00:02:54.959> out

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:55.199 
down but that's as far as it can go out

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:57.349 
down but that's as far as it can go out
but<00:02:55.409> it<00:02:55.500> can<00:02:55.620> go<00:02:55.709> forward<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.340> back<00:02:56.730> then<00:02:57.329> you

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
but it can go forward and back then you

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.240 
but it can go forward and back then you
can<00:02:57.540> also<00:02:57.659> you<00:02:57.780> know<00:02:57.900> move<00:02:58.109> there<00:02:58.319> again<00:02:58.620> then

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
can also you know move there again then

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.270

figures for the bad guys same on the

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.599 
figures for the bad guys same on the
other<00:03:12.930> arm<00:03:13.199> does<00:03:13.680> have<00:03:13.889> waist<00:03:14.219> articulation

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609

as<00:03:15.419> well<00:03:15.659> the<00:03:16.169> legs<00:03:16.469> can<00:03:16.859> spread<00:03:17.250> apart<00:03:17.639> or<00:03:18.060> get

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:18.689 
as well the legs can spread apart or get

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:21.110 
as well the legs can spread apart or get
right<00:03:18.959> next<00:03:19.169> to<00:03:19.379> each<00:03:19.530> other<00:03:19.680> go<00:03:20.220> back<00:03:20.879> and

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
right next to each other go back and

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.149 
right next to each other go back and
forth<00:03:21.509> throwing<00:03:21.840> ball<00:03:22.109> joints<00:03:22.530> bends<00:03:22.859> at<00:03:23.129> the

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159 
forth throwing ball joints bends at the

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:26.030 
forth throwing ball joints bends at the
knee<00:03:23.509> so<00:03:24.509> this<00:03:24.870> guy<00:03:25.019> is<00:03:25.079> far<00:03:25.409> so<00:03:25.500> articulation

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
knee so this guy is far so articulation

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.679 
knee so this guy is far so articulation
I<00:03:26.159> think<00:03:26.400> he's<00:03:26.519> one<00:03:26.759> of<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.939> best<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.359> be<00:03:27.479> quite

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:27.689 
I think he's one of the best to be quite

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:31.879 
I think he's one of the best to be quite
honest<00:03:28.019> as<00:03:28.290> far<00:03:29.220> as<00:03:29.569> size<00:03:30.569> comparison<00:03:31.229> Casey

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:35.939 
four-minute reviews it's probably one of
