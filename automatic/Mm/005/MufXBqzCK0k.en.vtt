 past 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.329

 wz 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.510
 this is broken said 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.140
 this can be through the medium but 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.140

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:37.860
 this is a car stone 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.860
 if you do not do as you do not know how to shoot yourself 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.469
 for the part 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.310

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.150
 ay ay ay ay 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:59.120
 ay ay ay ay ay what has happened 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.120
 although to miss the step of chasing him 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.210
 I am the truth to follow a little 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.479
 no this is not so fast as to 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.479
 do what 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.450
 the other side have not won it already would have 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.450
 what to do again 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.450
 a green 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.450
 to add up here when doing 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.620
 they are all painted so 25 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.620
 from base and this 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.340
 the average pressure be 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.340
 in clear karma 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.909
 they had carried the 205 I think 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.909
 break everything 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.909
 we give the artist and as 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.780
 it was a shot since it did not come to anything 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.410
 the problem with this car comes when 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.940
 more uphill like the cookie you 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.460
 which of 32 wool accelerates or something 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.080
 maybe they have put a little less 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.870
 of resistance to the terrain that are usually 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.850
 do it and then they never say it because 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.460
 I would swear that between 32 will be slower 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:43.090
 than this one and go at the speed that goes 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:46.000
 the uphill is pulling to pcr 35 2 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.990
 nothing happens, nothing happens 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.990
 no problem 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.170
 and nothing happens hammel there you are thank you 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.599

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.060
 single 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:14.660
 only 2100 of the year I shit in milk 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:17.769

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:21.000

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.000
