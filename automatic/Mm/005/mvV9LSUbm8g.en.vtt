00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.420 

translation<00:00:04.410> is<00:00:04.500> the<00:00:04.650> second<00:00:05.069> half<00:00:05.279> of

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
translation is the second half of

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.829 
translation is the second half of
protein<00:00:05.850> synthesis<00:00:06.359> now<00:00:06.390> it's<00:00:06.629> called

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
protein synthesis now it's called

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.150 
protein synthesis now it's called
translation<00:00:07.529> because<00:00:07.620> you're<00:00:07.799> taking<00:00:08.069> a

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
translation because you're taking a

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.089 
translation because you're taking a
sequence<00:00:08.400> of<00:00:08.849> a's<00:00:09.510> used<00:00:10.139> G's<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.620> C's<00:00:10.860> from

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
sequence of a's used G's and C's from

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.890 
sequence of a's used G's and C's from
RNA<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:11.940> you're<00:00:12.210> turning<00:00:12.540> them<00:00:12.660> into<00:00:12.809> a

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
RNA and you're turning them into a

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.169 
RNA and you're turning them into a
sequence<00:00:13.230> of<00:00:13.410> amino<00:00:13.500> acids<00:00:14.280> which<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:15.059> the

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
sequence of amino acids which is the

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.750 
sequence of amino acids which is the
language<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.690> proteins<00:00:16.500> so<00:00:16.980> you're<00:00:17.340> having<00:00:17.670> to

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
language of proteins so you're having to

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.939 
language of proteins so you're having to
go<00:00:18.090> from<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.330> nucleic<00:00:18.630> acid<00:00:19.020> language<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.770> the

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
go from the nucleic acid language to the

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.170 
go from the nucleic acid language to the
protein<00:00:20.310> language<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.760> that's<00:00:20.880> why<00:00:21.029> they

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
protein language and that's why they

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.080 
protein language and that's why they
call<00:00:21.330> translation<00:00:21.960> now<00:00:22.710> it's<00:00:23.039> done<00:00:23.369> primarily

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
call translation now it's done primarily

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.390 
call translation now it's done primarily

brings up what are the steps of
translation<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.090> then<00:00:51.420> general<00:00:52.110> they're

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
translation and then general they're

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.650 
translation and then general they're
called<00:00:53.129> initiation<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:53.969> that's<00:00:54.329> where<00:00:54.570> you

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
called initiation and that's where you

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.450 
called initiation and that's where you
bring<00:00:54.899> together<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.469> two<00:00:55.800> halves<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
ribosome the small and the large subunit

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.979 
ribosome the small and the large subunit
you<00:00:59.010> bring<00:00:59.309> together<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.870> messenger<00:01:00.870> RNA

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
you bring together the messenger RNA

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.020 
you bring together the messenger RNA
with<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.859> small<00:01:02.160> subunit<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.820> bring

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
with that small subunit you bring

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.899 
with that small subunit you bring
together<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.600> tRNA<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.769> begins<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.309> as<00:01:05.430> well

as any other required factors then

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.730 
as any other required factors then
elongation<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.930> where<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.229> start<00:01:10.470> adding

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
elongation is where you start adding

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.000 
elongation is where you start adding
more<00:01:11.010> amino<00:01:11.460> acids<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.840> growing<00:01:13.080> chain<00:01:13.229> or

more amino acids to the growing chain or

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.670 
more amino acids to the growing chain or
protein<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.060> finally<00:01:15.689> termination<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.530> when

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
protein and finally termination is when

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.770 
protein and finally termination is when
you<00:01:16.770> end<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.159> process<00:01:17.670> now<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.390> can<00:01:18.630> see

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
you end this process now you can see

to the codon again our enzyme joins the

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.050 
to the codon again our enzyme joins the
next<00:03:49.500> amino<00:03:49.739> acid<00:03:50.130> to<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.310> growing<00:03:50.519> chain<00:03:50.609> and

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
next amino acid to the growing chain and

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.789 
next amino acid to the growing chain and
that's<00:03:51.630> what's<00:03:51.900> happening<00:03:52.290> we're<00:03:52.440> just<00:03:52.590> going

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
that's what's happening we're just going

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.780 
that's what's happening we're just going
on<00:03:53.840> adding<00:03:54.840> in<00:03:54.989> amino<00:03:55.349> acids<00:03:55.829> till<00:03:56.190> finally

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
on adding in amino acids till finally

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.589 
on adding in amino acids till finally
we're<00:03:57.180> going<00:03:57.359> to<00:03:57.510> hit<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.930> stop<00:03:58.200> codon<00:03:58.680> and

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
we're going to hit the stop codon and

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.440 
we're going to hit the stop codon and
the<00:04:00.919> protein<00:04:01.919> will<00:04:02.069> be<00:04:02.160> broken<00:04:02.489> off<00:04:02.730> from<00:04:03.030> the

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
the protein will be broken off from the

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.420 
the protein will be broken off from the
last<00:04:03.750> tRNA<00:04:04.349> and<00:04:04.500> everything<00:04:04.980> will<00:04:05.099> just<00:04:05.130> fall

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
last tRNA and everything will just fall

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.819 
last tRNA and everything will just fall
apart<00:04:05.549> helped<00:04:06.090> by<00:04:06.269> termination<00:04:07.049> factors<00:04:07.620> and

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
apart helped by termination factors and

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:12.510 
apart helped by termination factors and
that's<00:04:09.109> translation

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520
