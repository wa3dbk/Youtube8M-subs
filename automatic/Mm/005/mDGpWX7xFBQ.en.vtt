00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.340
 recorded to video overclocking on the road 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:11.660
 pure snow sleep is not visible at all 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:17.059
 liquid gas we have gasoline car partner 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.059
 so let's say start-up 2 500 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:25.560
 crap start up let's say 3 500 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.980
 she is 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:59.360
 snow on my road next time 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:04.000
 clan 3 transfers 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.000
 up of paul custom 6 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:27.260
 at the end of the floor acceleration a bit far 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.260
 Now we will eat slides 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:36.080
 try 4 now 4 ride down the hill 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.680
 and for what 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.450
 man full 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.450
 generally consider 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.610
 post office 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:17.170
 road readable amikacin engage 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.170
 anything 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:30.760
 so now we will reach the end straight 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.760
 try overclocking again 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:07.140
 so here is our little snow unfortunately 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.140
 so with 3,500 we went 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.180
 but 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.760
 Well, somehow so while accelerates 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:45.150
 goes on a computer 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:51.080
 Now let's stop here with an arrow 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:52.379
 empty here i'm pointing with my finger somewhere 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.799
 065 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:57.420
 they show leaks I was eight 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:03.930
 thousand that is, periodically 8 thousand 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:06.989
 dollars at idle I'm a mixture of 16 like this 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.379
 Be it in my mix 13 this is how the 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.400
 So 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.400
 let's see
