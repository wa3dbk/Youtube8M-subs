welcome everyone to serious i'm going to
do<00:00:04.160> it's<00:00:05.160> basically<00:00:05.549> recording<00:00:06.150> my<00:00:06.299> progress

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
do it's basically recording my progress

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.259 
do it's basically recording my progress
of<00:00:06.990> making<00:00:07.680> pong<00:00:08.040> in<00:00:08.340> Minecraft<00:00:08.820> using

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
of making pong in Minecraft using

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.209 
of making pong in Minecraft using
redstone<00:00:10.429> now<00:00:11.429> I've<00:00:11.759> already<00:00:12.000> made<00:00:12.860> one<00:00:13.860> pong

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
redstone now I've already made one pong

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.460 
redstone now I've already made one pong
game<00:00:15.120> but<00:00:16.049> it<00:00:16.410> used<00:00:16.760> lots<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.940> mods<00:00:18.470> mostly

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
game but it used lots of mods mostly

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.090 
game but it used lots of mods mostly
redstone<00:00:20.060> so<00:00:21.060> centered<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.769> was<00:00:22.920> very

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
redstone so centered and it was very

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.890 
redstone so centered and it was very
buggy<00:00:23.480> so<00:00:24.480> now<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:25.430> think<00:00:26.430> I'm<00:00:27.119> finally<00:00:27.480> going

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
buggy so now I think I'm finally going

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.589 
buggy so now I think I'm finally going
to<00:00:28.109> do<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.380> vanilla<00:00:29.010> except<00:00:29.519> one<00:00:29.970> mod<00:00:30.269> which

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
to do it vanilla except one mod which

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.709 
to do it vanilla except one mod which
I'll<00:00:31.019> show<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.320> later<00:00:32.030> anyway<00:00:33.030> this<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.450> part

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
I'll show you later anyway this is part

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.010 
I'll show you later anyway this is part
one<00:00:33.989> which<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:35.010> screen<00:00:35.480> which<00:00:36.480> may<00:00:36.719> be<00:00:36.750> the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
one which is the screen which may be the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.240 
one which is the screen which may be the
hardest<00:00:37.050> part<00:00:37.790> now<00:00:38.790> for<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.870> screen<00:00:40.250> I'm

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
hardest part now for the screen I'm

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.900 
hardest part now for the screen I'm
going<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:42.149> basically<00:00:42.510> use<00:00:42.960> end<00:00:43.860> gates<00:00:44.219> here<00:00:44.850> I

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
going to basically use end gates here I

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.729 
going to basically use end gates here I
have<00:00:45.120> one<00:00:45.360> simple<00:00:45.750> one<00:00:46.550> so<00:00:47.550> if<00:00:48.379> both<00:00:49.379> inputs

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
have one simple one so if both inputs

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.900 
have one simple one so if both inputs
are<00:00:50.340> on<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:51.030> output<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.480> on<00:00:51.750> as<00:00:51.870> well<00:00:52.460> now<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
are on the output is on as well now the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.630 
are on the output is on as well now the
punk<00:00:54.180> screen<00:00:54.600> needs<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:55.079> display<00:00:55.530> one<00:00:56.129> pixel

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
punk screen needs to display one pixel

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.569 
punk screen needs to display one pixel
at<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.940> time<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.539> ball<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.370> for<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.579> I<00:01:00.079> I<00:01:01.079> need

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
at a time the ball and for that I I need

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.359 
at a time the ball and for that I I need
screen<00:01:02.579> size<00:01:03.000> 16<00:01:03.930> by<00:01:04.170> eight<00:01:04.409> that's<00:01:05.189> my

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
screen size 16 by eight that's my

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.750 
screen size 16 by eight that's my
resolution<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.750> will<00:01:06.900> be<00:01:07.110> using<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.760> vertical

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
resolution that will be using a vertical

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.420 
resolution that will be using a vertical
end<00:01:08.970> gate<00:01:09.210> which<00:01:09.479> I've<00:01:09.750> designed<00:01:10.220> here<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.340> the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
end gate which I've designed here is the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.770 
end gate which I've designed here is the
output<00:01:11.640> currently<00:01:12.360> off<00:01:13.970> still<00:01:14.970> off<00:01:15.210> only<00:01:15.689> if

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
output currently off still off only if

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.020 
output currently off still off only if
both<00:01:15.960> are<00:01:16.020> on<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.650> will<00:01:16.890> be<00:01:17.040> on<00:01:17.220> it's<00:01:17.759> pretty

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
both are on it will be on it's pretty

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.440 
both are on it will be on it's pretty
simple<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.479> can<00:01:18.720> figure<00:01:18.960> out<00:01:19.110> how<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.710> works

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
simple you can figure out how it works

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.109 
simple you can figure out how it works
because<00:01:21.450> if<00:01:22.049> either<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.650> those<00:01:23.040> are<00:01:23.580> not<00:01:24.210> on

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
because if either of those are not on

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:32.630 
because if either of those are not on
this<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.479> on<00:01:27.810> basically<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.720> this<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.869> off<00:01:31.640> so

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
this is on basically and this is off so

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.289 
this is on basically and this is off so
first<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.540> all<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:34.400> what<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.430> call<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.729> strip

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
first of all I have what I call a strip

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.450 
first of all I have what I call a strip
of<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:38.299> actual<00:01:39.299> screen<00:01:39.770> this<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.920> basically

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
of the actual screen this is basically

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.630 
of the actual screen this is basically
and<00:01:42.740> 1<00:01:43.740> pixel<00:01:44.100> x<00:01:44.340> eight<00:01:44.990> and<00:01:45.990> one<00:01:46.320> with<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.950> tight

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
and 1 pixel x eight and one with a tight

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.429 
and 1 pixel x eight and one with a tight
and<00:01:49.070> basically<00:01:50.070> having<00:01:50.399> 16<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:51.090> those<00:01:51.270> make<00:01:52.229> up

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
and basically having 16 of those make up

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:59.060 
and basically having 16 of those make up
the<00:01:52.590> whole<00:01:52.770> screen<00:01:53.009> now<00:01:53.729> i<00:01:54.170> use<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:57.560> x<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.950> y

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
the whole screen now i use a x and y

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.859 
the whole screen now i use a x and y
coordinates<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.909> determine<00:02:00.390> where<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.689> ball

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
coordinates to determine where the ball

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.139 
coordinates to determine where the ball
is<00:02:00.899> so<00:02:01.649> i<00:02:01.680> need<00:02:01.890> x<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.340> y<00:02:02.399> coordinates<00:02:02.939> to

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
is so i need x and y coordinates to

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.310 
is so i need x and y coordinates to
determine<00:02:03.860> where<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.130> light<00:02:05.549> will<00:02:06.270> be<00:02:06.479> in<00:02:06.750> the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
determine where the light will be in the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.880 
determine where the light will be in the
screen<00:02:08.209> so<00:02:09.209> here<00:02:09.810> we<00:02:09.929> have

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
screen so here we have

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.860 
screen so here we have
the<00:02:11.220> strip<00:02:11.550> these<00:02:11.850> are<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.300> Y<00:02:12.600> coordinates

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
the strip these are the Y coordinates

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.949 
the strip these are the Y coordinates
and<00:02:13.440> this<00:02:13.860> is<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.310> x-coordinate<00:02:15.060> there<00:02:15.420> with

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
and this is the x-coordinate there with

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.230 
and this is the x-coordinate there with
now<00:02:16.800> when<00:02:16.980> this<00:02:17.100> is<00:02:17.280> on<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.700> one<00:02:18.600> of<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:20.240> Y

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
now when this is on and one of the Y

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.530 
now when this is on and one of the Y
coordinates<00:02:21.450> are<00:02:21.840> on<00:02:21.990> a<00:02:22.370> spot<00:02:23.370> will<00:02:23.730> light<00:02:24.300> up

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
coordinates are on a spot will light up

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.920 
coordinates are on a spot will light up
so<00:02:24.959> now<00:02:25.800> we<00:02:25.860> have<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:27.300> Exxon<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:29.930> highest

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
so now we have the Exxon and the highest

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.510 
so now we have the Exxon and the highest
Y<00:02:31.440> on<00:02:31.650> which<00:02:31.920> means<00:02:32.270> that<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:34.590> top<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.280> most

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
Y on which means that the top the most

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.190 
Y on which means that the top the most
stop<00:02:36.200> pixel<00:02:37.200> is<00:02:37.410> lighted<00:02:37.920> up<00:02:38.040> if<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.239> add<00:02:39.450> the

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
stop pixel is lighted up if I add the

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:47.030 
stop pixel is lighted up if I add the
lowest<00:02:40.770> x<00:02:41.010> value<00:02:45.020> now<00:02:46.020> you<00:02:46.080> can<00:02:46.320> see<00:02:46.530> that<00:02:46.560> the

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
lowest x value now you can see that the

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.890 
lowest x value now you can see that the
bottom<00:02:47.640> pixel<00:02:48.600> is<00:02:48.720> on<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.250> if<00:02:50.250> I<00:02:50.550> enable<00:02:51.060> them

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
bottom pixel is on and if I enable them

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.060 
bottom pixel is on and if I enable them
all<00:02:54.019> let's<00:02:55.019> take<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.500> second<00:02:56.239> you<00:02:57.239> will<00:02:57.390> see

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
all let's take a second you will see

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:04.130 
all let's take a second you will see
that<00:02:59.630> the<00:03:00.630> whole<00:03:00.900> thing<00:03:01.320> is<00:03:01.500> lighted<00:03:02.280> up<00:03:03.140> here

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
that the whole thing is lighted up here

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.590 
that the whole thing is lighted up here
you<00:03:04.290> can<00:03:04.470> already<00:03:04.620> see<00:03:05.040> all<00:03:05.280> of<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.420> lights

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
you can already see all of the lights

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.360 
you can already see all of the lights
over<00:03:06.900> here<00:03:07.140> it's<00:03:07.260> all<00:03:07.440> right<00:03:10.100> now<00:03:11.100> how<00:03:11.310> does

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
over here it's all right now how does

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.370 
over here it's all right now how does
this<00:03:11.610> work<00:03:11.880> basically<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:14.220> x<00:03:14.400> coordinate

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
this work basically the x coordinate

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.870 
this work basically the x coordinate
travel<00:03:16.380> through<00:03:16.829> the<00:03:16.950> bottom<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.640> end<00:03:17.790> the

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
travel through the bottom of the end the

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.380 
travel through the bottom of the end the
eighth<00:03:18.709> it<00:03:19.709> powers<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.160> end<00:03:20.519> gate<00:03:20.730> and<00:03:21.030> the

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
eighth it powers the end gate and the

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.729 
eighth it powers the end gate and the
repeater<00:03:21.810> sends<00:03:22.260> it<00:03:22.400> again<00:03:23.400> forward<00:03:24.380> if<00:03:25.380> I<00:03:25.530> put

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
repeater sends it again forward if I put

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.410 
repeater sends it again forward if I put
like<00:03:25.950> this<00:03:26.130> it<00:03:26.340> won't<00:03:26.489> work<00:03:26.700> i<00:03:26.940> have<00:03:26.970> to<00:03:27.239> put<00:03:27.390> a

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
like this it won't work i have to put a

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.050 
like this it won't work i have to put a
repeater<00:03:27.780> which<00:03:28.190> will<00:03:29.190> carry<00:03:29.340> on<00:03:29.579> the<00:03:29.700> signal

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
repeater which will carry on the signal

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.680 
repeater which will carry on the signal
and<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:31.410> y<00:03:31.860> coordinates<00:03:32.400> are<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:33.180> top<00:03:33.420> part

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
and the y coordinates are the top part

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.150 
and the y coordinates are the top part
now<00:03:34.820> this<00:03:35.820> is<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.209> first<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.630> lowest<00:03:37.040> here<00:03:38.040> is

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
now this is the first the lowest here is

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.910 
now this is the first the lowest here is
the<00:03:38.310> end<00:03:38.459> gate<00:03:38.700> and<00:03:39.019> it<00:03:40.019> travels<00:03:40.560> to<00:03:40.769> the

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
the end gate and it travels to the

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.810 
the end gate and it travels to the
lowest<00:03:41.220> pixel<00:03:41.959> and<00:03:42.959> then<00:03:43.470> i<00:03:43.769> have<00:03:43.980> to<00:03:44.400> scale<00:03:44.790> it

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
lowest pixel and then i have to scale it

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.520 
lowest pixel and then i have to scale it
up<00:03:46.310> so<00:03:47.310> that's<00:03:47.790> why<00:03:47.970> it's<00:03:48.000> so<00:03:48.239> high<00:03:48.450> so<00:03:49.350> the

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
up so that's why it's so high so the

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.560 
up so that's why it's so high so the
wires<00:03:49.769> won't<00:03:50.070> interfere<00:03:50.360> now<00:03:51.360> this<00:03:51.510> is

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
wires won't interfere now this is

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.380 
wires won't interfere now this is
modular<00:03:52.320> which<00:03:52.980> means<00:03:53.250> you<00:03:53.400> can<00:03:53.640> duplicate<00:03:54.060> it

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
modular which means you can duplicate it

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.009 
modular which means you can duplicate it
as<00:03:54.630> many<00:03:54.840> times<00:03:54.900> as<00:03:55.200> you<00:03:55.320> want<00:03:55.850> to<00:03:56.850> make<00:03:57.090> as<00:03:57.390> big

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
as many times as you want to make as big

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.060 
as many times as you want to make as big
of<00:03:58.350> a<00:03:58.650> screen<00:03:59.100> as<00:03:59.220> you<00:03:59.250> want<00:03:59.579> but<00:04:00.829> the<00:04:01.829> height

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
of a screen as you want but the height

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.910 
of a screen as you want but the height
here<00:04:02.310> is<00:04:02.430> 8<00:04:02.579> pixels<00:04:03.060> so<00:04:03.269> if<00:04:03.360> you<00:04:03.480> want<00:04:03.660> a<00:04:03.930> higher

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
here is 8 pixels so if you want a higher

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.590 
here is 8 pixels so if you want a higher
than<00:04:05.160> that<00:04:05.310> you'll<00:04:05.519> have<00:04:05.549> to<00:04:05.850> extend<00:04:06.209> it<00:04:06.420> which

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
than that you'll have to extend it which

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.949 
than that you'll have to extend it which
will<00:04:06.780> go<00:04:06.900> far<00:04:07.940> now<00:04:08.940> this<00:04:09.329> block<00:04:09.630> here<00:04:09.810> is

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
will go far now this block here is

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.740 
will go far now this block here is
called<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.440> glass<00:04:10.859> light<00:04:11.160> mode<00:04:11.750> which

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
called the glass light mode which

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.710 
called the glass light mode which
basically<00:04:13.200> it's<00:04:13.440> a<00:04:13.530> light<00:04:13.680> bulb<00:04:14.420> which<00:04:15.420> lights

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
basically it's a light bulb which lights

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.500 
basically it's a light bulb which lights
up<00:04:15.900> if<00:04:16.140> there<00:04:16.410> is<00:04:16.560> a<00:04:16.590> redstone<00:04:17.430> input<00:04:18.329> right

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
up if there is a redstone input right

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.500 
up if there is a redstone input right
next<00:04:18.840> to<00:04:18.930> it<00:04:18.959> so<00:04:19.229> now<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:20.340> torch<00:04:20.609> is<00:04:20.760> on<00:04:20.940> the

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
next to it so now the torch is on the

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.300 
next to it so now the torch is on the
light<00:04:21.690> is<00:04:21.870> on<00:04:22.019> if<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:23.280> torch<00:04:23.550> will<00:04:23.849> be

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
light is on if the torch will be

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.780 
light is on if the torch will be
off<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:25.870> light<00:04:26.020> will<00:04:26.200> be<00:04:26.320> off<00:04:26.470> and<00:04:26.770> I<00:04:27.610> use<00:04:27.760> it

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
off the light will be off and I use it

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.310 
off the light will be off and I use it
just<00:04:28.090> because<00:04:28.419> it<00:04:28.570> looks<00:04:28.780> better<00:04:29.020> than

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
just because it looks better than

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.830 
just because it looks better than
playing<00:04:29.620> redstone<00:04:30.070> torches<00:04:30.460> now<00:04:31.419> when<00:04:31.570> I<00:04:31.600> say

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
playing redstone torches now when I say

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.440 
playing redstone torches now when I say
you<00:04:31.900> can<00:04:32.050> stuck<00:04:32.290> it<00:04:32.410> up<00:04:33.090> here<00:04:34.090> is<00:04:34.180> the<00:04:34.300> end

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
you can stuck it up here is the end

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.030 
you can stuck it up here is the end
result<00:04:35.010> this<00:04:36.010> is<00:04:36.220> a<00:04:36.300> 16<00:04:37.300> x<00:04:37.660> 8<00:04:37.870> screen<00:04:38.590> which

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
result this is a 16 x 8 screen which

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.700 
result this is a 16 x 8 screen which
means<00:04:39.570> 16<00:04:40.570> different<00:04:40.720> strips<00:04:42.090> stack<00:04:43.090> together

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
means 16 different strips stack together

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.200 
means 16 different strips stack together
and<00:04:45.510> you<00:04:46.510> can<00:04:46.690> see<00:04:46.900> it<00:04:46.990> here<00:04:47.550> and<00:04:48.550> it<00:04:49.180> looks

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
and you can see it here and it looks

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.090 
and you can see it here and it looks
very<00:04:49.990> organized<00:04:50.680> i<00:04:50.860> think<00:04:51.130> very<00:04:51.310> nice<00:04:51.700> and

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
very organized i think very nice and

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.060 
very organized i think very nice and
here<00:04:54.100> you<00:04:54.280> have<00:04:54.450> the<00:04:55.450> y-coordinates<00:04:56.200> eight<00:04:56.830> of

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
here you have the y-coordinates eight of

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.500 
here you have the y-coordinates eight of
them<00:04:58.080> so<00:04:59.080> let's<00:04:59.320> light<00:04:59.560> up<00:05:00.120> coordinate<00:05:01.120> number

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
them so let's light up coordinate number

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:08.670 
them so let's light up coordinate number
one<00:05:02.020> two<00:05:02.320> three<00:05:03.070> and<00:05:05.729> here<00:05:06.810> you<00:05:07.810> have<00:05:07.840> the<00:05:08.320> x

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
one two three and here you have the x

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.540 
one two three and here you have the x
coordinates<00:05:10.350> once<00:05:11.350> again<00:05:11.560> I<00:05:12.010> think<00:05:12.310> it's<00:05:12.430> very

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
coordinates once again I think it's very

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.980 
coordinates once again I think it's very
organized<00:05:13.060> lets<00:05:13.330> up<00:05:14.040> near<00:05:15.040> the<00:05:15.160> middle<00:05:15.540> so<00:05:16.540> it

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
organized lets up near the middle so it

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.790 
organized lets up near the middle so it
works<00:05:17.590> just<00:05:18.100> like<00:05:18.340> I<00:05:18.520> showed<00:05:19.090> you<00:05:19.150> earlier<00:05:19.800> the

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
works just like I showed you earlier the

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.340 
works just like I showed you earlier the
same<00:05:21.010> concept<00:05:21.990> only<00:05:23.310> 16<00:05:24.310> of<00:05:24.430> those<00:05:25.050> one<00:05:26.050> by

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
same concept only 16 of those one by

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.690 
same concept only 16 of those one by
another<00:05:27.870> now<00:05:28.870> if<00:05:29.050> we<00:05:29.200> go<00:05:29.340> to<00:05:30.340> look<00:05:30.490> at<00:05:30.610> the

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
another now if we go to look at the

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.159 
another now if we go to look at the
screen<00:05:31.260> you<00:05:32.260> can<00:05:32.410> see<00:05:32.680> the<00:05:33.340> pixel<00:05:33.729> I<00:05:33.820> chose

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
screen you can see the pixel I chose

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:36.510 
screen you can see the pixel I chose
it's<00:05:35.169> in<00:05:35.380> the<00:05:35.500> middle<00:05:35.680> we<00:05:35.950> didn't<00:05:36.190> count<00:05:36.400> it

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
it's in the middle we didn't count it

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.469 
it's in the middle we didn't count it
but<00:05:36.850> one<00:05:37.390> two<00:05:37.630> three<00:05:38.700> now<00:05:39.700> this<00:05:40.180> might<00:05:40.419> seem

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
but one two three now this might seem

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:43.500 
but one two three now this might seem
like<00:05:40.720> an<00:05:41.020> LCD<00:05:41.380> screen<00:05:41.830> but<00:05:42.550> actually<00:05:43.060> it's<00:05:43.180> not

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
like an LCD screen but actually it's not

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.159 
like an LCD screen but actually it's not
because<00:05:44.080> i'll<00:05:44.800> show<00:05:45.100> you<00:05:45.160> if<00:05:46.030> you<00:05:46.479> have<00:05:46.690> two

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
because i'll show you if you have two

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:48.510 
because i'll show you if you have two
points<00:05:47.560> on<00:05:47.620> the<00:05:47.770> screen<00:05:48.039> which<00:05:48.160> you<00:05:48.280> want<00:05:48.460> to

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
points on the screen which you want to

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:55.409 
points on the screen which you want to
show<00:05:49.530> let's<00:05:50.530> take<00:05:50.770> the<00:05:50.950> first<00:05:51.280> and<00:05:51.870> last<00:05:54.419> of

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
show let's take the first and last of

00:05:55.419 --> 00:06:00.210 
show let's take the first and last of
the<00:05:55.780> X&amp;Y<00:05:56.530> coordinates<00:05:57.270> you<00:05:58.270> will<00:05:58.389> see<00:05:59.220> that

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
the X&amp;Y coordinates you will see that

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.000 
the X&amp;Y coordinates you will see that
you'll<00:06:00.430> actually<00:06:00.550> get<00:06:01.500> four<00:06:02.500> points<00:06:02.710> on<00:06:02.919> the

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010 
you'll actually get four points on the

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.000 
you'll actually get four points on the
screen<00:06:03.310> instead<00:06:03.580> of<00:06:03.729> two<00:06:03.940> and<00:06:04.410> the<00:06:05.410> reason<00:06:05.590> is

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
screen instead of two and the reason is

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.820 
screen instead of two and the reason is
because<00:06:06.070> i<00:06:06.700> specify<00:06:07.300> an<00:06:07.539> X&amp;Y<00:06:07.900> coordinates<00:06:08.289> and

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
because i specify an X&amp;Y coordinates and

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.990 
because i specify an X&amp;Y coordinates and
2x<00:06:09.789> +<00:06:10.210> 2<00:06:10.389> y<00:06:10.419> coordinate<00:06:11.280> means<00:06:12.280> there<00:06:12.610> are<00:06:12.669> four

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
2x + 2 y coordinate means there are four

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.909 
2x + 2 y coordinate means there are four
points<00:06:13.919> say<00:06:14.919> so<00:06:15.400> i'll<00:06:15.940> have<00:06:16.270> the<00:06:17.110> lowest<00:06:17.500> x

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 
points say so i'll have the lowest x

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:20.029 
points say so i'll have the lowest x
coordinate<00:06:18.550> is<00:06:18.639> zero<00:06:18.940> the<00:06:19.330> same<00:06:19.539> for<00:06:19.720> the<00:06:19.810> y

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039 
coordinate is zero the same for the y

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:24.360 
coordinate is zero the same for the y
highest<00:06:21.039> y<00:06:21.280> coordinate<00:06:21.669> is<00:06:21.760> eight<00:06:22.120> and<00:06:23.190> the<00:06:24.190> y

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 
highest y coordinate is eight and the y

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:31.590 
highest y coordinate is eight and the y
the<00:06:24.700> x<00:06:24.910> is<00:06:25.180> six<00:06:25.419> teams<00:06:25.660> will<00:06:25.840> have<00:06:28.020> 0008<00:06:29.020> a<00:06:30.600> 16-0

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 
the x is six teams will have 0008 a 16-0

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.740 
the x is six teams will have 0008 a 16-0
and<00:06:31.840> sixteen<00:06:32.409> eight<00:06:32.940> so<00:06:33.940> that's<00:06:34.390> why<00:06:34.510> you<00:06:34.570> can

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:34.750 
and sixteen eight so that's why you can

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:35.800 
and sixteen eight so that's why you can
only<00:06:34.930> have

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
only have

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.720 
only have
one<00:06:36.410> point<00:06:36.680> at<00:06:36.889> a<00:06:36.980> time<00:06:37.160> if<00:06:37.310> you<00:06:37.430> want<00:06:37.580> it

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:37.730 
one point at a time if you want it

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.840 
one point at a time if you want it
secluded<00:06:38.710> but<00:06:39.710> since<00:06:39.980> this<00:06:40.220> is<00:06:40.400> for<00:06:40.610> a<00:06:40.639> pong

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:40.850 
secluded but since this is for a pong

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.540 
secluded but since this is for a pong
game<00:06:41.090> and<00:06:41.330> this<00:06:42.050> part<00:06:42.410> of<00:06:42.800> the<00:06:42.980> screen<00:06:43.220> is<00:06:43.370> for

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
game and this part of the screen is for

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.700 
game and this part of the screen is for
the<00:06:43.639> ball<00:06:43.820> I<00:06:44.290> shouldn't<00:06:45.290> really<00:06:45.440> have<00:06:45.680> a

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:45.710 
the ball I shouldn't really have a

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.270 
the ball I shouldn't really have a
problem<00:06:46.010> with<00:06:46.310> it<00:06:47.350> anyways<00:06:48.350> I<00:06:48.620> hope<00:06:48.889> you've
