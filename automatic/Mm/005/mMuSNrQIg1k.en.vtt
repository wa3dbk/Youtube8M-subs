00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.690 
was when I first bought it the only
thing<00:01:08.530> that<00:01:08.650> I've<00:01:08.740> noticed<00:01:09.010> is<00:01:09.400> that<00:01:09.430> the

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
thing that I've noticed is that the

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.670 
thing that I've noticed is that the
focus<00:01:10.119> ring<00:01:10.360> whenever<00:01:10.840> it<00:01:11.049> gets<00:01:11.260> really<00:01:11.439> cold

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
focus ring whenever it gets really cold

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.240 
focus ring whenever it gets really cold
outside<00:01:13.170> kinda<00:01:14.170> gets<00:01:14.350> kind<00:01:14.560> of<00:01:14.650> grainy<00:01:14.890> like

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
outside kinda gets kind of grainy like

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.300 
outside kinda gets kind of grainy like
almost<00:01:15.520> sandpapering<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:17.200> once<00:01:17.920> you<00:01:18.040> working

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
almost sandpapering so once you working

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.740 
almost sandpapering so once you working
around<00:01:18.520> for<00:01:18.670> a<00:01:18.700> bit<00:01:18.880> and<00:01:18.970> just<00:01:19.150> start<00:01:19.450> working

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
around for a bit and just start working

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.050 
around for a bit and just start working
with<00:01:19.869> it<00:01:19.900> it<00:01:20.140> loosens<00:01:20.500> right<00:01:20.650> back<00:01:20.860> up<00:01:21.100> but

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
with it it loosens right back up but

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.060 
with it it loosens right back up but
aside<00:01:22.869> from<00:01:22.930> that<00:01:23.140> everything<00:01:23.590> is<00:01:23.890> working

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
aside from that everything is working

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.460

yet<00:01:47.950> let<00:01:48.490> me<00:01:48.609> down<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:50.740> came<00:01:51.219> in<00:01:51.249> about<00:01:51.789> a

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
yet let me down this came in about a

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.529 
yet let me down this came in about a
week<00:01:52.090> after<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:53.560> actual<00:01:54.159> lens<00:01:54.340> hood<00:01:54.670> this<00:01:55.359> is

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
week after the actual lens hood this is

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.959 
week after the actual lens hood this is
very<00:01:55.749> hard<00:01:56.020> to<00:01:56.139> find<00:01:56.289> very<00:01:56.859> very<00:01:57.520> hard<00:01:57.819> to<00:01:57.939> find

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 
very hard to find very very hard to find

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.980 
very hard to find very very hard to find
so<00:01:59.609> invaluable<00:02:00.609> through<00:02:01.359> the<00:02:01.509> nice<00:02:01.659> felt

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
so invaluable through the nice felt

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.609 
so invaluable through the nice felt
interior<00:02:02.530> it's<00:02:03.030> increased<00:02:04.030> my<00:02:04.179> contrast<00:02:04.719> I

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
interior it's increased my contrast I

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.709 
interior it's increased my contrast I
can<00:02:06.369> notice<00:02:06.700> it<00:02:06.850> but<00:02:07.030> a<00:02:07.090> trained<00:02:07.359> you<00:02:07.509> know<00:02:07.539> it

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
can notice it but a trained you know it

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:09.990 
can notice it but a trained you know it
takes<00:02:08.319> a<00:02:08.410> trained<00:02:08.649> eye<00:02:08.830> to<00:02:08.890> notice<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:09.610> minor

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
takes a trained eye to notice the minor

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.250
