 Let's weave the chain of making eyes into a dream 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.990
 I am 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:43.689
 Put the needle in the first back of the mountain 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.689

 Now mark the first eye with a row marker 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.930
 Continue to pick up the woman from the back mountain in order 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:24.260
 If you pick up the woman to about half the length of the needle, you can also use the tension as one needle tip comes to the left 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.260
 I will 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:36.370
 Beat the needle tip and pull out the first eye 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.370
 I will draw two by two from the next 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.080
 Pull out until the eyes left on the needle are on 3 sides 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.810
 Hold the needle upside down and try again 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.810
 I will pick up a woman from the back mountain 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.030

 If you pick up about half the length of the needle, change the hand holding the needle 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.020
 We will repeat knitting the required number of stages 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:17.020
 It will be more and more just round and round Oh keep watching from the beginning to the end 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:24.049
 The last step is finished by pulling out 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:35.809

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.809
