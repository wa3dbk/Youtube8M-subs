you<00:00:54.270> lose<00:00:54.510> your<00:00:54.780> data<00:00:55.100> this<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.280> not<00:00:56.550> an<00:00:56.730> iPhone

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
you lose your data this is not an iPhone

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.990 
you lose your data this is not an iPhone
yeah<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.770> more<00:00:58.949> annoying<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.550> less<00:00:59.760> user

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
yeah it is more annoying and less user

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.020 
yeah it is more annoying and less user
friendly<00:01:00.590> try<00:01:01.590> switching<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> wired<00:01:02.640> port

friendly try switching to a wired port

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.270 
friendly try switching to a wired port
so<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.600> get<00:01:03.899> an<00:01:04.019> internet<00:01:04.379> connection<00:01:04.589> even

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
so you get an internet connection even
