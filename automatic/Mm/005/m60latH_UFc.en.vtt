00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
very clear most of the time between 45

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
UV index is at zero but sometimes it

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.630 
UV index is at zero but sometimes it
still<00:02:10.670> can<00:02:11.090> be<00:02:11.120> low<00:02:11.660> so<00:02:12.530> it's<00:02:13.100> always

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
still can be low so it's always

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.940 
still can be low so it's always
recommended<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:14.450> check<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.959> UV<00:02:15.290> index<00:02:15.650> before

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
recommended to check the UV index before

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.890 
recommended to check the UV index before
you<00:02:16.550> gaze<00:02:16.820> all<00:02:17.570> right<00:02:17.720> so<00:02:18.019> it's<00:02:18.200> 8:15<00:02:18.830> p.m.<00:02:19.900> at

dots<00:05:58.309> that<00:05:58.610> we're<00:05:58.789> seeing<00:05:59.059> at<00:05:59.269> where<00:05:59.389> the

00:05:59.499 --> 00:05:59.509 
dots that we're seeing at where the

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:01.629 
dots that we're seeing at where the
brain<00:05:59.719> waves<00:05:59.959> are<00:06:00.110> recorded<00:06:00.649> so<00:06:00.979> when<00:06:01.219> you<00:06:01.429> had

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:01.639 
brain waves are recorded so when you had

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:04.029 
brain waves are recorded so when you had
all<00:06:01.819> the<00:06:01.939> sensors<00:06:02.419> on<00:06:02.689> your<00:06:02.749> head<00:06:03.169> there's<00:06:03.949> a

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 
all the sensors on your head there's a

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:05.799 
all the sensors on your head there's a
line<00:06:04.309> between<00:06:04.339> the<00:06:04.789> dots<00:06:04.999> of<00:06:05.209> those<00:06:05.389> parts<00:06:05.689> of

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:05.809 
line between the dots of those parts of

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:07.719 
line between the dots of those parts of
the<00:06:05.869> brain<00:06:06.110> are<00:06:06.139> working<00:06:06.589> together<00:06:06.709> so<00:06:07.610> this

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729 
the brain are working together so this

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:09.100 
the brain are working together so this
is<00:06:07.789> when<00:06:08.029> you're<00:06:08.179> looking<00:06:08.300> at<00:06:08.569> the<00:06:08.659> tree<00:06:08.899> what

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
is when you're looking at the tree what

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.689 
is when you're looking at the tree what
you're<00:06:09.319> seeing<00:06:09.529> is<00:06:09.679> the<00:06:09.769> frontal<00:06:10.159> areas<00:06:10.550> are

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:10.699 
you're seeing is the frontal areas are

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:13.059 
you're seeing is the frontal areas are
mostly<00:06:10.969> active<00:06:11.259> because<00:06:12.259> the<00:06:12.469> perceptual

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:13.069 
mostly active because the perceptual

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:15.820 
mostly active because the perceptual
field<00:06:13.399> is<00:06:13.699> relatively<00:06:14.239> it's<00:06:15.050> not<00:06:15.289> changing

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
field is relatively it's not changing

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.759 
field is relatively it's not changing
it's<00:06:16.009> not<00:06:16.249> very<00:06:16.550> important<00:06:17.619> let's<00:06:18.619> look

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:18.769 
it's not very important let's look

00:06:18.769 --> 00:06:23.469 
it's not very important let's look
what's<00:06:18.949> happening<00:06:19.429> when<00:06:19.639> you're<00:06:22.330> looking<00:06:23.330> at

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 
what's happening when you're looking at

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:30.040 
what's happening when you're looking at
the<00:06:23.599> Sun<00:06:27.879> what<00:06:28.879> we're<00:06:29.029> seeing<00:06:29.240> again<00:06:29.509> it's<00:06:29.749> the

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
the Sun what we're seeing again it's the

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.869 
the Sun what we're seeing again it's the
frontal<00:06:30.499> areas<00:06:30.860> are<00:06:31.039> still<00:06:31.249> active<00:06:31.729> but

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:31.879 
frontal areas are still active but

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:34.359 
frontal areas are still active but
there's<00:06:32.059> much<00:06:32.269> more<00:06:32.300> especially<00:06:33.050> here<00:06:33.649> in<00:06:33.769> the

00:06:34.359 --> 00:06:34.369 
there's much more especially here in the

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:36.999 
there's much more especially here in the
lower-end<00:06:34.909> theta<00:06:35.240> in<00:06:35.509> terms<00:06:35.990> of<00:06:36.289> the<00:06:36.439> focus<00:06:36.860> is

00:06:36.999 --> 00:06:37.009 
lower-end theta in terms of the focus is

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:40.389 
lower-end theta in terms of the focus is
much<00:06:37.219> deeper<00:06:37.490> is<00:06:38.050> much<00:06:39.050> stronger<00:06:39.469> and<00:06:39.769> also

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:40.399 
much deeper is much stronger and also

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:43.239 
much deeper is much stronger and also
here<00:06:40.759> and<00:06:41.449> the<00:06:41.629> level<00:06:41.809> of<00:06:42.019> gamma<00:06:42.289> and<00:06:42.589> notice

00:06:43.239 --> 00:06:43.249 
here and the level of gamma and notice

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:44.709 
here and the level of gamma and notice
it's<00:06:43.429> not<00:06:43.490> only<00:06:43.819> in<00:06:44.029> the<00:06:44.149> front<00:06:44.419> but<00:06:44.599> also

00:06:44.709 --> 00:06:44.719 
it's not only in the front but also

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:46.149 
it's not only in the front but also
there's<00:06:45.079> quite<00:06:45.289> a<00:06:45.319> bit<00:06:45.469> of<00:06:45.529> activity<00:06:45.829> in<00:06:46.069> the

00:06:46.149 --> 00:06:46.159 
there's quite a bit of activity in the

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:47.709 
there's quite a bit of activity in the
back<00:06:46.369> the<00:06:46.610> whole<00:06:46.759> brain<00:06:46.999> has<00:06:47.179> become<00:06:47.509> a<00:06:47.539> little

00:06:47.709 --> 00:06:47.719 
back the whole brain has become a little

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:50.319 
back the whole brain has become a little
bit<00:06:47.869> more<00:06:47.959> activated<00:06:48.759> now<00:06:49.759> the<00:06:49.819> overall

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:50.329 
bit more activated now the overall

00:06:50.329 --> 00:06:52.059 
bit more activated now the overall
impression<00:06:50.719> you<00:06:51.019> see<00:06:51.259> here<00:06:51.529> is<00:06:51.619> there's<00:06:51.829> much

00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:52.069 
impression you see here is there's much

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:54.909 
impression you see here is there's much
more<00:06:52.429> coherence<00:06:53.089> it's<00:06:53.389> it's<00:06:53.779> more<00:06:54.050> red<00:06:54.259> that

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:54.919 
more coherence it's it's more red that

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:56.499 
more coherence it's it's more red that
means<00:06:55.129> as<00:06:55.279> much<00:06:55.339> higher<00:06:55.729> coherence<00:06:56.329> when

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:56.509 
means as much higher coherence when

00:06:56.509 --> 00:06:58.749 
means as much higher coherence when
looking<00:06:56.839> at<00:06:56.959> the<00:06:57.110> Sun<00:06:57.519> specifically<00:06:58.519> look

00:06:58.749 --> 00:06:58.759 
looking at the Sun specifically look

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:01.419 
looking at the Sun specifically look
again<00:06:59.029> here<00:06:59.269> at<00:06:59.419> the<00:06:59.509> gamma<00:06:59.829> fast<00:07:00.829> frequencies

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:01.429 
again here at the gamma fast frequencies

00:07:01.429 --> 00:07:04.209 
again here at the gamma fast frequencies
between<00:07:01.819> almost<00:07:02.569> all<00:07:02.839> parts<00:07:03.679> that<00:07:03.889> we<00:07:04.009> measure

00:07:04.209 --> 00:07:04.219 
between almost all parts that we measure

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:05.919 
between almost all parts that we measure
just<00:07:04.579> the<00:07:04.729> whole<00:07:04.909> brain<00:07:05.149> the<00:07:05.509> gamma<00:07:05.749> activity

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:05.929 
just the whole brain the gamma activity

00:07:05.929 --> 00:07:08.379 
just the whole brain the gamma activity
is<00:07:06.349> much<00:07:06.529> higher<00:07:06.800> the<00:07:07.550> attention<00:07:07.999> is<00:07:08.149> much

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:08.389 
is much higher the attention is much

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:11.049 
is much higher the attention is much
more<00:07:08.689> on<00:07:08.899> the<00:07:09.019> object<00:07:09.499> also<00:07:10.009> interesting<00:07:10.789> here

00:07:11.049 --> 00:07:11.059 
more on the object also interesting here

00:07:11.059 --> 00:07:14.259 
more on the object also interesting here
in<00:07:11.149> the<00:07:11.269> theta<00:07:11.509> there's<00:07:12.399> increased<00:07:13.399> focus<00:07:13.819> and

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:14.269 
in the theta there's increased focus and

00:07:14.269 --> 00:07:17.049 
in the theta there's increased focus and
also<00:07:15.110> this<00:07:15.409> is<00:07:15.649> the<00:07:15.679> two<00:07:15.949> alphas<00:07:16.399> notice<00:07:16.699> alpha

00:07:17.049 --> 00:07:17.059 
also this is the two alphas notice alpha

00:07:17.059 --> 00:07:18.999 
also this is the two alphas notice alpha
two<00:07:17.240> has<00:07:17.479> much<00:07:17.689> more<00:07:17.869> coherence<00:07:18.469> when<00:07:18.649> looking

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:19.009 
two has much more coherence when looking

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:21.749 
two has much more coherence when looking
at<00:07:19.129> the<00:07:19.249> Sun<00:07:19.490> so<00:07:19.879> pretty<00:07:20.509> much<00:07:20.659> to<00:07:20.929> sum<00:07:21.199> it<00:07:21.229> up

00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:21.759 
at the Sun so pretty much to sum it up

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:26.409 
at the Sun so pretty much to sum it up
more<00:07:22.759> brain<00:07:23.689> was<00:07:24.439> used<00:07:24.889> while<00:07:25.849> looking<00:07:26.089> at<00:07:26.300> the

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:26.419 
more brain was used while looking at the

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:28.829 
more brain was used while looking at the
Sun<00:07:26.659> compared<00:07:27.169> to<00:07:27.259> looking<00:07:27.589> at<00:07:27.800> an<00:07:28.459> object

00:07:28.829 --> 00:07:28.839 
Sun compared to looking at an object

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:32.679 
Sun compared to looking at an object
farther<00:07:29.839> far<00:07:30.589> away<00:07:30.800> at<00:07:31.039> the<00:07:31.099> tree<00:07:31.339> yep<00:07:31.759> while

00:07:32.679 --> 00:07:32.689 
farther far away at the tree yep while

00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:33.909 
farther far away at the tree yep while
knowing<00:07:32.990> what's<00:07:33.199> going<00:07:33.469> on<00:07:33.649> in<00:07:33.769> my<00:07:33.800> brain

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:33.919 
knowing what's going on in my brain

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:35.499 
knowing what's going on in my brain
while<00:07:34.339> I'm<00:07:34.519> Sun<00:07:34.789> gazing<00:07:34.999> was<00:07:35.269> very

00:07:35.499 --> 00:07:35.509 
while I'm Sun gazing was very

00:07:35.509 --> 00:07:37.719 
while I'm Sun gazing was very
interesting<00:07:36.169> I<00:07:36.259> still<00:07:36.469> have<00:07:36.649> one<00:07:37.039> important

00:07:37.719 --> 00:07:37.729 
interesting I still have one important

00:07:37.729 --> 00:07:40.779 
interesting I still have one important
question<00:07:37.969> to<00:07:38.269> tackle<00:07:38.719> is<00:07:39.529> there<00:07:40.279> a<00:07:40.309> way<00:07:40.550> I<00:07:40.579> can

00:07:40.779 --> 00:07:40.789 
question to tackle is there a way I can

00:07:40.789 --> 00:07:43.600 
question to tackle is there a way I can
safely<00:07:41.209> look<00:07:41.629> at<00:07:41.749> the<00:07:41.869> Sun<00:07:42.110> or<00:07:42.379> have<00:07:43.189> my<00:07:43.369> eyes

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:43.610 
safely look at the Sun or have my eyes

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.719 
safely look at the Sun or have my eyes
been<00:07:43.969> damaged<00:07:44.419> I<00:07:44.740> decided<00:07:45.740> the<00:07:45.979> only<00:07:46.519> way<00:07:46.669> to

00:07:46.719 --> 00:07:46.729 
been damaged I decided the only way to

00:07:46.729 --> 00:07:49.179 
been damaged I decided the only way to
truly<00:07:47.300> know<00:07:47.659> if<00:07:47.869> my<00:07:48.050> eyes<00:07:48.319> have<00:07:48.619> been<00:07:48.709> damaged

00:07:49.179 --> 00:07:49.189 
truly know if my eyes have been damaged

00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:50.980 
truly know if my eyes have been damaged
or<00:07:49.279> not<00:07:49.369> is<00:07:49.639> to<00:07:50.059> get<00:07:50.209> the<00:07:50.329> most<00:07:50.479> thorough<00:07:50.869> eye

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:50.990 
or not is to get the most thorough eye

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.199
