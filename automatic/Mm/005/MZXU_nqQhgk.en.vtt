through<00:01:55.490> different<00:01:56.240> acts<00:01:56.570> let's<00:01:57.080> take<00:01:57.320> a<00:01:57.350> look

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
through different acts let's take a look

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.740 
through different acts let's take a look
at<00:01:57.830> that<00:01:58.130> real<00:01:59.000> quickly<00:02:01.330> that's<00:02:02.330> what<00:02:02.659> the

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
at that real quickly that's what the

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.690 
at that real quickly that's what the
games<00:02:02.960> you<00:02:03.110> can<00:02:03.200> go<00:02:03.320> in<00:02:03.500> and<00:02:03.530> add<00:02:04.130> characters

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
games you can go in and add characters

games you can go in and add characters
for<00:02:04.880> free<00:02:05.060> play<00:02:06.130> so<00:02:07.130> again<00:02:07.460> this<00:02:07.820> is

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
for free play so again this is

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.910 
for free play so again this is
essentially<00:02:08.509> straight<00:02:08.869> up<00:02:09.020> a<00:02:09.200> lego<00:02:09.709> game

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
essentially straight up a lego game

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.340 
essentially straight up a lego game
there's<00:02:10.670> not<00:02:10.850> a<00:02:10.910> whole<00:02:11.090> lot<00:02:11.240> I<00:02:11.720> mean<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.170> game

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
there's not a whole lot I mean the game

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.010 
there's not a whole lot I mean the game
is<00:02:12.380> can<00:02:12.709> be<00:02:13.190> played<00:02:13.430> in<00:02:13.459> 3d<00:02:14.000> but<00:02:14.720> it<00:02:14.870> really

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
is can be played in 3d but it really

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.070 
is can be played in 3d but it really
doesn't<00:02:15.260> add<00:02:15.530> anything<00:02:15.890> to<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.310> experience

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
doesn't add anything to the experience

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.470 
doesn't add anything to the experience
you<00:02:18.080> get<00:02:18.200> a<00:02:18.260> little<00:02:18.590> more<00:02:18.709> depth<00:02:19.360> couple<00:02:20.360> of

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
you get a little more depth couple of

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.050 
you get a little more depth couple of
