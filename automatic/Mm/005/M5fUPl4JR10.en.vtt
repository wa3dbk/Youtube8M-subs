apps<00:00:41.850> like<00:00:42.090> when<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.360> says<00:00:42.570> when<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:42.870> have<00:00:43.020> a

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
apps like when it says when you have a

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.610 
apps like when it says when you have a
message<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.590> pops<00:00:43.800> up<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.160> one<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.670> notify<00:00:45.059> you

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
message it pops up the one to notify you

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.750 
message it pops up the one to notify you
once<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.770> click<00:00:46.980> on<00:00:47.010> everything<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.579> brings

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
once you click on everything it brings

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.150 
once you click on everything it brings
you<00:00:47.820> into<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.180> stock<00:00:48.420> Android<00:00:48.960> but<00:00:49.829> at<00:00:50.010> least

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
you into the stock Android but at least

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.069 
you into the stock Android but at least
you<00:00:50.610> know<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:51.239> could<00:00:51.390> fool<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.600> lot<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.930> people

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
you know you could fool a lot of people

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.750 
you know you could fool a lot of people
so<00:00:53.210> basically<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.420> way<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.870> app<00:00:55.500> starts<00:00:56.160> just

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
so basically the way the app starts just

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.029 
so basically the way the app starts just
like<00:00:56.879> on<00:00:57.030> iOS<00:00:57.510> by<00:00:57.750> default<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.469> have<00:00:58.649> like<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
like on iOS by default you have like the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.790 
like on iOS by default you have like the
core<00:00:59.309> applications<00:01:00.210> on<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.719> first<00:01:01.199> screen<00:01:01.530> or

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
core applications on the first screen or

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.139 
core applications on the first screen or
I<00:01:01.829> guess<00:01:02.070> you'd<00:01:02.219> call<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.550> second<00:01:03.000> screen

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
I guess you'd call this a second screen

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.270 
I guess you'd call this a second screen
and<00:01:03.480> then<00:01:04.760> once<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.939> get<00:01:06.090> past<00:01:06.119> those<00:01:07.280> you

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
and then once you get past those you

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.620 
and then once you get past those you
start<00:01:08.580> getting<00:01:08.729> into<00:01:09.150> your<00:01:09.360> own<00:01:09.860> apps<00:01:11.630> so

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
start getting into your own apps so

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.719 
start getting into your own apps so
basically<00:01:13.080> here<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.470> my<00:01:13.619> own<00:01:13.650> apps<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.640> I

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
basically here on my own apps that I

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.850 
basically here on my own apps that I
insulting<00:01:15.119> things<00:01:15.299> like<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.770> know

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.300 
gonna complain or file another lawsuit
but<00:01:54.680> it's<00:01:55.680> going<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.829> be<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:55.979> quick<00:01:56.159> review

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
but it's going to be a quick review

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.950 
but it's going to be a quick review
because<00:01:56.670> it's<00:01:57.270> not<00:01:58.159> too<00:01:59.159> much<00:01:59.340> outside<00:01:59.729> of<00:02:00.030> you

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
because it's not too much outside of you

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.840 
because it's not too much outside of you
know<00:02:01.020> whatever<00:02:01.229> meet<00:02:01.530> see<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.740> basically<00:02:02.430> it's

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
know whatever meet see I basically it's

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.749 
know whatever meet see I basically it's
a<00:02:03.500> very<00:02:04.500> straightforward<00:02:04.799> but<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.310> think<00:02:05.610> it's

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
a very straightforward but I think it's

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.999 
a very straightforward but I think it's
actually<00:02:06.540> pretty<00:02:06.930> good<00:02:07.320> looking<00:02:07.710> I

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
actually pretty good looking I

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.249 
actually pretty good looking I
I've<00:02:08.069> had<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.549> a<00:02:08.670> few<00:02:08.700> times<00:02:08.879> freeze<00:02:09.689> on<00:02:09.869> me<00:02:09.899> but

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
I've had it a few times freeze on me but

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.199 
I've had it a few times freeze on me but
only<00:02:10.470> really<00:02:10.979> when<00:02:11.159> I<00:02:11.189> went<00:02:11.519> into<00:02:11.670> like<00:02:11.970> a

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209
