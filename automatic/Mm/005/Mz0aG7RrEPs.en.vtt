00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
it's a drop open case anyway and the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.260 
it's a drop open case anyway and the
second<00:00:58.680> one<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.280> built<00:00:59.489> I'm<00:01:00.000> gonna<00:01:00.120> have

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
second one that I built I'm gonna have

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.830 
second one that I built I'm gonna have
to<00:01:00.390> show<00:01:00.539> me<00:01:00.570> now<00:01:01.309> Apple<00:01:02.309> studio<00:01:02.670> monitor<00:01:03.120> this

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
to show me now Apple studio monitor this

to show me now Apple studio monitor this
was<00:01:04.049> originally<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:05.270> Apple<00:01:06.270> CRT<00:01:06.900> screen

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
was originally a Apple CRT screen

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.490 
was originally a Apple CRT screen
computer<00:01:08.340> inside<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:09.439> was<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.590> flat<00:01:10.799> screen<00:01:11.180> and

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
computer inside it was a flat screen and

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.530 
computer inside it was a flat screen and
used<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.710> ADC<00:01:14.310> connector<00:01:14.729> which<00:01:14.880> was<00:01:15.090> apple's

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
used the ADC connector which was apple's

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.130 
used the ADC connector which was apple's
proprietary<00:01:16.009> DVI<00:01:17.009> style<00:01:17.580> connector<00:01:18.030> but<00:01:18.630> with

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
proprietary DVI style connector but with

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.590 
proprietary DVI style connector but with
additional<00:01:19.799> lines<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.820> as<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.270> understand

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
additional lines of it as I understand

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.440 
additional lines of it as I understand
it<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:22.409> also<00:01:22.530> had<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.830> USB<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.909> power<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.240> it

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
it it also had a USB and power and it

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.710 
it it also had a USB and power and it
basically<00:01:24.630> sir<00:01:26.000> one<00:01:27.000> other<00:01:27.030> things<00:01:27.360> about<00:01:27.540> the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
basically sir one other things about the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.149 
basically sir one other things about the
case<00:01:28.020> i'm<00:01:28.290> using<00:01:28.320> here<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.890> it's<00:01:29.009> got<00:01:29.040> a

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
case i'm using here is that it's got a

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.249 
case i'm using here is that it's got a
USB<00:01:29.520> port<00:01:29.909> inside<00:01:30.270> even<00:01:30.509> though<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.750> was<00:01:31.079> only

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
USB port inside even though it was only

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.990 
USB port inside even though it was only
a<00:01:31.409> CIT<00:01:31.740> monitor<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.400> that's<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.610> full<00:01:32.759> screen

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
a CIT monitor and that's a full screen

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.980 
a CIT monitor and that's a full screen
so<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.570> full-fledged<00:01:34.320> computer<00:01:35.869> with<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.900> USB

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
so a full-fledged computer with the USB

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:45.880 
so a full-fledged computer with the USB
port<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:39.290> yeah<00:01:40.290> right<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.710> table<00:01:40.860> look<00:01:44.840> so

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
port so yeah right on the table look so

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.899 
port so yeah right on the table look so
this<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.009> what<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.280> screen<00:01:47.549> looks<00:01:47.790> like

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.840 

now<00:01:51.909> that<00:01:52.119> our<00:01:52.149> 17<00:01:52.630> inch<00:01:52.750> LCD<00:01:53.320> and<00:01:53.590> behind<00:01:54.520> here

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
now that our 17 inch LCD and behind here

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.719 
now that our 17 inch LCD and behind here
this<00:01:55.630> is<00:01:55.780> um<00:01:56.079> actually<00:01:56.890> attempted<00:01:57.369> inch<00:01:57.490> CRT

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
this is um actually attempted inch CRT

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.950 
this is um actually attempted inch CRT
so<00:01:58.329> the<00:01:58.560> gap<00:01:59.560> here<00:01:59.950> means<00:02:00.549> LCD<00:02:01.210> sets<00:02:01.509> in<00:02:01.630> behind

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
so the gap here means LCD sets in behind

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.300 
so the gap here means LCD sets in behind
it<00:02:02.140> because<00:02:02.289> L<00:02:02.500> so<00:02:02.619> use<00:02:02.740> a<00:02:02.770> slightly<00:02:03.100> larger

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
it because L so use a slightly larger

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.090 
it because L so use a slightly larger
theme<00:02:04.090> settings<00:02:04.659> to<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.649> effect<00:02:05.829> that<00:02:05.860> C

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
theme settings to the effect that C

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.190 
theme settings to the effect that C
it's--if<00:02:06.579> overscan<00:02:07.329> here<00:02:07.569> is<00:02:07.689> and<00:02:07.959> so<00:02:08.080> the

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
it's--if overscan here is and so the

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.250 
it's--if overscan here is and so the
plastic<00:02:08.560> overlapped<00:02:09.160> a<00:02:09.310> bit<00:02:09.459> more<00:02:10.260> Ivan's

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
plastic overlapped a bit more Ivan's

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.750 
plastic overlapped a bit more Ivan's
I've<00:02:11.560> decided<00:02:11.799> to<00:02:12.040> instead<00:02:12.250> of<00:02:12.370> butchering

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
I've decided to instead of butchering

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.880 
I've decided to instead of butchering
the<00:02:12.879> basic<00:02:13.239> I've<00:02:13.390> compensated<00:02:14.349> and<00:02:14.470> software

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
the basic I've compensated and software

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.979 
the basic I've compensated and software
to<00:02:15.069> not<00:02:15.760> use<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.120> full<00:02:16.330> real<00:02:16.510> estate<00:02:16.810> of<00:02:16.930> the

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
to not use the full real estate of the

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:26.250 
to not use the full real estate of the
LCD<00:02:17.379> with<00:02:18.190> them<00:02:19.319> Alex<00:02:23.519> so<00:02:24.519> yeah<00:02:24.760> um<00:02:25.450> I've

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
LCD with them Alex so yeah um I've

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.319 
LCD with them Alex so yeah um I've

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
the motherboard and then correct them

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.970 
the motherboard and then correct them
for<00:05:48.290> that<00:05:48.380> Irial<00:05:48.710> for<00:05:48.950> the<00:05:49.010> TV<00:05:50.020> and<00:05:51.020> up<00:05:51.560> back
