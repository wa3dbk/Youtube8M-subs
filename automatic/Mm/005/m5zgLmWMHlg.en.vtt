00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:50.740 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.950 

the<00:00:51.550> same<00:00:51.760> stuff<00:00:52.030> that<00:00:52.060> was<00:00:52.360> on<00:00:52.480> that<00:00:52.510> throttle

plate<00:00:53.140> collects<00:00:53.470> inside<00:00:53.680> the<00:00:53.980> intake<00:00:54.310> as<00:00:54.520> well

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.700 
plate collects inside the intake as well

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.390 
plate collects inside the intake as well
so<00:00:55.270> what<00:00:55.420> I'd<00:00:55.540> like<00:00:55.630> to<00:00:55.690> do<00:00:55.900> is<00:00:56.050> take<00:00:56.230> a<00:00:56.260> lawn<00:00:56.560> go

backing<00:01:02.470> it<00:01:02.560> out<00:01:02.710> and<00:01:03.370> then<00:01:03.489> when<00:01:03.610> the<00:01:03.730> car<00:01:03.940> is

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
backing it out and then when the car is

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.550 
backing it out and then when the car is
running<00:01:04.449> it<00:01:04.570> will<00:01:04.600> clean<00:01:04.900> some<00:01:05.170> of<00:01:05.199> the<00:01:05.350> stuff

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
running it will clean some of the stuff

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.069 
running it will clean some of the stuff
off<00:01:05.740> of<00:01:05.890> the<00:01:06.010> intake

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:07.079 
off of the intake

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:09.109 
off of the intake
it's<00:01:07.380> not<00:01:07.560> possible<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.070> get<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.280> all<00:01:08.399> out<00:01:08.430> I'll

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
it's not possible to get it all out I'll

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:33.590 
it's not possible to get it all out I'll
take<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.359> knee<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.659> take<00:01:09.810> off

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.820

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.240 

that's<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.869> step<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.290> clean<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.560> intake<00:01:41.040> the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
that's the step to clean the intake the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.530 
that's the step to clean the intake the
next<00:01:41.490> step<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.729> going<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.909> be<00:01:41.970> cleaning<00:01:42.390> the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
next step is going to be cleaning the

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.130 
next step is going to be cleaning the
top<00:01:43.439> end<00:01:43.680> using<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.189> top<00:01:44.729> end<00:01:44.970> cleaner

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.350 
top end using the top end cleaner
disconnect<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.100> vacuum<00:01:47.280> line<00:01:47.640> with<00:01:48.180> the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
disconnect the vacuum line with the

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.430 
disconnect the vacuum line with the
top-end<00:01:48.810> cleaner

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440

I'm running the car when
I'm<00:01:54.740> gonna

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
I'm gonna

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.490 
I'm gonna

the<00:02:01.590> motor<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.980> stall<00:02:02.450> that's<00:02:03.450> my<00:02:03.750> goal<00:02:03.960> with

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 
the motor to stall that's my goal with

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.710 
the motor to stall that's my goal with
the<00:02:04.350> stuff<00:02:04.620> is<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.890> make<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.160> motor<00:02:05.340> stall

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.660 

continually<00:02:09.229> cranking<00:02:09.710> before

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.309 

let<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.790> sit<00:02:15.060> for<00:02:15.090> an<00:02:15.360> hour<00:02:15.450> after<00:02:15.930> that

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
let it sit for an hour after that

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.720 
let it sit for an hour after that
so<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.560> Kenneth<00:02:16.860> has<00:02:16.980> been<00:02:17.130> washed<00:02:17.310> under<00:02:17.610> the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
so the Kenneth has been washed under the

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.870 
so the Kenneth has been washed under the
carbon<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.270> stuff<00:02:18.480> off

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
carbon and stuff off

carbon and stuff off
Vale's<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:20.570> intake<00:02:21.050> and<00:02:21.830> then<00:02:22.070> we're<00:02:22.280> going

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
Vale's and intake and then we're going

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.220 
Vale's and intake and then we're going
to<00:02:22.430> run<00:02:22.640> it<00:02:22.760> again<00:02:22.880> when<00:02:23.420> we<00:02:23.540> start<00:02:23.930> it<00:02:24.020> back<00:02:24.170> up

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
to run it again when we start it back up

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.690 
to run it again when we start it back up
for<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.710> first<00:02:24.920> time<00:02:25.160> we're<00:02:25.310> going<00:02:25.400> to<00:02:25.490> run<00:02:25.610> it

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
for the first time we're going to run it

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.430 
for the first time we're going to run it
pretty<00:02:25.910> hard<00:02:26.150> in<00:02:26.690> order<00:02:26.870> to<00:02:26.990> push<00:02:27.230> it<00:02:27.350> all

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
have the ability to change to turn out

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.410 
have the ability to change to turn out
the<00:03:18.620> check<00:03:18.830> engine<00:03:19.040> light<00:03:19.310> which<00:03:19.519> I<00:03:19.790> like<00:03:20.239> is

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
the check engine light which I like is

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.520 
the check engine light which I like is
going<00:03:20.540> to<00:03:20.629> come<00:03:20.780> on

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:04:13.260 

just<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.620> have<00:03:25.740> a<00:03:25.770> light<00:03:26.010> canvas

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.820 

so<00:04:14.270> right<00:04:14.420> now<00:04:14.569> the<00:04:14.629> mechanic<00:04:14.840> is<00:04:15.260> forcing<00:04:15.739> the

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
so right now the mechanic is forcing the

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:24.970 
so right now the mechanic is forcing the
cleaner<00:04:16.070> into<00:04:16.400> the<00:04:16.519> engine

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.380 

we<00:04:25.980> like<00:04:26.130> to<00:04:26.160> let<00:04:26.430> it<00:04:26.610> sit<00:04:26.820> at<00:04:26.910> least<00:04:27.090> an<00:04:27.240> hour

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
we like to let it sit at least an hour

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
we let it

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.790 
we let it
better<00:04:31.540> results<00:04:31.720> in<00:04:32.110> longer<00:04:32.260> at<00:04:32.470> City<00:04:34.800> yeah

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
better results in longer at City yeah
