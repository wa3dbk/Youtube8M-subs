in<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.550> middle<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.090> depending<00:00:21.359> what<00:00:21.480> size

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
in the middle of it depending what size

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.870 
in the middle of it depending what size
the<00:00:21.779> beds<00:00:21.960> are<00:00:22.109> but<00:00:22.289> this<00:00:23.250> one<00:00:23.430> here<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.580> called

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
the beds are but this one here is called

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.599 
the beds are but this one here is called
phormium<00:00:24.600> 10x<00:00:24.930> trickle<00:00:25.470> trickle<00:00:25.740> off<00:00:26.039> and

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
phormium 10x trickle trickle off and

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.220 
phormium 10x trickle trickle off and
it's<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.060> steep<00:00:27.300> has<00:00:27.480> got<00:00:27.630> as<00:00:27.720> three<00:00:27.900> colors

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
it's so steep has got as three colors

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.540 
it's so steep has got as three colors
kind<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.529> red<00:00:28.800> green<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:30.090> sort<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:31.550> whitish

kind of red green and a sort of whitish
margin<00:00:33.180> as<00:00:33.300> well<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:34.260> can<00:00:34.320> get<00:00:34.469> three<00:00:34.800> or

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
margin as well so you can get three or

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.110 
margin as well so you can get three or
four<00:00:34.950> different<00:00:35.399> types<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.760> them<00:00:35.850> but<00:00:36.030> this

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
four different types of them but this

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.720 
four different types of them but this
one<00:00:36.329> here<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:37.680> lovely<00:00:38.100> kind<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.340> silvery

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
one here is a lovely kind of silvery

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.049 
one here is a lovely kind of silvery
color<00:00:39.059> as<00:00:39.210> well<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:40.070> in<00:00:41.070> terms<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.579> planting

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
color as well so in terms of planting

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.410 
color as well so in terms of planting
they<00:00:42.780> come<00:00:42.960> like<00:00:43.079> nice<00:00:43.920> soils<00:00:44.420> including

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
they come like nice soils including

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.080 
they come like nice soils including
coastal<00:00:45.600> sites<00:00:45.989> as<00:00:46.140> well<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.530> they<00:00:46.710> don't<00:00:47.280> tend

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
coastal sites as well so they don't tend

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.500 
coastal sites as well so they don't tend
to<00:00:48.210> die<00:00:48.930> off<00:00:49.050> too<00:00:49.230> quickly<00:00:49.469> on<00:00:50.460> coasts<00:00:51.239> on

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
to die off too quickly on coasts on

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.540 
to die off too quickly on coasts on
coastlines<00:00:51.840> anything<00:00:52.379> like<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.500> but<00:00:52.739> be

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
coastlines anything like that but be

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.920 
coastlines anything like that but be
