 want to highlight the importance of the role 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.559
 of women in its different facets 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.139
 especially when you commit to 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.109
 social causes we go to a topic 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.779
 totally different now up to where 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.600
 the intelligence of a 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.930
 animal in the next report are going 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.369
 to move and surprise because we are going to 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.630
 see scenes that will reflect hwan 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.780
 smart and not only smart but 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.360
 in motives and sensitive may be the 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.520
 animals a group of stray dogs 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.790
 it crossed in the middle of the highway that a 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.690
 German villa team 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.840
 unfortunately a car that came to 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.670
 all speed impacted two of them 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.579
 this reckless white color act 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.129
 quick and he tried to revive his partner 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.250
 He is seeing that it was impossible decided 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.530
 drag him off the road 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.930
 to heroic acts like this dog's 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.060
 vagabond surprises us many will say that 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.680
 it's just survival instinct but 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.900
 recent studies in intelligence 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.940
 animal have discovered that man does not 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.270
 he is the only one who feels he learns 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.609
 understand and reflect 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.920
 in 2010 in the Turkish city of Ankara 

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:17.929
 a cat helps his sick companion 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.689
 applying a kind of massage 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:23.479
 cardiac to revive his action he 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.700
 He saved my life in 2008 compared to 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.409
 constant abuse against pets the 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.289
 protective society of animals of 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.509
 london made this commercial kahn it 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:35.030
 he calls pee and his behavior puts 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:38.420
 test their intelligence not all do 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.090
 their suitcases move and feel but if 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.239
 your best friend leaves home can be 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.039
 because the stay in television espn 

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:48.170
 acts without the commercial after a 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.599
 training called a method of 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.090
 test iron dog commits several 

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:57.099
 mistakes until by chance he succeeds 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.099
 a result and get a prize 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:07.880
 with the leg over you are the zoo of 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.670
 Witches in Holland without bances were 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.500
 subjected to a test of insight 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.080
 They had to use their imagination to reach 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.210
 a banana had the tools only 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.690
 I had to execute a plan and the fruit would be 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.690
 his 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.920
 because one can not help but be left 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.510
 surprised by the performance in 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.700
 intelligent appearance of those 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.620
 chimpanzees is that later works 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.450
 show that chimpanzees must 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.670
 have a great previous experience with 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.129
 the tools that are going to be used so 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.360
 that more than a flash of insight 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.790
 it would be a cumulative effect of 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.709
 learning one of the most cases 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.810
 amazing animal learning 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.930
 publication occurs on the island of borneo 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.489
 in Asia and the orangutans live with 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.610
 people in the rehabilitation center 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:00.450
 of the lic and with these animals help 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.450
 in the daily tasks 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.000
 a true example of imitation 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.159
 requires that the execution by the 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.010
 animal but the first time and little 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:16.390
 after your first try be the same 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.000
 as good as a performer's 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.150
 experiment if you see a chimpanzee 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.950
 experimental living in arizona usa and 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.079
 he learned to count objects until 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.829
 number 6 how many candies we have 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.829
 over 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.390
 one 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.510
 how many there are 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.510
 we go 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:50.740
 in two very well 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.740
 story tales 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.860
 if that is the companion of chivas is the 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.740
 parrot álex according to scientists the bird 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.280
 smartest in the world how many balls 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.280
 yellow 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:09.459
 do not try again how many green cubes 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.940
 álex ability to count is 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.890
 impressive and you have to accept it is a 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.080
 easier perception procedure 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:23.170
 a visual procedure rather than 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.300
 vinci intellect can now the mind 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.060
 animal use words as symbols to 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:31.290
 just as man does with language 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.290
 just watch álex 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.760
 the good boy is 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:42.830
 what is this 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:45.500
 wool very well observe now a 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.539
 true example of fidelity a child 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.970
 he plays with his ball and ends up breaking 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:53.259
 an ornament the nana tries to hit him but 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.259
 your cat decides 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.070
 that animals feel your 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.640
 feelings are more instinctive 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:05.550
 For example, when you protect your young if 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.670
 we have a female with 5 offspring and loses 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:12.030
 a baby is going to feel sad and the 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:14.390
 feels for a while but not 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.470
 as prolonged as that of the human being 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.240
 recent studies carried out in 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.670
 various animals indicate that their 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.860
 mental ability is very similar to the 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.230
 of man an evolutionary process that 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.660
 according to specialists it could culminate 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.850
 when we managed to communicate 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.940
 perfectly with these species how many 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.530
 there is 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.530
 2 very well
