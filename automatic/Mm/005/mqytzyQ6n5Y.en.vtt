00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
to be Germany who is better than

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.719 
to be Germany who is better than
Portugal<00:01:46.560> we<00:01:46.829> think<00:01:47.509> better<00:01:48.509> than<00:01:48.689> ganya<00:01:49.399> so<00:01:50.399> I

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
Portugal we think better than ganya so I

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.120 
Portugal we think better than ganya so I
think<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.960> u.s.<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.290> in<00:01:52.649> some<00:01:52.829> major<00:01:52.979> trouble

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
think the u.s. is in some major trouble

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.020 
think the u.s. is in some major trouble
and<00:01:55.189> it's<00:01:56.189> going<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.520> be<00:01:56.610> tough<00:01:56.759> but<00:01:56.969> I

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
and it's going to be tough but I

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.219 
and it's going to be tough but I
definitely<00:01:57.390> think<00:01:57.659> it's<00:01:57.840> pretty<00:01:57.960> cool<00:01:58.170> that

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
definitely think it's pretty cool that

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.420 
definitely think it's pretty cool that
they've<00:01:58.469> been<00:01:58.500> making<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.979> this<00:01:59.070> far<00:01:59.130> and

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
they've been making it this far and

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.620 
they've been making it this far and
they've<00:01:59.549> been<00:01:59.670> making<00:01:59.759> such<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.149> game<00:02:00.420> out<00:02:00.450> of
