you uncover the boxes and the boxes give

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.460 
you uncover the boxes and the boxes give
you<00:01:41.400> new<00:01:42.000> resources<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.990> don't<00:01:43.170> actually<00:01:43.439> use

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
you new resources you don't actually use

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.490 
you new resources you don't actually use
the<00:01:43.799> resources<00:01:44.310> yourself<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.689> there's<00:01:45.869> some

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
the resources yourself so there's some

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.020 
the resources yourself so there's some
timber<00:01:46.740> for<00:01:46.890> example<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:48.110> unlock<00:01:49.110> items<00:01:50.030> by

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
timber for example you unlock items by

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.300 
timber for example you unlock items by
gathering<00:01:51.420> more<00:01:51.659> resources<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.890> once<00:01:53.130> you've

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
gathering more resources so once you've

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.620 
gathering more resources so once you've
cost<00:01:53.490> enough<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.880> can<00:01:54.030> then<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.210> lot<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.479> things

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
cost enough you can then a lot of things

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.010 
cost enough you can then a lot of things
like<00:01:54.810> new<00:01:55.590> houses<00:01:56.180> and<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.299> helps<00:01:57.570> advance<00:01:57.719> the

that<00:05:06.120> was<00:05:06.300> going<00:05:06.479> to<00:05:06.539> get<00:05:06.690> ugly<00:05:07.530> too

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
that was going to get ugly too

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.559

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
follow-up target and in the base we're

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:27.379 
follow-up target and in the base we're
at<00:05:25.979> the<00:05:26.039> moment<00:05:26.280> I<00:05:26.310> did<00:05:26.490> notice<00:05:26.699> a<00:05:26.940> few<00:05:27.120> times

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:27.389 
at the moment I did notice a few times

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:30.320 
at the moment I did notice a few times
it<00:05:27.990> would<00:05:28.139> say<00:05:28.349> for<00:05:28.889> example<00:05:28.949> 500<00:05:29.880> and<00:05:30.090> I<00:05:30.180> was

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
it would say for example 500 and I was

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.870 
it would say for example 500 and I was
on<00:05:30.449> 550<00:05:31.409> so<00:05:31.710> there's<00:05:32.280> a<00:05:32.310> bit<00:05:32.460> of<00:05:32.490> an<00:05:32.580> issue<00:05:32.669> but

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
on 550 so there's a bit of an issue but

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.820 
on 550 so there's a bit of an issue but
it<00:05:33.000> did<00:05:33.180> still<00:05:33.419> trigger<00:05:33.630> the<00:05:33.810> upgrade<00:05:34.169> once<00:05:34.710> I

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
it did still trigger the upgrade once I

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.490 
it did still trigger the upgrade once I
hit<00:05:34.979> 600<00:05:35.880> or<00:05:36.090> whatever<00:05:36.690> the<00:05:36.840> real<00:05:36.990> target

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
hit 600 or whatever the real target

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.100 
hit 600 or whatever the real target
happened<00:05:38.370> to<00:05:38.460> be<00:05:38.599> as<00:05:39.599> you're<00:05:39.750> dragging<00:05:40.020> around
