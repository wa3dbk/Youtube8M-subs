00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
themselves they'll just start excreting

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.219

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
I had to speed this up here because the

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.130 
I had to speed this up here because the

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
and realistically i could probably run

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.840 
and realistically i could probably run
