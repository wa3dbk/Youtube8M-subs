00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:15.830 

loading<00:00:01.020> a<00:00:01.110> mission

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:15.840 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.929 

there's<00:00:16.840> no<00:00:17.110> doubt<00:00:17.410> in<00:00:17.560> my<00:00:17.590> mind<00:00:17.949> now<00:00:18.130> this

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
there's no doubt in my mind now this

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:20.880 
there's no doubt in my mind now this
whole<00:00:19.210> incident<00:00:19.510> has<00:00:19.990> Sigma<00:00:20.439> written<00:00:20.770> all

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
whole incident has Sigma written all

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:31.350 
whole incident has Sigma written all
over<00:00:20.920> it<00:00:25.740> where<00:00:26.740> is<00:00:27.039> he<00:00:27.279> anyway

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.470 

it's<00:00:32.320> obvious<00:00:32.920> that<00:00:32.950> Sigma<00:00:33.490> is<00:00:33.550> involved<00:00:34.060> but

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
it's obvious that Sigma is involved but

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.850 
it's obvious that Sigma is involved but
things<00:00:34.690> are<00:00:34.840> bound<00:00:35.020> to<00:00:35.200> be<00:00:35.260> different<00:00:35.650> this

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
things are bound to be different this

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.050 
things are bound to be different this
time<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:38.710> doesn't<00:00:39.130> seem<00:00:39.610> as<00:00:39.640> if<00:00:39.910> he's

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.060 
time it doesn't seem as if he's

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.700 
time it doesn't seem as if he's
controlling<00:00:40.540> these<00:00:40.780> new<00:00:41.020> Mavericks<00:00:41.500> like

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
controlling these new Mavericks like

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:49.510 
controlling these new Mavericks like
puppets<00:00:42.810> they<00:00:43.810> all<00:00:44.050> seem<00:00:44.440> to<00:00:44.820> be<00:00:45.820> him

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.300 

do<00:00:50.090> you<00:00:50.180> mean<00:00:50.390> copies<00:00:50.930> of<00:00:50.960> Sigma<00:00:52.870> I'm<00:00:53.920> not<00:00:54.920> sure

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:55.310 
do you mean copies of Sigma I'm not sure

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.850 
do you mean copies of Sigma I'm not sure
so<00:00:56.150> far<00:00:56.450> all<00:00:56.480> the<00:00:56.900> sites<00:00:57.170> attacked<00:00:57.530> have<00:00:57.710> been

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
so far all the sites attacked have been

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.650 
so far all the sites attacked have been
related<00:00:58.100> to<00:00:58.280> the<00:00:58.370> Jacob<00:00:58.790> project<00:01:01.210> I'm<00:01:02.210> picking

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.160 

you<00:01:43.750> just<00:01:44.020> don't<00:01:44.290> know<00:01:44.409> when<00:01:44.710> to<00:01:44.740> quit<00:01:45.040> do<00:01:45.430> you

don't<00:01:50.170> worry<00:01:50.649> x<00:01:51.119> it'll<00:01:52.119> all<00:01:52.329> be<00:01:52.540> over<00:01:52.689> soon<00:01:52.869> and

don't worry x it'll all be over soon and

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
don't worry x it'll all be over soon and
we'll<00:01:53.590> never<00:01:53.920> have<00:01:54.310> to<00:01:54.340> meet<00:01:54.790> again

what space that's our future lies in the

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.440 
what space that's our future lies in the
sky<00:02:13.260> your<00:02:14.260> old<00:02:14.710> world<00:02:15.250> has<00:02:15.580> outlived<00:02:16.150> its

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.840 

Mavericks<00:02:20.870> come<00:02:21.260> what's<00:02:22.070> your<00:02:22.250> scheme<00:02:22.550> this

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
Mavericks come what's your scheme this

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.780 
Mavericks come what's your scheme this
time

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
time

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.990 
time
scheme<00:02:25.840> this<00:02:26.840> is<00:02:27.140> Providence<00:02:27.860> I'm<00:02:28.520> merely

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
scheme this is Providence I'm merely

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.390 
scheme this is Providence I'm merely
ushering<00:02:29.600> evolution<00:02:30.260> along<00:02:30.380> its<00:02:30.740> natural

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
ushering evolution along its natural

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.580

path

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.020 

evolution

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.910 

so<00:02:42.030> Sigma<00:02:42.360> was<00:02:42.660> really<00:02:43.050> after<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.470> Jacob

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
so Sigma was really after the Jacob

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.030 
so Sigma was really after the Jacob
project<00:02:44.340> all<00:02:44.520> along<00:02:45.380> if<00:02:46.380> you<00:02:46.620> stop<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:47.010> think

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
project all along if you stop to think

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.920 
project all along if you stop to think
about<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.550> it<00:02:47.670> makes<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.940> lot<00:02:48.120> of<00:02:48.150> sense<00:02:50.930> space

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
about it it makes a lot of sense space

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.540 
about it it makes a lot of sense space
development<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:52.710> the<00:02:52.890> emergence<00:02:53.370> of<00:02:53.490> new

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
generation Reptoids aren't unrelated so

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.240 
generation Reptoids aren't unrelated so
it's<00:03:00.510> causing<00:03:00.960> these<00:03:01.050> new<00:03:01.350> generation<00:03:02.010> Rev

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
it's causing these new generation Rev

it's causing these new generation Rev
Lloyd's<00:03:02.490> to<00:03:02.700> go<00:03:02.850> maverick<00:03:03.180> huh

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.650 

we<00:03:06.670> can't<00:03:06.940> let<00:03:07.060> him<00:03:07.150> get<00:03:07.300> away<00:03:07.450> with<00:03:07.570> this

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.870 

sigma's<00:03:11.470> transmission<00:03:12.130> was<00:03:12.310> disrupted<00:03:12.880> by

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
sigma's transmission was disrupted by

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.710 
sigma's transmission was disrupted by
the<00:03:13.090> orbit<00:03:13.480> of<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.660> satellite<00:03:15.150> this<00:03:16.150> is<00:03:16.360> lucky

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
the orbit of the satellite this is lucky

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.900 
the orbit of the satellite this is lucky
the<00:03:17.170> elevator<00:03:17.590> is<00:03:17.770> still<00:03:17.980> functional<00:03:18.550> so<00:03:18.790> we

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
the elevator is still functional so we

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.930 
the elevator is still functional so we
can<00:03:19.060> use<00:03:19.210> it<00:03:19.390> to<00:03:19.420> get<00:03:19.600> to<00:03:19.780> it
