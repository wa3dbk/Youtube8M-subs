00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:32.349
 so the first thing I use 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.630
 to wash my face is precisely the 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:39.059
 micellar solution of bioderma that 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:42.699
 I like it so much I apply it with a 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.160

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:48.790
 to cleanse my eyes I try to 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.440
 sion I rub soft but fairly badly 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.110
 to remove makeup on the eyes 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.860
 so I know about both eyes and 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.320
 then also I have I clean kind my 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.320
 child's face but like makeup 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.110

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.729
 remove makeup I use is 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.729
 cleans up so let's 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.360
 so you can see that it stays 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.750
 still very much makeup 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.630
 then I use a scrubbing so 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.890

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.990

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.180

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.010

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.090
 in the meantime then I still like 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.120

 very well it was underground that 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.540

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.570

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.399
 once i did that i just want 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.050

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.510
 I want to come clean my face 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.530

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.630
 that I use is the cleaner 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.190

 the face then it's just really 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:17.100
 doubi it cleans just too well so I 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.370
 will I finally hold it's still a 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.370
 time

 Then I dry my face I 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.200

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.019
 for the press 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.060
 so the next step is the one 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:45.239

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.110

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:16.260
 if it's really good to remove everything 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:19.229
 makeup is yes so I leave 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.500
 to dry and the next step is to 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:24.449
 correct but have not corrected but 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.600
 applied a nation that will help to make 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:29.130
 decrease the share of sheep I can 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.979
 why but this word if I want 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.130
 this is so I have applied where there 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:34.130
 had 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.810
 it's still fine, it's a 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.780
 lotion is depressed spectral admitted 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:46.770
 Cairo then it is a lotion option 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:49.320
 base of wooded mount the peroxide of 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.790
 benzoyl something like that and then 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:55.170
 it's not melted it's a bit like 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:58.380
 citalis allied with the buttons so 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:01.050
 I apply when I have what is a 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.760
 little else then the next step 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.520
 for me it's m 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.470
 an eye cream so I do 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.060
 not all the time that because of 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.270
 I'm just too fickle 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:16.360
 but elected it is a cream in 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.900
 the body shop a cream count for 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.940
 the eyes are fine, it's very 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.040
 light but at the same time if kremlin 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.320
 think it comes well hydrated the 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.230
 little door below the eyes it's 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:33.940
 good for wrinkles and fine lines 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:37.600
 then I'm with my night cream 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.970
 the child is that of cat bard 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.830
 Pury and worry is a very beautiful 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.380
 cream that moisturizes the skin 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:48.720
 for the evening it is also a cream that l 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:51.280
 decreased appearance of fine lines and wrinkles 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.260
 so I can not you to whom I see a 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.710
 difference because as if I had 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:59.920
 as long as they are at the start but I like 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:04.330
 a lot the the option its mellow the 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:07.360
 cream of driving president president and 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.490
 then the last step shortly before 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.410
 to go to bed is to apply a balm to 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.030
 lips in the bottom and that moisturizes years 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.910
 and then I started doing this I put 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:18.010
 my lip balm is my drawer 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.140

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:22.450
 to use it before going to bed 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.650
 so if all the steps and now I 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.080
 am ready to go to bed 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.090
