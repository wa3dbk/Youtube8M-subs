00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
like I said it was a tough opponent he

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.920 
like I said it was a tough opponent he
was<00:04:48.680> on<00:04:48.830> top<00:04:49.009> but<00:04:49.639> it<00:04:49.909> finished<00:04:50.330> free<00:04:50.539> to<00:04:50.720> and

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
was on top but it finished free to and

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.779 
was on top but it finished free to and

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:52.789

a<00:04:52.819> tough<00:04:53.030> opponent<00:04:53.210> and<00:04:53.810> yeah<00:04:54.620> I<00:04:54.650> think<00:04:54.800> it

a tough opponent and yeah I think it
could<00:04:55.069> have<00:04:55.159> beaten<00:04:55.340> as<00:04:55.460> if<00:04:55.580> I<00:04:55.669> wasn't<00:04:55.849> on<00:04:56.030> top

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180

could have beaten as if I wasn't on top
