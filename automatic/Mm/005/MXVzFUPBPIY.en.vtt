00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.600
 the car do the sign 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.380
 the exact thinking maybe children 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.729
 had tripoli 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:07.750
 branches 10 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.419
 put them together 

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:12.950
 and then finally and then with small packages but what more do you want 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:17.109
 and at grand build to see sit twice 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.079
 but this is not how it works our plan always says that important 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:23.050
 Dekkers that it can be done differently 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.089
 you should 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:27.089
 always building on a warm surface and those are leaves 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:30.689
 so here our house becomes a treasure hunt 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.800
 and for our second place, ten 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.730
 the hema wants to reflect as artistically all the results 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.620
 he did that too and then we went to see what nicer branches can find 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.990
 we are looking for large branches 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.940
 the transfer fee becomes this book 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.970
 the opera and it looks funny 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.199
 and I like that too 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:55.200
 this given 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.760
 so this would also ever drive a pack here so organizes 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.120
 after all, it is a large branch, seen a month earlier 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.390
 van der continue they have then you can well but this world 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.830
 there is not that much to do with it 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.900
 After this we will also go to court, yes there must also be a few 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.300
 mention it on the ground and then also in the ignition of course 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.430
 7 crazy though 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.660
 passes 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.720
 well there you have another point there waited i have you there 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.530
 maybe something 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.530
 furthermore we can put it down easily 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.540
 bruges 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.960
 there are nice facts 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.330
 that is 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.950
 I have left 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.520
 look very carefully i pay work on board the heavy work 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.980
 we have good agreements 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.070
 He owns the region's field battery odbs 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.280
 you can you 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.860
 the premium here would be 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.430
 the law 8 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.940
 bees are over branches 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.210
 he will see how the word 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.320
 chariot with a firearm
