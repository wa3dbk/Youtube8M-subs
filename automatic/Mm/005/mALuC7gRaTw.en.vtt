a<00:02:05.899> short<00:02:06.229> extension<00:02:06.530> cord<00:02:07.009> up<00:02:07.250> into<00:02:07.970> the

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
a short extension cord up into the

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.359 
a short extension cord up into the
canopy<00:02:08.270> of<00:02:08.600> the<00:02:08.630> tree<00:02:08.989> so<00:02:09.830> that<00:02:09.979> we<00:02:10.069> can<00:02:10.220> tie

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
canopy of the tree so that we can tie

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.300 
canopy of the tree so that we can tie
into<00:02:10.550> that<00:02:10.789> later<00:02:14.410> you<00:02:15.410> want<00:02:15.590> to<00:02:15.709> have<00:02:15.950> the

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
into that later you want to have the

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.400 
into that later you want to have the
extra<00:02:16.700> extension<00:02:17.239> cord<00:02:17.480> up<00:02:17.660> in<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:17.959> canopy

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
extra extension cord up in the canopy

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.320 
extra extension cord up in the canopy
primarily<00:02:19.100> so<00:02:19.370> you<00:02:19.430> have<00:02:19.640> an<00:02:19.760> extra<00:02:20.120> power

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
primarily so you have an extra power

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.990 
primarily so you have an extra power
source<00:02:20.660> right<00:02:21.290> inside<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.800> tree<00:02:22.069> once<00:02:22.850> you

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
source right inside the tree once you

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.840 
source right inside the tree once you
tie<00:02:23.269> three<00:02:23.900> 100-volt<00:02:24.739> strings<00:02:25.280> of<00:02:25.519> minis

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
tie three 100-volt strings of minis

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.970 
tie three 100-volt strings of minis
together<00:02:26.209> you<00:02:26.780> have<00:02:27.019> to<00:02:27.200> go<00:02:27.319> back<00:02:27.500> to<00:02:27.680> a<00:02:27.709> power

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
together you have to go back to a power

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.800 
together you have to go back to a power
source<00:02:28.310> where<00:02:28.850> you<00:02:28.880> run<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.360> chance<00:02:29.630> of

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
source where you run the chance of

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.199 
source where you run the chance of
shorting<00:02:30.230> out<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.470> strings<00:02:30.769> also<00:02:31.730> you<00:02:32.000> need

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
shorting out the strings also you need

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.030 
shorting out the strings also you need
to<00:02:32.299> make<00:02:32.450> sure<00:02:32.480> you<00:02:32.870> position<00:02:33.049> the<00:02:33.500> end<00:02:33.709> of<00:02:33.920> the

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
to make sure you position the end of the

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.640 
to make sure you position the end of the
cord<00:02:34.340> down<00:02:34.880> so<00:02:35.600> water<00:02:35.840> doesn't<00:02:36.140> cool<00:02:36.440> up

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
cord down so water doesn't cool up

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.500 
cord down so water doesn't cool up
inside<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.250> cord<00:02:37.519> and<00:02:37.760> short<00:02:38.030> it<00:02:38.150> out<00:02:38.269> when<00:02:38.420> it

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
inside the cord and short it out when it

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.990 
inside the cord and short it out when it
rains<00:02:38.950> okay<00:02:39.950> so<00:02:40.010> we're<00:02:40.280> ready<00:02:40.310> now<00:02:40.760> to<00:02:40.819> start

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
rains okay so we're ready now to start

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.150 
rains okay so we're ready now to start
