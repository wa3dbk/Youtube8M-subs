00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.040
 you buy a new memory kit and 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.630
 how you wanted the best performance possible 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.090
 got a model with more frequency 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.919
 available you have fulfilled an important 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.269
 step in the process to have an opinion 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:20.949
 high performance 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:23.259
 but maybe you 've forgotten a detail 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.419
 that not everyone knows to take the 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:28.509
 maximum benefit from your RAM is 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:30.489
 need to change the xmp profile these 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.470
 profiles back in pre settings 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.600
 determined by the manufacturers 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.539
 basically move with automatic and 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.829
 secure memory modules 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:39.640
 so as soon as you install your 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.260
 memoirs 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.929
 they will be running at a frequency 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.660
 but the process for changing this is 

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:49.839
 very simple to start 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.940
 open the bios of your computer for this 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:54.910
 press the delete or f 2 key while the 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.039
 computer is starting the key goes 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.559
 depending on your motherboard model but 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.989
 always be one of these two within the 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.080
 bios finds a session where the option to 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.900
 change the profile xmp our case we are 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.540
 using an asus rog motherboard then 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.650
 we need to access the extreme section 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.980
 twitter 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.440
 the next step is to click there overclock 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.620
 tuner and change the automatic switch 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.360
 for xmp when doing this will appear the 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.310
 option xmp just below 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.170
 this is where you can change the profile 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.240
 xmp from your memory 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.290
 in our case we are using modules 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.430
 raptorex producer of r 4 and 3 thousand megatts 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.200
 So, what speed do we go? 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.050
 select in the settings 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.150
 there is only leave the bios but do not forget 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.470
 to save your settings 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.090
 if you want to confirm that the 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.940
 settings have been applied 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.620
 just use a program like cpu z as 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.010
 you can see on the screen the frequency of 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.740
 our modules went from 2,133 to 3 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.690
 north megatts only that the value that 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.410
 appears the application is half the value 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.660
 real 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.370
 if you prefer motherboard manufacturers 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.010
 also launch programs to 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.970
 change the xmp profile directly through 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.510
 from windows 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:10.450
 now if you have ddr3 hyperx memory and 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.370
 of r 4 or ipads tie 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.150
 You do not have to do anything like this. 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.590
 what you need 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.590
 do is connect the memories to play 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:26.650
 the ssds solid-state drive no longer 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.670
 are new to enthusiasts of 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.650
 technology 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.590
 after all we know the advantages that 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.150
 technology brings in relation to hd 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.650
 especially for gamers and includes 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.049
 shorter system boot time 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.659
 and textures that carry more 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.220
 fast during games without counting 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.829
 you spend a lot less time seeing in 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.870
 loading screens the problem is that 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.970
 who owns a notebook is not always 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.909
 so simple to find space to install 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.819
 no ssd is to solve this problem 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:57.750
 that there are solid state drives 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.750
