00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.670
 You already know how to download a file 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.120

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.400
 in the chemistry part 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.400
 we are going to click 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.650

 coke now we have to wait for the 25 seconds that ask us for a cross side 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.409
 as you already know powers if we are registered are 25 and if we are not 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.130
 registered we have to wait about 45 seconds or what 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.230
 in a good this program that is at 240 points of sale and in what places 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.490
 and it only works on windows in the north 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.799
 the project and program is called has to be punished 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.940
 Once the time is over it shows who downloads the rule

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.700
 we downloaded it kent 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.440
 we will give to whom 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.440
 or let's open the folder where the file was downloaded 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.200
 i will be left to chile the compressed file 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.530
 as you know what we have to do skiing with our right button 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.109
 species 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:15.379
 with a good if you do not have the program to unzip the files 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.559
 in 'I have a tutorial on edwin radar so you can unzip your files 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:20.639
 what 

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:22.759
 once it is decompressed 

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:27.849
 we are going to be this one this direct access in how they can be seen as it is 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.139
 A yes 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:32.139
 a desk with a slogan 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.190
 movies and 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.679
 like a movie tape or what 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:39.289
 what we are going to do now is give 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:42.289
 Double click 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:46.409
 what we have to do is give it 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:50.260
 and like all right execute as administrator or that he 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.099
 Well then but I could not contain the error 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:57.409
 they know 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:00.409
 for it to work explained right engine 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.579
 explained the doctor in law 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.579
 execute as an administrator 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:13.329
 in him was 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.769
 we are going to do it to him if we want that it makes changes of the program 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:21.729
 we were a little 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:25.049
 and it will open us a little dent 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.159
 and what we are going to do 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:31.359
 what we are going to do now is 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.620
 if you want to activate the function 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.620
 because this is not anything other than an activator 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.249
 because that function can be said that 

00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:43.619
 who's coming will sleep from windows seven 

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:45.399
 and what we are going to do 

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:48.619
 to activate pop to wake her up 

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:52.250
 is to give it here where it says in nobody 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.469
 efe 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:57.519
 As you can see, I have this function disabled 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.199
 because I have it disabled 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:01.279
 why not 

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:03.499
 I already have 

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:06.819
 this function wakes up like it did 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.819
 that is, they are not going to wake up again 

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:11.809
 so 

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:15.219
 so they activated this function I have to give you here 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.669
 and then what would be disabled and could not put an efe video 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.840
 then you already know to activate this function you give here in 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.840
 in aviles yen efe 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.960
 in case you already want the function that you can I think that the good 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.900
 nobody will not want that function 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.240
 they are going to give to whom to speak about you of impression 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:49.740
 well once you lead your agent at the racecourse to activate the function 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:55.520
 the forest the windows seeker 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.360
 When restarting 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.020
 what is the search engine the search engine because the folders are this 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:05.490
 what are the icons and that goes 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.250
 as it would set aside a little 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.330
 do not scare is something normal, it lasts very little 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.169
 it's like a flicker villa 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:15.550
 that can also tell you that the function has already been activated or 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:17.889
 well then 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.930
 now since you have the obviously active function 

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:24.680
 we will go to where you have according to video 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.050
 and here in my case I have this video 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.449
 what are we going to do the real betis with right buttons 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:31.490
 to the video 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:32.949
 and we are going to give it 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:36.559
 in the badajoz merchants around the menu 

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:38.340
 what is this that says to be 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.320
 before this 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.509
 banking van 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:42.979
 let's be objective 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:46.960
 immediately the video to start running 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.419
 as well as for our wallpaper where you can find out 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:52.439
 I have my 

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:55.949
 nor king's taskbar and the video is adapting 

00:05:56.809 --> 00:06:00.990
 the operation this program looks very fluid the image 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.789
 i well whole 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:05.689
 Now it's everything and I called them next video
