00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.070

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:10.180

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.180

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:19.659
 that they lost my house and it already takes the 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.490
 compass and 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:26.079
 where they go from your house you have to walk 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.810
 to your quiet and happy house of life and 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:32.590
 perfect coming to my house 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:36.240
 friends all for nothing if you mind very 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:39.350
 what they have to do is this 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.930
 they go far away 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.930
 and there I am very far close minecraft 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.430
 they are going to vote because title 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:58.329
 and they put you through here and they're going to 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.329
 move point of initial pressure 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.150
 before they are here 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:12.080
 eye this can not work sometimes this 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.080
 sometimes it fails them I recommend it 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.410
 so please be careful of 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.390
 use it 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.390
 because to see where they appear 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.370
 if it appears here where it works then 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.490

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.490
