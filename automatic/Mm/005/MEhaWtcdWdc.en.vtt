nothing there it's black why because

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.039 
nothing there it's black why because
it's<00:01:49.829> severely<00:01:50.220> underexposed<00:01:50.970> now<00:01:51.570> with

the flash over here I've adjusted the

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.810 
the flash over here I've adjusted the

power by the way for the flash at 8

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.630 
power by the way for the flash at 8
power<00:01:59.180> that<00:01:59.780> allows<00:02:00.050> me<00:02:00.230> to<00:02:00.320> be<00:02:00.440> f11<00:02:01.070> at<00:02:01.280> this

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640

approximate distance and I'm having the

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.430 
approximate distance and I'm having the
light<00:02:04.040> come<00:02:04.340> in<00:02:04.520> as<00:02:04.700> if<00:02:04.850> it's<00:02:05.030> backlit<00:02:05.510> so<00:02:06.110> take

light come in as if it's backlit so take

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.520 
light come in as if it's backlit so take
a<00:02:06.470> look<00:02:06.740> with<00:02:07.370> the<00:02:07.430> benefit<00:02:07.910> of<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:08.030> flash

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
that black background we once had is now

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.920

by<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.470> stroke<00:02:21.890> I'm<00:02:22.370> often<00:02:22.640> asked<00:02:23.120> well<00:02:23.210> does

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
by the stroke I'm often asked well does

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.790 
by the stroke I'm often asked well does
it<00:02:23.420> really<00:02:23.540> matter<00:02:23.870> whether<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.320> strobe<00:02:24.620> is

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
it really matter whether the strobe is

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.590 
it really matter whether the strobe is
placed<00:02:25.130> you<00:02:25.430> darn<00:02:25.670> right<00:02:25.880> it<00:02:26.030> does<00:02:26.210> because

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
placed you darn right it does because

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.630 
placed you darn right it does because
we're<00:02:26.780> emphasizing<00:02:26.930> texture<00:02:27.920> when<00:02:28.430> it's

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
we're emphasizing texture when it's

backlit when it's front we'll take a

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.380 
backlit when it's front we'll take a
look<00:02:31.430> at<00:02:31.550> this<00:02:31.700> shot<00:02:32.290> clearly<00:02:33.290> it<00:02:33.590> falls<00:02:33.860> flat

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
look at this shot clearly it falls flat

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.720 
look at this shot clearly it falls flat
front<00:02:35.390> lighting<00:02:35.660> is<00:02:35.930> flat<00:02:36.260> lighting

look<00:02:40.010> at<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:40.220> two<00:02:40.400> side-by-side<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:41.300> I<00:02:41.330> think

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
look at the two side-by-side and I think

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.300 
look at the two side-by-side and I think
the<00:02:41.660> point<00:02:41.930> is<00:02:42.020> well<00:02:42.230> made<00:02:42.260> so<00:02:42.890> to<00:02:42.950> kill

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
the point is well made so to kill

in from the front something to think
