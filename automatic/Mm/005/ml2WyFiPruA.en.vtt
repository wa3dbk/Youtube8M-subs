may be different this will give you an

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.140 
may be different this will give you an
idea<00:01:24.750> about<00:01:25.110> how<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:25.770> system<00:01:25.950> works<00:01:26.189> we'll

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
idea about how this system works we'll

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.700 
idea about how this system works we'll
start<00:01:27.450> by<00:01:27.600> removing<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.140> cover<00:01:28.380> over<00:01:28.590> the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
start by removing the cover over the

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.700 
start by removing the cover over the
lock<00:01:28.950> assembly

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.500 

now<00:01:35.710> we<00:01:35.770> can<00:01:36.040> see<00:01:36.250> our<00:01:36.400> lock<00:01:36.640> actuator<00:01:36.910> right

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
now we can see our lock actuator right

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.480 
now we can see our lock actuator right
here<00:01:37.780> and<00:01:38.590> we're<00:01:38.710> going<00:01:38.830> to<00:01:38.980> replace<00:01:39.220> it<00:01:39.280> with

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
here and we're going to replace it with

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.280 
here and we're going to replace it with
a<00:01:39.880> brand<00:01:40.180> new<00:01:40.270> one<00:01:40.390> that<00:01:40.690> we<00:01:40.960> bought<00:01:41.110> directly

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
a brand new one that we bought directly

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:49.940 
a brand new one that we bought directly
from<00:01:41.590> Newmar<00:01:42.010> next<00:01:42.310> we'll<00:01:42.490> remove<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.940> latch

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.580 

now<00:01:50.950> we'll<00:01:51.160> remove<00:01:51.370> this<00:01:51.729> metal<00:01:52.000> plate<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:53.560> we

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
now we'll remove this metal plate so we

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.710 
now we'll remove this metal plate so we
can<00:01:53.830> get<00:01:53.950> access<00:01:54.190> to<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:55.060> actuator<00:01:55.479> now<00:01:55.660> we

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
can get access to the actuator now we

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.690 
can get access to the actuator now we
can<00:01:55.990> see<00:01:56.200> how<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.380> actuator<00:01:56.950> solenoid<00:01:57.460> works

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
can see how the actuator solenoid works

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.260 
can see how the actuator solenoid works

even though you can't see the internal

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.780 
even though you can't see the internal
workings<00:02:22.900> of<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.110> old<00:02:23.350> actuator<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.520> can<00:02:24.670> get

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
workings of the old actuator you can get

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.790 
workings of the old actuator you can get
an<00:02:24.880> idea<00:02:25.209> for<00:02:25.420> how<00:02:25.480> old<00:02:25.570> it<00:02:25.900> is<00:02:25.989> because<00:02:26.680> the

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
an idea for how old it is because the

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.830 
an idea for how old it is because the
bellows<00:02:27.190> is<00:02:27.400> completely<00:02:27.850> fallen<00:02:28.180> apart<00:02:28.239> after

eight years of use now let's put our

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.550 
eight years of use now let's put our
assembly<00:02:31.000> back<00:02:31.180> together<00:02:31.360> using<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:32.440> new

actuator<00:02:33.100> in<00:02:33.280> place<00:02:33.459> of<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.700> old<00:02:33.730> one

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.120 

be<00:02:51.090> sure<00:02:51.300> to<00:02:51.420> line<00:02:51.600> up<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.870> green<00:02:52.080> wires<00:02:52.320> on

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
be sure to line up the green wires on

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:08.690 
be sure to line up the green wires on
one<00:02:53.430> side<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.330> blue<00:02:54.540> wires<00:02:54.780> on<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.530> other

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.339 

now<00:03:09.700> that<00:03:09.909> we've<00:03:10.030> replaced<00:03:10.299> the<00:03:10.480> actuator<00:03:10.959> we

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
now that we've replaced the actuator we

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.250 
now that we've replaced the actuator we
can<00:03:11.530> show<00:03:11.769> you<00:03:11.829> exactly<00:03:12.310> how<00:03:12.610> this<00:03:12.790> works<00:03:13.260> when

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
can show you exactly how this works when

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.509 
can show you exactly how this works when
I<00:03:14.290> pull<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.680> handle<00:03:14.980> to<00:03:15.400> open<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.790> door<00:03:17.519> this

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
I pull the handle to open the door this

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.149 
I pull the handle to open the door this
is<00:03:18.700> how<00:03:18.849> the<00:03:18.909> mechanism<00:03:19.510> moves<00:03:20.069> releasing<00:03:21.069> the

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:21.159 
is how the mechanism moves releasing the

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:26.509 
is how the mechanism moves releasing the
latch<00:03:21.659> when<00:03:22.659> we<00:03:22.810> lock<00:03:22.989> the<00:03:23.200> door

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.729 

the<00:03:27.519> latch<00:03:27.730> is<00:03:27.909> blocked<00:03:28.290> let's<00:03:29.290> do<00:03:29.440> a<00:03:29.470> real

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
the latch is blocked let's do a real

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.770 
the latch is blocked let's do a real
close-up<00:03:30.010> on<00:03:30.310> this<00:03:30.519> so<00:03:31.030> you<00:03:31.090> can<00:03:31.269> see<00:03:31.450> how<00:03:31.629> it

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
close-up on this so you can see how it

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.199 
close-up on this so you can see how it
works<00:03:32.280> when<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.430> lock<00:03:33.609> is<00:03:33.849> in<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.120> unlocked

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
works when the lock is in the unlocked

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.360 
works when the lock is in the unlocked
position<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:37.120> handle<00:03:37.510> moves<00:03:37.690> freely

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
position the handle moves freely

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.690 
position the handle moves freely
allowing<00:03:39.370> us<00:03:39.519> to<00:03:39.700> open<00:03:40.299> the<00:03:40.480> latch<00:03:41.549> when<00:03:42.549> it's

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
allowing us to open the latch when it's

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.710 
allowing us to open the latch when it's
locked<00:03:43.319> we<00:03:44.319> can<00:03:44.530> see<00:03:44.739> that<00:03:44.920> this<00:03:45.040> metal<00:03:45.370> arm

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
locked we can see that this metal arm

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.619 
locked we can see that this metal arm
now<00:03:46.720> blocks<00:03:47.049> the<00:03:47.260> actuator<00:03:47.709> from<00:03:47.950> moving<00:03:48.629> you

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:49.629 
now blocks the actuator from moving you

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.270 
now blocks the actuator from moving you
can<00:03:49.780> also<00:03:49.930> see<00:03:50.319> that<00:03:50.680> we've<00:03:50.799> added<00:03:50.950> fresh

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
can also see that we've added fresh

00:03:51.280 --> 00:04:00.800 
can also see that we've added fresh
grease<00:03:51.659> while<00:03:52.659> we're<00:03:52.810> servicing<00:03:53.290> the<00:03:53.379> lock

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.210 

now<00:04:01.810> when<00:04:02.019> I<00:04:02.049> head<00:04:02.290> outside<00:04:02.440> and<00:04:02.739> need<00:04:03.040> access

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
now when I head outside and need access

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.699 
now when I head outside and need access
to<00:04:03.489> the<00:04:03.670> basement<00:04:04.060> I<00:04:04.209> know<00:04:04.540> that<00:04:05.170> every<00:04:05.500> door

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
to the basement I know that every door

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.580 
to the basement I know that every door
is<00:04:05.859> open<00:04:06.329> and<00:04:07.329> when<00:04:07.450> I<00:04:07.480> finished<00:04:07.900> and<00:04:08.170> it's

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
is open and when I finished and it's

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.699 
is open and when I finished and it's
time<00:04:08.769> to<00:04:08.799> lock<00:04:09.040> up<00:04:09.280> I<00:04:09.900> know<00:04:10.900> all<00:04:11.199> the<00:04:11.349> doors<00:04:11.560> are

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
time to lock up I know all the doors are

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.069 
time to lock up I know all the doors are
secure
