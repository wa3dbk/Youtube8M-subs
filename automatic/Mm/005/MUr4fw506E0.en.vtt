 today in great shape 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.230
 in fact the patron despite the start 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.750
 from the pit lane due to battery problems 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.580
 succeeds after countless overtaking ad 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.620
 grab the podium and find yourself 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.590
 even on the second step for 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.230
 the departure of ronzoni from his scene 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.360
 an excellent race pace and a best lap 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.190
 the almost fifty year old RAI license among 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.980
 a few days gave ample proof 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.720
 that this and extraordinary motion can 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.810
 be guided to a good level too 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.269
 in age no longer green 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.940

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:21.010
 the fourth place podium for the Swede

 daniel person quinto bepi michelotto ma 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.040
 today it went very well 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.090
 in short, we won the race, so it is 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.129
 went well for strength 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.950
 sorry i'm really sorry for jan 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:35.129
 they varied because the championship is a 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.140
 Our discourse is the fact of not ending 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.000
 unfortunately a race can be said that 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.860
 compromises almost everything because the races 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.959
 they are very few then it can happen to me 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.880
 the next one really would have been 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.190
 nice to play it until the end but so much 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.760
 I can already say that Imola will still be online 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.769
 he is ready to give us a briefing 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.879
 so nothing for the rest anyway 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.940
 it's all OK 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:59.310
 well actually one was already planned 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.310
 large turnout at the third 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.340
 round and there was some defection but 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.840
 in the end we were 34 35 on the grid 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.420
 day we witnessed the medium is 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.840
 went very well and the two categories 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.569
 times less than the 125 gp but we are still 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.660
 investing in this historic class 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:20.700
 so even today we had 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.520
 the absolute debut of the boy 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.860
 alessandro pozzo on honda and at 14 years yes 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.830
 it is allowed to use 212 without 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.590
 having ever seen the track this means 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.870
 that the championship is also preparatory 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.789
 for the young champions of tomorrow 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.979
 this is to reiterate that the federation 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:40.039
 this has already been understood by the motorcycle manufacturer 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.940
 economic championship situation 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:45.400
 beautiful motorcycles e 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.670
 great economy for the registration for the 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.830
 management so I'm waiting for you all now 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.630
 we have two months of rest we will see each other for 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.420
 the fourth round and then the round of 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.120
 return to the historic imola circuit 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:01.180
 I look forward to seeing you all and continue to 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.660
 follow us on 250 gp point it 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.910
 if we say that I was the whole race 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.790
 third because marchetta had started from 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.980
 pit lane and in the end he picked me up e 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.240
 I thought I had finished fourth and then it is 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.200
 arrived at the closed park they have me 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:19.720
 announced that the arno has fallen and me 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:23.050
 I'm very sorry because he deserved it 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.810
 definitely a better location maybe 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:29.860
 also to win and then in the end there 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:32.410
 come third so in short I make a 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.150
 ayane greeting that i am sorry but can 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.980
 happen 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:39.640
 I hope, in short, it will recover quickly 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:42.160
 in 250 sports and paolo favalli yes 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.020
 award the ranking on max and treasures 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.730
 and roberto vitti 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.190
 but the race was tiring because 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.930
 a lot that I am still as the three 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.840
 wild cards, however, have appeared 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.760
 here this race but in short it was 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.830
 fun then in the end because the 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.680
 fantastic circuit conditions were 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.320
 ideal and great fun the trophy 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.320
 it's fantastic organized in a way 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.430
 excellent what to say I enjoyed it 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.590
 very 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:12.160
 debut with a bang for the fourteen year old 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:15.070
 alessandro pozzo honda 125 gp that has 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.410
 conquered by wild card the round of 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.230
 mugello in front of the Lorenzo brothers 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:22.030

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.440
 imola for the fourth round of the season 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.270
 I came here to mugello on Friday for 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.810
 the first time made the two rounds of 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.820
 free 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.950
 yesterday even for a problem I have 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.630
 had to skip one of the two will succeed there 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.420
 so I am very happy to succeed in 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.990
 to win 

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:41.440
 for the 125 gp it was really a debut 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.440
 perfect
