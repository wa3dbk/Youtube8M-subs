00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
pro package that I'm going to review

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.220 
pro package that I'm going to review
very<00:00:30.150> shortly<00:00:30.449> but<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.660> thought<00:00:30.840> I'd<00:00:30.960> just<00:00:31.019> take

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
very shortly but I thought I'd just take

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.590 
very shortly but I thought I'd just take
a<00:00:31.260> quick<00:00:31.500> look<00:00:31.710> at<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:32.010> before<00:00:33.000> we<00:00:33.120> get<00:00:33.330> there

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
a quick look at this before we get there

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.049 
a quick look at this before we get there
as<00:00:34.379> I<00:00:34.559> say<00:00:34.680> it's<00:00:34.890> looks<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.519> bit<00:00:35.550> like<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:35.970> think

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
as I say it's looks a bit like a I think

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.479 
as I say it's looks a bit like a I think
it's<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.300> same<00:00:36.449> form<00:00:36.720> factor<00:00:37.050> as<00:00:37.199> a<00:00:37.500> what<00:00:38.430> is

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
it's the same form factor as a what is

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.970 
it's the same form factor as a what is
it<00:00:38.610> per<00:00:38.699> GoPro<00:00:39.030> 3<00:00:39.330> so<00:00:40.110> it's<00:00:40.290> it's<00:00:40.559> reasonably

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
it per GoPro 3 so it's it's reasonably

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.110 
it per GoPro 3 so it's it's reasonably
small<00:00:41.129> it's<00:00:41.250> actually<00:00:41.309> quite<00:00:41.610> heavy<00:00:41.879> because

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
small it's actually quite heavy because

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.060 
small it's actually quite heavy because
it's<00:00:42.270> got<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.390> built-in<00:00:42.780> if<00:00:43.079> P<00:00:43.530> V<00:00:43.680> transmitter

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
it's got a built-in if P V transmitter

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.340 
it's got a built-in if P V transmitter
has<00:00:44.129> got<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.399> crappy<00:00:45.149> little<00:00:45.329> sleeve<00:00:45.960> dipole

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
has got this crappy little sleeve dipole

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.209 
has got this crappy little sleeve dipole
here<00:00:46.469> which<00:00:46.620> she<00:00:46.710> probably<00:00:46.800> wouldn't<00:00:47.160> use

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
here which she probably wouldn't use

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.790 
here which she probably wouldn't use
much<00:00:47.610> but<00:00:47.820> they<00:00:48.000> also<00:00:48.149> threw<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.800> scoop

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
much but they also threw in a scoop

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.229 
much but they also threw in a scoop
planar<00:00:50.100> antenna<00:00:50.370> but<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.760> was<00:00:50.850> left<00:00:51.030> hand

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
planar antenna but it was left hand

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.840 
planar antenna but it was left hand
polarized<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.230> don't<00:00:52.710> know<00:00:52.800> why<00:00:52.980> but<00:00:53.610> it's

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
polarized so I don't know why but it's

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.400 
polarized so I don't know why but it's
got<00:00:53.969> an<00:00:54.059> SMA<00:00:54.390> connector<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:54.899> if<00:00:55.050> you've<00:00:55.170> got<00:00:55.379> a

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
got an SMA connector so if you've got a

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.459 
got an SMA connector so if you've got a
your<00:00:56.309> favorite<00:00:56.550> if<00:00:57.510> P<00:00:57.780> V<00:00:57.930> antenna<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.410> can

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
your favorite if P V antenna you can

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.170 
your favorite if P V antenna you can
just<00:00:58.710> whack<00:00:58.949> on<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.309> SMA<00:00:59.640> connector<00:01:00.030> there

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
just whack on to the SMA connector there

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.750 
just whack on to the SMA connector there
and<00:01:00.480> do<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.739> don't<00:01:02.010> know<00:01:02.219> what<00:01:02.340> parrot<00:01:02.670> is

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
and do that I don't know what parrot is

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.950 
and do that I don't know what parrot is
probably<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.210> couple<00:01:03.300> hundred<00:01:03.390> milli<00:01:03.690> watts<00:01:03.870> I

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
probably a couple hundred milli watts I

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.050 
probably a couple hundred milli watts I
would<00:01:04.110> think<00:01:04.350> maybe<00:01:04.470> less<00:01:04.739> I'm<00:01:04.890> not<00:01:05.039> sure<00:01:05.250> it's

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
would think maybe less I'm not sure it's

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.310 
would think maybe less I'm not sure it's
only<00:01:06.180> 720p<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:07.770> not<00:01:07.890> full<00:01:08.250> HD<00:01:08.630> but<00:01:09.630> it's

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
only 720p so it's not full HD but it's

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.109 
only 720p so it's not full HD but it's
got<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.590> little<00:01:11.340> lead<00:01:11.610> here<00:01:11.789> which<00:01:11.880> provides

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
got this little lead here which provides

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.449 
got this little lead here which provides
power<00:01:12.509> and<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.110> can<00:01:13.229> also<00:01:13.319> control<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.660 
on the side for changing from movie to
stills<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.289> in<00:01:25.410> some<00:01:25.560> respects<00:01:25.920> it's<00:01:26.039> quite

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
stills so in some respects it's quite

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.270

tick<00:01:30.380> horizon<00:01:31.380> HD<00:01:31.830> but<00:01:32.099> it's<00:01:32.220> not<00:01:32.340> full<00:01:32.520> HD<00:01:32.550> so

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
tick horizon HD but it's not full HD so

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.760

so<00:01:37.380> it's<00:01:37.500> not<00:01:37.649> cheap<00:01:37.979> it's<00:01:38.429> not<00:01:38.640> cheap<00:01:38.849> but<00:01:38.940> it

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
so it's not cheap it's not cheap but it

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.359 
so it's not cheap it's not cheap but it
does<00:01:39.270> slot<00:01:39.599> straight<00:01:39.869> into<00:01:40.080> that<00:01:40.200> GoPro<00:01:40.410> mount

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
does slot straight into that GoPro mount

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.320 
does slot straight into that GoPro mount
if<00:01:41.520> you're<00:01:41.610> going<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.819> be<00:01:41.880> using<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.209> on<00:01:42.300> a

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
if you're going to be using it on a

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.850 
if you're going to be using it on a
gimbal<00:01:42.599> or<00:01:42.780> something<00:01:43.020> for<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.200> multi<00:01:43.530> multi

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
rotor or a fixed-wing so well but of

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.479 
rotor or a fixed-wing so well but of
course<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.649> antenna<00:01:46.950> route<00:01:47.069> here's<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.310> bit<00:01:47.429> of

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:47.489 
course the antenna route here's a bit of

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:48.589 
course the antenna route here's a bit of
a<00:01:47.550> pain<00:01:47.759> if<00:01:47.970> you're<00:01:48.060> going<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.239> be<00:01:48.300> putting<00:01:48.450> it

00:01:48.589 --> 00:01:48.599 
a pain if you're going to be putting it

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:50.300 
a pain if you're going to be putting it
in<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.810> gimbal<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.319> it's<00:01:49.619> like<00:01:49.860> for<00:01:50.220> example

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
in a gimbal and it's like for example

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.240 
in a gimbal and it's like for example
inside<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.819> discovere<00:01:51.569> or<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:53.160> know

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
inside the discovere or the you know

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.710 
inside the discovere or the you know
these<00:01:53.399> was<00:01:53.550> the<00:01:53.670> hobbyking<00:01:54.030> discover<00:01:54.390> or<00:01:54.599> the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
these was the hobbyking discover or the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.260 
these was the hobbyking discover or the
RV<00:01:55.590> jet<00:01:55.860> this<00:01:56.310> antenna<00:01:56.670> would<00:01:56.910> get<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.239> way

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
RV jet this antenna would get in the way

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.669 
RV jet this antenna would get in the way
if<00:01:57.569> you've<00:01:57.690> got<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.899> on<00:01:57.989> the<00:01:58.080> gimbal<00:01:58.349> because

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
if you've got it on the gimbal because

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:00.499 
if you've got it on the gimbal because
it's<00:01:58.800> inside<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.160> nose<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.459> a<00:01:59.520> plane<00:01:59.729> so<00:01:59.910> yeah

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
it's inside the nose of a plane so yeah

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.330 
it's inside the nose of a plane so yeah
that's<00:02:00.720> a<00:02:00.780> bit<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:00.959> a<00:02:00.989> downer

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
that's a bit of a downer

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.710 
that's a bit of a downer
with<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.369> skew<00:02:02.670> planer<00:02:02.910> it's<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.209> lot<00:02:03.330> smaller

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
with a skew planer it's a lot smaller

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.600 
with a skew planer it's a lot smaller
but<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.200> know<00:02:04.619> I'd<00:02:04.709> be<00:02:04.800> nice<00:02:04.979> if<00:02:05.160> it<00:02:05.220> was<00:02:05.280> I

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
but you know I'd be nice if it was I

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.070 
but you know I'd be nice if it was I
don't<00:02:05.910> know<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.239> don't<00:02:06.360> know<00:02:06.450> what<00:02:06.599> you<00:02:06.720> do<00:02:06.869> I

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
don't know I don't know what you do I

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.690 
don't know I don't know what you do I
guess<00:02:07.470> that's<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.709> limitation<00:02:08.069> of<00:02:08.280> having<00:02:08.580> you

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
guess that's a limitation of having you

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.720 
guess that's a limitation of having you
transmitter<00:02:09.390> built<00:02:09.629> into<00:02:09.899> your<00:02:10.020> camera<00:02:10.319> but

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:10.730 
transmitter built into your camera but

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.220 
transmitter built into your camera but
I'm<00:02:11.730> still<00:02:12.000> hunting<00:02:12.300> for<00:02:12.599> some<00:02:12.720> instruction

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
I'm still hunting for some instruction

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.590 
I'm still hunting for some instruction
it<00:02:14.129> just<00:02:14.310> came<00:02:14.520> all<00:02:14.790> ready<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.150> go<00:02:15.270> so<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:15.450> have

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
it just came all ready to go so I have

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.940 
it just came all ready to go so I have
to<00:02:15.690> play<00:02:15.840> around<00:02:16.020> see<00:02:16.440> if<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.560> can<00:02:16.650> get<00:02:16.770> it<00:02:16.830> with

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
to play around see if I can get it with

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.770 
to play around see if I can get it with
me<00:02:17.070> show<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:17.610> it's<00:02:17.790> got<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:17.910> micro<00:02:18.210> SD<00:02:18.510> card

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
me show you it's got a micro SD card

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.870 
me show you it's got a micro SD card
slot<00:02:18.840> of<00:02:19.110> course<00:02:19.350> so<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:19.560> will<00:02:19.710> record<00:02:20.070> live

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
slot of course so it will record live

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.559 
slot of course so it will record live
video

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
video

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.750 
video
it<00:02:21.689> will<00:02:21.810> obviously<00:02:22.349> send<00:02:23.159> the<00:02:23.280> video<00:02:23.489> back<00:02:23.730> to

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
it will obviously send the video back to

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.099 
it will obviously send the video back to
your<00:02:23.969> goggles<00:02:24.120> through<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.569> five<00:02:24.930> point

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:25.109 
your goggles through the five point

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:26.929 
your goggles through the five point
eight<00:02:25.170> gig<00:02:25.709> video<00:02:26.159> link<00:02:26.370> so<00:02:26.459> I'm<00:02:26.519> gonna<00:02:26.609> try<00:02:26.879> it

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:26.939 
eight gig video link so I'm gonna try it

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:28.580 
eight gig video link so I'm gonna try it
obviously<00:02:27.659> it<00:02:27.749> works<00:02:27.900> in<00:02:28.109> conjunction<00:02:28.139> with

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
obviously it works in conjunction with

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.190 
obviously it works in conjunction with
the<00:02:28.709> Devo<00:02:29.340> seven<00:02:30.180> transmitted<00:02:31.019> with<00:02:31.109> the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
the Devo seven transmitted with the

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.619 
the Devo seven transmitted with the
little<00:02:31.409> LCD<00:02:31.859> screen<00:02:32.129> so<00:02:32.340> I'll<00:02:32.969> set<00:02:33.239> it<00:02:33.269> up<00:02:33.450> I'll

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
little LCD screen so I'll set it up I'll

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:34.849 
little LCD screen so I'll set it up I'll
try<00:02:33.870> it<00:02:33.930> out<00:02:34.049> we'll<00:02:34.200> see<00:02:34.230> how<00:02:34.499> it<00:02:34.590> goes

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
try it out we'll see how it goes

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:35.929 
try it out we'll see how it goes
looking<00:02:35.189> through<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.400> front<00:02:35.639> here<00:02:35.700> it's<00:02:35.819> got

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:35.939 
looking through the front here it's got

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.449 
looking through the front here it's got
an<00:02:36.030> awfully<00:02:36.540> small<00:02:36.659> aperture<00:02:37.170> for<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.799> camera

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
an awfully small aperture for the camera

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.789 
an awfully small aperture for the camera
so<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.389> may<00:02:39.599> be<00:02:39.659> that<00:02:39.870> it's<00:02:40.019> quite<00:02:40.230> wide<00:02:40.379> angle

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
so it may be that it's quite wide angle

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.709 
so it may be that it's quite wide angle
I<00:02:40.889> don't<00:02:41.189> know<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.730> guess<00:02:42.000> it<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.239> try<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:42.599> see

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:42.719 
I don't know I guess it to try and see

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:43.940 
I don't know I guess it to try and see
it's<00:02:42.959> got<00:02:43.079> a<00:02:43.109> microphone<00:02:43.379> as<00:02:43.680> well<00:02:43.709> by<00:02:43.920> the

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
it's got a microphone as well by the

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.679 
it's got a microphone as well by the
look<00:02:44.129> of<00:02:44.219> it<00:02:44.340> it's<00:02:44.849> an<00:02:44.939> unknown<00:02:45.150> quantity<00:02:45.389> but

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:45.689 
look of it it's an unknown quantity but

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:46.819 
look of it it's an unknown quantity but
I<00:02:45.750> thought<00:02:45.840> I'd<00:02:45.989> just<00:02:46.019> you<00:02:46.319> know<00:02:46.500> let<00:02:46.709> you<00:02:46.799> know

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
I thought I'd just you know let you know

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.080 
I thought I'd just you know let you know
probably<00:02:47.129> one<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.430> first<00:02:47.639> in<00:02:47.760> captivity

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
probably one of the first in captivity

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.909 
probably one of the first in captivity
and<00:02:48.450> I'll<00:02:48.810> be<00:02:48.870> throwing<00:02:49.139> it<00:02:49.230> on<00:02:49.319> the<00:02:49.409> beach<00:02:49.590> in

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:49.919 
and I'll be throwing it on the beach in

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:51.819 
and I'll be throwing it on the beach in
a<00:02:50.189> day<00:02:50.340> or<00:02:50.370> so<00:02:50.639> once<00:02:51.120> I've<00:02:51.239> finished<00:02:51.389> the

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
a day or so once I've finished the

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.440 
a day or so once I've finished the
modifications<00:02:52.829> updates<00:02:53.129> to<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.450> twenty

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
modifications updates to the twenty
