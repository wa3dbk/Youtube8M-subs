Tesla's<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.829> way<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.039> know<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.670> my<00:00:59.820> pack<00:01:00.210> is

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
Tesla's that way I know that my pack is

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.500 
Tesla's that way I know that my pack is
will<00:01:00.930> do<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.050> lot<00:01:01.379> more<00:01:01.410> work<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.980> way<00:01:02.510> so

looks like they're pretty close to
taking<00:01:05.549> out<00:01:05.790> those<00:01:05.970> Tesla's<00:01:06.510> looks<00:01:06.689> like

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
taking out those Tesla's looks like

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.770

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.289 
only good for like safe you have a bunch
of<00:01:29.759> weaker<00:01:30.119> units<00:01:30.570> with<00:01:30.810> less<00:01:31.020> health<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:32.299> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
of weaker units with less health so the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.940 
of weaker units with less health so the
Wizards<00:01:33.659> actually<00:01:33.990> did<00:01:34.140> manage<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.530> take<00:01:34.740> the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
Wizards actually did manage to take the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.770 
Wizards actually did manage to take the
one<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.729> wizard<00:01:36.030> towers<00:01:36.360> out<00:01:36.509> by

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
one of the wizard towers out by

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.600 
one of the wizard towers out by
themselves<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.040> dropped<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.400> raid

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
themselves and so I dropped that raid

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.160 
themselves and so I dropped that raid
spelling<00:01:39.000> them<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.299> hurry<00:01:39.479> up<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.750> speed<00:01:40.140> up

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
spelling them to hurry up and speed up

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.170 
spelling them to hurry up and speed up
through<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.590> battle<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:41.159> probably<00:01:41.759> didn't

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
through the battle I probably didn't

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.670 
through the battle I probably didn't
need<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.329> rage<00:01:42.659> spell<00:01:42.930> too<00:01:43.110> badly<00:01:43.350> but

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
need that rage spell too badly but

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.050

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
defence pretty well sent arise and you

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.280

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
had a pretty well leveled up so i didn't

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.109 
had a pretty well leveled up so i didn't
really<00:01:58.409> need<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.680> drop<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.000> probably<00:02:00.000> would

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
really need to drop that probably would

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.310 
really need to drop that probably would
have<00:02:00.180> done<00:02:00.299> too<00:02:00.479> much<00:02:00.630> good<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.110> actually

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
have done too much good and I actually

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.050 
have done too much good and I actually
do<00:02:01.619> manage<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:01.950> three<00:02:02.250> star<00:02:02.430> this<00:02:02.549> guy's<00:02:02.759> base

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
anyways so we've got the Town Hall left

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.270 
anyways so we've got the Town Hall left
and<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.140> looks<00:02:07.320> like<00:02:07.409> couple<00:02:07.799> buildings<00:02:08.009> he

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
and it looks like couple buildings he

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.010 
and it looks like couple buildings he
looks<00:02:08.489> like<00:02:08.610> he's<00:02:08.759> building<00:02:08.940> his<00:02:09.149> first<00:02:09.270> Expo

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020

looks like he's building his first Expo
there<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:10.950> definitely<00:02:11.459> took<00:02:11.730> full

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
there so I definitely took full

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.400 
there so I definitely took full
advantage<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.569> him<00:02:12.750> not<00:02:12.900> having<00:02:12.989> a

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
advantage of him not having a

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.680 
advantage of him not having a
