not the hardest hitting scout rifle and
the<00:00:35.309> range<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.640> pretty<00:00:35.910> average<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.750> has<00:00:36.780> a

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
the range is pretty average it has a

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.360 
the range is pretty average it has a
distinct<00:00:37.440> feel<00:00:37.649> that's<00:00:37.800> different<00:00:38.040> from<00:00:38.160> all

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
of the Scout rifles I've used so far and

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.959 
of the Scout rifles I've used so far and
it's<00:00:40.649> got<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> cool<00:00:41.040> compass<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.640> left<00:00:41.790> side

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
it's got a cool compass on the left side

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.729 
it's got a cool compass on the left side
the<00:00:42.420> stability<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:42.989> pretty<00:00:43.290> good<00:00:43.410> too

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
the stability is pretty good too

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.979 
the stability is pretty good too
at<00:00:43.829> first<00:00:44.160> sight<00:00:44.340> seems<00:00:44.760> pretty<00:00:45.030> average<00:00:45.660> well

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
at first sight seems pretty average well

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.479 
at first sight seems pretty average well

take a look at the perks the first

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.260 
take a look at the perks the first
column<00:00:49.200> adjust<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.649> typical<00:00:50.070> impact<00:00:50.670> ranges

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
column adjust the typical impact ranges

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.000 
column adjust the typical impact ranges
to<00:00:51.390> building<00:00:51.690> features<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.289> barrel<00:00:52.680> you

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
to building features of the barrel you

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.189 
to building features of the barrel you
cannot<00:00:53.340> adjust<00:00:53.550> let's<00:00:53.879> go<00:00:54.090> like<00:00:54.449> most<00:00:54.690> exotics

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
cannot adjust let's go like most exotics

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.110 
cannot adjust let's go like most exotics
so<00:00:55.710> if<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.980> don't<00:00:56.190> like<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.430> zoom<00:00:56.610> range<00:00:56.789> then

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
so if you don't like the zoom range then

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.069 
so if you don't like the zoom range then
you're<00:00:57.210> not<00:00:57.300> gonna<00:00:57.449> like<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.719> gun<00:00:57.899> right

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
big of a fan of this perk because if you

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.850 
big of a fan of this perk because if you
use<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.510> for<00:01:12.750> too<00:01:12.900> long<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.350> can<00:01:13.470> get<00:01:13.619> too<00:01:13.830> used

use it for too long you can get too used

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.410 
use it for too long you can get too used
