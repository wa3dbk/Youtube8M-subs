corner<00:03:41.110> so<00:03:41.770> this<00:03:42.010> is<00:03:42.190> not<00:03:42.370> good<00:03:42.670> for<00:03:42.700> black

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.850 

black<00:03:47.680> should<00:03:47.950> just<00:03:48.280> extend<00:03:49.030> here<00:03:49.710> this<00:03:50.710> is

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
black should just extend here this is

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.970 
black should just extend here this is
the<00:03:50.950> correct<00:03:51.190> thing<00:03:52.410> so<00:03:53.410> now<00:03:53.590> we<00:03:53.650> know<00:03:54.000> white

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
the correct thing so now we know white

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:02.670 
the correct thing so now we know white
extending<00:03:56.980> is<00:03:57.490> bad<00:03:58.530> what<00:03:59.530> white<00:03:59.800> should<00:04:00.190> do<00:04:01.680> is

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
extending is bad what white should do is

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.810 
extending is bad what white should do is
this<00:04:03.150> diagonal<00:04:04.150> move<00:04:06.990> now<00:04:07.990> if<00:04:08.380> black<00:04:08.820> protects

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
this diagonal move now if black protects

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.590 
this diagonal move now if black protects
the<00:04:09.970> corner<00:04:10.560> white<00:04:11.560> extends<00:04:12.040> black<00:04:12.600> jumps

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
the corner white extends black jumps

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:20.039 
the corner white extends black jumps
white<00:04:14.050> jumps<00:04:14.970> that<00:04:15.970> jumps<00:04:18.000> white<00:04:19.000> makes<00:04:19.780> back

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
white jumps that jumps white makes back

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.040 
white jumps that jumps white makes back
the<00:04:20.260> move<00:04:20.410> now<00:04:21.280> you<00:04:21.340> see<00:04:21.820> this<00:04:22.419> white<00:04:22.690> group

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
the move now you see this white group

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.430 
the move now you see this white group
and<00:04:23.770> this<00:04:24.070> black<00:04:24.370> group<00:04:24.669> will<00:04:25.150> Duke<00:04:25.390> it<00:04:25.540> out<00:04:25.720> so

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
and this black group will Duke it out so

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.640 
and this black group will Duke it out so
the<00:04:26.740> result<00:04:26.919> is<00:04:27.220> not<00:04:27.370> bad<00:04:27.640> for<00:04:27.880> white<00:04:31.230> now<00:04:32.230> at

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
the result is not bad for white now at

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.460 
the result is not bad for white now at
this<00:04:32.830> point<00:04:33.100> instead<00:04:33.760> of<00:04:34.110> protecting<00:04:35.110> in<00:04:35.350> the

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
this point instead of protecting in the

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.010 
this point instead of protecting in the
corner<00:04:36.750> if<00:04:37.750> black<00:04:38.230> cup<00:04:38.590> caps<00:04:39.100> here<00:04:40.020> what

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.970 

wife<00:04:45.550> can<00:04:45.820> play<00:04:46.030> this<00:04:48.360> if<00:04:49.360> black<00:04:49.720> cuts<00:04:50.020> white

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
wife can play this if black cuts white

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.370 
wife can play this if black cuts white

Ataris extends if black extends white
captures<00:05:02.470> this<00:05:02.920> so<00:05:03.490> white<00:05:04.420> group<00:05:04.720> is<00:05:05.280> alive

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
captures this so white group is alive

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.110 
captures this so white group is alive
easily<00:05:06.970> and<00:05:07.290> it<00:05:08.290> gets<00:05:08.470> the<00:05:08.800> corner<00:05:09.460> territory

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
easily and it gets the corner territory

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:19.500 
easily and it gets the corner territory
so<00:05:10.630> this<00:05:10.930> result<00:05:11.320> is<00:05:11.500> good<00:05:11.710> for<00:05:11.950> white

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:25.740 

now<00:05:20.020> also<00:05:21.360> white<00:05:22.360> can<00:05:22.660> first<00:05:23.050> play<00:05:23.290> this<00:05:24.750> black

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
now also white can first play this black

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:32.030 
now also white can first play this black

white<00:05:44.020> touches<00:05:44.680> these<00:05:45.520> two<00:05:45.760> black<00:05:45.970> stones<00:05:47.670> so

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:48.670 
white touches these two black stones so

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:57.390 
white touches these two black stones so
also<00:05:49.210> is<00:05:49.960> alive<00:05:50.350> now<00:05:55.740> when<00:05:56.740> black<00:05:56.980> one<00:05:57.190> white

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
also is alive now when black one white

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:04.680 
also is alive now when black one white
connects<00:05:58.030> black<00:06:01.170> captures<00:06:02.170> this<00:06:02.680> stone<00:06:03.690> white

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
connects black captures this stone white

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.820 
connects black captures this stone white
connects<00:06:05.260> any<00:06:05.710> skate<00:06:06.120> so<00:06:07.320> this<00:06:08.320> group<00:06:08.590> and

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
connects any skate so this group and

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:14.670 
connects any skate so this group and
this<00:06:09.010> group<00:06:09.070> will<00:06:09.820> fight<00:06:10.030> it<00:06:10.210> out

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:22.800 

so<00:06:15.220> that's<00:06:15.630> one<00:06:16.630> variation<00:06:21.150> so<00:06:22.150> the<00:06:22.330> last<00:06:22.540> one

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
so that's one variation so the last one

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.989 
so that's one variation so the last one
is

00:06:26.989 --> 00:06:26.999 

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:33.289 

what<00:06:27.599> if<00:06:28.339> black<00:06:29.339> diagonals<00:06:30.209> again<00:06:32.029> then<00:06:33.029> white

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:33.299 
what if black diagonals again then white

00:06:33.299 --> 00:06:40.119 
what if black diagonals again then white
cut<00:06:34.639> here<00:06:36.289> if<00:06:37.289> black<00:06:37.649> extends<00:06:38.099> white<00:06:39.110> jumps

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:40.129 
cut here if black extends white jumps

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:43.039 
cut here if black extends white jumps
because<00:06:41.129> of<00:06:41.549> this<00:06:41.729> stone<00:06:42.029> this<00:06:42.419> cut<00:06:42.719> is<00:06:42.839> really

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:43.049 
because of this stone this cut is really

00:06:43.049 --> 00:06:47.119 
because of this stone this cut is really
good<00:06:43.819> because<00:06:44.819> of<00:06:45.209> this<00:06:45.389> black<00:06:46.349> cannot<00:06:46.739> cut

00:06:47.119 --> 00:06:47.129 
good because of this black cannot cut

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:51.499 
good because of this black cannot cut
here<00:06:47.719> if<00:06:48.719> so<00:06:49.019> wide<00:06:49.259> arteries<00:06:50.029> then<00:06:51.029> captures

00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:51.509 
here if so wide arteries then captures

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:54.229 
here if so wide arteries then captures
these<00:06:52.409> two<00:06:52.649> black<00:06:52.829> stone<00:06:53.159> and<00:06:53.489> black<00:06:53.729> totally

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:54.239 
these two black stone and black totally

00:06:54.239 --> 00:07:03.379 
these two black stone and black totally
collapses<00:06:54.779> so<00:06:58.429> the<00:06:59.429> best<00:06:59.699> black<00:07:00.449> can<00:07:00.719> do<00:07:02.179> is<00:07:03.179> to

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:03.389 
collapses so the best black can do is to

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:08.839 
collapses so the best black can do is to
play<00:07:03.599> here<00:07:04.909> the<00:07:05.909> white<00:07:06.209> connects<00:07:06.809> again<00:07:07.849> this

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:08.849 
play here the white connects again this

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:11.379 
play here the white connects again this
group<00:07:09.209> and<00:07:09.479> this<00:07:09.869> group<00:07:09.929> will<00:07:10.679> fight<00:07:10.949> it<00:07:11.129> out

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:11.389 
group and this group will fight it out

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:15.069 
group and this group will fight it out
so<00:07:12.389> that's<00:07:12.569> how<00:07:12.899> to<00:07:12.929> escape<00:07:13.379> this<00:07:14.009> white<00:07:14.369> stone

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:15.079 
so that's how to escape this white stone

00:07:15.079 --> 00:07:22.849 
so that's how to escape this white stone
from<00:07:16.079> black<00:07:17.089> enclosure<00:07:19.009> that's<00:07:20.009> it<00:07:20.339> thanks
