00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
our story early story really needs and

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.510 
our story early story really needs and
each<00:02:24.320> of<00:02:24.470> these<00:02:24.560> characters<00:02:25.130> who<00:02:25.280> are<00:02:25.310> moving

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
each of these characters who are moving

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.030 
each of these characters who are moving
through<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.880> storyline<00:02:26.840> do<00:02:27.470> add<00:02:27.650> something

through the storyline do add something
and<00:02:28.310> I<00:02:28.370> think<00:02:28.550> that<00:02:28.760> man<00:02:29.000> beyond<00:02:29.390> is<00:02:29.660> kind<00:02:29.959> of

and I think that man beyond is kind of

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.020 
and I think that man beyond is kind of
has<00:02:30.200> that<00:02:30.230> magic<00:02:30.890> spark<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.400> it<00:02:31.489> that<00:02:31.730> readers

with<00:03:46.850> others<00:03:47.210> for<00:03:47.930> the<00:03:47.990> most<00:03:48.200> part<00:03:48.380> oh<00:03:48.920> yeah

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
with others for the most part oh yeah

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.930 
with others for the most part oh yeah
yeah<00:03:50.540> it's<00:03:50.990> come<00:03:51.140> along<00:03:51.350> it<00:03:52.010> took<00:03:52.250> us<00:03:52.580> a<00:03:52.760> while

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
yeah it's come along it took us a while

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.180 
yeah it's come along it took us a while
I<00:03:53.270> think<00:03:53.630> to<00:03:53.720> figure<00:03:54.020> each<00:03:54.319> other<00:03:54.590> out<00:03:54.740> and

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
I think to figure each other out and

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.000 
I think to figure each other out and
figure<00:03:55.700> out<00:03:56.590> you<00:03:57.590> know<00:03:57.620> it's<00:03:57.830> not<00:03:57.950> just

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
figure out you know it's not just

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.160 
figure out you know it's not just
figuring<00:03:58.550> each<00:03:58.730> other<00:03:59.000> out<00:03:59.150> in<00:03:59.600> the<00:03:59.690> context

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
figuring each other out in the context

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.830 
figuring each other out in the context
of<00:04:00.319> how<00:04:00.620> we<00:04:01.490> all<00:04:01.670> work<00:04:01.910> as<00:04:02.090> individuals<00:04:02.660> it's

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
of how we all work as individuals it's

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.720 
of how we all work as individuals it's
how<00:04:02.990> how<00:04:03.620> do<00:04:03.680> you<00:04:03.770> figure<00:04:04.040> it<00:04:04.220> out<00:04:04.310> when<00:04:04.520> you're

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
how how do you figure it out when you're

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.460 
how how do you figure it out when you're
on<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:04.970> run<00:04:05.420> trying<00:04:05.959> to<00:04:06.110> tell<00:04:06.290> a<00:04:06.320> story

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
on the run trying to tell a story

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.410 
on the run trying to tell a story
because<00:04:07.070> it's<00:04:07.250> not<00:04:07.370> like<00:04:07.580> you<00:04:07.700> get<00:04:07.850> a<00:04:07.880> year<00:04:08.240> to

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
because it's not like you get a year to

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.330 
because it's not like you get a year to
figure<00:04:08.600> it<00:04:08.780> out<00:04:08.870> and<00:04:09.170> then<00:04:09.230> start<00:04:09.980> writing

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
figure it out and then start writing

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.430 
figure it out and then start writing
we're<00:04:10.520> telling<00:04:10.970> the<00:04:11.090> story<00:04:11.360> and<00:04:11.690> trying<00:04:12.320> to

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
we're telling the story and trying to

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.930 
we're telling the story and trying to
learn<00:04:12.560> to<00:04:12.800> work<00:04:12.950> together<00:04:13.070> all<00:04:13.580> at<00:04:13.670> the<00:04:13.760> same

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
learn to work together all at the same

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.930 
learn to work together all at the same
time<00:04:14.000> and<00:04:14.600> I<00:04:15.380> think<00:04:15.470> we<00:04:15.709> hit<00:04:15.890> a<00:04:15.950> couple<00:04:16.760> of

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
time and I think we hit a couple of

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.580 
time and I think we hit a couple of
moments<00:04:17.120> where<00:04:17.480> we<00:04:17.510> could<00:04:17.780> all<00:04:17.870> say<00:04:18.019> okay<00:04:18.380> all

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
moments where we could all say okay all

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.319 
moments where we could all say okay all
of<00:04:18.680> a<00:04:18.739> sudden<00:04:19.040> this<00:04:19.310> is<00:04:19.370> it<00:04:19.669> it's<00:04:19.880> work<00:04:20.120> and

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
of a sudden this is it it's work and

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.520 
of a sudden this is it it's work and
we're<00:04:20.570> in<00:04:20.750> and<00:04:21.019> and<00:04:21.200> we<00:04:21.799> can<00:04:21.980> go<00:04:22.100> from<00:04:22.130> there<00:04:23.530> so

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
we're in and and we can go from there so

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.690 
we're in and and we can go from there so
this<00:04:25.460> is<00:04:25.580> going<00:04:25.700> to<00:04:25.790> be<00:04:25.850> a<00:04:25.880> weekly<00:04:26.210> series<00:04:26.450> uh

different<00:05:39.089> from<00:05:39.149> a<00:05:39.329> lot<00:05:39.360> of<00:05:39.569> a<00:05:40.019> lot<00:05:40.949> of<00:05:41.009> things

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:41.309 
different from a lot of a lot of things

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:43.639 
different from a lot of a lot of things
I<00:05:41.639> mean<00:05:42.419> reading<00:05:42.629> the<00:05:42.749> first<00:05:42.929> few<00:05:43.110> issues<00:05:43.319> I

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:43.649 
I mean reading the first few issues I

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:46.339 
I mean reading the first few issues I
was<00:05:43.799> really<00:05:44.399> struck<00:05:44.669> with<00:05:44.849> like<00:05:44.999> how<00:05:45.569> dark

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:46.349 
was really struck with like how dark

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:51.969 
was really struck with like how dark
this<00:05:46.559> stuff<00:05:46.860> mm-hmm<00:05:47.749> and<00:05:49.399> for<00:05:50.399> me<00:05:50.519> to<00:05:50.639> say<00:05:50.819> that

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
this stuff mm-hmm and for me to say that

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:55.159 
this stuff mm-hmm and for me to say that
it's<00:05:52.979> really<00:05:53.069> dark<00:05:53.519> well<00:05:54.360> partly<00:05:54.689> part<00:05:54.959> of<00:05:55.049> it

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.169 
it's really dark well partly part of it

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:56.959 
it's really dark well partly part of it
is<00:05:55.409> if<00:05:55.649> it's<00:05:55.979> the<00:05:56.129> world<00:05:56.309> five<00:05:56.549> years<00:05:56.789> from<00:05:56.879> now

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:56.969 
is if it's the world five years from now

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:58.159 
is if it's the world five years from now
one<00:05:57.209> of<00:05:57.239> the<00:05:57.360> first<00:05:57.539> things<00:05:57.599> we<00:05:57.869> have<00:05:57.989> to<00:05:58.110> ask

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 
one of the first things we have to ask

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:00.379 
one of the first things we have to ask
ourselves<00:05:58.349> is<00:05:58.800> how<00:05:58.829> is<00:05:59.129> the<00:05:59.249> world<00:05:59.399> change<00:05:59.819> and

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389 
ourselves is how is the world change and

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:02.149 
ourselves is how is the world change and
there<00:06:00.839> have<00:06:00.959> been<00:06:00.989> a<00:06:01.139> couple<00:06:01.229> of<00:06:01.469> major<00:06:01.769> events

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:02.159 
there have been a couple of major events

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:05.119 
there have been a couple of major events
in<00:06:02.729> the<00:06:02.939> dcu<00:06:03.360> time<00:06:03.659> line<00:06:03.959> between<00:06:04.709> what

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:05.129 
in the dcu time line between what

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:07.549 
in the dcu time line between what
readers<00:06:05.399> recognize<00:06:05.969> right<00:06:06.569> now<00:06:06.779> and<00:06:07.139> what<00:06:07.439> has

00:06:07.549 --> 00:06:07.559 
readers recognize right now and what has

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:08.899 
readers recognize right now and what has
happened<00:06:07.889> five<00:06:08.069> years<00:06:08.369> from<00:06:08.459> now<00:06:08.550> so<00:06:08.819> the

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:08.909 
happened five years from now so the

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:10.729 
happened five years from now so the
world<00:06:09.239> starts<00:06:09.659> out<00:06:09.779> in<00:06:09.929> a<00:06:10.019> darker<00:06:10.349> place<00:06:10.379> I

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:10.739 
world starts out in a darker place I

00:06:10.739 --> 00:06:13.999 
world starts out in a darker place I
mean<00:06:10.889> that<00:06:11.489> our<00:06:11.729> characters<00:06:12.329> are<00:06:12.719> in<00:06:13.289> a<00:06:13.559> much

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:14.009 
mean that our characters are in a much

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:17.179 
mean that our characters are in a much
different<00:06:14.429> world<00:06:15.239> than<00:06:16.019> the<00:06:16.199> dcu<00:06:16.709> we<00:06:16.979> know

00:06:17.179 --> 00:06:17.189 
different world than the dcu we know

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:21.100 
different world than the dcu we know
right<00:06:17.429> now<00:06:17.489> and<00:06:17.999> so<00:06:18.329> that<00:06:18.749> puts<00:06:19.199> them<00:06:19.409> in<00:06:19.939> a

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
right now and so that puts them in a

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.389 
right now and so that puts them in a
particular<00:06:22.110> point<00:06:22.409> of<00:06:22.499> mind<00:06:22.769> where<00:06:23.069> things

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:23.399 
particular point of mind where things

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:25.459 
particular point of mind where things
are<00:06:23.519> just<00:06:23.549> very<00:06:23.999> different<00:06:24.419> from<00:06:24.629> them<00:06:24.869> and<00:06:25.139> if

00:06:25.459 --> 00:06:25.469 
are just very different from them and if

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:27.199 
are just very different from them and if
it<00:06:25.679> if<00:06:25.949> you've<00:06:26.159> had<00:06:26.279> major<00:06:26.610> events<00:06:27.119> and

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:27.209 
it if you've had major events and

00:06:27.209 --> 00:06:28.639 
it if you've had major events and
they've<00:06:27.299> been<00:06:27.419> negative<00:06:27.839> yeah<00:06:28.289> it<00:06:28.349> tends<00:06:28.589> to

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:28.649 
they've been negative yeah it tends to

00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:30.799 
they've been negative yeah it tends to
be<00:06:28.829> a<00:06:28.860> little<00:06:28.979> dark<00:06:29.339> that<00:06:29.579> way<00:06:29.759> and<00:06:29.939> then<00:06:30.389> it's

00:06:30.799 --> 00:06:30.809 
be a little dark that way and then it's

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:32.149 
be a little dark that way and then it's
a<00:06:30.929> question<00:06:31.229> how<00:06:31.409> do<00:06:31.469> these<00:06:31.619> characters

00:06:32.149 --> 00:06:32.159 
a question how do these characters

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:34.399 
a question how do these characters
evolve<00:06:32.489> where<00:06:32.849> do<00:06:32.969> they<00:06:33.059> go<00:06:33.269> who<00:06:33.869> comes<00:06:34.169> out<00:06:34.349> of

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:34.409 
evolve where do they go who comes out of

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:37.339 
evolve where do they go who comes out of
it<00:06:34.619> who<00:06:35.309> doesn't<00:06:35.849> who<00:06:36.599> gets<00:06:36.809> buried<00:06:37.050> by<00:06:37.289> it

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:37.349 
it who doesn't who gets buried by it

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:40.399 
it who doesn't who gets buried by it
even<00:06:37.649> more<00:06:37.800> and<00:06:38.009> all<00:06:38.129> that<00:06:38.339> it's<00:06:39.269> put<00:06:39.479> me<00:06:39.539> in

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:40.409 
even more and all that it's put me in

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:42.889 
even more and all that it's put me in
place<00:06:40.889> where<00:06:41.219> I'm<00:06:41.879> the<00:06:42.149> one<00:06:42.269> who<00:06:42.449> has<00:06:42.479> to<00:06:42.599> say

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:42.899 
place where I'm the one who has to say

00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:45.820 
place where I'm the one who has to say
that<00:06:43.080> can<00:06:43.259> get<00:06:43.439> some<00:06:43.589> optimism<00:06:44.039> in<00:06:44.219> this<00:06:44.369> one

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830 
that can get some optimism in this one

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.049 
that can get some optimism in this one

00:07:18.709 --> 00:07:18.719 
different thing that I think it might

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:21.439 
different thing that I think it might
expect<00:07:19.199> going<00:07:19.439> in<00:07:19.769> and<00:07:20.069> you<00:07:20.789> will<00:07:20.939> see<00:07:21.119> a<00:07:21.149> lot

00:07:22.579 --> 00:07:22.589 
of characters I mean this is a dense

00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:24.919 
of characters I mean this is a dense
book<00:07:22.860> to<00:07:23.069> agree<00:07:23.459> we<00:07:23.669> have<00:07:23.819> a<00:07:23.849> big<00:07:24.179> big<00:07:24.389> cast<00:07:24.689> in
