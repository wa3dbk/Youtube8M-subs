touchwood<00:01:25.090> I<00:01:25.270> looked<00:01:25.689> at<00:01:25.810> these<00:01:25.960> paper<00:01:26.200> and<00:01:26.319> I

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
touchwood I looked at these paper and I

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.239 
touchwood I looked at these paper and I
saw<00:01:26.530> there<00:01:26.679> might<00:01:26.770> be<00:01:26.799> a<00:01:26.920> little<00:01:27.009> bit<00:01:27.159> of

saw there might be a little bit of
football<00:01:27.399> in<00:01:27.640> there<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:29.049> hopefully<00:01:29.109> we<00:01:29.409> get<00:01:29.530> a

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
football in there so hopefully we get a

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.260
