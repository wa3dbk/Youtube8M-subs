00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.550
 catamarca the company generates that the tapas for empanadas work is part 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.550
 efe for the regime 

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:19.340
 so that they transcend and wish to another broadcast more support art and culture in 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:20.310
 University 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.310
 my name is jimena colunga 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.019
 and this time we will talk about the very interesting seasonal exchange 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.449
 the teacher daniel escoto villa wolves of the autonomous university of zacatecas 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:38.739
 participated in the celebrations of the 25th anniversary of the music school of 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.239
 the unam a classical guitar recital and a series of master classes at 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.680
 Inside this school of diversity 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.680
 let's give the note 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.460
 the program I see 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.269
 more than anything he tried on this one 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:04.280
 In Berlin 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.710
 the levels that can be reached as a student like me 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.710
 oo 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.540
 and you can get to achieve 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.410
 already in a professional music grade quality musicity that 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.510
 power 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.510
 the study 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.460
 what I want is incredible to see 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.979
 what you can learn to achieve what you can find in others 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:36.930
 state 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.290
 each state has its wealth in this case the wealth of 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.920
 although this case is very big in terms of culture 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.940
 teacher daniel currently of the teacher is this 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.340
 since from incredible to work with the person 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.920
 of level 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.270
 of musical level of people level this 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.430
 falls every day they teach you something new for life and for music 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.789
 and those types of people are the ones that help you to grow more and more 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.849
 I wish you were here because 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.819
 the one in zacatecas where I work 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.769
 so very much therefore for us is working with the boys 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.769
 who are forming for future generations 

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:47.369
 it's very motivating not 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:57.989
 Well, I do not really have a special dynamic, but what I do is 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.379
 work as common as I work my classes usually do not 

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:05.059
 maybe 

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:06.779
 the only thing that has special to 

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:08.439
 the class in this case 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:10.369
 is that he tried 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:14.859
 to concentrate on you will find some situation that eln 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.619
 ueda benefits what I am telling you 

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:21.969
 some specific detail and I feel that saying it 

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:25.959
 his achilles heel, so to speak 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.749
 the trying to make him see 

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.289
 this of being consented so that 

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:33.289
 later the works 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.899
 the civil repertoire and modify it because I think it's very important 

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:45.049
 at 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.049
 in the sense that there is an auditorium 

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:51.729
 in that you do not know much about classical guitar 

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:55.649
 cede this process of formation of public 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:02.219
 not just good tarno san xerome program as we usually do 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.209
 that creates a barrier times between the public and the performer not 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.840
 if it is for example to spread parana 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.559
 in a master class oem 

00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:20.529
 I do not demand dicta 

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:23.319
 of choice has to issue nest 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:25.749
 how different teachers teach 

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:28.509
 or how they play in a concert 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:31.830
 all that is giving him parameters of the student to locate if to say 

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:34.650
 I want to do this I do not want to do it 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.620
 because in Mexico we have the big problem that they enter 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.469
 the seven music races 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:43.550
 many students who do not really know what they want to do if they really 

00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:45.139
 they want to dedicate venues 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.580
 party that have the possibility to try a little bit of that in real life 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.580
 then when they are sources and if they want to do it 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:59.229
 one of the most recognized concert musicians in our Mexico 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:03.810
 contemporary in the university saw parading colunga and 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.639
 we read in the next one according 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.339
 art and culture at the university
