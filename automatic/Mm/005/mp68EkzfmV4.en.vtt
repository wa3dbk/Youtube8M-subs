00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello for the members of the assault 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.750
 a guitar accompaniment can 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.750
 small white wine of roberto maroni 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.130
 we do not 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.130
 I 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.110
 he can 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.500
 for 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.350
 no 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:36.550
 ok so for the intro you're actually relying on 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.780
 tablature it will be easier if we 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:43.900
 play on the finger for the accompaniment itself 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.230
 thing then no difficulties 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:50.430
 particular it's a rhythm to 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:54.450
 three beats low on the first beat 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.450
 sharp on the other two times 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:05.229
 and maybe it's a little bit of precision 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.970
 concerning certain sequences 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.209
 of agreements that I did not have the place and of 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:14.470
 note then for example here when you in 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:17.530
 will be between the ground 900 9th pardon down 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.530
 would be and the new ground will end up 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:32.070
 like that with this fingering and did it's 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:32.070
 must evolve our forum here 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:45.250
 then the other maybe positioning 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:49.300
 a little tricky will come to the level of 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:54.550
 high-ranking mom where you have to ask a 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:56.650
 only seventh that way there and face 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.580
 this one can be soul 7th 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.670
 quantify and then be the seventh 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:07.239
 down this like this you add the little 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.549
 finger down it's an accessory if 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:13.060
 optional but it allows me to change 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:16.090
 there 6 6 passes and a low this body of 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.200
 five and add a little finger to this 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.350
 place there to make a variation 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.350
 melodic 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:27.430
 a terminal at the end with a small 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:29.700
 passing a stung finger will play as 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.700
 this 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:36.859
 on the tunes of the white wine then to the 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:40.480
 white wine what we will find 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:43.370
 our new blood would go chained to 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.819
 108.9 gift of life the positioning 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.819
 just now 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:04:01.549
 the last delicate movement will be between 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:04:04.760
 women 6th and then fa efa decreased 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:07.129
 so for the Fassis we will ask ourselves 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:12.280
 this way there first douala or on the 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:12.280
 base then I use fingers number 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:20.139
 3 and 2 for treble that gives us 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:20.139
 this 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.560
 and to do it I would have only 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.490
 add a little finger here on the 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:34.720
 fourth body of third box 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:38.710
 this is a movement like this for the 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.090
 fan first drama or then then 3rd the 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.260
 finger on the third rope in 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.540
 the occurrence and second time on the 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.590
 second rope here and then to make 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:49.330
 the lighthouse I add the little finger here 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.030
 the decreased release and not all fans 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.980
 to the lifts as his second must 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.070
 die first fingers for the barracks 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.840
 here here with that you should you 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.310
 unravel for interpretation is a 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.850
 a bit confusing because I did 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:06.280
 sight reading I put a lot of table 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.430
 for the arrangement so I wanted to go 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.780
 fast enough for recording 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.080
 but with sharing you end up 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.570
 no problem all that and with time 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.610
 and patience we can come to a 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.550
 interpretation a little more correct 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:24.430
 here you find the tablature always 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:28.270
 the same on the site that is indicated in 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.330
 below the video and I tell you to 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.330
 soon
