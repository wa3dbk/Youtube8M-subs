00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
course can be applied through this

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.150 
course can be applied through this
situation<00:01:56.770> it's<00:01:57.430> gas<00:01:57.790> and<00:01:58.350> has<00:01:59.350> a<00:01:59.380> fan<00:01:59.800> in<00:02:00.009> it

situation it's gas and has a fan in it

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.270 
situation it's gas and has a fan in it
so<00:02:00.670> that<00:02:01.300> obviously<00:02:02.050> heats<00:02:02.619> the<00:02:02.830> whole<00:02:02.979> place

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
so that obviously heats the whole place

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.980 
so that obviously heats the whole place
for<00:02:03.550> a<00:02:03.610> while<00:02:03.819> it's<00:02:04.090> really<00:02:04.330> cute<00:02:04.660> to<00:02:04.869> watch
