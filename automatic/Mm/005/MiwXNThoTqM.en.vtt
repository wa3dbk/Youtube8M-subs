first thing I notice about these trucks

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.350 
first thing I notice about these trucks
might<00:01:15.950> put<00:01:16.159> them<00:01:16.250> on<00:01:16.369> is<00:01:16.520> that<00:01:16.670> that<00:01:16.790> my<00:01:17.150> board

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
might put them on is that that my board

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.880 
might put them on is that that my board
felt<00:01:17.570> really<00:01:17.780> light<00:01:18.049> I<00:01:18.080> was<00:01:18.380> like<00:01:18.500> man<00:01:18.619> I<00:01:18.710> like
