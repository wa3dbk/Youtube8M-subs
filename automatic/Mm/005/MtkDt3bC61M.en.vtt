does make ATI video cards they just

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.630 
does make ATI video cards they just
started<00:00:28.199> doing<00:00:28.439> that<00:00:28.619> just<00:00:29.130> recently<00:00:29.340> like

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
started doing that just recently like

they didn't stop making an Nvidia video
cards<00:00:34.440> but<00:00:34.980> they<00:00:35.130> do<00:00:35.190> now<00:00:35.550> make<00:00:35.760> ATI<00:00:36.120> Radeon

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
cards but they do now make ATI Radeon

cards but they do now make ATI Radeon
video<00:00:36.690> cards<00:00:36.899> as<00:00:37.020> well<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.380> for<00:00:37.559> very<00:00:37.739> good

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
video cards as well and for very good

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.560 
video cards as well and for very good
reason<00:00:38.280> they're<00:00:38.399> doing<00:00:38.430> extremely<00:00:39.420> well

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
reason they're doing extremely well

reason they're doing extremely well
right<00:00:39.930> now<00:00:40.020> on<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.260> market<00:00:40.440> pretty<00:00:41.309> much

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
right now on the market pretty much

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.569 
right now on the market pretty much
they're<00:00:41.579> outperforming<00:00:42.210> some<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.579> Szalai

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
they're outperforming some of the Szalai

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.910 
they're outperforming some of the Szalai
cards<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.270> video<00:00:45.450> cards<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.649> know<00:00:46.739> at<00:00:46.829> the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
cards and in video cards you know at the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.619 
cards and in video cards you know at the
same<00:00:47.039> price<00:00:47.340> point<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.910> why<00:00:48.149> would<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.420> pay

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
same price point so why would you pay

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.529 
same price point so why would you pay
for<00:00:48.660> an<00:00:49.620> video<00:00:49.829> when<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.039> can<00:00:50.129> have<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.579> ti<00:00:50.940> so

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
for an video when you can have a ti so

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.529 
for an video when you can have a ti so
check<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.230> card<00:00:52.440> out<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.680> 4850<00:00:53.460> now<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.329> 40

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
check this card out the 4850 now the 40

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.049 
check this card out the 4850 now the 40
or<00:00:54.570> 50<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.320> between<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.680> 48<00:00:56.010> 30<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
or 50 is in between the 48 30 and the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.450 
or 50 is in between the 48 30 and the
4870<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:58.260> when<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.500> 40<00:00:58.680> 50<00:00:58.859> first<00:00:59.039> came<00:00:59.190> out<00:00:59.309> we

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
4870 so when the 40 50 first came out we

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.099 
4870 so when the 40 50 first came out we
were<00:00:59.489> kind<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.760> like<00:00:59.879> what<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.449> now<00:01:00.809> we<00:01:00.870> know

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
were kind of like what is it now we know

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.689 
were kind of like what is it now we know
exactly<00:01:01.260> what<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:01.859> let<00:01:02.340> me<00:01:02.399> go<00:01:02.550> over<00:01:02.609> the

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
exactly what it is let me go over the

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:03.830 
exactly what it is let me go over the
specs<00:01:02.879> with<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.390> give<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.690> general

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
specs with you to give you a general

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.690 
specs with you to give you a general
idea<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.439> hardware<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.100> inside<00:01:05.549> this

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
idea of the hardware that is inside this

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.859 
idea of the hardware that is inside this
card<00:01:05.970> because<00:01:06.150> it's<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.299> lot<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.479> good<00:01:06.630> stuff

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
card because it's a lot of good stuff

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.469 
card because it's a lot of good stuff
now<00:01:07.049> first<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.380> all<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.040> rv770<00:01:09.000> GPU

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
now first of all this is the rv770 GPU

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.969 
now first of all this is the rv770 GPU
that's<00:01:09.600> on<00:01:09.780> there<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.560> it's<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.710> same<00:01:10.890> one

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
that's on there so it's the same one

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.920 
that's on there so it's the same one
that's<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.280> 4870<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:12.180> very<00:01:12.450> fast<00:01:12.750> it's

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
that's in the 4870 it's very fast it's

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.020 
that's in the 4870 it's very fast it's
just<00:01:12.960> clocked<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.380> little<00:01:13.650> slower<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.880> let's

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
just clocked a little slower so let's

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.609 
just clocked a little slower so let's
talk<00:01:15.119> about<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.420> first<00:01:15.600> GPU<00:01:16.049> core<00:01:16.259> clock<00:01:16.409> on

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
talk about that first GPU core clock on

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.460 
talk about that first GPU core clock on
this<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.979> 625<00:01:17.909> megahertz<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:19.049> give<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.350> an

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
this is 625 megahertz to give you an

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.640 
this is 625 megahertz to give you an
idea<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:20.400> 4870<00:01:20.729> s<00:01:21.030> at<00:01:21.150> 750<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.020> 48<00:01:22.380> 30<00:01:22.530> s

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
idea the 4870 s at 750 and the 48 30 s

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.370 
idea the 4870 s at 750 and the 48 30 s
at<00:01:22.740> 575<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:23.759> you're<00:01:23.909> right<00:01:24.240> in<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.479> middle<00:01:24.689> 50

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
at 575 so you're right in the middle 50

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.499 
at 575 so you're right in the middle 50
50<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.770> 50<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.220> increases<00:01:26.580> by<00:01:26.700> 50<00:01:27.030> each<00:01:27.210> time

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
50 and 50 it increases by 50 each time

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.870 
50 and 50 it increases by 50 each time
you<00:01:27.930> have<00:01:27.990> some<00:01:28.170> 800<00:01:28.920> stream<00:01:29.340> processors

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
you have some 800 stream processors

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.969 
you have some 800 stream processors
which<00:01:30.090> are<00:01:30.210> also<00:01:30.390> clocked<00:01:30.750> at<00:01:30.930> 625<00:01:31.560> megahertz

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
which are also clocked at 625 megahertz

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.980 
which are also clocked at 625 megahertz

this one video card now as far as
interface<00:03:51.189> goes<00:03:51.459> you<00:03:51.939> guessed<00:03:52.180> a<00:03:52.299> PCI<00:03:52.629> Express

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
interface goes you guessed a PCI Express

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.580 
interface goes you guessed a PCI Express
2.0<00:03:53.799> x16<00:03:54.430> length<00:03:55.389> and<00:03:55.689> electrically<00:03:56.229> running

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.409 
2.0 x16 length and electrically running
so<00:03:56.829> make<00:03:57.519> sure<00:03:57.549> you<00:03:57.699> have<00:03:57.819> the<00:03:57.879> right<00:03:58.030> slot<00:03:58.299> if

so make sure you have the right slot if

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:00.149 
so make sure you have the right slot if
you<00:03:58.449> don't<00:03:58.659> have<00:03:58.750> PCI<00:03:58.989> Express<00:03:59.199> 2.0<00:03:59.829> it<00:04:00.009> will

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:00.159 
you don't have PCI Express 2.0 it will

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:02.099 
you don't have PCI Express 2.0 it will
run<00:04:00.310> in<00:04:00.430> PCI<00:04:00.669> Express<00:04:00.970> as<00:04:01.180> long<00:04:01.329> as<00:04:01.419> it's<00:04:01.540> x16

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
run in PCI Express as long as it's x16

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:04.379 
run in PCI Express as long as it's x16
and<00:04:02.319> you<00:04:02.949> won't<00:04:03.189> lose<00:04:03.370> any<00:04:03.519> performance<00:04:04.030> you

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:04.389 
and you won't lose any performance you

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:06.929 
and you won't lose any performance you
got<00:04:04.509> a<00:04:04.540> dual<00:04:04.780> link<00:04:04.989> DVI<00:04:05.859> on<00:04:06.280> here<00:04:06.430> also<00:04:06.579> you<00:04:06.759> can

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:06.939 
got a dual link DVI on here also you can

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:08.129 
got a dual link DVI on here also you can
do<00:04:07.090> crossfire<00:04:07.659> which<00:04:07.840> is<00:04:07.930> also<00:04:08.049> very

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
do crossfire which is also very

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:09.960 
do crossfire which is also very
important<00:04:08.680> so<00:04:09.370> if<00:04:09.489> you<00:04:09.579> want<00:04:09.699> to<00:04:09.759> run<00:04:09.879> these

important so if you want to run these

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.939 
important so if you want to run these
with<00:04:10.120> any<00:04:10.299> other<00:04:10.479> 4800<00:04:11.049> series<00:04:11.079> cards<00:04:11.470> you<00:04:11.650> can
