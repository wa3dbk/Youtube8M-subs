00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
importance of percent damage over sheet

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.459 
importance of percent damage over sheet
DPS<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:11.820> lot<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.300> people<00:00:12.420> think<00:00:12.929> that<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.170> sheet

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
DPS a lot of people think that a sheet

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.440 
DPS a lot of people think that a sheet
dps<00:00:13.860> is<00:00:14.099> most<00:00:14.309> important<00:00:14.759> probably<00:00:15.150> right<00:00:15.330> now

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
dps is most important probably right now

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.760 
dps is most important probably right now
and<00:00:15.690> that's<00:00:15.839> not<00:00:16.109> initially<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.590> truth

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
and that's not initially the truth

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.529 
and that's not initially the truth
especially<00:00:17.070> with<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.490> changes<00:00:17.850> coming<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.300> lot

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
especially with the changes coming a lot

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.880 
especially with the changes coming a lot
of<00:00:18.570> percent<00:00:18.960> damage<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.320> going<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.500> make<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.650> big

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
of percent damage is going to make a big

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.650 
of percent damage is going to make a big
difference<00:00:20.100> in<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.430> game<00:00:20.580> I'm<00:00:21.390> going<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.600> be

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660
