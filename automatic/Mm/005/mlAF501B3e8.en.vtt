creases so but fold your paper in half
diagonally<00:01:04.019> both<00:01:04.530> ways<00:01:13.729> then<00:01:14.729> once<00:01:15.060> you've

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
diagonally both ways then once you've

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.930 
diagonally both ways then once you've
gotten<00:01:15.420> all<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.659> those<00:01:15.979> folds<00:01:16.979> your<00:01:17.220> points

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
gotten all of those folds your points

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:39.730 
gotten all of those folds your points
into<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.570> center<00:01:19.170> here<00:01:21.680> for<00:01:22.680> all<00:01:22.830> four<00:01:23.100> sides

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.200 

so<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.799> got<00:01:41.039> all<00:01:41.159> four<00:01:41.399> of<00:01:41.429> those<00:01:41.579> sides<00:01:41.909> fold

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
so you got all four of those sides fold

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.319 
so you got all four of those sides fold
it<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.479> flip<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.229> over<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.710> now<00:01:43.799> fold<00:01:44.399> from<00:01:44.969> the

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
it in flip it over and now fold from the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.469 
it in flip it over and now fold from the
outer<00:01:45.689> sides<00:01:46.289> to<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.890> center<00:01:47.069> again<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:48.149> is

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
outer sides to the center again this is

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.999 
outer sides to the center again this is
a<00:01:48.509> little<00:01:48.840> hard<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.170> see<00:01:49.350> cuz<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.829> white

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
a little hard to see cuz of the white

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.889 
a little hard to see cuz of the white
but<00:01:50.459> you<00:01:50.490> are<00:01:50.610> just<00:01:50.969> folding<00:01:51.360> towards<00:01:51.750> the

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
but you are just folding towards the

00:01:51.899 --> 00:02:03.139 
but you are just folding towards the
center<00:01:55.100> all<00:01:56.100> four<00:01:56.549> sides<00:02:01.759> there<00:02:02.759> we<00:02:02.880> want<00:02:03.060> to

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
center all four sides there we want to

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.680 
center all four sides there we want to
open<00:02:03.450> everything<00:02:03.659> up<00:02:08.209> so<00:02:09.209> we've<00:02:09.329> got<00:02:09.539> all

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
open everything up so we've got all

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.020 
open everything up so we've got all
these<00:02:09.929> creases<00:02:10.259> here<00:02:10.470> now<00:02:11.250> we've<00:02:11.400> got<00:02:11.579> it<00:02:11.700> open

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
these creases here now we've got it open

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.339 
these creases here now we've got it open
I'm<00:02:12.239> just<00:02:12.450> gonna<00:02:12.569> take<00:02:12.720> one<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.959> these<00:02:13.079> sides

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
I'm just gonna take one of these sides

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.350 
I'm just gonna take one of these sides
and<00:02:13.650> fold<00:02:13.769> it<00:02:13.950> down<00:02:14.190> for<00:02:14.459> a<00:02:14.519> second<00:02:14.910> we're

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
and fold it down for a second we're

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.059 
and fold it down for a second we're
gonna<00:02:15.480> flip<00:02:15.720> everything<00:02:16.019> over<00:02:16.349> take<00:02:17.040> the

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
gonna flip everything over take the

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.339 
gonna flip everything over take the
sides<00:02:17.579> and<00:02:17.910> fold<00:02:18.360> in<00:02:18.630> on<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.930> creases<00:02:19.319> that

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
sides and fold in on the creases that

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.360 
sides and fold in on the creases that
are<00:02:19.560> already<00:02:19.799> there<00:02:20.010> just<00:02:20.250> at<00:02:20.849> the<00:02:21.030> top<00:02:21.239> here

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
are already there just at the top here

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.979 
are already there just at the top here
and<00:02:23.370> then<00:02:23.519> I'm<00:02:23.610> going<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.880> take<00:02:24.239> what<00:02:24.630> I've<00:02:24.750> got

left here I could kind of push in and
bring<00:02:27.390> this<00:02:27.540> little<00:02:27.810> flap<00:02:28.019> together<00:02:28.440> I<00:02:28.739> want

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
bring this little flap together I want

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.940 
bring this little flap together I want
this<00:02:29.430> one<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.970> just<00:02:30.540> go<00:02:30.750> straight<00:02:30.810> out<00:02:31.349> lay<00:02:31.890> it

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
this one to just go straight out lay it

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.940 
this one to just go straight out lay it
flat<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:32.519> that<00:02:32.549> it<00:02:32.730> goes<00:02:32.849> straight<00:02:33.329> out<00:02:33.390> from

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
flat so that it goes straight out from

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.069 
flat so that it goes straight out from
this<00:02:34.950> white<00:02:35.220> area<00:02:35.940> here<00:02:36.030> on<00:02:36.389> the<00:02:36.480> side<00:02:36.720> and

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.410 
this white area here on the side and
then<00:02:37.829> these<00:02:38.069> bottom<00:02:38.579> pieces<00:02:38.609> I'm<00:02:39.209> going<00:02:39.359> to

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
then these bottom pieces I'm going to

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.780 
then these bottom pieces I'm going to
push<00:02:39.660> up<00:02:39.930> too<00:02:40.350> so<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:40.799> we<00:02:40.889> can<00:02:41.100> get<00:02:41.220> these<00:02:41.400> two

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
push up too so that we can get these two

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.509 
push up too so that we can get these two
little<00:02:42.090> sections<00:02:42.269> here<00:02:42.900> as<00:02:42.989> well<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.620> both<00:02:44.489> of

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
little sections here as well and both of

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.789 
little sections here as well and both of
these<00:02:44.940> I<00:02:45.359> want<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:46.109> have<00:02:46.319> go<00:02:46.680> straight<00:02:47.670> down

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
these I want to have go straight down

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.229 
these I want to have go straight down
kind<00:02:49.799> of<00:02:49.859> get<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.160> flow<00:02:50.459> going<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.090> get

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
kind of get the flow going and get

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.140 
kind of get the flow going and get
everything<00:02:51.510> crease<00:02:51.959> off<00:02:52.230> good<00:02:52.530> there<00:02:53.090> so<00:02:54.090> you

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
everything crease off good there so you

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.670 
everything crease off good there so you
should<00:02:54.299> have<00:02:54.329> a<00:02:54.480> flap<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.019> right<00:02:55.139> and<00:02:55.500> then

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
should have a flap to the right and then

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.229 
should have a flap to the right and then
the<00:02:55.799> two<00:02:55.980> pacing<00:02:56.489> down<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:57.000> then<00:02:57.090> we're<00:02:57.209> just

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
the two pacing down and then we're just

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.090 
the two pacing down and then we're just
going<00:02:57.510> to<00:02:57.569> fold<00:02:57.750> in<00:02:57.900> half<00:02:58.109> right<00:02:58.380> there<00:02:58.650> along

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
going to fold in half right there along

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.120 
going to fold in half right there along
where<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.700> diagonal<00:03:00.299> is<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.840> as<00:03:01.500> I<00:03:01.530> do<00:03:01.709> that

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
where the diagonal is and as I do that

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.099 
where the diagonal is and as I do that
I'm<00:03:02.250> gonna<00:03:02.400> let<00:03:02.579> this<00:03:02.819> flap<00:03:03.209> actually<00:03:03.750> come<00:03:04.079> up

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
I'm gonna let this flap actually come up

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.309 
I'm gonna let this flap actually come up
and<00:03:04.849> fold<00:03:05.849> down<00:03:05.970> so<00:03:06.599> now<00:03:06.720> you<00:03:06.780> can<00:03:07.019> see<00:03:07.200> I've

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
and fold down so now you can see I've

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.309 
and fold down so now you can see I've
got<00:03:07.500> two<00:03:08.099> kind<00:03:08.549> of<00:03:08.639> little<00:03:08.940> legs<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.200> back

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
got two kind of little legs and the back

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.250 
got two kind of little legs and the back
part<00:03:10.590> here<00:03:11.299> then<00:03:12.299> the<00:03:12.420> last<00:03:12.660> little<00:03:12.900> bit<00:03:13.079> is

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
part here then the last little bit is

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.780 
part here then the last little bit is
I'm<00:03:13.380> going<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.530> open<00:03:13.709> up<00:03:14.040> kind<00:03:14.310> of<00:03:14.430> here<00:03:14.669> and
