00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.900
using road shop products only which you guys all love.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:18.420
It will make soft and girlish makeup look, so it will be perfect for daily or date makeup.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.960
The lens it O-lens Anna Sui brown that I once shown you when I did special video of lens.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.520
To make smooth skin, I’m going to apply base first.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.160
Apply a foundation that stays well on face thinly to make good and simple base makeup.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.480
For brows, I chose eyebrow tint to to draw the outline of the straight brows.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.560
Use light brown shadow without pearl to fill the inner part and I’m going to use the remaining to give shading on the nose.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.720
I used peach color shadow as base to apply it on the whole eyes.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.520
Because I’ll put pearl shadow, it’s better to use shadow with pearl for base.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.520
Put glamorous gold pearl shadow on the whole eyes and blend it with a blending brush.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.480
Use the shadow that was used to fill the brows on the 2/3 part of the outer underline.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.680
To fill the waterline easily, I’m going to curl the lashes first.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.720
After filling between the roots, draw very thin line right above the roots.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:15.200
By drawing the line to the inner part, I made the eyes look wider.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:23.840
Make drooping eye shape and blend it with a cotton but to make it natural.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.520
Apply mascara fixer with fiber to make the lashes look longer and to fix the curl.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:45.400
Put lighter rose brown color shadow or eyeliner on the middle of the under to make the eyes look clearer.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.640
If the fixer it well dried, brush the lashes finely with a mascara.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.520
Because I made the curling with a fixer, I’m going to use volume mascara to volumize it.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.720
Don’t make the shading too much but just do it lightly following the outer line of the jaw.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:29.520
Apply peach color cream blusher evenly and put peach color shadow onto the blusher to fix the color.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:41.240
Apply orange color lipstick on the inner part and blend it to the lip line with a cotton bud.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.480
Apply orange color tint that lasts long to finish the daily date makeup!

00:03:53.320 --> 00:04:01.720
I used orange lip color, but if you don’t look good with the color, change it with a color that fits you to finish the makeup.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.760
Now, we are done with soft and useful daily date makeup!

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.480
Try once!

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.420
