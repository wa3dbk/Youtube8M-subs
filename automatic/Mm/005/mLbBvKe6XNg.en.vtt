to become involved in mobile directional

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.560 
to become involved in mobile directional
movements<00:00:43.879> you<00:00:44.879> know<00:00:44.970> it's<00:00:45.180> not<00:00:45.270> just<00:00:45.330> a

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
movements you know it's not just a

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.970 
movements you know it's not just a
static<00:00:45.989> hold<00:00:46.020> stretch<00:00:46.559> but<00:00:46.800> there's<00:00:46.920> a

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
static hold stretch but there's a

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.790 
static hold stretch but there's a
dynamic<00:00:47.400> movement<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:47.820> comes<00:00:47.970> with<00:00:48.239> that

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
dynamic movement that comes with that

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.520 
dynamic movement that comes with that
out<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:50.040> the<00:00:50.129> sides<00:00:50.370> where's<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:51.530> squat

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
out to the sides where's that squat

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.570 
out to the sides where's that squat
threw<00:00:52.769> that<00:00:53.870> forward<00:00:54.870> lunge<00:00:55.110> yes<00:00:56.010> Ricky<00:00:56.489> the

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
threw that forward lunge yes Ricky the

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.840 
threw that forward lunge yes Ricky the
chest<00:00:56.820> high<00:00:57.030> dip<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.839> in<00:00:57.989> drive<00:00:58.650> it<00:00:58.830> back<00:00:59.010> so

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
chest high dip it in drive it back so

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.399 
chest high dip it in drive it back so
it's<00:01:00.210> moving<00:01:00.479> through<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.930> range<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.320> a

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:01.409 
it's moving through the range and a

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:02.899 
it's moving through the range and a
controlled<00:01:01.830> movement<00:01:02.309> through<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.519> range<00:01:02.760> I

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
controlled movement through the range I

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:04.579 
controlled movement through the range I
think<00:01:03.089> that's<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.420> idea<00:01:03.750> really<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.470> know

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
think that's the idea really of you know

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.770 
think that's the idea really of you know
preparing<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.339> getting<00:01:05.370> the<00:01:05.580> body<00:01:05.729> ready

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.050 

we<00:01:09.780> like<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:09.960> integrate<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.620> spark<00:01:11.370> work<00:01:11.640> into

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
we like to integrate the spark work into

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.380 
we like to integrate the spark work into
every<00:01:12.420> single<00:01:12.720> session<00:01:12.870> the<00:01:13.799> key<00:01:14.010> criteria

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
every single session the key criteria

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.430 
every single session the key criteria
differentiates<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.479> top<00:01:15.659> players<00:01:15.930> from<00:01:16.080> the

differentiates the top players from the
amateurs<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.190> quickness<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.790> feet<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.360> you're

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
amateurs is quickness of feet so you're

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.880 
amateurs is quickness of feet so you're
loading<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.900> up<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.440> then<00:01:19.619> it's<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.799> little

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
loading it up and then it's a little

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.030 
loading it up and then it's a little
acceleration<00:01:20.640> through<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.000> red<00:01:21.770> nice<00:01:22.770> quick

last exercise side on it's the quickness

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.999 
last exercise side on it's the quickness
of<00:01:47.969> that<00:01:48.149> reaction<00:01:48.719> that's<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.320> key<00:01:49.500> factor

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009

well<00:01:58.740> preseason<00:01:59.189> really<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.909> gives<00:02:00.179> you

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
well preseason really is it gives you

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.959 
well preseason really is it gives you
the<00:02:00.390> base<00:02:01.130> what<00:02:02.130> we<00:02:02.310> see<00:02:02.490> do<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.700> dynamic

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
the base what we see do a dynamic

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.029 
the base what we see do a dynamic
flexibility<00:02:03.960> warm-up<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:04.530> it's<00:02:04.679> a<00:02:04.740> question

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
flexibility warm-up so it's a question

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.039 
flexibility warm-up so it's a question
of<00:02:05.159> just<00:02:05.460> getting<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.880> neuromuscular<00:02:06.780> system

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
of just getting the neuromuscular system

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.749 
of just getting the neuromuscular system
fired<00:02:07.469> up<00:02:07.649> then<00:02:08.100> they'll<00:02:08.250> be<00:02:08.310> involved<00:02:08.429> with

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
fired up then they'll be involved with

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.950 
fired up then they'll be involved with
footwork<00:02:09.149> then<00:02:09.390> we're<00:02:09.509> gonna<00:02:09.600> bring<00:02:09.810> these

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
footwork then we're gonna bring these

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.080 
footwork then we're gonna bring these
into<00:02:10.500> play<00:02:10.679> very<00:02:10.710> quickly<00:02:11.190> get<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.610> feel<00:02:11.910> for

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
into play very quickly get a feel for

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.790 
into play very quickly get a feel for
that<00:02:12.180> ball<00:02:12.450> they've<00:02:12.750> got<00:02:12.990> to<00:02:13.080> feel<00:02:13.230> confident

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
that ball they've got to feel confident

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.500 
that ball they've got to feel confident
with<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.100> ball<00:02:14.310> are<00:02:14.670> we<00:02:14.819> gonna<00:02:14.940> solve<00:02:15.180> chars

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
with the ball are we gonna solve chars

you're looking at em patterns dad now
you<00:04:41.840> look<00:04:42.110> for<00:04:42.289> the<00:04:42.349> patterns<00:04:43.870> well<00:04:44.870> done

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.530 

I<00:04:49.440> think<00:04:50.400> if<00:04:50.520> you<00:04:50.610> watch<00:04:50.790> carefully<00:04:51.090> you<00:04:51.420> see

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
I think if you watch carefully you see

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.990 
I think if you watch carefully you see
the<00:04:51.870> ID<00:04:52.020> to<00:04:52.350> detail<00:04:52.800> the<00:04:53.340> accuracy<00:04:53.790> of<00:04:53.820> the

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
the ID to detail the accuracy of the

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.300 
the ID to detail the accuracy of the
pass<00:04:54.210> is<00:04:54.510> the<00:04:54.570> weight<00:04:55.020> of<00:04:55.050> the<00:04:55.350> pass<00:04:55.560> and<00:04:56.190> the

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
pass is the weight of the pass and the

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.950 
pass is the weight of the pass and the

top player stand out from average

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.830 
top player stand out from average

yourself<00:05:01.290> out<00:05:01.470> of<00:05:01.650> trouble

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.030 

good<00:05:08.400> football<00:05:10.250> matches<00:05:11.250> are<00:05:11.610> a<00:05:11.640> combination

good football matches are a combination

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.000 
good football matches are a combination
you<00:05:14.660> do<00:05:15.660> nothing<00:05:16.020> for<00:05:16.170> 60<00:05:16.470> minutes<00:05:16.590> then<00:05:16.920> you

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
you do nothing for 60 minutes then you

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.750 
you do nothing for 60 minutes then you
called<00:05:17.280> upon<00:05:17.450> rookie<00:05:18.450> David<00:05:18.630> out<00:05:19.020> you<00:05:19.170> go

called upon rookie David out you go

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.350 
called upon rookie David out you go

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
so you got out of the mental

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.750 
so you got out of the mental
concentration<00:05:21.930> the<00:05:22.710> physical<00:05:23.130> capability

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
concentration the physical capability

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.980 
concentration the physical capability
and<00:05:23.940> then<00:05:24.030> they're<00:05:24.150> gonna<00:05:24.240> have<00:05:24.300> quickness<00:05:24.600> I

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
and then they're gonna have quickness I

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.900 
and then they're gonna have quickness I
always<00:05:25.650> look<00:05:25.800> for<00:05:25.890> intensity<00:05:26.340> in<00:05:26.520> quality

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910
