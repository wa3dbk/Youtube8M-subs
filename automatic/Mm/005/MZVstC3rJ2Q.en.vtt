didn't seem so happy with it um I like

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.630 
didn't seem so happy with it um I like
the<00:01:17.340> base<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:18.030> base<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.619> you<00:01:19.619> know<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
the base the base is you know the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.800 
the base the base is you know the
bedding<00:01:20.970> which<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.990> nice<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:23.210> kind<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.270> like<00:01:24.540> the

thing<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.530> will<00:01:25.710> on<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.430> on<00:01:26.549> top

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
thing of the will on this is on top

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.359 
thing of the will on this is on top
better<00:01:27.570> than<00:01:27.930> when<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.259> wheels<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:29.159> cage

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
better than when the wheels and the cage

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.819 
better than when the wheels and the cage
because<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.750> know<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.170> will<00:01:31.320> takes<00:01:31.560> up<00:01:31.740> a

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829

this blue one but I changed them out

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:58.819 
this blue one but I changed them out
because<00:02:57.389> I<00:02:57.750> just<00:02:57.780> kind<00:02:58.139> of<00:02:58.169> wanted<00:02:58.379> to<00:02:58.469> mix<00:02:58.650> the

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
because I just kind of wanted to mix the

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.580 
because I just kind of wanted to mix the
colors<00:02:59.129> up<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.370> little<00:02:59.549> bit<00:02:59.730> but<00:02:59.939> it's<00:03:00.120> um<00:03:00.590> you

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
can't really see it on the camera but

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.080 
can't really see it on the camera but
they're<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.689> bases<00:03:04.620> are<00:03:04.769> you<00:03:05.010> know<00:03:05.159> stuff

sparkles<00:03:06.689> in<00:03:06.870> them<00:03:07.049> so<00:03:07.590> it's<00:03:07.709> kind<00:03:07.859> of<00:03:07.919> a

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
sparkles in them so it's kind of a

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.280 
sparkles in them so it's kind of a
really<00:03:08.310> girly<00:03:08.549> cage<00:03:08.969> which<00:03:09.359> a<00:03:09.510> lot<00:03:09.810> of<00:03:09.840> cages

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
really girly cage which a lot of cages

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.369 
really girly cage which a lot of cages
are<00:03:10.709> more<00:03:11.180> primary<00:03:12.180> colors<00:03:12.569> like<00:03:12.780> this<00:03:13.139> one

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
are more primary colors like this one

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.679 
are more primary colors like this one
which<00:03:14.069> are<00:03:14.219> kind<00:03:14.430> of<00:03:14.489> more<00:03:14.669> boyish<00:03:15.120> I<00:03:15.329> think

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:15.689 
which are kind of more boyish I think

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:19.610
