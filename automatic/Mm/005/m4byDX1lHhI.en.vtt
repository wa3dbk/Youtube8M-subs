hey guys so this is normal here for

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.780 
hey guys so this is normal here for
technique<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.740> today<00:00:11.250> we<00:00:11.370> will<00:00:11.460> check<00:00:11.490> out

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
technique and today we will check out

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.330 
technique and today we will check out
the<00:00:11.969> gaming<00:00:12.240> performance<00:00:12.480> of<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.380> Lumia<00:00:13.679> 530

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
the gaming performance of the Lumia 530

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.000 
the gaming performance of the Lumia 530
so<00:00:14.849> this<00:00:15.059> is<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.330> budget<00:00:15.619> smartphone<00:00:16.619> from

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
so this is the budget smartphone from

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.220 
so this is the budget smartphone from
Microsoft<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:17.910> it's<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.690> cheapest

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
Microsoft and it's this is the cheapest

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
and it has a fight tool MV ramps so

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.069 
and it has a fight tool MV ramps so
similar<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.750> 520<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.530> 6:30<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:36.030> 530<00:00:36.690> also

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
similar to the 520 and 6:30 the 530 also

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.200 
similar to the 520 and 6:30 the 530 also
comes<00:00:37.530> with<00:00:37.680> only<00:00:37.950> fighter<00:00:38.250> mb<00:00:38.700> ram<00:00:38.850> which<00:00:39.120> is

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
comes with only fighter mb ram which is

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.000 
comes with only fighter mb ram which is
kind<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.510> disappointing<00:00:39.719> because<00:00:40.559> most<00:00:40.829> of

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
kind of disappointing because most of

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.350 
kind of disappointing because most of
the<00:00:41.129> smart<00:00:41.340> phones<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.059> price<00:00:42.329> point

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
the smart phones in this price point

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.220 
the smart phones in this price point
have<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.590> 1gb<00:00:44.160> ram<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:45.059> but<00:00:45.360> then<00:00:45.570> that's<00:00:45.809> it

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
have the 1gb ram so but then that's it

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.319 
have the 1gb ram so but then that's it
support<00:00:46.590> coprocessor<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.460> then<00:00:47.940> we<00:00:48.149> know

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
support coprocessor and then we know

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.160 
support coprocessor and then we know
that<00:00:48.360> we<00:00:48.989> windows<00:00:49.440> phones<00:00:49.800> are<00:00:50.100> not<00:00:50.309> really

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
that we windows phones are not really

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.930 
that we windows phones are not really
memory<00:00:52.170> hog<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:52.860> we'll<00:00:53.129> touch<00:00:53.370> out<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.670> gaming

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
memory hog so we'll touch out the gaming

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.760 
memory hog so we'll touch out the gaming
performance<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.750> device<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.379> see<00:00:55.590> how

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
performance of this device and see how

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.400 
performance of this device and see how
it<00:00:55.920> performs<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.850> we'll<00:00:57.000> play<00:00:57.660> two<00:00:57.899> games<00:00:58.170> one

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
it performs so we'll play two games one

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.869 
it performs so we'll play two games one
is<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.590> subway<00:00:58.800> surface<00:00:59.340> which<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.699> now

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
is the subway surface which is now

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.290 
is the subway surface which is now
available<00:01:00.270> for<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.829> fight<00:01:02.070> will<00:01:02.370> mb<00:01:02.640> devices

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
available for the fight will mb devices

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.899 
available for the fight will mb devices
and<00:01:03.589> secondly<00:01:04.589> we'll<00:01:04.860> play<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.220> asphalt<00:01:05.640> 8

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
and secondly we'll play the asphalt 8

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.300 
and secondly we'll play the asphalt 8
airborne<00:01:06.090> that's<00:01:06.600> again<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.439> highly<00:01:07.890> graphic

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
airborne that's again a highly graphic

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.880 
airborne that's again a highly graphic
which<00:01:08.460> game<00:01:08.760> again<00:01:09.479> available<00:01:09.720> for<00:01:10.200> phi<00:01:10.380> 2<00:01:10.439> mb

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
which game again available for phi 2 mb

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.609 
which game again available for phi 2 mb
ram<00:01:11.100> devices<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.390> let's<00:01:12.600> start<00:01:12.900> off<00:01:13.080> with<00:01:13.140> the

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
ram devices so let's start off with the

00:01:13.619 --> 00:02:02.930 
ram devices so let's start off with the
subway<00:01:14.010> surfer

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.120 

so<00:02:03.940> as<00:02:04.060> you<00:02:04.180> can<00:02:04.300> see<00:02:04.540> the<00:02:04.990> performance<00:02:05.860> is<00:02:06.100> not

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
so as you can see the performance is not

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.969 
so as you can see the performance is not
that<00:02:06.760> good<00:02:07.030> but<00:02:07.300> okay<00:02:07.480> the<00:02:08.229> graphics<00:02:08.650> are<00:02:08.830> not

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
that good but okay the graphics are not

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.740 
that good but okay the graphics are not
really<00:02:09.400> rich<00:02:09.550> because<00:02:09.910> of<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.119> display<00:02:10.510> is

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
really rich because of the display is

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.320 
really rich because of the display is
not<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.380> best<00:02:11.620> but<00:02:12.220> there<00:02:12.370> is<00:02:12.460> no<00:02:12.580> lag<00:02:12.820> as<00:02:13.090> such

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
not the best but there is no lag as such

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.420 
not the best but there is no lag as such
on<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.720> game<00:02:13.900> uh<00:02:13.930> so<00:02:14.380> it's<00:02:14.590> play<00:02:14.890> smooth<00:02:15.160> and

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
on the game uh so it's play smooth and

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.850 
on the game uh so it's play smooth and
the<00:02:15.490> touch<00:02:15.670> response<00:02:15.850> is<00:02:16.480> pretty<00:02:16.840> average<00:02:16.990> not

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
the touch response is pretty average not

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.400 
the touch response is pretty average not
really<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.550> best<00:02:18.790> but<00:02:19.240> still<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.990> game<00:02:20.140> plays

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
really the best but still the game plays

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.620 
really the best but still the game plays
pre<00:02:20.710> okay<00:02:21.070> I<00:02:21.100> mean<00:02:21.430> there<00:02:21.790> is<00:02:21.880> no<00:02:22.030> lag<00:02:22.300> or

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
pre okay I mean there is no lag or

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.810 
pre okay I mean there is no lag or
anything<00:02:23.020> as<00:02:23.170> as<00:02:23.590> such<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:24.490> graphic

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
anything as as such the graphic

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.790 
anything as as such the graphic
performance<00:02:25.360> is<00:02:25.510> not<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.870> best<00:02:26.110> probably

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
performance is not the best probably

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.410 
performance is not the best probably
because<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.340> display<00:02:27.760> is<00:02:27.820> not<00:02:28.060> really

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
because the display is not really

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.440 
because the display is not really
vibrant<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:29.020> it's<00:02:29.830> just<00:02:30.100> so<00:02:30.220> f<00:02:30.400> wbj<00:02:30.910> display

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
vibrant and it's just so f wbj display

00:02:31.450 --> 00:04:59.000 
vibrant and it's just so f wbj display
now<00:02:31.630> let's<00:02:31.810> play<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:32.080> asphalt<00:02:32.740> 8<00:02:32.950> airborne

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.540 

so<00:04:59.550> you<00:04:59.640> just<00:04:59.820> saw<00:05:00.120> one<00:05:00.570> rod<00:05:00.750> of<00:05:00.900> gaming<00:05:01.350> on

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
so you just saw one rod of gaming on

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.950 
so you just saw one rod of gaming on
that<00:05:02.550> fault<00:05:02.850> a<00:05:03.030> tab<00:05:03.300> on<00:05:03.540> and<00:05:03.780> you<00:05:03.870> could

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
that fault a tab on and you could

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.650 
that fault a tab on and you could
clearly<00:05:04.290> see<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:04.650> reefs<00:05:05.580> lag<00:05:05.880> in<00:05:06.210> many<00:05:06.420> areas

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
clearly see the reefs lag in many areas

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.050 
clearly see the reefs lag in many areas
when<00:05:07.050> you<00:05:07.080> hit<00:05:07.380> the<00:05:07.560> cars<00:05:07.830> or<00:05:08.100> bump<00:05:08.670> into<00:05:08.940> other

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
when you hit the cars or bump into other

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.120 
when you hit the cars or bump into other
cars<00:05:09.300> you<00:05:09.450> can<00:05:09.630> clearly<00:05:09.870> see<00:05:10.020> there<00:05:10.710> is<00:05:10.800> a<00:05:10.830> lag

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
cars you can clearly see there is a lag

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
do hinder with the gaming so when you

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.570 
do hinder with the gaming so when you

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
home button I'm cut a lot of times and

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.330 
home button I'm cut a lot of times and
we<00:05:29.550> felt<00:05:29.820> this<00:05:30.030> is<00:05:30.270> not<00:05:31.140> the<00:05:31.350> really<00:05:31.530> greatest

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
we felt this is not the really greatest

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.430 
we felt this is not the really greatest
of<00:05:32.550> the<00:05:32.670> devices<00:05:33.300> in<00:05:33.600> this<00:05:33.720> price<00:05:33.990> point<00:05:34.260> for

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
of the devices in this price point for

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.190 
of the devices in this price point for
gaming<00:05:34.950> so<00:05:35.100> we<00:05:35.790> can<00:05:36.180> say<00:05:36.390> that<00:05:36.660> there<00:05:36.960> are<00:05:37.050> many

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
gaming so we can say that there are many

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.690 
gaming so we can say that there are many
other<00:05:37.440> devices<00:05:37.650> in<00:05:38.010> this<00:05:38.100> price<00:05:38.340> point<00:05:38.580> like

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
other devices in this price point like

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
Micromax unite - which have better

Micromax unite - which have better
gaming<00:05:44.790> performance<00:05:45.210> than<00:05:45.810> this<00:05:46.080> one<00:05:46.350> so<00:05:46.500> this

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.040 
gaming performance than this one so this

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.160 
gaming performance than this one so this
is<00:05:47.160> 5<00:05:47.370> steps<00:05:47.640> 7<00:05:48.000> point<00:05:48.210> 2<00:05:48.330> K<00:05:48.600> in<00:05:48.750> India<00:05:49.020> right

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:49.170 
is 5 steps 7 point 2 K in India right

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.100 
is 5 steps 7 point 2 K in India right
now<00:05:49.230> and<00:05:49.790> this<00:05:50.790> has<00:05:51.030> just<00:05:51.390> fight<00:05:51.600> with<00:05:51.630> MB<00:05:52.080> RAM

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
now and this has just fight with MB RAM

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.800 
now and this has just fight with MB RAM
so<00:05:52.800> it<00:05:53.130> does<00:05:53.430> play<00:05:53.700> all<00:05:53.880> the<00:05:54.060> games<00:05:54.180> probably

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
so it does play all the games probably

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.870 
so it does play all the games probably
which<00:05:54.960> all<00:05:55.170> have<00:05:55.470> support<00:05:55.980> for<00:05:56.130> 512<00:05:56.610> MB<00:05:56.850> RAM

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
which all have support for 512 MB RAM

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.820 
which all have support for 512 MB RAM
those<00:05:57.360> games<00:05:57.630> are<00:05:57.870> playable<00:05:58.170> on<00:05:58.380> this<00:05:58.560> device

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
those games are playable on this device

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.980 
those games are playable on this device
but<00:05:59.580> the<00:05:59.700> quality<00:06:00.090> is<00:06:00.120> not<00:06:00.210> that<00:06:00.390> great<00:06:00.780> and

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
but the quality is not that great and

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.840 
but the quality is not that great and
there<00:06:01.380> is<00:06:01.530> a<00:06:01.560> hint<00:06:01.830> of<00:06:01.980> lag<00:06:02.220> incurred<00:06:02.670> a<00:06:02.700> lot<00:06:02.790> of

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:02.850 
there is a hint of lag incurred a lot of

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.000 
there is a hint of lag incurred a lot of
