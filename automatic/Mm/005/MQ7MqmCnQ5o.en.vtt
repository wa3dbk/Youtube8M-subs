00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.240
 this valverde extension 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.439

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:32.640
 encouragement for juanjo cobo palmer to start tino zaballa returns to tempt him 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.800
 tino zaballa there a little margin for the reaction already has to react already 

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:37.900

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.530
 it stays cut and cheap but the man who called had shown one due to 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.630
 that in the last kilometer 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.820
 zavala valverde plaza in front of his sons mikel astarloza

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.290

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.290
 today I was chasing jp descent mikel astarloza 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.950
 let's see if we can see 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.800
 constantino zaballa discount 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.590

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.240
 that can finish it proclaiming champion of Spain in the background 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.110
 highway 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.240
 favorable ground for mikel astarloza 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.090
 you have to watch the floor is very wet 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.450
 the asphalt is very dangerous showcase mestalla 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.160
 if you do that help, it keeps getting worse, it's still raining a lot 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.869
 mikel astarloza who can rescue this league 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.149
 the third victory of the season after those achieved by all 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.770
 hernandez

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.280
 ainia she 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.520
 thus to the bottom the goal of geoposition last slope mikel astarloza 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.710
 we no longer enter it 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.689
 when I passed it but today in favor for the leader 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:55.820
 what can he do 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.820
 champion of Spain cycling on the road 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.390
 two to 78 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.149
 We already said bombings where mikel astarloza and igor antón 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.249
 between the differences are fast approaching 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:10.409
 valverde 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:14.629
 zavalla and rubén plaza are trying the final climb to mikel 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.939
 Astarloza that last slope 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:20.429
 with great force valverde robert launches 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:25.119
 and constantino zaballa are choking him and robert throwing that 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:30.459
 alejandro abba constantino zaballa is going to win him silver provide place with that 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.459
 tremendous start with great force 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:37.039
 ruben plaza where podium of these championships of spain 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.619
 especially after the bronze in the test against him 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.849
 in it is going to proclaim champion of spain robert the ceremony in denver 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.539
 Where do I turn 

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:48.889
 thousands of Haitians 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:51.889
 tino zaballa that will end up being safe 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:55.629
 Spain can do it tomorrow 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:57.259
 now I see sense to zaballa 

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:01.669
 and the third place that serves to amaze astarloza father 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:04.140
 now outside the podium it also protects 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.199
 now he's out of the podium 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:07.599
 now they call me 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:13.799
 teresa garcía hirales 41 kilometers per hour valverde fourth igor antón 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:14.699
 fifth 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:18.379
 Lithuania and the runner we won has earned her a transvestite 

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:23.879
 because he is proclaimed champion of Spain in the background on the road to Kino Bay 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:25.249
 the spectators 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:29.249
 finally actor win here we think this unpublished goal 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:33.349
 in this act 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.389
 it seems that the good ending of constantino zaballa 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.579
 the mayor also of mikel astarloza 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.269
 they have been left out of that probable Igor Anton village 

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:46.279
 victory to displace 

00:03:46.279 --> 00:03:49.279
 Friday, April 9 

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:51.719
 rubén plaza 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:53.789
 she was champion 

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:57.099
 of Spain in 2003 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.739
 therefore repeats title rubén plaza on that occasion imposed on rafa 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.139
 hunting benjamín noval also picks up the relief of alejandro valverde 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:09.959
 Thus 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.019
 as well 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.279
 achieves if he was going to finish the present championship of spain 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:18.639
 background on highway 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.919
