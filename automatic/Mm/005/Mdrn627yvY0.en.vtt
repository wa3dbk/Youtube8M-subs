00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:17.920
 We would like to introduce the new Naturaliss range from Cupinic 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.249
 for guinea pigs 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:23.229
 Why we called it naturaliss, because everything we added is natural 

00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:26.409
 This is the new concept of nutrition that we have developed 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:27.960
 at Cunipic 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.029
 We find all the ingredients 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.100
 that you can meet in nature and that can eat animals. 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.730
 They are composed of 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.530
 hay of multiflower priaries where a multitude of different plants and flowers grow 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.200
 It is also very rich in vitamin C 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.129
 I tell you why vitamin C is very important for guinea pigs. 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:50.570
 Vitamin C mixes with food 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.050
 and can serve as a reward 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.150
 We also find calendula, nettle 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.379
 This is not a bad plant 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.190
 it has many beneficial properties 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.080
 when she prepares herself as a drink 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.120
 it is a plant that is used in homeopathy 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.560
 The most important thing is to talk about these nutrients 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.289
 let's take a closer look at the diet of guinea pigs 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:27.950
 because we have to remove the harmful foods 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.930
 as the excess of additives. There are foods that are 100% natural 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.750
 We do not use chemical processes for cereals 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.200
 You know that guinea pigs live in the Andes 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.580
 in South America 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.590
 They live in altitude, and support the cold 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.460
 and in nature, there is no chemical process 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.350
 This extraction process which consists of subjecting the cereal 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.540
 a fairly strong termic treatment 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.719
 for it to grow, and grow faster 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:08.789
 we do not use it 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.669
 because the cereal loses its dietary properties. What we do is a 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:17.920
 predigest 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:24.839
 Everyone knows it 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:27.270
 We can improve the diet 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.640
 guinea pigs love fruits and especially 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.910
 various vegetables 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.040
 For vegetables, find 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.529
 vegetables rich in vitamin c 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.579
 Surely you'll see it on our other videos, following our channel 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:45.309
 for example, peppers are very rich in vitamin C 

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:48.929
 red pepper like green pepper, especially red pepper 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:54.269
 in slices, they love! they are crazy! mostly 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.399
 if they come out of the fridge in summer because they are cool 

00:02:57.399 --> 00:03:01.179
 Now know that some guinea pigs can not synthesize vitamin C 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.450
 There are very few animals that can 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.199
 as in humans 

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:13.369
 You know that some people, bats 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:21.079
 or guinea pigs are not able to synthesize vitamin C 

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:26.249
 and we must therefore administer it in addition We have learned 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:30.399
 during the first transatlantic trips 

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:34.129
 when Colon crossed the Atlantic to discover the Americas. 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.599
 There was a disease that no one knew the gums 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:38.509
 bleeding 

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:42.529
 and they had sudden bleeding and sometimes even tooth loss 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:46.430
 because of lack of vitamin C 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.599
 There is in all fresh products 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.899
 but especially in fruits and vegetables. During these long trips 

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:57.979
 Fruits and vegetables rotted and you could not eat fresh fruit. 

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:02.309
 there was a disease called scurvy, 

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:03.859
 which is the lack of vitamin C 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:04.759
 otherwise 

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:08.229
 the other important food that must be integrated into the diet is hay 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:18.340
 Talking about hay and saying nothing is the same thing, because hay is nothing more than dry grass 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.140
 the most important is to know 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.279
 what grass are we talking about 

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:27.519
 So you have to vary it as much as possible. That means, try to take hay of all the varieties you can. 

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:31.079
 The more varieties there are, the better. 

00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:33.379
 You have to change varieties 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:37.360
 because some plants bring benefits while others bring others 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.669
 Try to have two or three hay varieties at home 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.649
 and to alternate the varieties so that they can taste of all kinds. 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.610
 Finally, we will develop a few 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.580
 different points of the naturaliss range, to discover its benefits. 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.189
 The fiber supplement 

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:02.830
 Fiber is a very important food 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.539
 because the fiber, maintains the intestinal transit 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:11.759
 eliminate the teeth. You know that their teeth grow all their lives 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:13.699
 we'll talk about it in the next videos 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:17.229
 and I take this opportunity to tell you to go on you tube 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:20.650
 because we have a lot of videos about food 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:26.089
 on the digestive system, and digestive fisiology of guinea pigs 

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:27.620
 You also have low calorie diets 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.760
 a very important thing. A low calorie diet means that it contains very little or no fat at all 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.389
 because guinea pigs 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:38.180
 have the habit of getting fat, and they are rather greedy It is sure that have had guinea pigs 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.830
 know their cries when they ask for food, the classic cry they make 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.770
 when they are hungry 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.660
 You must be very careful, especially with the excess of cereals because 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.360
 the cereals 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.550
 make them grow 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.270
 On the other hand, vitamin C must be administered separately 

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:03.460
 We mixed vitamin C with what they like the most 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.259
 with small grains of wheat 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.070
 Our choice is these prepared diets 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.690
 to please the guinea pigs. Diet 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.690
 is not only good in its composition 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.060
 and in its totality if not that we chose 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.819
 the ingredients they prefer for them to eat well 

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:27.889
 You will try at home and you will get there 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.520
 They love food a lot!
