like<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.350> algae<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.370> kind<00:02:41.640> of<00:02:41.760> feeding<00:02:42.330> away

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
like the algae is kind of feeding away

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.330 
like the algae is kind of feeding away

also going to show you a third enemy
this<00:02:47.880> is<00:02:47.940> an<00:02:48.090> enemy<00:02:48.420> right<00:02:48.570> here<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.930> third

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
this is an enemy right here the third

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.350 
this is an enemy right here the third
one<00:02:49.850> usually<00:02:50.850> travels<00:02:51.450> along<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.020> rock<00:02:52.380> and

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
one usually travels along the rock and

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.960 
one usually travels along the rock and
you<00:02:54.360> hear<00:02:54.600> that<00:02:54.780> enemies<00:02:55.380> have<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:55.560> sting<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.250> I

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
you hear that enemies have a sting and I

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.390 
you hear that enemies have a sting and I
really<00:02:57.510> didn't<00:02:57.750> believe<00:02:57.810> it

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
really didn't believe it

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.870 
really didn't believe it
but<00:02:59.690> trust<00:03:00.690> me<00:03:00.810> they<00:03:01.020> do<00:03:01.220> you<00:03:02.220> as<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:02.610> can<00:03:02.730> see

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
but trust me they do you as you can see

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.479 
but trust me they do you as you can see
in<00:03:02.970> that<00:03:03.060> video<00:03:03.270> right<00:03:03.630> there<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:04.489> totally

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
in that video right there it totally

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.280 
in that video right there it totally
bleached<00:03:05.880> out<00:03:06.150> a<00:03:06.209> whole<00:03:06.570> branch<00:03:06.870> of<00:03:07.110> that

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
bleached out a whole branch of that

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.250 
bleached out a whole branch of that
coral<00:03:08.390> like<00:03:09.390> you<00:03:09.510> for<00:03:09.720> me<00:03:10.370> normally<00:03:11.370> care<00:03:11.640> but

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
coral like you for me normally care but

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.449 
coral like you for me normally care but
I've<00:03:13.260> been<00:03:13.680> one<00:03:13.860> of<00:03:13.980> a<00:03:14.160> nicer<00:03:14.880> coral<00:03:15.380> you<00:03:16.380> know

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
I've been one of a nicer coral you know

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.729 
I've been one of a nicer coral you know
I've<00:03:17.459> been<00:03:17.670> pretty<00:03:17.880> mad<00:03:18.320> this<00:03:19.320> core<00:03:19.560> right

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
I've been pretty mad this core right

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.080 
I've been pretty mad this core right
here<00:03:19.890> is<00:03:19.980> pretty<00:03:20.130> big<00:03:20.400> anyways

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
here is pretty big anyways

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.479 
here is pretty big anyways
so<00:03:21.720> I'll<00:03:21.810> just<00:03:22.019> break<00:03:22.440> that<00:03:22.620> branch<00:03:22.890> off<00:03:23.190> and

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
so I'll just break that branch off and

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.750 
so I'll just break that branch off and
it'll<00:03:23.640> be<00:03:23.760> all<00:03:23.880> right<00:03:24.530> looking<00:03:25.530> at<00:03:25.650> my<00:03:25.860> Zola

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
it'll be all right looking at my Zola

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.199 
it'll be all right looking at my Zola
garden<00:03:27.180> that<00:03:27.299> I<00:03:27.390> got<00:03:27.540> going<00:03:27.840> on<00:03:28.760> this<00:03:29.760> one<00:03:29.970> has

garden that I got going on this one has

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.590 
garden that I got going on this one has
pretty<00:03:31.140> much<00:03:31.380> filled<00:03:31.680> up<00:03:31.799> the<00:03:32.030> frag<00:03:33.030> plug<00:03:33.330> and

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
pretty much filled up the frag plug and

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.320 
pretty much filled up the frag plug and
is<00:03:34.410> finally<00:03:34.830> growing<00:03:34.980> on<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.640> Tonga<00:03:36.060> Brook

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
is finally growing on to the Tonga Brook

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.979 
is finally growing on to the Tonga Brook

and on to the right you can see not

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.460 
and on to the right you can see not
those<00:03:53.220> pots<00:03:53.640> or<00:03:53.880> calls<00:03:54.150> at<00:03:54.360> bencoseze<00:03:54.780> so<00:03:55.200> it

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
those pots or calls at bencoseze so it

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.440 
those pots or calls at bencoseze so it
pretty<00:03:55.650> much<00:03:55.739> did<00:03:56.130> hopefully<00:03:56.880> they'll<00:03:57.269> come

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
pretty much did hopefully they'll come

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.289 
pretty much did hopefully they'll come
back<00:03:57.660> and<00:03:57.989> bounce<00:03:58.920> back

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299

I<00:04:00.329> have<00:04:01.079> those<00:04:01.320> Zulu<00:04:02.030> cat<00:04:03.030> ice<00:04:03.239> I<00:04:03.660> got<00:04:04.200> those

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
I have those Zulu cat ice I got those

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.380 
I have those Zulu cat ice I got those
from<00:04:04.799> cherry<00:04:05.340> corals<00:04:05.790> those<00:04:06.030> are<00:04:06.150> doing

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
from cherry corals those are doing

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.020 
from cherry corals those are doing
pretty<00:04:06.600> good<00:04:06.870> i<00:04:07.170> frag<00:04:07.620> them<00:04:07.730> quite<00:04:08.730> a<00:04:08.760> few

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
pretty good i frag them quite a few

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.900 
pretty good i frag them quite a few
times<00:04:09.239> already<00:04:09.650> give<00:04:10.650> them<00:04:10.799> to<00:04:10.950> other<00:04:11.400> members

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
times already give them to other members

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.360 
times already give them to other members
and<00:04:12.180> seems<00:04:13.019> like<00:04:13.200> they'll<00:04:13.410> be<00:04:13.440> attaching

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
and seems like they'll be attaching

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.180 
and seems like they'll be attaching
themselves<00:04:14.670> onto<00:04:15.000> that<00:04:15.239> rock<00:04:15.450> pretty<00:04:15.750> soon

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
themselves onto that rock pretty soon

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.219 
themselves onto that rock pretty soon
these<00:04:17.190> ones<00:04:17.519> are<00:04:17.820> doing<00:04:18.540> all<00:04:18.660> right

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
these ones are doing all right

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.310 
these ones are doing all right
they're<00:04:20.010> kind<00:04:20.250> of<00:04:20.870> iffy<00:04:21.870> I'm<00:04:21.959> sure<00:04:22.169> they're

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
they're kind of iffy I'm sure they're

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.380 
they're kind of iffy I'm sure they're
not<00:04:22.349> supposed<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:22.830> be<00:04:22.979> that<00:04:23.099> color<00:04:23.340> and<00:04:23.669> my

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
not supposed to be that color and my

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.010 
not supposed to be that color and my
process

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
process

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.140 
process
we're<00:04:26.410> doing<00:04:26.650> pretty<00:04:26.800> good<00:04:27.099> I<00:04:27.370> had<00:04:27.819> did<00:04:28.000> have

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
we're doing pretty good I had did have

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.749 
we're doing pretty good I had did have
three<00:04:28.449> heads<00:04:28.599> on<00:04:28.840> them<00:04:29.020> but<00:04:29.400> looks<00:04:30.400> like<00:04:30.580> only

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 
three heads on them but looks like only

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:35.520 
three heads on them but looks like only
two<00:04:31.150> have<00:04:31.479> survived<00:04:33.539> they<00:04:34.539> also<00:04:34.840> grow<00:04:35.259> really

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
two have survived they also grow really

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:41.040 
two have survived they also grow really
slow<00:04:35.680> but<00:04:36.580> I<00:04:37.560> guess<00:04:38.560> you<00:04:39.099> know<00:04:39.250> whatever<00:04:40.050> and

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
slow but I guess you know whatever and

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.409 
slow but I guess you know whatever and
for<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:41.740> center<00:04:42.130> this<00:04:42.669> is<00:04:42.819> my<00:04:43.090> newest

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
for the center this is my newest

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.100 
for the center this is my newest
addition<00:04:43.930> right<00:04:44.080> there<00:04:44.319> are<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:45.039> Hornets

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
addition right there are the Hornets

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.080 
addition right there are the Hornets
really<00:04:47.110> love<00:04:47.319> those<00:04:47.580> want<00:04:48.580> to<00:04:48.639> get<00:04:48.819> some

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
really love those want to get some

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.730 
really love those want to get some
yellow<00:04:49.240> ones<00:04:49.360> and<00:04:49.720> some<00:04:49.870> red<00:04:50.050> ones<00:04:50.199> later<00:04:50.500> on

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
yellow ones and some red ones later on

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.300 
yellow ones and some red ones later on
but<00:04:51.250> they're<00:04:51.550> kind<00:04:51.759> of<00:04:51.789> hard<00:04:51.940> for<00:04:52.030> me<00:04:52.180> to<00:04:52.270> find

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
but they're kind of hard for me to find

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.730 
but they're kind of hard for me to find
locally<00:04:54.310> so<00:04:55.180> I'll<00:04:55.389> probably<00:04:55.599> end<00:04:55.870> up<00:04:55.990> ordering

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
locally so I'll probably end up ordering

right there is huge if you open up your
hand<00:06:21.610> that's<00:06:22.090> about<00:06:22.300> as<00:06:22.479> big<00:06:22.659> as<00:06:22.719> it<00:06:22.840> is<00:06:22.990> the

foot on this sucker is huge
and<00:06:25.949> thankfully<00:06:26.949> it<00:06:27.099> really<00:06:27.310> hasn't<00:06:27.490> been

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:27.699 
and thankfully it really hasn't been

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:35.510 
and thankfully it really hasn't been
moving<00:06:28.300> moving<00:06:28.930> around<00:06:29.229> a<00:06:29.620> whole<00:06:29.889> lot

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.580 

but<00:06:36.520> I<00:06:37.180> don't<00:06:37.480> have<00:06:37.540> any<00:06:37.720> problems<00:06:38.170> with<00:06:38.380> any

but I don't have any problems with any
of<00:06:38.770> my<00:06:38.970> inverts<00:06:42.030> you<00:06:43.030> can<00:06:43.180> see<00:06:43.330> the<00:06:43.510> ugly<00:06:44.140> hair

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:44.320 
of my inverts you can see the ugly hair

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.570 
of my inverts you can see the ugly hair
algae<00:06:44.710> all<00:06:44.830> over<00:06:45.070> the<00:06:45.160> place<00:06:46.650> been<00:06:47.650> raising<00:06:48.340> my

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:48.580 
algae all over the place been raising my

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.560 
algae all over the place been raising my
magnesium<00:06:49.270> up<00:06:49.810> right<00:06:50.440> now<00:06:50.560> it's<00:06:50.770> at<00:06:50.890> 1400<00:06:51.760> I've

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:52.570 
magnesium up right now it's at 1400 I've

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.960 
magnesium up right now it's at 1400 I've
been<00:06:52.960> trying<00:06:53.260> to<00:06:53.320> raise<00:06:53.530> it<00:06:53.680> up<00:06:53.770> to<00:06:53.830> 1600<00:06:54.700> they

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:54.970 
been trying to raise it up to 1600 they

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.080 
been trying to raise it up to 1600 they
say<00:06:55.180> if<00:06:55.390> you<00:06:55.510> keep<00:06:55.720> it<00:06:55.900> at<00:06:55.960> 1600<00:06:56.620> for<00:06:56.800> a<00:06:56.860> week

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.090 
say if you keep it at 1600 for a week

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:01.190 
say if you keep it at 1600 for a week
using<00:06:58.090> tech<00:06:58.450> em<00:06:58.720> that<00:06:59.200> this<00:06:59.830> algae<00:07:00.280> will<00:07:00.580> just

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:01.200 
using tech em that this algae will just

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:07.080 
using tech em that this algae will just
kind<00:07:02.200> of<00:07:02.290> disappear<00:07:03.960> on<00:07:04.960> a<00:07:05.170> cans<00:07:05.880> looking<00:07:06.880> good

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:07.090 
kind of disappear on a cans looking good

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.370 
kind of disappear on a cans looking good
I<00:07:07.450> have<00:07:08.140> a<00:07:08.170> whole<00:07:08.740> bunch<00:07:08.950> of<00:07:09.040> algae<00:07:09.370> on<00:07:09.490> my

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:10.380 
I have a whole bunch of algae on my

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.960 
I have a whole bunch of algae on my
mushroom<00:07:11.380> islands<00:07:11.920> and<00:07:12.070> some<00:07:12.340> of<00:07:12.430> the<00:07:12.520> a<00:07:12.550> cans

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:12.970 
mushroom islands and some of the a cans

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.850 
mushroom islands and some of the a cans
so<00:07:13.810> anyways<00:07:14.140> here's<00:07:14.440> the<00:07:14.620> tech<00:07:15.010> in<00:07:15.300> magnesium
