00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
actually didn't notice though is a fact

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.960 
actually didn't notice though is a fact
that<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.920> camera<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.310> not<00:01:35.490> very<00:01:35.700> good<00:01:35.850> at

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
that the camera is not very good at

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.100 
that the camera is not very good at
balancing<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.570> foreground<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.049> background

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
balancing the foreground and background

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.520 
balancing the foreground and background
I'll<00:01:37.710> explain<00:01:37.979> most<00:01:38.780> susceptible<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.320> is

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
I'll explain most susceptible to this is

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.380 
I'll explain most susceptible to this is
the<00:01:40.650> front<00:01:40.950> camera<00:01:41.100> which<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.520> when<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.090> focus

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
the front camera which is when you focus

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.780 
the front camera which is when you focus
on<00:01:42.689> someone<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.829> foreground<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.670> I'm

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
on someone in the foreground that is I'm

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.160 
on someone in the foreground that is I'm
standing<00:01:45.060> right<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.270> front<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.630> know<00:01:45.750> it

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
standing right in front of you know it

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.569 
standing right in front of you know it
tends<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.470> kind<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.710> blow<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.189> background

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
tends to kind of blow the background

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.039 
tends to kind of blow the background
because<00:01:47.850> he<00:01:47.939> wants<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.210> conserve<00:01:48.659> like<00:01:48.869> a

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
because he wants to conserve like a

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.200 
because he wants to conserve like a
preserve<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.740> front<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.579> does<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.729> problem

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
preserve the front so it does a problem

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.280 
preserve the front so it does a problem
with<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.390> camera<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.750> don't<00:01:51.930> know<00:01:51.990> if<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.140> can

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
with the camera I don't know if it can

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.319 
with the camera I don't know if it can
be<00:01:52.350> fixed<00:01:52.439> by<00:01:52.890> software<00:01:53.250> update<00:01:53.579> but<00:01:54.060> thatís

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
be fixed by software update but thatís

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.760 
be fixed by software update but thatís
basically<00:01:54.570> beneath<00:01:55.110> for<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.320> second<00:01:55.649> day<00:01:55.740> of

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
basically beneath for a second day of

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.160 
basically beneath for a second day of
use<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.520> McCoy<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.149> today's<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.840> third

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
use of the McCoy and today's the third

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.780 
use of the McCoy and today's the third
day<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.469> I've<00:01:58.590> been<00:01:58.740> using<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.219> me<00:01:59.399> for<00:01:59.640> I

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
day that I've been using the me for I

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.999 
day that I've been using the me for I
now<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.299> first<00:02:00.689> thing<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:01.020> must<00:02:01.259> get<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.680> tell

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
now the first thing I must get a tell

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.620 
now the first thing I must get a tell
you<00:02:02.100> guys<00:02:02.219> is<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.820> actually<00:02:03.060> use<00:02:03.479> the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
you guys is that I actually use the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.209 
you guys is that I actually use the
device<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:03.990> performance<00:02:04.680> mode<00:02:04.950> basically

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
device and performance mode basically

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.520 
device and performance mode basically
performance<00:02:05.909> mode<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.240> where

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
performance mode is where

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.590 
performance mode is where
things<00:02:06.979> are<00:02:07.130> supposed<00:02:07.220> to<00:02:07.460> go<00:02:07.640> faster<00:02:08.209> like

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
things are supposed to go faster like

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.240 
things are supposed to go faster like
its<00:02:08.780> supposed<00:02:08.840> to<00:02:09.110> clog<00:02:09.319> the<00:02:09.470> CPU<00:02:09.860> higher<00:02:10.100> i

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
its supposed to clog the CPU higher i

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.220 
its supposed to clog the CPU higher i
think<00:02:10.580> but<00:02:11.090> i<00:02:11.150> noticed<00:02:11.540> that<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:11.780> phone<00:02:11.990> got

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
think but i noticed that the phone got

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.320 
think but i noticed that the phone got
very<00:02:12.560> very<00:02:12.860> hot<00:02:13.100> and<00:02:13.280> i<00:02:13.370> lost<00:02:13.610> a<00:02:13.760> lot<00:02:13.940> of<00:02:13.970> charge

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
very very hot and i lost a lot of charge

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.330 
very very hot and i lost a lot of charge
so<00:02:14.959> that's<00:02:15.230> definitely<00:02:15.470> something<00:02:15.830> I<00:02:16.160> should

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
so that's definitely something I should

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.470 
so that's definitely something I should
look<00:02:16.370> out<00:02:16.550> for<00:02:16.580> if<00:02:17.060> you<00:02:17.150> want<00:02:17.300> to<00:02:17.360> use

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
look out for if you want to use

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.840 
look out for if you want to use
performance<00:02:17.930> mode<00:02:18.500> know<00:02:19.069> that<00:02:19.280> it's<00:02:19.490> going<00:02:19.670> to

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
performance mode know that it's going to

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.090 
performance mode know that it's going to
make<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.270> phone<00:02:20.450> go<00:02:20.660> very<00:02:20.900> hot<00:02:21.110> another

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
make the phone go very hot another

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.800 
make the phone go very hot another
downside<00:02:22.280> actually<00:02:22.850> noticed<00:02:23.209> by<00:02:23.360> using<00:02:23.600> it

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
downside actually noticed by using it

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.960 
downside actually noticed by using it
this<00:02:23.989> third<00:02:24.290> day<00:02:24.500> is<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.770> fact<00:02:25.010> that<00:02:25.100> when<00:02:25.940> i

hit wireless headphones with the cable
into<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.770> phone<00:02:31.069> i<00:02:31.280> noticed<00:02:31.910> that<00:02:32.000> it<00:02:32.239> wasn't

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569

the third day two recap all I said the
phone<00:02:51.769> on<00:02:51.920> performance<00:02:52.370> mode<00:02:52.580> gets<00:02:52.850> really

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
phone on performance mode gets really

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.190 
phone on performance mode gets really
really<00:02:53.360> hot<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:55.000> when<00:02:56.000> I<00:02:56.030> used<00:02:56.330> my<00:02:56.750> headphones

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
really hot and when I used my headphones

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.660 
really hot and when I used my headphones
my<00:02:57.500> steelseries<00:02:57.920> headphones<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.400> actually

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
my steelseries headphones I actually

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.460 
my steelseries headphones I actually
noticed<00:02:58.970> that<00:02:59.360> it<00:02:59.510> wasn't<00:02:59.840> working<00:03:00.140> and

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
noticed that it wasn't working and

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.050 
noticed that it wasn't working and
that's<00:03:00.590> a<00:03:00.739> buddy<00:03:00.890> for<00:03:01.069> the<00:03:01.160> third<00:03:01.340> day<00:03:01.370> today's

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
feature called sunlight display what

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.650 
feature called sunlight display what
that<00:03:09.920> basically<00:03:09.950> is<00:03:10.459> is<00:03:10.820> when<00:03:11.299> you<00:03:11.420> take<00:03:11.450> your

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
phone into the sun and if there's like

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.940 
phone into the sun and if there's like
duck<00:03:13.970> parts<00:03:14.329> of<00:03:14.420> a<00:03:14.510> picture<00:03:14.959> or<00:03:15.200> your<00:03:15.440> keyboard

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
duck parts of a picture or your keyboard

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.130 
duck parts of a picture or your keyboard
which<00:03:16.160> is<00:03:16.310> like<00:03:16.519> a<00:03:16.549> dark<00:03:16.910> theme<00:03:17.420> apply<00:03:17.750> it's

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
which is like a dark theme apply it's

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.750 
which is like a dark theme apply it's
actually<00:03:18.290> make<00:03:18.590> it<00:03:18.739> brighter<00:03:19.010> so<00:03:19.310> it<00:03:19.370> makes<00:03:19.579> it

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
actually make it brighter so it makes it

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.890 
actually make it brighter so it makes it
that<00:03:19.820> you<00:03:20.060> don't<00:03:20.239> have<00:03:20.329> to<00:03:20.390> bump<00:03:20.750> up<00:03:20.870> your

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
that you don't have to bump up your

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.810 
that you don't have to bump up your
brightness<00:03:21.470> and<00:03:21.890> I<00:03:21.980> call<00:03:22.130> it<00:03:22.220> 20<00:03:22.519> me<00:03:22.579> when<00:03:22.760> I

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
brightness and I call it 20 me when I

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.610 
brightness and I call it 20 me when I
osgi<00:03:23.180> event<00:03:23.510> it's<00:03:23.720> actually<00:03:24.110> hardware-based

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
osgi event it's actually hardware-based

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.289 
osgi event it's actually hardware-based
so<00:03:25.280> it<00:03:25.370> doesn't<00:03:25.640> actually<00:03:25.760> affect<00:03:26.000> your

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
so it doesn't actually affect your

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:27.729 
so it doesn't actually affect your
battery<00:03:26.600> life<00:03:26.750> so<00:03:26.900> today<00:03:27.170> I<00:03:27.200> actually<00:03:27.380> went<00:03:27.620> to

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739

after<00:04:32.000> updated<00:04:32.540> was<00:04:32.690> that<00:04:32.870> actually<00:04:33.500> lost<00:04:33.770> one

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
after updated was that actually lost one

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.280 
after updated was that actually lost one
hour<00:04:34.790> battery<00:04:35.150> life<00:04:35.360> so<00:04:35.720> before<00:04:36.110> I<00:04:36.139> used<00:04:36.260> to

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
hour battery life so before I used to

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.780

it has a weird exposure issue actually

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.140 
it has a weird exposure issue actually
fix<00:05:03.800> that<00:05:04.010> by<00:05:04.160> going<00:05:04.280> to<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:04.550> settings<00:05:04.910> and

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
fix that by going to the settings and

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.480 
fix that by going to the settings and
changing<00:05:05.810> the<00:05:05.990> metering<00:05:06.380> mode<00:05:06.650> from<00:05:07.160> spot

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
changing the metering mode from spot

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.190 
changing the metering mode from spot
metering<00:05:07.880> to<00:05:08.120> something<00:05:08.630> else<00:05:08.720> I<00:05:08.900> guess<00:05:09.080> how

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
metering to something else I guess how

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.140 
metering to something else I guess how

new style of review to recap all I said

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.540 
new style of review to recap all I said
well<00:05:35.630> all<00:05:35.660> I<00:05:35.990> said<00:05:36.349> and<00:05:36.620> recorded<00:05:37.099> in<00:05:37.220> the<00:05:37.310> past

five<00:05:37.760> days<00:05:38.000> I<00:05:38.270> would<00:05:38.630> say<00:05:38.750> the<00:05:38.870> phone<00:05:39.050> is

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
five days I would say the phone is

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:41.140 
five days I would say the phone is
pretty<00:05:39.530> lights<00:05:39.860> like<00:05:40.190> when<00:05:40.430> you<00:05:40.580> start<00:05:41.000> using

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
pretty lights like when you start using

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.940 
pretty lights like when you start using
this<00:05:41.389> phone<00:05:41.630> every<00:05:42.229> other<00:05:42.289> phone<00:05:42.560> it<00:05:42.710> feels

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
this phone every other phone it feels

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.070 
this phone every other phone it feels
really<00:05:43.220> really<00:05:43.460> heavy<00:05:43.760> I<00:05:44.090> would<00:05:44.810> say<00:05:44.960> the

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
really really heavy I would say the

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.900 
really really heavy I would say the
battery<00:05:45.380> life<00:05:45.500> is<00:05:45.530> good<00:05:45.919> up<00:05:46.070> until<00:05:46.190> yesterday

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
battery life is good up until yesterday

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.210 
battery life is good up until yesterday
when<00:05:47.270> and<00:05:47.750> it<00:05:48.320> was<00:05:48.470> pretty<00:05:48.620> bad<00:05:48.889> because<00:05:49.070> of

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
when and it was pretty bad because of

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.710 
when and it was pretty bad because of
the<00:05:49.400> update<00:05:49.580> i<00:05:49.789> think<00:05:50.090> they<00:05:50.240> should<00:05:50.419> fix<00:05:50.630> that

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
the update i think they should fix that

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.260 
the update i think they should fix that
in<00:05:50.930> the<00:05:51.080> next<00:05:51.260> update<00:05:51.470> i<00:05:51.860> would<00:05:52.550> say<00:05:52.789> the

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270

in the next update i would say the
display<00:05:53.660> is<00:05:53.720> really<00:05:54.050> really<00:05:54.200> good<00:05:54.440> like<00:05:54.650> many
