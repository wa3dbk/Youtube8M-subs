00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.690
 Hello dear easter bunny I am marti and 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.639
 that's what's going on easter special 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.830
 easter what is that really? 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.880
 the sweets are not really easter 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.830
 namely, the Christians celebrate the 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.630
 resurrection of Jesus Christ after the new one 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.369
 testament he is three days after his 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.529
 funeral risen jesus became 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.939
 thus brought back to life by God 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.289
 Russia is for the Christians 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.359
 most important festival of the whole year 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.680
 more importantly as christmas 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.539
 Incidentally, Christmas is the birth of 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.010
 jesus celebrated in kristen is like easter 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.810
 important because they believe that Jesus the 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.820
 people through his death from sins 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.500
 liberates and thereby redemption 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.910
 and eternal life has given after 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.920
 the Christian conception came 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.930
 sin into the world after adam and eva 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.700
 in the paradise of the tree of knowledge ate 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.200
 what God had forbidden them before 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.329
 since then, people have to end 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.649
 her life die because jesus die 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.239
 sins of all humans vicariously 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.160
 has taken on and therefore 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.719
 he died because of his death 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.879
 and the resurrection of the people of 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.199
 Sins and death are released for 40 days 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.300
 After easter, he was then on one 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.760
 cloud carried to the sky at this 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.050
 day today we celebrate christi ascension 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.520
 you're probably wondering why it is 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.710
 was so much sweet and easter then 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.420
 look for eggs that the egg becomes a symbol 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.670
 Easter has been with the lent 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.260
 to do the 40 days before Easter 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.850
 Ash Wednesday begins believing 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.439
 Christians abstain from lent 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.869
 on certain foods frequently 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.610
 sweets or alcohol and offer a lot 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.560
 so they want easter for their sins 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.869
 repent and remember that also Jesus 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.580
 For 40 days fasted in the desert 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.200
 In the past, lentings were much stricter 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.060
 as today and the believers renounced 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.189
 also on meat from warm-blooded animals 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.659
 fat and everything that consists of milk 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.100
 So butter cream, etc 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.750
 but the people already have 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.790
 tricked and therefore explained 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.280
 just a few mammals and birds 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.780
 to fish because some Catholics do not 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.119
 to abstain from meat and capture 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.619
 Wanted fish but was allowed but what 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.200
 has that with the eggs and easter on 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.549
 in the old days this was considered fluid 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.350
 meat therefore one has in the 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.329
 also no eggs in the spring 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.700
 put chickens but especially many 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.170
 Eggs that means the quantity and 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.060
 eaten in eggs did not match 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.799
 since there were no refrigerators before 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.119
 that was a real problem therefore 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.860
 The eggs were made and preserved 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.149
 she gave away to be easter today 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.950
 the painted eggs of the easter bunny 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.240
 brought but why does he bring the eggs 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.469
 and where does he get for and why? 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.030
 there is even the hare for this 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.450
 different theories one of them is 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.860
 that both the hare and the symbol 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.480
 Fertility is also the behavior 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.910
 The lawn makes them the ideal eggs 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.260
 Hidden hares stay still 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.360
 the meadow until you reach danger quickly 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.709
 of it the place on the the 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.390
 have sat and the grass 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.340
 have pressed down is then one 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.870
 suitable place for egg laying one 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.849
 other theory says that since 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.620
 the 18th century the so-called three 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.810
 hare picture a popular motive for 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.370
 painting of Easter eggs was this motif 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.200
 consists of three bunnies each with only 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.360
 an ear because the egg on the hare 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.000
 are painted around it looks like 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.160
 Everybody has 23 ears to stand 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.420
 for the trinity of god she 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.160
 is an important symbol of 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.049
 christendums that should clarify that 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.790
 god jesus and the holy spirit one 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.170
 unity form according to a third 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.329
 The theory, however, very controversial 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.190
 is the origin of easter 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.380
 a pagan gods named ostara 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.239
 She is supposed to be a spring goddess 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.849
 the Germans had been to the day and 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.739
 night equals the day in spring 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:05.630
 the day and night are the same length 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.390
 a big feast for the goddess ostara 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.530
