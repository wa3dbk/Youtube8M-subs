video that I did with the parts I had
the<00:00:12.950> bouncing<00:00:13.950> ball<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:14.750> did<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:16.670> OBX<00:00:19.550> throttle

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
the bouncing ball I did the OBX throttle

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:28.390 
the bouncing ball I did the OBX throttle
body<00:00:20.760> spacer<00:00:25.039> and<00:00:26.039> we<00:00:26.220> see<00:00:26.539> let's<00:00:27.539> see<00:00:27.750> if<00:00:27.869> that

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
body spacer and we see let's see if that

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.850 
body spacer and we see let's see if that
helps<00:00:29.400> but<00:00:30.300> if<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.599> can<00:00:30.779> see<00:00:31.460> that<00:00:32.460> circular

helps but if you can see that circular

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:40.670 
helps but if you can see that circular
thing<00:00:36.170> on<00:00:37.250> the<00:00:38.250> throttle<00:00:38.820> body<00:00:39.350> right<00:00:40.350> below

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
thing on the throttle body right below

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.420 
thing on the throttle body right below
it<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.840> spacer<00:00:42.840> that's<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.290> OBX<00:00:43.950> total<00:00:44.280> body

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
it that spacer that's the OBX total body

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.660 
it that spacer that's the OBX total body
spacer<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.989> there<00:00:47.660> and<00:00:48.660> then<00:00:48.809> then<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.289> know

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
spacer in there and then then you know

00:00:49.670 --> 00:01:00.369 
spacer in there and then then you know
HPS<00:00:50.670> cold<00:00:50.969> air<00:00:51.120> intake<00:00:54.710> over<00:00:55.710> here<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.660> put<00:00:57.829> the

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
HPS cold air intake over here I put the

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:06.980 
HPS cold air intake over here I put the
OBX<00:01:03.680> alternator<00:01:04.680> pulley<00:01:05.270> the<00:01:06.270> water<00:01:06.600> pump

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990
