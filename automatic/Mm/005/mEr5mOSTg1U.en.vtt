00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:13.360
 hi everyone and the hostile one 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.889
 video tutoz let's say 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.140
 on the special goes on the special 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.480
 but on the launchers so we go 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.580
 start with the first 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.289
 then the third and the second 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.270
 why I made the lan deezer goes all 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.250
 simply because for the second 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.590
 I have a little surprise for you so 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.869
 I do not say more you'll see that in 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.940
 the third video huh and then we go 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.700
 start with ben i'll start with 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.890
 explain to you the first nine 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.059
 camouflage well the challenges then on 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.969
 just learned it but camouflage 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.490
 it will be without apparatus to destroy the 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.290
 second so simple I think there is 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.200
 a bullet in the water that word so take 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.760
 plunderers with you to avoid at every 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.560
 time to die to recover a bullet 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.390
 if you have worse you get the 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.210
 small blue bag and you recover 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.870
 ammo thanks to this little this 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.649
 small bag 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:05.979
 so it will be necessary to destroy without apparatus 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.740
 enemy long drones any device 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.820
 air 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.700
 it's the same account that is 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.500
 counted in the senses so that's it 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.760
 once you get his hundred 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:22.270
 first bass and first nine like or 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.909
 flash you will have 5 challenges then excused 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.070
 for this little Brig I have enough throat 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.830
 dry 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.990
 so here's the first as flash 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.000
 carbon fiber you have to make ten 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.150
 appointments the impact I advise you 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.299
 to have looters in our class too 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.159
 go in gold than in normal flow without the 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.710
 record simply because there is 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:48.490
 has normal that if they have them 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.900
 bullets so for the explosive damage the 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.000
 launchers will be part of it 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.770
 so you will have faster markers than 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.700
 so you have then the best record 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.530
 anyway because I'm taking them away 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.200
 their body 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.090
 when we have a maximum of enemies and 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.009
 try to get as close to 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.850
 ie you stick to them for 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:09.490
 shoot or whatever but that's the best it is 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.850
 to stick to put 2 you go to m 2 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.550
 in their back and boubou renéricéric osm he 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.560
 must do ten simply 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.210
 the second will be cherry blossoms there 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.240
 must destroy five enemy aircraft 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.070
 so on time in simple domination but 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.170
 generally in the parts to have 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.450
 a fortnight the drone throne of 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.430
 scrambling these two there are 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.170
 counted so you have to make five 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.200
 devices destroy five devices in one 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.750
 part the smo simple enough you can 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.420
 lock the aircraft 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.640
 so it's very very fast you go 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.110
 to have it easily enough then there 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.780
 will have the art of war kills the enemy 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.400
 from a car then this one there 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.630
 must do it at pressures 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.560
 castle what I mean by pressure 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:57.280
 devote themselves started the game players / 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.570
 / / / standoff and you see when you 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.610
 always start a car at 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.020
 middle and low house level 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.060
 generally he always admitted who 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.880
 go out there it goes up 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.780
 it depends on which side so if you 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.100
 fall on the h side of cross in dominance 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.690
 to climb in the middle in water 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.490
 and then you shot directly at the 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.380
 car usually like I'll you 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.730
 say there is always an enemy or if you 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.840
 are on the other side ben you will see 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.760
 in a gameplay and I did but I 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.530
 I am lying shooting and ibo prechac 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.410
 directly so simple enough to do 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.790
 pretty quickly following rona so he 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.340
 must get five double medals 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.320
 murder done when their bodies try 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.990
 to bypass a maximum the enemies I 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.840
 you recommend it what I have to 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:43.980
 to say other yes try to do it at 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.750
 valuable are rather respect 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.720
 towards this knowing that if you put 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.890
 a vehicle with I believe on it not sure 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.140
 because it did not happen to me but I 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.120
 believe he knows it does not matter 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.940
 excuse my post the little guy that does not 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.280
 not count so try to do it 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.740
 by diverting enemies by trying to 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.140
 go behind their back and that's what makes 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.930
 face is paying attention what are we going to 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.400
 a skull the last challenge let's say so 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.380
 there a little harder you have to destroy a 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.400
 drag and fire must know that one of 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:17.340
 rhenium fire it takes two queries with 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.669
 the smau to beat her 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.380
 do it in simple domination this is where 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.050
 where I found them the simplest and 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.720
 more often we will say knowing that 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.210
 I have a piece of gameplay that I have 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.729
 taken for this tutorial and you have to know that 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.590
 I have your cuzieu that moment over there I 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.169
 take a big chance we'll say 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.630
 and I advise you to do in 2009 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.940
 are simple and you will only need 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.620
 two rockets so try self 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.110
 to have stone donate from one of your classes 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.990
 to retrieve the small bags or 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:52.169
 if you have no looters have fired a 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.320
 missile then a rocket on fire 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:56.669
 suicidal taste like I did in the 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.740
 in the gameplay while I was able to 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.500
 keep my managed by recovering bag 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.290
 so I commit suicide and then you here 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.780
 to recover the very cult wire bador from 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:10.320
 duty where it is and take it with 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.360
 the second complicated enough a month I 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.180
 put I had to put half a day to 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.949
 do it knowing that the enemies in 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.020
 single shot also on 3 yann gaillard 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:21.300
 blonde who can be pretty fast so 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.039
 I wish you good luck so on 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.169
 this is going to go to second part of 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:28.200
 gameplay so let's say as I 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.820
 explained that a marquee there will be 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.200
 the first part where I explain the 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.389
 camouflages is gameplay second part 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.620
 where I show you how it's going 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:36.620
 so right now 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:43.310
 I'm back to show you the 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.960
 second part gameplay and I start 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.749
 directly to a carbon fiber that 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.930
 is to shoot 10 enemies to make 10 

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:52.550
 burial at impact thanks cosmo then 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.560
 as you can see 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.419
 olala gb today good is not bad 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.340
 as you can see I'm going around 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:01.610
 a maximum the enemies I arrive in 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:04.029
 their backs and boom I hold it's from the 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.930
 next way it will be necessary to redo 

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:06.409
 then we will pass the flower of 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.499
 Cherry tree 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:11.419
 you just have to destroy five 

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:12.860
 enemy devices in one part so there 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:15.830
 I was lucky there was a lot of 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.879
 jamming trunk and funny like 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.029
 you can see I'm trying to 

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:22.340
 to commit suicide because I do not have time to 

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:24.919
 recover thanks to third of the saddlebags 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.599
 so every time I killed 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:30.050
 that I have to be accused earlier 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:30.529
 a drone to eybens I suicide is all 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.539
 simply 

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:34.759
 but it's going to be that everybody's 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:36.770
 part as long as you have not recovered 

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:37.939
 small panniers down you are in 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.029
 shit somehow 

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:43.250
 it is better to privilege suicide 

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:45.110
 am directly destroying myself again at 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.789
 our role and it's much simpler 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.080
 then we will move on to the art of 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:48.469
 war that involves shooting a 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.939
 car 

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:52.250
 good I was wrong this is not 

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:55.310
 certainly here in this case it was 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:57.020
 on this alone as you could see 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.589
 I shot directly at the car 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.479
 preachy 

00:06:57.589 --> 00:07:02.930
 yes because it's the right part of 

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:04.939
 so start there garnet camouflage so 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.139
 you have to make five double medals 

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:08.599
 murder as you can see i 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:10.279
 had luck I dismounted we will say 

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:11.750
 in a way to designate there I come 

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:13.610
 in sprint I kill two enemies is good 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.289
 I have blocks including garnet camouflage 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:18.169
 so as you can see you the 

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:20.389
 would have spoon shot bypassing 

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:22.759
 the enemies so here we go to 

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:24.800
 kral camouflage which consists in destroying 

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:27.500
 a shadow worker like you 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.330
 go see a ball require so the 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.789
 first bullet is passed I suicide 

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.800
 the second christmas will pass knowing 

00:07:31.789 --> 00:07:36.759
 that I take a great chance because 

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.719
 an enemy shot me now 

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:41.080
 so there I also spoke a little bit of my 

00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:42.740
 thank you channel for these subscribed 

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.449
 super happy 1 

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.639
 as you could see I changed 

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:48.300
 my background says the least 

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:51.810
 comment please 

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:53.639
 so on this I leave you I tell you 

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:58.220
 good day ears as you want 

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:58.220
 how and then to the next ciao
