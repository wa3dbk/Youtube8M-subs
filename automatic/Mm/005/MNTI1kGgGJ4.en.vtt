00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
to need the size tank you're going to

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.700 
to need the size tank you're going to
need<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:43.160> breathe<00:00:44.300> say<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.690> your<00:00:45.899> tank

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.610 

you're<00:00:49.710> gonna<00:00:49.890> need<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.129> fairly<00:00:50.550> large<00:00:50.760> tank

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
you're gonna need a fairly large tank

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.619 
you're gonna need a fairly large tank
the<00:00:52.620> height<00:00:52.860> should<00:00:53.730> be<00:00:53.940> about<00:00:56.300> height<00:00:57.300> it

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
the height should be about height it

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.170 
the height should be about height it
should<00:00:58.230> be<00:00:58.260> about<00:00:58.969> 30<00:01:00.230> centimeters<00:01:02.059> we're<00:01:03.059> on

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
should be about 30 centimeters we're on

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.630 
should be about 30 centimeters we're on
30<00:01:03.510> would<00:01:03.750> be<00:01:03.899> nice<00:01:04.110> because<00:01:04.830> angelfish<00:01:05.580> a

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
30 would be nice because angelfish a

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.570 
30 would be nice because angelfish a
real<00:01:06.030> tall<00:01:06.810> fish<00:01:07.290> with<00:01:07.590> their<00:01:07.770> big<00:01:07.950> fins<00:01:08.280> and

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
real tall fish with their big fins and

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.039 
real tall fish with their big fins and
you<00:01:09.479> need<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:10.369> let<00:01:11.369> them<00:01:11.640> be<00:01:11.790> able<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.330> move

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
you need to let them be able to move

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.260 
you need to let them be able to move
around<00:01:13.290> without<00:01:14.070> bumping<00:01:14.729> all<00:01:14.909> over<00:01:15.180> the

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
around without bumping all over the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.950 
around without bumping all over the
place<00:01:15.540> they're<00:01:16.439> fairly<00:01:16.740> large<00:01:17.100> fish<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.960> so

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
place they're fairly large fish and so

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.300 
place they're fairly large fish and so
you<00:01:19.020> need<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> fairly<00:01:19.799> large<00:01:19.950> tank<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:21.020> length

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
you need a fairly large tank and length

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:38.630 
you need a fairly large tank and length
should<00:01:23.310> be<00:01:23.369> around<00:01:28.790> round<00:01:29.840> from<00:01:32.090> 42

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.350 

maybe<00:01:40.760> 70<00:01:41.760> would<00:01:42.659> be<00:01:42.840> fine<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.409> between<00:01:43.890> them

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
maybe 70 would be fine in between them

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:55.150 
maybe 70 would be fine in between them
should<00:01:45.360> be<00:01:45.540> fine<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:49.640> width<00:01:50.640> should<00:01:51.110> be<00:01:52.110> about

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:06.950 

what<00:01:56.160> should<00:01:56.460> be<00:01:56.520> about<00:01:57.860> from<00:01:59.570> 25<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:05.960> say

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
what should be about from 25 to say

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.100 
what should be about from 25 to say
about<00:02:07.140> boarding<00:02:09.229> in<00:02:10.229> between<00:02:11.160> there<00:02:12.110> should

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
about boarding in between there should

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.140 
about boarding in between there should
be<00:02:13.260> good<00:02:13.410> for<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.770> width<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.190> so<00:02:14.940> you've<00:02:15.120> got

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
be good for the width and so you've got

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.540 
be good for the width and so you've got
a<00:02:15.360> tank<00:02:15.780> this<00:02:16.110> is<00:02:16.350> a<00:02:16.680> fairly<00:02:17.190> large<00:02:17.550> tank<00:02:18.090> and

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
a tank this is a fairly large tank and

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.770 
a tank this is a fairly large tank and
then<00:02:20.550> once<00:02:20.850> you<00:02:21.000> get<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.269> tank<00:02:21.570> and

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
then once you get the tank and

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.120 
then once you get the tank and
everything<00:02:22.230> you're<00:02:22.380> gonna<00:02:22.500> have<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.769> put<00:02:22.950> some

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
everything you're gonna have to put some

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:32.660 
everything you're gonna have to put some
stuff<00:02:23.370> in<00:02:23.580> it<00:02:24.170> such<00:02:25.170> as<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:26.239> filter<00:02:31.400> hang<00:02:32.400> off

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
stuff in it such as a filter hang off

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.280 
stuff in it such as a filter hang off
spine<00:02:33.650> or<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.820> sponge<00:02:35.820> filter<00:02:36.239> that's<00:02:36.750> good<00:02:36.989> too

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
spine or a sponge filter that's good too

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.910 
spine or a sponge filter that's good too
it's<00:02:37.590> just<00:02:37.680> not<00:02:37.980> as<00:02:38.160> powerful<00:02:38.459> and<00:02:39.530> I<00:02:40.530> don't

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
it's just not as powerful and I don't

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.500 
it's just not as powerful and I don't
know<00:02:41.010> it's<00:02:41.190> just<00:02:41.280> not<00:02:41.400> as<00:02:41.640> good<00:02:41.910> but<00:02:41.940> with<00:02:42.360> the

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
know it's just not as good but with the

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.110 
know it's just not as good but with the
hang<00:02:42.720> off<00:02:42.900> filter<00:02:43.519> you're<00:02:44.519> going<00:02:44.850> to<00:02:45.090> have<00:02:45.299> to

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
hang off filter you're going to have to

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.020 
hang off filter you're going to have to
because<00:02:48.120> this<00:02:48.329> part<00:02:48.600> here<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.260> intake<00:02:50.030> has

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
because this part here the intake has

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.789 
because this part here the intake has
little<00:02:51.450> holes<00:02:51.600> in<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.019> for<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.290> wire<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.680> go

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
little holes in it for the wire you go

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.500 
little holes in it for the wire you go
into<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:54.840> fish<00:02:55.790> if<00:02:56.790> they<00:02:57.000> find<00:02:57.239> a<00:02:57.360> way

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
into and the fish if they find a way

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.750 
into and the fish if they find a way
that<00:02:57.810> they're<00:02:58.470> probably<00:02:58.739> going<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.519> get

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
that they're probably going to get

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.990 
that they're probably going to get
sucked<00:03:00.120> up<00:03:00.390> into<00:03:00.660> your<00:03:00.989> filter<00:03:01.760> because<00:03:02.760> the

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
sucked up into your filter because the

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.569 
sucked up into your filter because the
parents<00:03:03.180> are<00:03:03.510> moving<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:04.500> fry<00:03:04.769> around<00:03:05.160> a

parents are moving the fry around a
whole<00:03:06.120> lot<00:03:06.329> and<00:03:06.630> while<00:03:07.320> they're<00:03:07.530> swimming

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739
