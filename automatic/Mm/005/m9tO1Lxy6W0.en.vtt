pattern<00:00:36.239> from<00:00:36.390> scratch<00:00:36.660> in<00:00:37.020> Photoshop<00:00:37.620> and

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
pattern from scratch in Photoshop and

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.459 
pattern from scratch in Photoshop and
then<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.489> printed<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.239> out<00:00:39.390> onto<00:00:39.960> paper<00:00:40.260> and

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469

then trace that onto the fabric and then

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.200 
then trace that onto the fabric and then
I<00:00:42.540> use<00:00:42.780> puff<00:00:43.110> paint<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.680> make<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.579> webbing<00:00:45.120> on

shell and I made these lenses magnetic

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.000 
shell and I made these lenses magnetic

of<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.090> face<00:01:30.270> shell<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.689> sculpted<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.530> so

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
of the face shell and sculpted it so

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.499 
of the face shell and sculpted it so
that<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:31.950> fits<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.759> know<00:01:32.880> really<00:01:33.180> snug

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
that this fits in you know really snug

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.410 
that this fits in you know really snug
and<00:01:34.020> then<00:01:34.350> it's<00:01:34.829> got<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> places<00:01:36.000> for<00:01:36.299> these

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
and then it's got a places for these

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.859 
and then it's got a places for these
magnets<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.590> just<00:01:38.180> snaps<00:01:39.180> right<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.479> this

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
magnets so it just snaps right in this

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.080 
magnets so it just snaps right in this
is<00:01:39.930> pretty

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
is pretty

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.570 
is pretty
pretty<00:01:42.690> accurate<00:01:42.900> pretty<00:01:43.440> thin<00:01:43.740> because<00:01:44.010> you

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
pretty accurate pretty thin because you

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.190 
pretty accurate pretty thin because you
don't<00:01:44.729> really<00:01:44.880> think<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.420> there's

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
don't really think that there's

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.719 
don't really think that there's
something<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.740> front<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:47.070> your<00:01:47.250> face<00:01:47.460> when

I can't get away with was there one
oh<00:02:06.090> absolutely<00:02:06.570> this<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.290> actually<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.649> really

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
oh absolutely this is actually a really

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.400 
oh absolutely this is actually a really
challenging<00:02:08.009> project<00:02:08.759> for<00:02:08.880> a<00:02:08.910> project<00:02:09.410> the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
challenging project for a project the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.229 
challenging project for a project the
hardest<00:02:10.739> thing<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:11.160> would<00:02:11.340> say<00:02:12.709> probably<00:02:14.239> shoot

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
hardest thing I would say probably shoot

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.970 
hardest thing I would say probably shoot
I'll<00:02:15.480> be<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:15.660> sewing<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.500> sewing<00:02:16.800> was<00:02:16.890> the

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
I'll be the sewing the sewing was the

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.650 
I'll be the sewing the sewing was the
most<00:02:17.160> difficult<00:02:17.310> because<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.180> thing<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:18.420> I

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
most difficult because the thing is I

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.540 
most difficult because the thing is I
based<00:02:18.900> this<00:02:19.080> off<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.560> next<00:02:19.830> movie<00:02:20.220> pattern

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
based this off of the next movie pattern

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.790 
based this off of the next movie pattern
so<00:02:21.000> it's<00:02:21.269> just<00:02:21.480> it's<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.780> crazy<00:02:22.080> pattern<00:02:22.470> it's

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
so it's just it's a crazy pattern it's

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.449 
so it's just it's a crazy pattern it's
like<00:02:22.950> not<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.489> normal<00:02:24.269> pattern<00:02:24.480> for<00:02:25.140> like<00:02:25.290> a

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
like not a normal pattern for like a

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.009 
like not a normal pattern for like a
standard<00:02:26.459> spandex<00:02:27.060> bodysuit<00:02:27.209> at<00:02:27.630> all<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:27.989> I

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
standard spandex bodysuit at all so I

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.259 
standard spandex bodysuit at all so I
had<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.290> kind<00:02:28.769> of<00:02:28.830> go<00:02:28.950> from<00:02:29.040> scratch<00:02:29.400> making<00:02:30.150> it

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
had to kind of go from scratch making it

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.059 
had to kind of go from scratch making it
so<00:02:30.930> that<00:02:31.080> was<00:02:31.200> probably<00:02:31.500> one<00:02:31.709> of<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:31.830> hardest

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
so that was probably one of the hardest

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.350 
so that was probably one of the hardest
parts<00:02:32.250> where<00:02:32.489> I<00:02:32.519> was<00:02:32.640> just<00:02:32.760> like<00:02:32.880> this<00:02:33.030> is<00:02:33.150> so

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
parts where I was just like this is so

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.460 
parts where I was just like this is so
hard<00:02:33.569> I<00:02:33.720> don't<00:02:33.750> know<00:02:33.900> if<00:02:33.989> this<00:02:34.110> is<00:02:34.140> even<00:02:34.380> going

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
hard I don't know if this is even going

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.410 
hard I don't know if this is even going
to<00:02:34.560> work<00:02:34.709> once<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.370> make<00:02:35.550> this<00:02:35.760> suit<00:02:36.030> pattern

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
to work once I make this suit pattern

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.520 
to work once I make this suit pattern
it's<00:02:36.540> just<00:02:36.660> going<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.840> look<00:02:36.930> totally<00:02:37.319> weird

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530
