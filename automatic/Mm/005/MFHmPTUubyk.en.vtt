 international that moves us to alhaurín 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:21.589
 for the vast majority 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:24.909
 Oriental dance is limited to belly dancing 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:27.909
 but the reality is that it is a much more art 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.500
 for more than 50 years it dropped 2 beta for many the antonio gates egyptian has 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.030
 consecrated all his life show the infinite variety of folklore of his 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.230
 country 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.460
 I worked in a company that danced Argentine dances and 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.260
 Spanish with castanets and all that 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.280
 and one day I asked myself why I do Argentine dance instead of my 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.630
 own country 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.280
 both in cinema and in theater riera has been the first of the musical in the world 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.410
 Arab 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.120
 there were no schools so I watched the films of fred astaire hellín de 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.120
 rollers 20 times until we learned steps 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.750
 in my country the dancers had bad reputation to the fundamentalists 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.740
 he still does not like 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.399
 but if you are someone bending down to pick up something from the ground and get up and put on 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:17.159
 music those dances like it or not the human being was born to dance it 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.440
 According to the Spaniards, we have a special gift for oriental dance 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.350
 proof of this is added that since the 90s triumph in Egypt and now is the 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.660
 In charge of presenting us the choreographies of this veteran artist 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.859
 the public 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:33.620
 you can not imagine 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.470
 when we act that we are Spanish because in addition to this company 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.230
 normally it goes up is very typical n in Egypt or in dance shows in the 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.590
 case of the courts 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.500
 and all the girls sing the songs and 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.730
 it's a bit surprising the truth 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.960

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.070
