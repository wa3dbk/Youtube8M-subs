00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:16.690 
diminished and augmented now we're going
to<00:00:15.139> progress<00:00:15.410> to<00:00:15.620> adding<00:00:15.889> a<00:00:15.950> seventh<00:00:16.400> interval

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:16.700

on<00:00:16.939> top<00:00:17.150> of<00:00:17.360> these<00:00:17.509> triads<00:00:17.869> and<00:00:18.140> see<00:00:18.320> what<00:00:18.470> we

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
on top of these triads and see what we

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.350 
on top of these triads and see what we
get<00:00:18.800> and<00:00:19.250> today<00:00:19.610> of<00:00:19.759> course<00:00:19.820> we're<00:00:20.119> starting

get and today of course we're starting

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.170 
get and today of course we're starting
with<00:00:20.509> the<00:00:20.630> major<00:00:20.840> seventh<00:00:21.410> arpeggio<00:00:22.180> the

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
with the major seventh arpeggio the

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.350 
with the major seventh arpeggio the
mechanics<00:00:23.689> are<00:00:23.810> the<00:00:23.989> the<00:00:24.369> the<00:00:25.369> structure<00:00:26.180> of

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:26.360 
mechanics are the the the structure of

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.900 
mechanics are the the the structure of
the<00:00:26.869> tri<00:00:27.140> or<00:00:27.410> the<00:00:27.590> our<00:00:27.890> page<00:00:28.130> is<00:00:28.279> very<00:00:28.520> simple

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
the tri or the our page is very simple

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.519 
the tri or the our page is very simple
it's<00:00:29.149> a<00:00:29.270> major<00:00:29.480> triad<00:00:29.840> so<00:00:30.140> if<00:00:30.200> you<00:00:30.290> remember

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
it's a major triad so if you remember

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.979 
it's a major triad so if you remember
that's<00:00:30.649> a<00:00:30.890> root<00:00:31.250> a<00:00:31.520> major<00:00:32.239> third<00:00:32.570> which<00:00:32.870> I'm

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
that's a root a major third which I'm

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:34.750 
that's a root a major third which I'm
playing<00:00:33.230> here<00:00:33.380> with<00:00:33.469> my<00:00:33.590> index<00:00:33.829> finger<00:00:34.190> and<00:00:34.610> a

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
playing here with my index finger and a

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.430 
playing here with my index finger and a
firm<00:00:34.970> v<00:00:35.240> which<00:00:35.510> I'm<00:00:35.630> playing<00:00:35.840> with<00:00:36.020> my<00:00:36.110> pinkie

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
firm v which I'm playing with my pinkie

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.680 
firm v which I'm playing with my pinkie
now<00:00:37.160> to<00:00:37.220> that<00:00:37.460> we<00:00:37.640> add<00:00:37.820> a<00:00:37.850> major<00:00:38.150> seventh

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
now to that we add a major seventh

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.750 
now to that we add a major seventh
interval<00:00:38.960> which<00:00:39.320> is<00:00:39.350> literally<00:00:40.160> the<00:00:40.370> seventh

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
interval which is literally the seventh

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.760 
interval which is literally the seventh
note<00:00:40.940> of<00:00:41.090> the<00:00:41.150> major<00:00:41.300> scale<00:00:41.450> one<00:00:42.110> two<00:00:42.470> three

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
note of the major scale one two three

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.150 
note of the major scale one two three
four<00:00:43.100> five<00:00:43.400> six<00:00:43.700> seven<00:00:44.380> so<00:00:45.380> now<00:00:45.560> we<00:00:45.620> get<00:00:45.920> this

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
four five six seven so now we get this

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.680 
four five six seven so now we get this
arpeggio<00:00:48.130> so<00:00:49.130> it's<00:00:49.280> a<00:00:49.340> root<00:00:49.640> major<00:00:50.329> third

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
arpeggio so it's a root major third

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.530 
arpeggio so it's a root major third
perfect<00:00:51.410> fifth<00:00:51.620> major<00:00:51.950> seven<00:00:52.460> I<00:00:52.730> think<00:00:53.150> at<00:00:53.420> the

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
perfect fifth major seven I think at the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.810 
perfect fifth major seven I think at the
octave<00:00:53.870> on<00:00:54.020> the<00:00:54.079> octave<00:00:54.560> is<00:00:54.680> is<00:00:55.040> just<00:00:55.550> a<00:00:55.640> half

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
octave on the octave is is just a half

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.310 
octave on the octave is is just a half
step<00:00:55.850> above<00:00:56.239> the<00:00:56.420> major<00:00:56.600> seventh<00:00:57.050> and<00:00:57.170> that's

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
step above the major seventh and that's

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.780 
step above the major seventh and that's
also<00:00:57.680> important<00:00:58.100> though<00:00:58.220> when<00:00:58.700> you're

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
also important though when you're

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.280 
also important though when you're
actually<00:00:58.940> improvising<00:00:59.690> with<00:00:59.720> this<00:00:59.960> arpeggio

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
actually improvising with this arpeggio

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.170 
actually improvising with this arpeggio
if<00:01:00.860> you're<00:01:01.010> playing<00:01:01.160> the<00:01:01.340> root<00:01:01.520> you<00:01:01.910> have<00:01:02.149> a

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
if you're playing the root you have a

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.030 
if you're playing the root you have a
core<00:01:02.510> tone<00:01:02.750> a<00:01:03.020> half-step<00:01:03.470> below<00:01:03.649> the<00:01:03.860> root

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
core tone a half-step below the root

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.039 
core tone a half-step below the root
that's<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:04.399> major<00:01:04.549> seventh<00:01:05.030> below<00:01:05.659> the<00:01:05.869> root

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
that's the major seventh below the root

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:11.620 
that's the major seventh below the root
so<00:01:09.760> now<00:01:10.760> what<00:01:10.909> I<00:01:10.940> would<00:01:11.060> really<00:01:11.300> strongly

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
so now what I would really strongly

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.810 
so now what I would really strongly
encourage<00:01:11.840> you<00:01:12.170> to<00:01:12.290> do<00:01:12.409> is<00:01:12.650> first<00:01:13.640> of<00:01:13.760> all

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
encourage you to do is first of all

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.340 
encourage you to do is first of all
learn<00:01:14.180> the<00:01:14.360> pattern<00:01:14.659> as<00:01:14.780> I've<00:01:14.930> showed<00:01:15.110> it<00:01:15.260> to

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
learn the pattern as I've showed it to

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.860 
learn the pattern as I've showed it to
you<00:01:15.440> and<00:01:16.220> let<00:01:16.820> me<00:01:16.880> give<00:01:17.030> you<00:01:17.120> the<00:01:17.240> notes<00:01:17.479> just

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
you and let me give you the notes just

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.920 
you and let me give you the notes just
if<00:01:18.049> for<00:01:18.530> some<00:01:18.560> reason<00:01:18.950> there's<00:01:19.130> some<00:01:19.930> areas

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
if for some reason there's some areas

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.570 
if for some reason there's some areas
that<00:01:20.960> aren't<00:01:21.260> clear<00:01:21.500> to<00:01:21.650> you<00:01:21.710> but<00:01:22.159> in<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:22.400> c

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
that aren't clear to you but in the c

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.580 
that aren't clear to you but in the c
major<00:01:22.820> seven<00:01:23.060> arpeggio<00:01:23.420> we<00:01:23.720> have<00:01:23.840> a<00:01:23.870> C<00:01:24.170> which

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
major seven arpeggio we have a C which

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.770 
major seven arpeggio we have a C which
is<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:24.860> root<00:01:25.040> the<00:01:25.610> e<00:01:25.640> which<00:01:26.360> is<00:01:26.390> the<00:01:26.600> major

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
is the root the e which is the major

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.230 
is the root the e which is the major
third<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:27.710> G<00:01:27.979> which<00:01:28.430> is<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.610> perfect<00:01:29.060> fifth

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
third the G which is the perfect fifth

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.170 
third the G which is the perfect fifth
and<00:01:29.479> the<00:01:29.900> B<00:01:30.110> which<00:01:30.560> is<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.740> major<00:01:30.979> seventh<00:01:31.490> so

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
and the B which is the major seventh so

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.990 
and the B which is the major seventh so
once<00:01:32.720> you<00:01:32.869> can<00:01:33.049> get<00:01:33.229> that<00:01:33.440> now<00:01:34.000> practice

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
once you can get that now practice

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.730 
once you can get that now practice
moving<00:01:35.240> it<00:01:35.600> to<00:01:35.780> other<00:01:35.930> root<00:01:36.200> swing<00:01:36.500> this

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
moving it to other root swing this

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.410 
moving it to other root swing this
example<00:01:37.100> I'm<00:01:37.310> starting<00:01:37.610> on<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:37.700> D<00:01:38.000> on<00:01:38.299> the

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
example I'm starting on the D on the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.030 
example I'm starting on the D on the
fifth<00:01:38.630> fret<00:01:38.780> but<00:01:39.290> I'm<00:01:39.350> keeping<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:39.770> same

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
fifth fret but I'm keeping the same

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.789 
fifth fret but I'm keeping the same
figuring<00:01:40.670> now<00:01:41.450> I<00:01:41.479> have<00:01:41.659> a<00:01:41.750> D<00:01:41.930> major<00:01:42.170> 7<00:01:42.440> arpeggio

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
figuring now I have a D major 7 arpeggio

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.490 
figuring now I have a D major 7 arpeggio
now<00:01:43.520> if<00:01:43.580> we<00:01:43.670> move<00:01:43.850> it<00:01:44.000> to<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:44.299> E<00:01:44.330> string<00:01:44.780> here's

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
now if we move it to the E string here's

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.010 
now if we move it to the E string here's
the<00:01:45.650> G<00:01:45.860> on<00:01:46.040> the<00:01:46.130> third<00:01:46.369> fret<00:01:46.580> I<00:01:46.820> have<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.720> same

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
the G on the third fret I have the same

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.170 
the G on the third fret I have the same
exact<00:01:48.439> finger<00:01:48.799> e<00:01:48.860> now<00:01:49.010> change<00:01:49.490> my<00:01:49.610> mechanics

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
exact finger e now change my mechanics

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.270 
exact finger e now change my mechanics
at<00:01:50.330> all<00:01:50.479> and<00:01:50.750> I<00:01:50.840> have<00:01:51.049> the<00:01:51.500> major<00:01:51.920> seven

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
at all and I have the major seven

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.940 
at all and I have the major seven
arpeggio<00:01:52.540> so<00:01:53.540> the<00:01:53.630> key<00:01:53.930> point<00:01:54.229> is<00:01:54.380> to<00:01:54.409> plug<00:01:54.740> in

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
arpeggio so the key point is to plug in

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.420 
arpeggio so the key point is to plug in
your<00:01:55.100> bass<00:01:55.820> to<00:01:56.060> an<00:01:56.150> amp<00:01:56.330> and<00:01:56.570> isolate<00:01:57.530> any<00:01:58.189> of

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
your bass to an amp and isolate any of

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.649 
your bass to an amp and isolate any of
the<00:01:58.490> distraction<00:01:58.970> so<00:01:59.090> you<00:01:59.180> can<00:01:59.330> really<00:01:59.450> focus

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
the distraction so you can really focus

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.420 
the distraction so you can really focus
your<00:01:59.900> ear<00:02:00.229> to<00:02:00.409> listening<00:02:00.860> to<00:02:01.009> what<00:02:01.280> you're

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
your ear to listening to what you're

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.330 
your ear to listening to what you're
doing<00:02:01.460> I<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.540> key<00:02:02.780> is<00:02:02.930> to<00:02:03.110> really<00:02:03.259> get<00:02:03.890> the

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
doing I the key is to really get the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.880 
doing I the key is to really get the
salad<00:02:04.880> of<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.090> major<00:02:05.299> seven<00:02:05.659> arpeggio<00:02:05.930> into

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
salad of the major seven arpeggio into

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.759 
salad of the major seven arpeggio into
your<00:02:07.009> mind<00:02:07.250> so<00:02:07.490> you<00:02:07.580> can<00:02:07.640> identify<00:02:08.000> my<00:02:08.509> ear<00:02:08.769> and

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
your mind so you can identify my ear and

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.470 
your mind so you can identify my ear and
by<00:02:09.890> doing<00:02:10.069> that<00:02:10.250> just<00:02:10.369> play<00:02:10.579> them<00:02:10.729> on<00:02:11.150> every

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
by doing that just play them on every

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.970 
by doing that just play them on every
root<00:02:11.689> on<00:02:11.840> your

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
root on your

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.730 
root on your
try<00:02:13.670> to<00:02:13.730> maybe<00:02:13.940> expand<00:02:14.450> and<00:02:14.690> get<00:02:15.230> outside<00:02:15.380> of

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
try to maybe expand and get outside of

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.160 
try to maybe expand and get outside of
the<00:02:15.830> one<00:02:16.010> octave<00:02:16.340> pattern<00:02:16.730> in<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:17.750> very<00:02:17.930> least

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
the one octave pattern in the very least

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.630 
the one octave pattern in the very least
like<00:02:18.380> say<00:02:18.560> if<00:02:18.650> I'm<00:02:18.770> doing<00:02:19.010> G<00:02:19.190> on<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.430> third

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
like say if I'm doing G on the third

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.870 
like say if I'm doing G on the third
fret<00:02:19.820> you'll<00:02:20.300> play<00:02:20.600> here<00:02:21.430> then<00:02:22.430> go<00:02:22.580> up<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:22.730> the

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
fret you'll play here then go up to the

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
G on the tenth fret on the a-string so

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.510 
G on the tenth fret on the a-string so
you<00:02:26.030> can<00:02:26.300> get<00:02:26.540> a<00:02:26.570> little<00:02:26.750> range<00:02:27.380> there<00:02:27.710> now

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
you can get a little range there now

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.430 
you can get a little range there now
what<00:02:29.000> would<00:02:29.090> be<00:02:29.150> ideal<00:02:29.360> and<00:02:29.930> absolutely<00:02:30.350> the

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
let's say tomorrow you decide to do the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.150 
let's say tomorrow you decide to do the
a<00:02:40.850> major<00:02:41.180> 7<00:02:41.570> arpeggio<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:42.590> first<00:02:42.830> thing<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.100> do

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
a major 7 arpeggio the first thing to do

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.280 
a major 7 arpeggio the first thing to do
is<00:02:43.280> figure<00:02:43.520> out<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.880> notes<00:02:44.120> so<00:02:44.570> the<00:02:44.720> a<00:02:44.870> is<00:02:45.140> the

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
is figure out the notes so the a is the

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.160 
is figure out the notes so the a is the
root<00:02:45.440> C<00:02:46.010> sharp<00:02:46.400> is<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:46.970> third<00:02:47.420> major<00:02:47.600> third

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
root C sharp is the third major third

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.680 
root C sharp is the third major third
we<00:02:48.500> got<00:02:48.650> ease<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.880> perfect<00:02:50.209> fifth<00:02:50.390> and

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
we got ease the the perfect fifth and

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.190 
we got ease the the perfect fifth and
we've<00:02:51.110> got<00:02:51.320> G<00:02:51.620> sharp<00:02:51.890> is<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.370> major<00:02:52.550> 7<00:02:53.030> so<00:02:53.240> make

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
we've got G sharp is the major 7 so make

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.800 
we've got G sharp is the major 7 so make
sure<00:02:54.230> you<00:02:54.440> know<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.740> notes<00:02:54.980> then<00:02:55.720> figure<00:02:56.720> out

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
sure you know the notes then figure out

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.800 
sure you know the notes then figure out
how<00:02:57.050> to<00:02:57.110> play<00:02:57.470> them<00:02:57.830> you<00:02:58.790> know<00:02:59.180> outside<00:02:59.630> of

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
how to play them you know outside of

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.890 
how to play them you know outside of
that<00:02:59.900> one<00:03:00.140> on<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.760> restricted<00:03:01.760> box<00:03:02.510> that<00:03:02.810> you

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
that one on the restricted box that you

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.420 
that one on the restricted box that you
know<00:03:03.080> we<00:03:03.260> seem<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.680> find<00:03:03.980> ourselves<00:03:04.070> trapped

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
know we seem to find ourselves trapped

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.280 
know we seem to find ourselves trapped
in<00:03:04.700> and<00:03:04.880> then<00:03:05.390> see<00:03:05.630> if<00:03:05.690> you<00:03:05.780> can<00:03:05.959> move<00:03:06.110> it

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
in and then see if you can move it

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.070 
in and then see if you can move it
through<00:03:06.530> and<00:03:06.680> improvise<00:03:07.130> of<00:03:07.340> it

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.410 

and<00:03:12.650> really<00:03:13.070> then<00:03:13.280> mix<00:03:13.580> some<00:03:13.760> music<00:03:14.120> with<00:03:14.270> it

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
and really then mix some music with it

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.390 
and really then mix some music with it
by<00:03:14.990> taking<00:03:15.200> a<00:03:15.440> different<00:03:15.590> route<00:03:15.860> every<00:03:16.190> day

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
by taking a different route every day

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.850 
by taking a different route every day
you<00:03:17.000> can<00:03:17.150> really<00:03:17.390> focus<00:03:17.870> in<00:03:18.080> and<00:03:18.470> doesn't<00:03:18.739> take

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
you can really focus in and doesn't take

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.820 
you can really focus in and doesn't take
long<00:03:19.040> if<00:03:19.220> you<00:03:19.430> really<00:03:19.850> dedicate<00:03:20.239> five<00:03:20.450> minutes

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
long if you really dedicate five minutes

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.830 
long if you really dedicate five minutes
you<00:03:21.830> know<00:03:21.920> practice<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:23.300> fingering

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
you know practice the the fingering

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.710 
you know practice the the fingering
learn<00:03:24.800> the<00:03:25.040> actual<00:03:25.160> knows<00:03:25.640> and<00:03:26.000> then<00:03:26.269> stretch

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
learn the actual knows and then stretch

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.540 
learn the actual knows and then stretch
that<00:03:26.959> out<00:03:27.019> throughout<00:03:27.470> the<00:03:27.560> bass<00:03:27.890> and<00:03:28.160> you're

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
that out throughout the bass and you're

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.430 
that out throughout the bass and you're
going<00:03:28.670> to<00:03:28.700> be<00:03:28.820> much<00:03:29.120> more<00:03:29.480> capable<00:03:30.140> when

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
going to be much more capable when

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.650
