00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:15.629
 hi to all those 62 flops for a 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.510
 second video on mw3 for a top ten 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.280
 knives to throw then in tenth 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.750
 position after a he in the head 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.000
 I defend the base b by launching 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.619
 knife and it's on the rise 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.330
 ninth position we do not hear it 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.009
 but the base b gets caught I'm 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.220
 returns I do not search I run my 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:34.410
 knife and it's on the rise 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.170
 eighth position on a terminal 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.510
 I am in bad shape my only 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.989
 reflex is to throw my knife etc 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.750
 in the seventh position on 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.780
 bootleg fashion small hillside launched enough 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.440
 simple but at random in sixth 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.379
 position 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.989
 always on bootleg i run my 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.989
 knife again at random but 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.600
 right at the door and often this scope 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.000
 borrowed enough and as you go 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.290
 to be able to see it to the enemy is in 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.050
 same time and that's the timing 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:12.180
 perfect leaders get my knife 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:13.439
 it's once again in the 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.600
 fifth position on the map 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.180
 resistance she aignan the new pole 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.130
 unfortunately unfortunately because of the 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.960
 quality but on slow motion we see it 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.170
 well I run my knife and the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.520
 trajectory is perfect 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:34.140
 he wants to go directly to my enemy 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:39.270
 you will see it really well placed 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.130
 this expensive in pet riem position in 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.520
 affect an enemy was in the 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.100
 building 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.119
 I try my luck I jump and people are 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.130
 rather and this is the infection 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:53.759
 in third position arrives on the top 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.530
 3 half because of my psy it can 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.270
 to say sister in slow motion we'll see I 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.640
 throw my knife really at random he 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.939
 there are only allies on the video is there 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.070
 an enemy will once again point 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.020
 in the wrong place at the wrong time 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.310
 and my knife go directly to 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.410
 planting would be in second position on 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.520
 Bootleg mode I run my knife 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.470
 really peeping 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.300
 again yeah that's really 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.860
 luck 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.700
 it's good it takes the knives of 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:26.660
 throw it's on the knife will go 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.090
 bounce off the ground and then go 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:34.280
 plant on my enemy who was 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.850
 the other side and we come to the first 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.550
 square 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.820
 1 because of maps really beautiful I 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.500
 located in tatters this one took the 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.520
 knife you'll see him go on to 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.440
 above the building 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.380
 then there really you will see I 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:53.060
 see person sincerely he advocates the 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:55.070
 building he'll go bounce for 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.520
 then go kill an enemy who camped 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.780
 behind the building 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.730
