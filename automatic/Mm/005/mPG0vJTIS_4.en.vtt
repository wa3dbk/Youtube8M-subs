00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.240
 no guys this is my sd channel 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.189
 in this lesson we will introduce the attribute and 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.719
 Dieter learn his principles 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.460
 use that surely 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:18.090
 will positively affect your 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:19.859
 relationship with my drove as in 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.710
 last lesson in this we will too 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.080
 mock helicopter highlighted 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.240
 top screw area 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.560
 to go to 3 here's Inter clamp 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.980
 control + a 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.320
 and this is short for attribute also 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:41.760
 go to this panel, you can select it 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:43.950
 side tabs in the attribute and you tore 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.170
 It turns out a lot of special and often 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.000
 specific information about the selected 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.260
 the object 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.870
 object descriptions are divided into topics 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.780
 tabs minimum number of tabs 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.699
 for a normal object 3 itself 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.300
 this part of the object 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.730
 Now I will try to explain the first 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.580
 tab is attributes transform 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.340
 partly duplicates channel box but here 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.470
 There are also all sorts of settings in general 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.170
 form customization tab 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:19.140
 type move scale 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:22.250
 turn to hide you can for example ask 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.250
 limits on these attributes 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.310
 the second tab is the settings itself 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.280
 geometric shape 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.800
 so to speak and physical if so 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.860
 can be expressed properties and third 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.720
 tab is material this tab is for us 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.750
 with you will be most requested on 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.420
 stage modeling and texturing is not 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:50.050
 scare a lot of settings 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.240
 gradually settle down at the bottom of the panel there 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.640
 paragraph for comments that you 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:01.810
 leave for yourself or colleagues at this 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:04.630
 object selected another object 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.720
 we see that now in the attributes of the guitar 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.190
 its possible settings are displayed 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.050
 if you don't want the program 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.180
 automatically go to settings 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.810
 selected object go to menu 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.530
 sheet and uncheck automatic 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.420
 loading attributes of the selected object 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.020
 now even if we select another 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.150
 an object 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.130
 attribute they changed we are still 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.130
 can affect the blade 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.250
 and how then go to the new attribute 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.610
 everything is just a menu sheet there is a line 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.250
 load selected attributes 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.110
 but there is another way to click kontrol 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.239
 plus 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.300
 thereby we switched started box 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:49.360
 and now again control + and what 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.390
 move to the attributes of the guitar and voila we 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.700
 observe the attribute of the selected object 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.260
 now about the location of the panel happens 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.930
 that there is an overwhelming desire 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.230
 see simultaneously edith attribute 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.209
 and ink box there is a solution we take out 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.440
 panel behind the dotted line at the top on 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.720
 open space 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.090
 now the panel is displayed as a separate 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.220
 window and it can be moved to an example 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.670
 On the second monitor well this if you already 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.940
 the pros 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.610
 or bourgeois sang you have played enough 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.519
 now it is necessary to replace twice 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.430
 click on the top of the window panel 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.930
 returned to her native place 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.360
 summarize the attribute of these tr 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.600
 this is a very cool thing main and for one 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.850
 sit down and and not master but if you will 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.790
 watch my lessons and then everything we have 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.930
 get in the next lesson you'll learn 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.819
 how to group objects and how 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.370
 Unscrew ie ask dependence 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.959
 object relative to each other not 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.680
 forget to like for useful 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.750
 information 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.709
 leave comments with questions and 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.230
 offers 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.209
 and if you have not subscribed to the necessary 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.079
 will do now 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.079
 today, bye
