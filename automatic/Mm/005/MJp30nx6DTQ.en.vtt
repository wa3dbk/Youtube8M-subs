00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620
 it's the car hood 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:12.870
 Hi, I 'm coming to bring you my 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:17.789
 four favorite products of the day and 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:22.020
 The night begins to count neither the 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:25.680
 I like to use during the day is that the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.859
 xii early it has sun protection factor 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.269
 15 it is very well dry well taste 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.590
 enough of it 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.380
 so when I'm going to make a makeup 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.930
 For the day I opted for this team 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.300
 Already for the night I prefer to use the time 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.250
 for the party not only here I guess 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.860
 it closes the pores more and leaves the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.899
 skin more smooth as if it were a 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.980
 hairy and it has no protective factor 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.760
 solar 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.730
 He looks at the cold is very dry and for the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.120
 night would be fashion color 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.370
 now for base and option during the day 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.210
 to supply in Mexico and the link of 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.399
 power 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.220
 The danone to it has a powdery effect 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.790
 so I do not need to go over 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.850
 she has a lightweight cover plus copper is 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.340
 base that I'm using without my marking 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.890
 goal that she was going to drive for sure 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.830
 who will choose and for the day is the 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.799
 doctor on the edital link is for the brunette 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.549
 already for the night I use bases of the 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.920
 I'm sorry to hear she's in the excellent base. 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.229
 very suitable for many brides 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.780
 markers use this base for brides 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.340
 because it leaves skin flawless without 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.040
 stay that mask 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.270
 You stay that thing that I touch 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.909
 A lot of makeup is a copper base but 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.399
 at the same time and light is excellent for 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.770
 night for sure use her and she will 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.439
 When I'm done, I'll buy another one. 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.290
 the corrective during the day I like 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.360
 to use the radio tucuruÃ­ with fillet of ars 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.579
 it is a corrective enlightenment that he 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.040
 has a very good coverage 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.009
 his finish is very fine too 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.390
 it lasts a lot is a corrective that I 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.640
 I'm crazy to buy one more color 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.860
 clear why you're scared on the date of 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.099
 my skin and at night I think 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.900
 not 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.120
 during the edurant 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.549
 I like to use a lighter concealer. 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.370
 to give a lighted in the eye area 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:23.680
 but during the day it is he who steps and 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.680
 times are not alone and he's already account 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.110
 Message is very good I even indicate myself 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.670
 I was not going in a hurry , I said no 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.879
 I 'm going to buy I will not buy 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.709
 I went to a sephora shop I tried 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.260
 I was already a lot of concealer in 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.939
 home but they could not bring it 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.230
 very good month 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:43.420
 if you are looking for a concealer 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.890
 to invest with this for sure you 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.769
 you will not regret it 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.040
 already at night use the prolongation of the 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:55.030
 nec it's a lighter tone who is he 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.159
 It covers not so well but it lasts a lot 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.319
 he can train and I am of his people a 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:01.750
 party when the people in jail will be there. 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.840
 there and if you want a bigger coverage 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.790
 wave apply two layers of concealer 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.319
 At night my favorite has been another 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.950
 work 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:14.139
 now the dust during the advertisement can that 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.599
 basis it is in fact the port does not 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:19.930
 I need but if I were to choose a powder 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.819
 I chose the one from Nars very thin as well 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.769
 that is not the focus will be 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:27.040
 a lot of coverage he was kind of traumatic 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:29.169
 getting your skin assures you this afternoon more 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.349
 cover it does not cover much not for good 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:34.120
 even thin and often even to 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.370
 night when I want coverage so 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.949
 heavy just to give a modified one 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.290
 on the fur most night I chose to bring 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:44.949
 another option for you who beat up 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.079
 and I'm glad the base is powdered. 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:49.599
 give coverage will cover the 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:52.120
 more in your makeup but it's great 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.739
 also can measure the amount 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.690
 you put on your putting a thing 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.729
 But then you'll do more in the net. 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.709
 played if you want to put a 

00:03:57.729 --> 00:04:02.889
 heavier coverage you can 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:05.199
 deposited on the face after failing is a 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:07.870
 cover powder then let's say 

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:09.250
 so it is also a very good option that 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.409
 It gives you to do that skin 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.199
 benevolence nothing but it's not a 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:15.970
 thing but it's just know how to dosar the fans more 

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:18.880
 productive for day and night 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:22.289
 I really hope you liked it. 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.289
 A kiss, bye.
