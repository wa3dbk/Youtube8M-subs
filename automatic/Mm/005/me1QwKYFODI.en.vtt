00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
section of the roof right open so we can

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.169 
section of the roof right open so we can
get<00:00:08.010> to<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.250> metal<00:00:08.519> part<00:00:08.730> of<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:08.910> ladder<00:00:09.090> and

through area you have to cut a couple of
times<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.880> couple<00:00:15.410> of<00:00:16.410> times

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.990 

here<00:00:21.130> we<00:00:21.220> go<00:00:22.860> look<00:00:23.860> at<00:00:23.950> that<00:00:24.100> is<00:00:24.520> the<00:00:24.760> bracket

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
here we go look at that is the bracket

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.859 
here we go look at that is the bracket
that<00:00:25.390> wasn't<00:00:26.320> even<00:00:26.410> screwed<00:00:26.800> down<00:00:27.040> oh<00:00:27.760> I<00:00:28.750> got

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
that wasn't even screwed down oh I got

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:35.490 
that wasn't even screwed down oh I got
some<00:00:29.080> oh<00:00:29.640> okay<00:00:33.090> all<00:00:34.090> right<00:00:34.360> without<00:00:35.050> brackets

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
some oh okay all right without brackets

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.740 
some oh okay all right without brackets
out<00:00:35.980> there's<00:00:36.400> nothing<00:00:36.850> penetrating<00:00:37.420> the<00:00:37.510> roof

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
out there's nothing penetrating the roof

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.360 
out there's nothing penetrating the roof
and<00:00:38.050> now<00:00:38.500> we're<00:00:38.680> going<00:00:38.770> to<00:00:38.860> patch<00:00:39.070> the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
and now we're going to patch the

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.450 
and now we're going to patch the
substrate<00:00:40.530> typically<00:00:41.530> under<00:00:41.800> a<00:00:41.830> rubber<00:00:42.190> roof

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
substrate typically under a rubber roof

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.100 
substrate typically under a rubber roof
you<00:00:42.640> find<00:00:42.910> this<00:00:43.030> substrate<00:00:43.600> right<00:00:43.780> here

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
you find this substrate right here

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.720 
you find this substrate right here
what's<00:00:44.410> that<00:00:44.530> made<00:00:44.680> out<00:00:44.710> of<00:00:44.980> well<00:00:45.489> here's<00:00:45.670> a

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
what's that made out of well here's a

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.250 
what's that made out of well here's a
piece<00:00:45.910> right<00:00:46.090> here<00:00:46.150> it's<00:00:46.540> actually<00:00:46.720> a<00:00:46.960> high

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
piece right here it's actually a high

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.860 
piece right here it's actually a high
density<00:00:47.650> fiberboard<00:00:48.520> and<00:00:49.059> when<00:00:49.629> it<00:00:49.750> goes

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
density fiberboard and when it goes

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.540 
density fiberboard and when it goes
under<00:00:50.080> the<00:00:50.170> rubber<00:00:50.379> roof<00:00:50.680> it's<00:00:50.980> designed<00:00:51.370> to

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
under the rubber roof it's designed to

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.100 
under the rubber roof it's designed to
give<00:00:51.699> the<00:00:51.730> rubber<00:00:52.090> some<00:00:52.360> give<00:00:52.660> in<00:00:52.930> case<00:00:53.079> a

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
give the rubber some give in case a

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.990 
give the rubber some give in case a
branch<00:00:53.530> or<00:00:53.739> something<00:00:53.770> should<00:00:54.340> fall<00:00:54.610> on<00:00:54.850> it

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
branch or something should fall on it

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.600 
branch or something should fall on it
and<00:00:55.150> it's<00:00:55.690> held<00:00:55.930> down<00:00:56.020> with<00:00:56.440> these<00:00:56.590> screws<00:00:57.280> and

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
and it's held down with these screws and

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.910 
and it's held down with these screws and
washers<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.989> first<00:00:59.230> thing<00:00:59.380> we<00:00:59.470> want<00:00:59.649> to<00:00:59.680> do<00:00:59.800> is

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
washers the first thing we want to do is

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.770 
washers the first thing we want to do is
remove<00:01:00.220> the<00:01:00.280> two<00:01:00.670> screws<00:01:01.060> and<00:01:01.210> washers<00:01:01.420> here

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
remove the two screws and washers here

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:10.820 
remove the two screws and washers here
so<00:01:01.989> we<00:01:02.110> can<00:01:02.230> cut<00:01:02.380> out<00:01:02.500> this<00:01:02.680> damaged<00:01:03.100> piece

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.609 

okay<00:01:11.860> now<00:01:12.490> clean<00:01:13.000> that<00:01:13.270> all<00:01:13.509> out<00:01:16.050> okay<00:01:17.050> now<00:01:17.380> let

piece of substrate on top of another
piece<00:01:34.330> of<00:01:34.360> substrate<00:01:34.929> so<00:01:35.170> I<00:01:35.200> don't<00:01:35.590> cut

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:36.069 
piece of substrate so I don't cut

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:38.249 
piece of substrate so I don't cut

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
piece of rubber roof that I bought at a

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.559 
piece of rubber roof that I bought at a
roofing<00:02:00.929> and<00:02:01.110> siding<00:02:01.380> supply<00:02:02.009> yard<00:02:02.429> now<00:02:03.329> I'm

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
roofing and siding supply yard now I'm

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:05.569 
roofing and siding supply yard now I'm
going<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.929> patch<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.530> roof<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.039> cover<00:02:05.369> the

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
going to patch the roof and cover the

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.210 
going to patch the roof and cover the
substrate<00:02:06.119> with<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.899> rubber<00:02:07.140> but<00:02:07.979> if<00:02:08.069> you

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
substrate with the rubber but if you

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.039 
substrate with the rubber but if you
notice<00:02:08.640> there's<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:08.970> little<00:02:09.269> depression<00:02:09.660> right

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.049 
notice there's a little depression right

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:12.740 
notice there's a little depression right
there<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:11.129> fill<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.730> depression<00:02:12.209> I'm<00:02:12.540> going

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750
