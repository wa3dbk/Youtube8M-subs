 what happens if not 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.490
 to see why not inside 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.470
 I do not weigh the armor to find out the other 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.030
 works 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.920
 now 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.220

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.220
 jail 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.070
 I've still got the two birds 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.079
 me neither 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.129
 to see if it enters 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.390
 to give iron 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.910
 like among people like 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.180

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.100
 as you are I am undefeated of three and 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.150
 I'm here back playing projecting 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.590
 is what I am capturing the or is called 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.460
 this capture the wool and well 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.890
 both external to tell you that I am 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.560
 pretty bad I do not have much 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.380
 experience to project what is 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.700
 refers that is to say to pvp and others yes 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.740
 but as a rescue project is 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.810
 Well, the truth is that I'm not failing 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.280
 little I just lost and a lot of a 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.410
 heap of wood, but he has lost 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.940
 wood is I do not know anything 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.550
 I know what I'm doing now now I'm going to 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.660
 make armor what is said is not that 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:42.090
 very good and so therefore what 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.250
 pretend to do in this series is to learn 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.540
 to play with your comments that 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.130
 some of you because you already know how to play 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.590
 pretty good to see orange portal vale 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.079
 ok here we have to leave the yellow 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.280
 so we have to go for the 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.329
 enemies 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.780
 there is the pink of what color I am red 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.880
 so we should go towards there vale 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.039
 well that's the goal of this series 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.950
 is to learn to play to project is 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.260
 because the truth is that I'm not super 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.959
 well the truth that makes me a lot 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.209
 illusion then learn to play this mode 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.860
 of the server game that says because it is 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.860
 can not go gray 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.359
 because I can not enter my own 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:29.370
 friend, I really want to learn 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:31.109
 to play because they also gave me in range 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.159
 youtuber thanks to some subscribers already 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:37.650
 I said it on twitter ugly and because that had 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:39.780
 quite after I do not know how to take advantage of it 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.569
 a little too and see what little things 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.489
 I can do ok let's let those 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:49.409
 xl that you get it right you wanted it 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:51.480
 lessons what was the water that arrow was 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:54.659
 just bring it all in here 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.970
 around here it's worth it does not take in fact 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:03:00.090
 phago the date before going to another 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.889
 another world another world is worth as well as not 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.769
 It is the main objective of this series 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:06.629
 I hope that it will not be that difficult either 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.859
 I know I have hopes in the game some 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:11.609
 losses already that is more or less what 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:13.769
 basic I know him but still so 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:15.269
 I do not know enough little things 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:21.010
 game because I played more it has been 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:23.560
 same as that of capturing the wool and 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.930
 the normal team duel is that 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.439
 we have to go what happens that I did not know 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.439
 yes 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.490
 these these bows have 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.260
 hey but how did he push me so much 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.330
 his arch is worth I think that of my equipment 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.760
 they are sleeping on their laurels because 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.070
 this can not be we have removed one 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.890
 nanny the wool 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:53.350
 the lila wool now I'm not very sure 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.000
 but I think so and you have to do something 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.370
 we have to turn the game we are going 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.610
 to distribute distribute love here to butt 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.600
 have a second this I propose is valid and 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.730
 let's go for him 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.890
 so it appeared towards what I do not know why 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.890
 they give you a lot of months of searching 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.570
 already done are extra blocks but they have 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.510
 to go in months of songs no longer 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:16.480
 can do something more normal ok I think 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.760
 that the lute has not been stolen 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.270
 the wool so what we should do is 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.460
 go for your wool that I do not know if I have to 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.460
 go towards and I guess if it's not yet 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:32.910
 for all the surprises that I did not have 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.910
 idea of what it is 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.260
 or not 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.390
 and from what I see many people what 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:56.090
 uses are the blocks to be placed 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.090
 let's say them below their 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:02.900
 and is that if I want to know discussion to 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:07.040
 Sometimes it's worth it 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.040
 it happens to run to the cage 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.460
 / vÃ­ctor cent of these is something is something 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:24.290
 it could not be that he was about to 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:27.470
 save the game by coming here what 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:29.270
 I do not know what they talked about. 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.460
 I have to learn because the 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.590
 truth is that it is not old yet for 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.430
 divide this server and it does not tell us 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:39.590
 very by the hand is more I started yesterday to 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.480
 play on it and the truth is that they are 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.930
 flying and that's why I wanted to throw a 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:52.940
 little more d 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:52.940
 of trigger and I hope so
