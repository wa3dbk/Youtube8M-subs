00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:09.519
 underwear wards crossed for two of and all 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.900
 hello with you madred, give me another 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:14.349
 girlfriend on my 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:20.700
 nor strangely needs a channel and since 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:20.700
 I have problems finding p. 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.960
 pho p to 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.110
 dumb google search 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.420
 I decide to tell about the old gods given 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.300
 ago the great Knicks have gone before me but 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.070
 still drove and the first game on the line 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.710
 extreme road trip 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.020
 the board he is nowhere easier to play all two 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.300
 keys on whom forward and tilt back 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.270
 principle, this is the whole point and 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.940
 mountains you need to stand on wheels but 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.520
 if everything was so simple you have 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.710
 a certain supply of gasoline he spends with 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.900
 time for the tricks you get boiled 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.570
 nitrogen which when stopping waste gasoline 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.100
 for a while if it seems to you 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.170
 play funny 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.170
 there is also a choice in the game 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.540
 car from bus to motorcycle and 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.210
 You can buy a market for real 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.680
 money that by the way is quite justified so 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.680
 as the game is free 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.150
 second game dedicated to the knights no no 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.900
 not those who are less likely to each other in war 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.150
 and those that are catchy number of 2 wind-up 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.080
 knight you have to play for the clockwork 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.030
 soldier 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.670
 avoiding various obstacles 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.070
 the game is framed in medieval style and 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.040
 This style looks enough and 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.260
 well enough along the way we collect 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.330
 coins which we spend on the purchase of things 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.360
 for the character along the way we will 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.820
 meet different cocks necklaces and would 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.770
 obscure fences and on or just those 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.420
 places where it is necessary to make the shallows and 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.420
 the mountain is absolutely free 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.750
 And finally, what you have to 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:13.120
 remember scary dreams that you can 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.220
 call the younger brother and i wanna be the 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.770
 guy mega night 2 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.620
 this is a platformer with 8 bit graphics 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.200
 but the graphics in the game are far from important 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.650
 the main thing and the difficulty on the way you will be 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.330
 come across covalent balls fall through 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.640
 essay paul some kind of bullshit which 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.860
 time it is necessary to sensors all this literally 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.790
 will humiliate you regularly for 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.530
 throughout the game the game is very addictive and when 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.269
 you pass the level until the end comes 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.760
 an unprecedented sense of pride 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.220
 migraines for the store just as well 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:50.940
 the coins themselves the game costs 80 rubles but 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.940
 there is also a free version 5 elastic
