00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
this looks like the exact same face of a

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.990 
this looks like the exact same face of a
giant<00:02:12.900> man<00:02:13.200> right<00:02:13.440> here<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:14.340> it's<00:02:14.550> like<00:02:14.790> got

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
giant man right here and it's like got

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.820 
giant man right here and it's like got
the<00:02:15.120> angry<00:02:15.480> teeth<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:15.870> everything<00:02:16.200> but<00:02:16.650> these

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
the angry teeth and everything but these

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.590 
the angry teeth and everything but these
are<00:02:17.040> read<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.430> out<00:02:17.550> eyes<00:02:17.820> and<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.270> eyes<00:02:18.390> are

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
are read it out eyes and the eyes are

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.470 
are read it out eyes and the eyes are
different<00:02:18.900> there<00:02:19.080> so<00:02:19.680> that<00:02:20.010> looks<00:02:20.610> almost<00:02:21.000> the

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
different there so that looks almost the

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.420 
different there so that looks almost the
exact<00:02:21.720> same<00:02:21.900> design<00:02:22.110> but<00:02:22.470> it's<00:02:22.980> not<00:02:23.160> him

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
exact same design but it's not him

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.680 
exact same design but it's not him
because<00:02:24.210> that<00:02:24.630> would<00:02:25.410> be<00:02:26.060> not<00:02:27.060> enough<00:02:27.450> that

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
because that would be not enough that

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.330 
because that would be not enough that
you<00:02:27.750> got<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:28.020> change<00:02:28.260> it<00:02:28.410> slightly<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:29.130> of

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
you got to change it slightly and of

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.420 
you got to change it slightly and of
course<00:02:29.550> there<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:30.210> number<00:02:30.390> 94<00:02:31.400> daredevil

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
course there it is number 94 daredevil

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.750 
course there it is number 94 daredevil
so<00:02:32.910> it<00:02:33.030> looks<00:02:33.270> almost<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.930> same<00:02:34.050> as<00:02:34.710> where<00:02:35.640> to

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
so it looks almost the same as where to

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.990 
so it looks almost the same as where to
go<00:02:35.880> again<00:02:36.560> giant<00:02:37.560> man<00:02:37.770> look<00:02:38.280> at<00:02:38.340> that<00:02:38.400> like
