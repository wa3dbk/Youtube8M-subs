00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.930 
so we're gonna start with the world
population<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.360> from<00:02:06.570> 2000<00:02:07.289> to<00:02:07.680> 2010<00:02:08.610> I

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
population so the from 2000 to 2010 I

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.750 
population so the from 2000 to 2010 I
want<00:02:09.360> an<00:02:09.450> estimate<00:02:10.019> of<00:02:10.170> how<00:02:10.259> many<00:02:10.760> billion

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760

people have we increased by anybody
anybody<00:02:13.950> but<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.280> microRNA<00:02:14.760> see<00:02:15.140> somebody<00:02:16.140> do

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
anybody but a microRNA see somebody do

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.100 
anybody but a microRNA see somebody do
this<00:02:16.470> r3<00:02:16.920> does<00:02:17.459> way<00:02:18.180> more<00:02:18.209> it's<00:02:18.720> actually<00:02:18.989> just

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
this r3 does way more it's actually just

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.860 
this r3 does way more it's actually just
point<00:02:19.350> seven<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.940> United<00:02:24.299> States<00:02:24.600> that's

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
point seven the United States that's

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:44.180 
point seven the United States that's
equivalent<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.590> Europe<00:02:42.470> so<00:02:43.470> within<00:02:43.980> six
