00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
we thought of thought we only ran once

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.000 
we thought of thought we only ran once
last<00:00:20.939> season<00:00:21.330> one<00:00:21.900> very<00:00:22.170> easy<00:00:22.350> very<00:00:22.590> quietly

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
last season one very easy very quietly

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.560 
last season one very easy very quietly
and<00:00:23.100> during<00:00:23.699> chuckling<00:00:23.970> we<00:00:24.029> got<00:00:24.180> Huntington

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
and during chuckling we got Huntington

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.759 
and during chuckling we got Huntington
and<00:00:24.779> we've<00:00:24.960> always<00:00:25.109> thought<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.470> world<00:00:25.650> of

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
and we've always thought the world of

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.580 
and we've always thought the world of
him<00:00:26.359> done<00:00:27.359> nothing<00:00:27.480> wrong<00:00:27.779> this<00:00:27.990> year<00:00:28.199> yes<00:00:28.470> he

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
him done nothing wrong this year yes he

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.560 
him done nothing wrong this year yes he
got<00:00:28.769> lost<00:00:29.099> his<00:00:29.220> undefeated<00:00:29.519> tag<00:00:29.970> in<00:00:30.420> the

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
got lost his undefeated tag in the

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.240 
got lost his undefeated tag in the
tolworth<00:00:31.019> but<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.349> think<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.650> form<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.130> as

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
tolworth but that think that form is as

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.220 
tolworth but that think that form is as
strong<00:00:32.460> as<00:00:32.520> any<00:00:32.759> race<00:00:33.000> any<00:00:33.600> novice<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.079> this

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
strong as any race any novice in this

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.130 
strong as any race any novice in this
country<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.739> year<00:00:35.270> and<00:00:36.270> therefore<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:36.870> think

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
country this year and therefore I think

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.350 
country this year and therefore I think
of<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.290> market<00:00:37.590> 139<00:00:38.100> he's<00:00:38.370> very<00:00:38.940> well<00:00:39.120> equipped

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
of a market 139 he's very well equipped

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.090

ride him I think he likes the horse I
hope<00:01:01.590> he<00:01:01.890> likes<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.190> horse<00:01:02.340> if<00:01:02.550> he<00:01:02.609> doesn't

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
hope he likes the horse if he doesn't

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.789 
hope he likes the horse if he doesn't
like<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.059> horse<00:01:03.239> well<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:04.110> know<00:01:04.260> if<00:01:04.559> he's<00:01:04.650> not

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
like the horse well you know if he's not

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.500 
like the horse well you know if he's not
riding<00:01:05.010> him<00:01:05.220> then<00:01:05.339> as<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.060> worry<00:01:06.299> we're<00:01:06.479> not

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
riding him then as a worry we're not

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.000 
riding him then as a worry we're not
quite<00:01:06.750> as<00:01:06.869> accurate<00:01:07.020> as<00:01:07.200> we<00:01:07.290> thought<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.770> think

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
quite as accurate as we thought I think

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.200 
quite as accurate as we thought I think
he'll<00:01:08.159> want<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.430> ride<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.670> horse<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.030> think

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
he'll want to ride the horse and I think

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.640 
he'll want to ride the horse and I think
he<00:01:09.270> therefore<00:01:09.479> he<00:01:09.630> might<00:01:09.810> go<00:01:09.930> coral<00:01:10.260> cup<00:01:10.409> and

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
he therefore he might go coral cup and

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.770 
he therefore he might go coral cup and
two<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.400> his<00:01:11.520> wins<00:01:11.729> have<00:01:11.909> been<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.420> heavy

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
as jumping settled a bit better you're

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.629 
as jumping settled a bit better you're
just<00:02:35.079> teaching<00:02:35.290> him<00:02:35.560> it's<00:02:36.280> been<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.459> lot<00:02:36.579> of

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379 
so I think yeah I think I think the

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.199 
so I think yeah I think I think the
three-mile<00:03:32.739> will<00:03:32.889> be<00:03:33.010> massive<00:03:33.549> help<00:03:33.939> for<00:03:34.090> him

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.839 
three-mile will be massive help for him
but<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:34.989> four-time<00:03:35.530> at<00:03:35.739> is<00:03:36.010> landed<00:03:36.579> might

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
but the four-time at is landed might

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:38.159 
but the four-time at is landed might
well<00:03:37.150> have<00:03:37.180> been<00:03:37.359> getting<00:03:37.599> the<00:03:37.689> better<00:03:37.840> of<00:03:37.930> the

more<00:03:53.590> year<00:03:53.799> yet<00:03:54.009> his<00:03:54.129> last<00:03:54.370> one<00:03:54.579> was<00:03:54.699> a<00:03:54.729> bit

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
more year yet his last one was a bit

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.089 
more year yet his last one was a bit
disappointing<00:03:55.419> but<00:03:55.569> that<00:03:55.750> was<00:03:55.870> I<00:03:56.049> think<00:03:56.109> he

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
disappointing but that was I think he

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:58.830 
disappointing but that was I think he
needed<00:03:57.310> that<00:03:57.549> rate<00:03:57.759> he<00:03:57.939> hadn't<00:03:58.209> only<00:03:58.449> work<00:03:58.659> he

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
needed that rate he hadn't only work he

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.879 
needed that rate he hadn't only work he
was<00:03:58.930> just<00:03:59.079> too<00:03:59.229> fresh<00:03:59.909> and<00:04:00.909> I<00:04:01.739> like<00:04:02.739> to<00:04:02.829> think

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
was just too fresh and I like to think

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:04.490 
was just too fresh and I like to think
he<00:04:03.009> can<00:04:03.099> continue<00:04:03.310> his<00:04:03.519> upward<00:04:03.759> curve<00:04:03.909> yes<00:04:04.180> and

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
he can continue his upward curve yes and

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.710 
he can continue his upward curve yes and
he'll<00:04:05.500> go<00:04:05.650> for<00:04:05.889> the<00:04:05.919> three<00:04:06.519> mile<00:04:06.699> on<00:04:06.849> the<00:04:07.180> JLT

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
he'll go for the three mile on the JLT

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.499 
he'll go for the three mile on the JLT
and<00:04:07.930> of<00:04:08.859> your<00:04:09.159> team<00:04:09.669> going<00:04:09.970> forward<00:04:10.090> this<00:04:10.449> year

yet<00:04:17.560> so<00:04:17.729> I'm<00:04:18.729> pendra<00:04:19.570> must<00:04:19.750> be<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:19.989> one<00:04:20.079> that

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
yet so I'm pendra must be the one that

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.690 
yet so I'm pendra must be the one that
stands<00:04:20.529> out<00:04:20.709> you<00:04:20.979> know<00:04:21.099> he's<00:04:21.279> the<00:04:21.370> one<00:04:21.519> I<00:04:21.549> think

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
stands out you know he's the one I think

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.080 
stands out you know he's the one I think
is<00:04:21.849> just

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
is just

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.370 
is just
forms<00:04:22.300> been<00:04:22.480> franked<00:04:22.840> everywhere<00:04:23.199> and<00:04:23.350> I

forms been franked everywhere and I

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.180 
forms been franked everywhere and I
think<00:04:23.560> it<00:04:23.620> could<00:04:23.740> be<00:04:23.800> ahead<00:04:23.889> of<00:04:23.980> the<00:04:24.040> hand

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
think it could be ahead of the hand

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:32.220 
think it could be ahead of the hand
together
