00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 yes 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.290
 hello everyone and welcome a week 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.240
 more and thanks to the collaboration of 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.620
 cooler master we have the opportunity to 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.990
 analyze one of your last 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.440
 liquid refrigerations in this case it 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.180
 it's about the 62 120 xl it's definitely about 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.280
 of a great product with a great 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.770
 dissipation capacity that we have the 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.590
 opportunity to show you through 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.930
 of this review with manufacturers like 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.239
 course air and tech or thermal t that in the 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.610
 market with the master also wants a 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.649
 part in this segment is undoubtedly 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.569
 they go in the right direction and that with 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.179
 these are shown as one 

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:44.679
 alternative to other brands aspects 

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:47.050
 as the compatibility with the touches 

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:48.429
 most current market or the quality of 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.409
 the materials used for their 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:52.449
 construction make it a 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.519
 sensational product and that we will have to 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.139
 keep in mind when buying a 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:57.760
 cooling solution for our 

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:59.800
 team 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.149
 Among its features stand out 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.519
 Aspects such as the inclusion of two 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.369
 120 mm fans that 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.720
 they can rotate between 600 and 2400 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.210
 revolutions per minute 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.149
 generating a noise level among the 19 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.070
 and the 40 decibels plus its pump 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:17.200
 has an estimated duration of about 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.030
 60,000 hours what along with its level 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.100
 of loudness below 25 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.009
 decibels will get our equipment 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.659
 lower your noise level and these are the 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.680
 complete specifications that we 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.680
 facilitates the manufacturer 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.140
 with respect to the testing environment and with 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:38.240
 the purpose of doing it the most objective 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.399
 possible we have used as a reference 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.679
 part of the components that one assembles 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.780
 of the equipment in our catalog is 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.250
 it's about the twister module that you 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.789
 we will leave a link in the description 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.789
 of the video 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.640
 for these tests have not been made 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.259
 no kind of see cloud last the 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.909
 thermal paste that has been used in both 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.039
 cases is what is included with the 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.659
 cooling cooler master and before 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.460
 to move on to the results obtained in 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.369
 the tests this is the software that has been 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:10.810
 used among this are found 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:13.720
 applications like occc burning test and 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.519
 prime 95 to measure the values ​​of the 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.769
 temperatures hardware has been used 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.360
 monitor and these are the results 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.519
 final we have obtained in the 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.980
 different tests starting with the 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.450
 temperatures at rest there is no doubt 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.580
 that we will notice a substantial difference 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.010
 which will also result in a lower 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.360
 noise level especially due to the 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.000
 low rotation of the fans that 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.190
 incorporate that yes they should be regulated 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.959
 manually on the other hand and with respect 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.970
 the stress tests to which it has 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.590
 submitted to this configuration does not fit 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.750
 doubt that the fact of having the 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.580
 side on has tempered the temperatures to 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.709
 a high level of work what we 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.000
 will allow you to be more secure and obtain a 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.160
 better performance of our team 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.630
 cooler master has made a strong 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.579
 bet on the introduction in a 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.040
 segment of the market in which brands 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:59.890
 as before thermaltake or core side 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.079
 they have an important presence yet 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.390
 the results have been satisfactory and 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:07.689
 are shown as an alternative to the 80's 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.920
 corsair or 900 20 antec aspects 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.810
 as the inclusion of thermal paste 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.909
 applicable through an additional tube 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.739
 and not pre-applied as the case is 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.379
 competitors the quality of the 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.950
 materials used in manufacturing 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.049
 especially the wiring of the 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.150
 fans ease in assembly 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.519
 or the inclusion of a back play for md 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.379
 they make it stand out and they show up like 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.900
 outstanding features of the product 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.849
 In any case, details such as noise 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.049
 or from your fans the material 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.060
 Corrugated for pipes 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.579
 cooling or not regulating the speed 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.200
 of ventilation are automatically 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.000
 details that the guys from cv the master 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.700
 they should be polishing in future versions 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.540
 of these products and this has been all 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.159
 for this review 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.290
