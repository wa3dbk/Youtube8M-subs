00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.960
 today we have a new 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.370
 mercedes s tax class a lot of 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.040
 things to say about it and we're going 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.340
 see together the young navy let me 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.170
 to guess 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.779
 I will not be a trick to see the night 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:31.590
 by chance exactly that goes very fast there 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:32.550
 where did I make it to English good 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.989
 so how do we walk imagine that 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.260
 it's paris who exactly did you 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.920
 several 3- way cameras with a vision 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.329
 infrared 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.860
 so that's the particularity of the 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.410
 thing because most of the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.809
 competition has those of this 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.030
 bmc night vision system 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.620
 this audi a8 what exactly except that 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.489
 that's with an opening more 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.350
 sensitive to light 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.730
 the camera here you have a system 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.270
 infrared that coupled to the camera 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.600
 okay so for that it takes one thing 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.270
 imperative it takes the night no but 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.750
 vital baba 8 yeah that's it the click is 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.880
 what are we going to wait for is the night 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.830
 exactly it's the magic of the cinema of 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.780
 unemployed gorn hollywood hollywood 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.240
 then we will be able to fully appreciate 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.710
 the nahd young life for that I'll tell you 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.740
 proposes to discover the experience in 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.939
 two times agree the system is supposed 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.710
 recognize the pedestrians the hinds the 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.840
 tarpaulins the little horses or not the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.670
 big horses agree no then we no 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.619
 of all that we have a low pedestrian 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.299
 behind and there are beautiful days and 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.790
 that was good enough to lend itself to 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.659
 experience 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.600
 currently there are a few of the three 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.860
 lanes a mixture of the three and so we're going 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.299
 compounds that happens in two stages 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.040
 the first one is to say that we will 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.049
 ask to hide in the forest at 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.850
 bottom of the woods here and we will spend more 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.670
 late to see how much he has harvested no 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.240
 and we're going to go for the first time 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.979
 without the young navy and the second time 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.689
 it will always be in the same place and we 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.030
 will trigger the system and we will see 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.500
 if their authors 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.030
 you understand you're fleeing here yeah 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.960
 go we go we go you see the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.659
 thick headed 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.179
 well here we are going to leave you behind 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.870
 the tree you see you're going to put yourself 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.459
 behind the tree comes behind and we go 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.930
 to make two passages of agreement the year 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.290
 arthur researchers they abandoned me 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.280
 on a road and I'm going to hide myself I 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.220
 see if he can find me 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.040
 I am all in black there is this 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:31.350
 what we do best for you walk the 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.209
 normally night google favor 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.319
 here we are in normal conditions 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.610
 use of agreement as a 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.060
 lambda driver on a departmental 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.519
 the night we remember we'll see if at 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.930
 the naked eye while driving normally one 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.440
 happens to have our accomplice who located 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.010
 at the door 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.900
 okay so let's go 60 km 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.140
 in point on a departmental 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.760
 here is the milestone, good voila here it is 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.190
 abandoning the voice I do not see and said 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.780
 he says he does not see and says he was 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.610
 not seen it's convincing it's dangerous 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.380
 we did not see the agreement now you 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.390
 can you stop and humans rod systems 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.150
 nite topic but how do you harper then 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.360
 have a little button on the left of 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:13.019
 flying with a moon there on the 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.459
 witness you see my place okay she has 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.470
 normally you should have a square 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.390
 red says indicates the presence of an object 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.400
 in motion so a pedestrian a cow 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.739
 like me I was just now banny 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.459
 burns because it's going to work or not 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.459
 there is what we will see 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:39.520
 I saw here because it's a clever thing 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.520
 made of the day - and yes it makes a killer 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:47.390
 ayem bixente xiam fucking you go movie 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.770
 and it closed me well served to kill you 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.360
 would have killed me I'll tell you with 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.440
 the doe what the live is that me 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.000
 I also saw that the first purpose of 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.650
 the screen yeah and after through the 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.560
 windshield of big crosby doe 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.750
 hot to loaf to italy via the 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.610
 say to turn on the thing and you see 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.740
 I did not get the low city to save 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.180
 the doe especially mercedes so what 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.650
 what did you think of this system 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.030
 listen to that we still allowed to 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.070
 save bambi there is a calm life 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.690
 the inverted one was first seen on the screen 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.730
 of old city young it has been detected 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.650
 and we saw that after through the front 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.810
 breeze but suddenly I could brake well 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.070
 earlier than really an excellent 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.320
 demonstration the utility of this system 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.020
 exactly that proves that there is an interest 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.910
 is that technology sometimes exceed 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.920
 the human eye so here you have to know 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.800
 that this system is offered as an option to 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.140
 2700 euros on the class s so good 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.630
 idea or not rob validated and nature 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:39.920
 look after no you're not going to die 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:42.530
 so to my family that I will tell you 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:46.370
 woman you do by which they 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.930
 you adore you play the game predator 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.820
 now it's okay what's that one 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.090
 mountain of muscles cd nice it 's not going 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:56.480
 to hurt you makes us black at kost ar 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.060
 analysts you put yourself there no you put yourself 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.090
 behind 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:05.200
 but you behind when you go can 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:09.010
 to be interest in them goes to the loupiote 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:13.930
 the lady already has a client the voice sarah 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:17.250
 school go I do not know going to class 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.250
 with him micheline
