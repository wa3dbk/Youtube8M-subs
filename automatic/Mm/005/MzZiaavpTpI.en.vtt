 continue with this project here 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.640

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.160
 This video here I'll show you 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.000
 how do we do the configuration of 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.000
 remote access here on windows 8 and let's 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.079
 is to delegate access to only one 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.969
 specific user and group 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.520
 administrators ok then only who is 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.460
 administrator and that user can 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.500
 have remote access to this machine 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.960
 It will make a practical test here okay 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.960

 windows 8 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:50.819
 Here is the message that Mary 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:53.639

 user account is not authorized 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.660
 To make a remote one soon, it 's a 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:49.130
 procedure is very simple you activate 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:52.620
 that remote access is able to delegate 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:54.510
 the people who will have access to this 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.790
 computer remotely 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:00.980
