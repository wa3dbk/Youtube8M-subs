00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 make your previous video me 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:09.650
 showed how to knit a scarf 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:13.230
 on the hands without spokes in this video I will show 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.179
 also knitting technique itself but now 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.240
 instead of hands and we will use your finger 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:25.670
 it is desirable to take thick yarn do 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:30.300
 air loop resulting loop 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:35.100
 put on your right hand and now 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:39.840
 using the principle of looping like on 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.730
 knitting needles and a on the index finger and up 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.700
 string their loops 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:49.710
 do not delay because it will be difficult 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:52.050
 work for example dial 8 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.690
 The only negative of course such a neigh 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.100
 what 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.100
 the scarf will not be very wide 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.830
 now you need to choose which side y 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:20.030
 you will be working thread or keep it 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:23.500
 for knitting or before but do not translate 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:30.080
 back and forth and start drawing get lost 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:33.740
 Now we take a working thread and push through 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.770
 and her in front through the first loop but in 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:44.300
 put the loop on the finger 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:50.500
 other hand continued working thread through 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.500
 next loop on the finger of the other hand 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:05.730
 if the chance on our hands goes beyond 10 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:09.420
 20 minutes with this method will have 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:12.660
 sit a little longer on a loop here by 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.440
 the size will of course be much smaller and 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.440
 neater 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.930
 and in this way we will knit on the right 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.610
 us length 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:36.099
 if you will do on a scarf 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:40.330
 probably better to do at length so 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:47.080
 enough to wrap around twice 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:48.880
 neck if in the process of knitting you need 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.980
 happen then you can take advantage 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.980
 pencil or thick knitting needles 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.840
 It looks like our face so 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.430
 looks like the wrong side now i will show how 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:09.220
 end in return end in the same way 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:15.790
 in the usual way as when knitting through 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:18.269
 2 loops stretch the working thread but in 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:25.110
 resulting loop 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:25.110
 back on the finger and working thread 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:37.260
 after two loops it turned out 1 gram 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:37.260
 novoflex and so on to the end 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.920
 He remained one loop with a garment itself and 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:06.260
 tail 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:13.560
 more I will sew them two halves 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:17.130
 stretching and pulling down 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:21.199
 facing in and using 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.900
 left tail I'll sew 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:27.710
 edges together you can use 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:36.539
 hook or just 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:37.760
 thread so thread using a needle with 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:44.389
 a thick ear 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:44.389
 hide tip knitting 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:05:01.889
 this scarf consists of 15 loops and here 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.889
 what did we do
