know<00:03:40.209> three<00:03:40.569> years<00:03:40.599> and<00:03:41.379> I<00:03:41.859> have<00:03:42.010> zero

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
know three years and I have zero

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.760 
know three years and I have zero
payments<00:03:43.030> so<00:03:43.359> no<00:03:43.599> payments<00:03:44.049> on<00:03:44.169> the<00:03:44.260> truck<00:03:44.530> so

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
payments so no payments on the truck so

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.390 
payments so no payments on the truck so
so<00:03:46.370> that's<00:03:46.610> my<00:03:47.140> what<00:03:48.140> I<00:03:48.170> found<00:03:48.410> out<00:03:48.680> about<00:03:48.890> the

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
so that's my what I found out about the

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.850 
so that's my what I found out about the
you<00:03:50.030> know<00:03:50.060> this<00:03:50.300> little<00:03:50.510> dilemma<00:03:50.960> keep<00:03:51.620> the

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
you know this little dilemma keep the

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.610 
you know this little dilemma keep the
old<00:03:52.700> truck<00:03:53.000> and<00:03:53.030> keep<00:03:53.330> repairing<00:03:53.990> it<00:03:54.110> or<00:03:54.380> buy<00:03:54.590> a

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
old truck and keep repairing it or buy a

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.680 
old truck and keep repairing it or buy a
new<00:03:54.710> one<00:03:55.010> so<00:03:55.220> I<00:03:55.280> think<00:03:55.520> it's<00:03:55.670> better<00:03:55.850> to<00:03:56.060> keep

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
new one so I think it's better to keep

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.360 
new one so I think it's better to keep
the<00:03:56.750> old<00:03:57.020> one<00:03:57.260> because<00:03:57.560> there's<00:03:57.770> no<00:03:57.890> payments

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
the old one because there's no payments

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.320 
the old one because there's no payments
and<00:03:59.440> it's<00:04:00.440> always<00:04:00.740> cheaper<00:04:00.980> to<00:04:01.370> fix<00:04:01.700> the<00:04:02.150> old

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
and it's always cheaper to fix the old

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.760 
and it's always cheaper to fix the old
truck<00:04:02.690> than<00:04:02.960> buy<00:04:03.140> a<00:04:03.170> new<00:04:03.380> one

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
truck than buy a new one

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.920 
truck than buy a new one
