00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:13.639
 and again we are to show you 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.430
 How can you solder with two batteries? 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.919
 car we can drop the iron 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.780
 this is for small jobs now they 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:24.960
 I will show how it is done 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.750
 look there first Safety first 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:32.810
 that putting the gloves is not high 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.810
 voltage but you can burn one 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:42.200
 have as you can see here I have the 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:45.140
 wire this would be the ground 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.910
 this is a current as you can 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:52.480
 see also connected 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.910
 to the positive of the battery you can 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.510
 watch 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.330
 and on this side is the negative toward 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.540
 positive this is done with two batteries 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.990
 to have greater amperage and here is the 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.150
 negative where we're going to connect the other 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.950
 as they were marylÃ©ne down there is no 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.770
 nothing 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.909
 to 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.909
 nor in the other matter 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.980
 so 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.980
 the negative we connect here 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.720
 I have to be quick because I already 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.150
 in which time is very valuable 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.140
 then how did I tell you that this is 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.780
 negative to positive here we already have the 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.760
 two charges of the two batteries and here already 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.850
 we are left 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.100
 positive that is the sea and the negative that 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.020
 is the least 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.719
 the negative we connect here to the iron 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.810
 and the positive is where we put the 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:59.000
 electrode or wands to be welded or not 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.240
 they say wands of soldiers but machines 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.149
 electrodes 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.750
 and here we can shoot or we have our 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.750
 as well 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.180
 this 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.180
 this is a square with magnets is the 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.629
 used me to not be stopping the 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.629
 pieces 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.459
 of all and we have free hands 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.459
 to be able to work 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.340
 our things 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.020
 We are talking 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.720
 two 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.050
 speech the mind as for small 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.050
 repairs 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.150
 Y 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.590
 As you can see you have to be soldier 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:15.129
 and then no more or milk over here for the 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.129
 other side 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.750
 it looks good soldiers 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:43.310
 all right 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:46.410
 then the system this I use it 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:49.110
 practically at times like when it's in 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:51.000
 a ranch or something that does not have a 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.640
 electricity 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.130
 and they occupy making small repairs to 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:58.470
 less than if it's a little bigger what 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:01.350
 that you have to solar even three batteries 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:05.230
 of these cards but with two batteries 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:08.380
 can weld small things 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:12.190
 As in others, a man opens a 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:15.870
 tow a small broken then 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:18.100
 he tells the soldiers or he was on a ranch 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:21.060
 but how can you see me 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.060
 there is nothing else 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.120
 our things more than what is the most the 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:32.720
 bacteria 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.720
 so 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:38.160
 in this video, I'm doing it 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:40.170
 I hope you like the video 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.849
 If you like money, put it on and 

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:45.229
 like the video 

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:45.229
 sign up on my channel 

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:50.670
 later I will continue making another 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.420
 video I have other earrings that also 

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:55.960
 I am in process 

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:58.430
 no more than being done 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.290
 I can do later 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.960
 So if you liked the video, put it on and 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:05.200
 who liked the video and write to me 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.200
