where<00:02:54.590> to<00:02:54.680> start<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.070> notice<00:02:55.250> I<00:02:55.519> brighten<00:02:55.880> up

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
where to start to notice I brighten up

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.090 
where to start to notice I brighten up
around<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:57.050> head<00:02:57.260> up<00:02:57.530> here<00:02:57.680> you<00:02:57.830> can<00:02:57.950> actually

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
around the head up here you can actually

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.040 
around the head up here you can actually
see<00:02:58.310> where<00:02:58.790> it's<00:02:58.940> not<00:02:59.090> blurring<00:02:59.480> it's<00:02:59.870> still

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
see where it's not blurring it's still

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.410 
see where it's not blurring it's still
showing<00:03:00.260> a<00:03:00.380> hard<00:03:00.590> edge<00:03:01.000> you'll<00:03:02.000> just<00:03:02.120> have<00:03:02.300> to

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
showing a hard edge you'll just have to

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.060 
showing a hard edge you'll just have to
feather<00:03:02.660> and<00:03:02.989> play<00:03:03.140> with<00:03:03.260> that<00:03:03.440> Gaussian<00:03:03.830> blur
