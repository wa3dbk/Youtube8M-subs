do is the edge of my trowel

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.380 
do is the edge of my trowel
I<00:02:59.510> go<00:03:00.020> flat<00:03:00.350> like<00:03:00.620> this<00:03:00.830> it<00:03:01.070> seals<00:03:01.490> it<00:03:01.790> and<00:03:01.970> it

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
I go flat like this it seals it and it

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.510 
I go flat like this it seals it and it
doesn't<00:03:02.750> dry<00:03:02.990> as<00:03:03.380> quickly<00:03:03.680> but<00:03:03.890> if<00:03:04.010> I<00:03:04.100> just<00:03:04.370> use

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
doesn't dry as quickly but if I just use

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.290 
doesn't dry as quickly but if I just use
an<00:03:04.730> edge<00:03:04.970> like<00:03:05.360> that<00:03:06.070> it<00:03:07.070> dries<00:03:07.460> it<00:03:07.760> it<00:03:07.880> opens

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
an edge like that it dries it it opens

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.250 
an edge like that it dries it it opens
it<00:03:08.420> up<00:03:08.680> kind<00:03:09.680> of<00:03:09.740> what<00:03:09.920> does<00:03:10.510> dark<00:03:11.510> or<00:03:11.930> straight

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
it up kind of what does dark or straight

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.370 
it up kind of what does dark or straight
edge<00:03:12.470> or<00:03:12.650> Ross<00:03:13.280> does<00:03:13.670> its<00:03:14.270> serrated<00:03:14.780> so<00:03:15.200> what

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
you allow it to dry because we are

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.660 
you allow it to dry because we are
involved<00:03:29.930> Oh<00:03:31.690> technically<00:03:33.340> niche<00:03:34.340> in<00:03:34.580> a
