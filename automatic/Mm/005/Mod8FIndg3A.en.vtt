they're socially how it looks like it's

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.290 
they're socially how it looks like it's
kind<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.219> like<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.430> big<00:00:32.579> circle<00:00:32.790> but<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.090> small

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
kind of like a big circle but a small

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:42.930 
kind of like a big circle but a small
house<00:00:33.510> okay<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.410> much<00:00:34.559> like<00:00:34.739> this

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.700 

so<00:00:43.510> what<00:00:43.780> we're<00:00:43.930> doing<00:00:43.960> here<00:00:44.230> is<00:00:44.500> we're<00:00:44.620> trying

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
so what we're doing here is we're trying

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.490 
so what we're doing here is we're trying
to<00:00:44.860> do<00:00:45.010> a<00:00:45.040> big<00:00:45.250> circle<00:00:45.430> which<00:00:45.880> is<00:00:45.910> if<00:00:46.420> you<00:00:46.780> learn

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
to do a big circle which is if you learn

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.350 
to do a big circle which is if you learn
two<00:00:47.739> big<00:00:47.890> circles<00:00:48.040> before<00:00:48.610> we're<00:00:49.060> going<00:00:49.239> to

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
two big circles before we're going to

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.630 
two big circles before we're going to
little<00:00:49.660> Ryan<00:00:49.840> as<00:00:50.140> we<00:00:50.260> open<00:00:50.590> the<00:00:50.680> arms<00:00:50.980> and<00:00:51.190> then

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
little Ryan as we open the arms and then

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.490 
little Ryan as we open the arms and then
we<00:00:51.850> push<00:00:52.150> should<00:00:52.270> we<00:00:52.330> give<00:00:52.480> back<00:00:52.750> and<00:00:53.170> then<00:00:53.320> we

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
we push should we give back and then we

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.200 
we push should we give back and then we
switch<00:00:53.770> to<00:00:54.010> the<00:00:54.129> right<00:00:54.160> to<00:00:54.550> see<00:00:54.700> a<00:00:54.730> lot<00:00:55.090> of

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
switch to the right to see a lot of

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.880 
switch to the right to see a lot of
switches<00:00:55.570> of<00:00:55.690> the<00:00:55.780> opposites<00:00:56.200> like<00:00:56.260> and<00:00:56.710> then

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
switches of the opposites like and then

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.250 
switches of the opposites like and then
we<00:00:57.040> come<00:00:57.220> straight<00:00:58.090> that's<00:00:58.480> your<00:00:58.720> big<00:00:58.900> circle

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
we come straight that's your big circle

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.930 
we come straight that's your big circle
now<00:00:59.769> with<00:01:00.010> ice<00:01:00.129> exactly<00:01:00.400> what<00:01:00.730> we're<00:01:00.850> doing

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
now with ice exactly what we're doing

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.240 
now with ice exactly what we're doing
here<00:01:01.090> in<00:01:01.360> the<00:01:01.420> bouncy<00:01:01.780> circle<00:01:02.140> not<00:01:02.949> what<00:01:03.129> we're

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
here in the bouncy circle not what we're

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.070 
here in the bouncy circle not what we're
doing<00:01:03.460> is<00:01:03.580> more<00:01:03.760> like<00:01:03.940> those<00:01:04.119> in<00:01:04.390> the<00:01:04.510> heels<00:01:04.780> as

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
doing is more like those in the heels as

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.290 
doing is more like those in the heels as
we<00:01:05.350> do<00:01:05.440> it<00:01:05.590> at<00:01:05.650> the<00:01:05.710> same<00:01:05.860> time<00:01:05.940> so<00:01:06.940> you<00:01:07.000> want<00:01:07.210> to

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
we do it at the same time so you want to

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.320 
we do it at the same time so you want to
lift<00:01:07.540> just<00:01:08.320> the<00:01:08.440> heel<00:01:08.680> and<00:01:08.950> bounce<00:01:09.490> bounce

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
lift just the heel and bounce bounce

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.900 
lift just the heel and bounce bounce
bounce<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.710> we're<00:01:11.860> really<00:01:11.979> not<00:01:12.280> bending<00:01:12.759> the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
bounce so we're really not bending the

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.490 
bounce so we're really not bending the
knees<00:01:13.090> much<00:01:13.360> here<00:01:13.720> you<00:01:13.990> know<00:01:14.080> it's<00:01:14.229> a<00:01:14.350> lot

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
knees much here you know it's a lot

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.200 
knees much here you know it's a lot
easier<00:01:14.680> to<00:01:14.920> lock<00:01:15.070> your<00:01:15.250> needs<00:01:15.490> what<00:01:16.060> are<00:01:16.119> you

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
easier to lock your needs what are you

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.130 
easier to lock your needs what are you
trying<00:01:16.479> to<00:01:16.600> do

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
trying to do

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.160 
trying to do
the<00:01:17.619> bouncy<00:01:18.130> heel<00:01:18.700> okay<00:01:19.210> they<00:01:19.690> get<00:01:19.810> a<00:01:19.869> notice

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
the bouncy heel okay they get a notice

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.170 
the bouncy heel okay they get a notice
on<00:01:20.350> this<00:01:20.440> one<00:01:20.500> that<00:01:20.800> it<00:01:20.920> does<00:01:21.130> work<00:01:21.880> your

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
on this one that it does work your

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.389 
on this one that it does work your
calves<00:01:22.539> more<00:01:22.930> stability<00:01:23.350> with<00:01:23.619> your<00:01:23.950> cat<00:01:24.130> so

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
calves more stability with your cat so

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.550 
calves more stability with your cat so
try<00:01:24.940> to<00:01:25.000> practice<00:01:25.390> touch<00:01:25.600> that<00:01:25.810> motion<00:01:26.020> well

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
try to practice touch that motion well

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.340 
try to practice touch that motion well
we're<00:01:26.680> gonna<00:01:26.800> try<00:01:26.950> to<00:01:27.009> achieve<00:01:27.250> two<00:01:27.640> bounces

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
we're gonna try to achieve two bounces

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.350 
we're gonna try to achieve two bounces
at<00:01:29.350> once<00:01:29.649> you<00:01:30.280> know<00:01:30.369> for<00:01:30.550> each<00:01:30.700> side<00:01:31.000> is<00:01:31.180> going

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
at once you know for each side is going

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.450 
at once you know for each side is going
to<00:01:31.420> be<00:01:31.479> bouncing<00:01:32.050> twice<00:01:32.289> so<00:01:33.009> it's<00:01:33.160> gonna<00:01:33.280> get

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
to be bouncing twice so it's gonna get

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.740 
to be bouncing twice so it's gonna get
at<00:01:33.580> this<00:01:33.759> one<00:01:34.360> two<00:01:35.110> three<00:01:35.740> four<00:01:36.369> five

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
at this one two three four five

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.860 
at this one two three four five
seven<00:01:38.680> eight<00:01:39.040> so<00:01:39.310> one<00:01:39.490> first<00:01:39.790> way<00:01:40.030> to<00:01:40.180> do<00:01:40.330> it<00:01:40.480> is

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
seven eight so one first way to do it is

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.330 
seven eight so one first way to do it is
learn<00:01:41.290> just<00:01:41.530> keeping<00:01:41.890> your<00:01:41.980> feet<00:01:42.160> together

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
learn just keeping your feet together

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.670 
learn just keeping your feet together
and<00:01:42.730> relaxing<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.300> same<00:01:43.540> spot<00:01:43.900> but<00:01:44.320> trying<00:01:44.620> to

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
and relaxing the same spot but trying to

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.570 
and relaxing the same spot but trying to
push<00:01:44.800> a<00:01:44.950> hip<00:01:45.240> sign<00:01:46.240> then<00:01:47.020> back<00:01:47.290> side<00:01:48.280> and

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
push a hip sign then back side and

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.870 
push a hip sign then back side and
forward<00:01:49.420> and<00:01:49.600> she<00:01:50.230> bounced<00:01:50.470> in<00:01:51.070> a<00:01:51.220> 2000<00:01:51.730> each

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
forward and she bounced in a 2000 each

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.530 
forward and she bounced in a 2000 each

so that this one then to bring this
marker<00:03:27.490> 30<00:03:28.450> and<00:03:28.930> four<00:03:29.440> and<00:03:30.030> then<00:03:31.030> drop<00:03:31.360> this

hand<00:03:31.810> down<00:03:32.220> five

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.039 

eight<00:03:37.790> let's<00:03:38.450> try<00:03:38.599> that<00:03:38.780> again

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
eight let's try that again

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.750 
eight let's try that again
so<00:03:39.530> you<00:03:39.590> hold<00:03:39.830> the<00:03:39.950> belly<00:03:40.129> as<00:03:40.340> you<00:03:40.370> go<00:03:40.549> on<00:03:40.580> the

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
so you hold the belly as you go on the

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.339 
so you hold the belly as you go on the
side<00:03:40.970> and<00:03:41.120> the<00:03:41.209> extent<00:03:41.569> there<00:03:41.659> are<00:03:41.810> two<00:03:42.170> to

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349 
side and the extent there are two to

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:43.839 
side and the extent there are two to
five<00:03:42.590> so<00:03:42.860> it<00:03:42.920> makes<00:03:43.099> them<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.400> left<00:03:43.610> because

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
five so it makes them the left because

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.350 
five so it makes them the left because
you<00:03:43.909> own<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:44.269> last<00:03:44.540> one<00:03:45.440> and<00:03:45.769> two<00:03:46.610> and<00:03:46.909> then

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
you own the last one and two and then

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.100 
you own the last one and two and then
look<00:03:47.720> behind<00:03:47.959> me<00:03:48.470> through<00:03:49.159> the<00:03:49.310> four<00:03:50.150> and<00:03:51.019> the
