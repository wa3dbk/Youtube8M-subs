this kind of batteries you must be seen
in<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.080> car<00:00:13.290> this<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.710> using<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.370> car<00:00:14.990> or

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
in the car this is using the car or

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.450 
in the car this is using the car or
inverter<00:00:16.410> in<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.740> home<00:00:18.830> and<00:00:19.830> this<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.100> used<00:00:20.279> in

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
inverter in the home and this is used in

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.060 
inverter in the home and this is used in
mobile<00:00:20.580> phones<00:00:21.230> also<00:00:22.230> if<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:22.890> see<00:00:23.010> the

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
mobile phones also if you see the

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.740 
mobile phones also if you see the
laptops<00:00:23.580> they<00:00:23.880> have<00:00:24.029> this<00:00:24.119> kind<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.390> batteries

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
laptops they have this kind of batteries

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.470 
laptops they have this kind of batteries
so<00:00:25.019> they<00:00:25.740> can<00:00:25.980> be<00:00:26.099> recharged<00:00:26.609> by<00:00:26.760> passing<00:00:27.420> the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
so they can be recharged by passing the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.089 
so they can be recharged by passing the
current<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.869> opposite<00:00:28.439> direction

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
current in opposite direction

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.690 
current in opposite direction
and<00:00:30.500> actually<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.679> good<00:00:31.859> second<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.340> cell<00:00:32.550> it

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
and actually a good second to cell it

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.389 
and actually a good second to cell it
can<00:00:32.730> undergo<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.420> large<00:00:33.750> number<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.399> discharge

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
can undergo a large number of discharge

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.610 
can undergo a large number of discharge
and<00:00:35.640> recharge<00:00:36.180> cycle<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:37.020> see<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.230> given

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
and recharge cycle you see a given

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.780 
and recharge cycle you see a given
battery<00:00:38.210> will<00:00:39.210> have<00:00:39.420> fixed<00:00:40.230> number<00:00:40.620> of

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
battery will have fixed number of

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.250 
battery will have fixed number of

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
recharge in this charge cycle that's why

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.930 
recharge in this charge cycle that's why
even<00:00:43.739> if<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.070> buy<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.250> rechargeable<00:00:44.910> battery

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
even if you buy a rechargeable battery

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.299 
even if you buy a rechargeable battery
you<00:00:45.420> use<00:00:45.719> for<00:00:45.960> two<00:00:46.110> years<00:00:46.320> after<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:47.039> it

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
you use for two years after that it

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.569 
you use for two years after that it
doesn't<00:00:47.579> work<00:00:48.059> stop<00:00:48.719> working<00:00:49.079> because<00:00:49.579> every

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
doesn't work stop working because every

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.580 
doesn't work stop working because every
battery<00:00:50.910> has<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.270> fixed<00:00:51.750> number<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:52.020> charging

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
battery has a fixed number of charging

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.860 
battery has a fixed number of charging
and<00:00:52.710> discharging<00:00:52.770> second<00:00:54.559> right<00:00:56.480> so<00:00:57.480> they

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
and discharging second right so they

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.900 
and discharging second right so they
argued<00:00:58.289> costly<00:00:58.710> initial<00:00:59.190> cost<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.520> pretty

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
argued costly initial cost is pretty

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.000 
argued costly initial cost is pretty
high<00:01:00.559> initially<00:01:01.559> cost

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
high initially cost

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.200 
high initially cost
initial<00:01:02.430> cost<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:02.789> high<00:01:06.020> is<00:01:07.020> high<00:01:07.760> but<00:01:08.760> overall

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
initial cost is high is high but overall

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.090 
initial cost is high is high but overall
cost<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:10.280> less<00:01:12.020> why<00:01:13.020> because<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.590> same<00:01:13.770> bad<00:01:13.979> to

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
cost is less why because the same bad to

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.249 
cost is less why because the same bad to
use<00:01:14.220> for<00:01:14.490> long<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> period<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.030> time<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.420> they

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
use for long a period of time and they

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:25.429 
use for long a period of time and they
have<00:01:16.520> low<00:01:17.520> impact<00:01:18.979> to<00:01:19.979> environment<00:01:24.439> well

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
have low impact to environment well

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.520 
have low impact to environment well
because<00:01:26.840> why<00:01:27.840> because<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.229> are<00:01:28.290> using<00:01:28.409> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
because why because you are using the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.910 
because why because you are using the
same<00:01:28.680> battery<00:01:28.979> for<00:01:29.130> long<00:01:29.280> appear<00:01:29.520> time

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
same battery for long appear time

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.469 
same battery for long appear time
correct<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.729> examples<00:01:33.180> are<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.329> lead

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
correct so the examples are the lead

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.350 
correct so the examples are the lead

right now you see the discharge cycle I

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.130 
right now you see the discharge cycle I
can<00:02:15.480> show<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:16.770> discharge<00:02:17.989> will<00:02:18.989> talk

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
can show you the discharge will talk

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:26.869 
can show you the discharge will talk
about<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.500> discharge<00:02:22.129> reaction<00:02:25.010> my<00:02:26.010> anode

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
about the discharge reaction my anode

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:32.630 
about the discharge reaction my anode
at<00:02:27.270> a<00:02:27.300> node<00:02:29.420> if<00:02:30.420> we<00:02:30.599> want<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:30.930> write<00:02:31.640> oxidation

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
at a node if we want to write oxidation

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.890 
at a node if we want to write oxidation
will<00:02:32.760> happen<00:02:33.290> so<00:02:34.290> lead<00:02:34.560> will<00:02:35.310> become

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
will happen so lead will become

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
will happen so lead will become
lead<00:02:37.010> sulfate<00:02:41.360> and<00:02:42.360> two<00:02:43.110> electrons<00:02:43.560> become

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
lead sulfate and two electrons become

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.410 
lead sulfate and two electrons become

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.570 

correct<00:03:53.099> so<00:03:53.519> each<00:03:53.730> cell<00:03:54.060> is<00:03:54.209> 3.3<00:03:55.019> volt<00:03:55.580> 32.2

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
correct so each cell is 3.3 volt 32.2

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.899 
correct so each cell is 3.3 volt 32.2
volt<00:03:56.879> each<00:03:57.000> cell<00:03:57.330> so<00:03:58.340> now<00:03:59.340> generally<00:03:59.730> they<00:03:59.879> are

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
volt each cell so now generally they are

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:02.660 
volt each cell so now generally they are
either<00:04:00.090> using<00:04:00.390> 3<00:04:00.750> cells<00:04:01.019> or<00:04:01.230> 6<00:04:01.739> cells<00:04:01.980> say

either using 3 cells or 6 cells say

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.539 
either using 3 cells or 6 cells say
where<00:04:02.849> they're<00:04:03.299> using<00:04:03.569> 3<00:04:03.750> cells<00:04:04.370> then<00:04:05.370> the

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
where they're using 3 cells then the

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.420 
where they're using 3 cells then the
total<00:04:05.879> goal<00:04:06.030> will<00:04:06.269> be<00:04:06.360> 3<00:04:06.599> into<00:04:06.780> 2.2<00:04:07.590> almost

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
total goal will be 3 into 2.2 almost

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.690 
total goal will be 3 into 2.2 almost
aprox<00:04:08.819> to<00:04:08.939> 6<00:04:09.120> more

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
aprox to 6 more

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.940 
aprox to 6 more
are<00:04:10.700> they<00:04:10.880> are<00:04:10.940> using<00:04:11.180> 6l6<00:04:11.780> in<00:04:12.080> 22.2<00:04:12.620> almost

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
are they are using 6l6 in 22.2 almost

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.040 
are they are using 6l6 in 22.2 almost
approximate<00:04:13.400> 12<00:04:13.640> but<00:04:13.790> because<00:04:14.060> if<00:04:14.630> you<00:04:14.750> add<00:04:14.900> in

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
approximate 12 but because if you add in

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.110 
approximate 12 but because if you add in
series<00:04:15.320> is<00:04:15.470> some<00:04:15.620> voltage<00:04:15.740> drop<00:04:16.100> also<00:04:16.310> right

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
series is some voltage drop also right

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.040 
series is some voltage drop also right
so<00:04:17.720> since<00:04:18.430> you<00:04:19.430> can<00:04:19.640> recharge<00:04:19.970> it<00:04:20.150> also<00:04:20.720> so<00:04:20.959> it

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:21.050 
so since you can recharge it also so it

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:26.520 
so since you can recharge it also so it
is<00:04:21.140> also<00:04:21.320> voltaic<00:04:21.860> cell<00:04:24.040> it<00:04:25.040> is<00:04:25.160> a<00:04:25.190> voltaic

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
is also voltaic cell it is a voltaic

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:47.530 
rechargeable cell so an anode oxidation
will<00:05:42.020> happen<00:05:42.350> I<00:05:42.530> will<00:05:42.740> show<00:05:43.460> you<00:05:43.550> at<00:05:43.760> anode<00:05:46.540> my

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:47.540 
will happen I will show you at anode my

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.370 
will happen I will show you at anode my
oxidation<00:05:48.110> will<00:05:48.200> happen<00:05:50.170> so<00:05:51.170> what<00:05:51.290> will

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
oxidation will happen so what will
