little geotracker had issue with this
we're<00:00:04.770> going<00:00:04.980> down<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.250> freeway<00:00:05.460> it<00:00:05.819> seems

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
we're going down the freeway it seems

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.700 
we're going down the freeway it seems
like<00:00:06.180> here<00:00:06.330> time<00:00:06.509> you<00:00:06.629> get<00:00:06.720> going<00:00:06.899> 70<00:00:07.319> miles<00:00:07.500> an

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
hour and stomp on the gas it would tend

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.390 
hour and stomp on the gas it would tend
to<00:00:11.179> cause<00:00:12.179> it<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.450> just<00:00:12.780> die<00:00:13.099> call<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.250> tow

turn<00:00:21.600> on<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.930> key<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.439> see<00:00:22.529> all<00:00:22.740> these

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
turn on the key and you see all these

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.380 
turn on the key and you see all these
lights<00:00:23.100> that<00:00:23.250> come<00:00:23.460> on<00:00:23.519> those<00:00:23.850> wouldn't<00:00:24.180> come

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
lights that come on those wouldn't come

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.359 
lights that come on those wouldn't come
on<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:25.289> know<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.500> crank<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:25.980> crank<00:00:26.099> and

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
on you know the crank and crank and

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.000 
on you know the crank and crank and
crank<00:00:26.519> can<00:00:26.789> not<00:00:26.939> start<00:00:27.380> so<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.470> check<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.830> out

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
crank can not start so you check it out

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.080 
crank can not start so you check it out
and<00:00:29.400> then<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.630> fuse<00:00:30.900> would<00:00:31.140> be<00:00:31.320> blown<00:00:31.590> up

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
and then the fuse would be blown up

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.060 
and then the fuse would be blown up
underneath<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.270> here<00:00:33.540> get<00:00:34.530> some<00:00:34.710> light<00:00:34.890> on

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
underneath it here get some light on

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.670 
underneath it here get some light on
this<00:00:35.219> okay<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.210> coming<00:00:36.840> into<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.290> driver's

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
this okay so coming into the driver's

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.880 
this okay so coming into the driver's
side<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.280> see<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.180> far<00:00:39.660> left-hand<00:00:40.110> fuse<00:00:40.620> the

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
side you see that far left-hand fuse the

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.069 
side you see that far left-hand fuse the
one<00:00:41.040> that's<00:00:41.250> blue<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.820> middle<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.300> one

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
one that's blue in the middle that one

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.520 
one that's blue in the middle that one
would<00:00:43.290> be<00:00:43.320> blown<00:00:43.910> so<00:00:44.910> anyway<00:00:45.450> there's<00:00:46.320> two

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
would be blown so anyway there's two

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.520 
would be blown so anyway there's two
things<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.100> cause<00:00:47.309> this<00:00:48.079> the<00:00:49.079> first<00:00:49.320> one

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
things that can cause this the first one

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.889 
things that can cause this the first one
you<00:00:49.649> see<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.950> oxygen<00:00:50.129> sensor<00:00:50.969> right<00:00:51.660> here

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
you see that oxygen sensor right here

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.049 
you see that oxygen sensor right here
where<00:00:52.050> it's<00:00:52.199> been<00:00:52.350> spliced<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:53.520> can<00:00:53.699> see<00:00:53.910> they

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
where it's been spliced you can see they

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.760 
where it's been spliced you can see they
got<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.329> replaced<00:00:54.719> because<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.199> got<00:00:55.320> burned<00:00:55.559> on

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
got it replaced because it got burned on

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.490 
got it replaced because it got burned on
the<00:00:55.980> manifold<00:00:56.550> once<00:00:56.789> well<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.840> found<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.350> was

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
the manifold once well I found it was

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.380 
the manifold once well I found it was
burning<00:00:58.770> on<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.190> manifold<00:00:59.640> over<00:00:59.910> here<00:01:00.210> I

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
burning on the manifold over here I

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.119 
burning on the manifold over here I
cleared<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.050> out<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.559> way<00:01:01.649> that's<00:01:01.859> real

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
cleared that out of the way that's real

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.770 
cleared that out of the way that's real
common<00:01:02.309> calls<00:01:02.670> for<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:02.969> fuse<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.390> blow<00:01:03.570> so

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
common calls for that fuse to blow so

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.380 
common calls for that fuse to blow so
I'm<00:01:03.840> not<00:01:03.960> oh<00:01:04.199> cool<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.619> found<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.189> well<00:01:06.150> I'm<00:01:06.240> also

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
I'm not oh cool I found it well I'm also

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.810 
I'm not oh cool I found it well I'm also
doing<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.869> starter<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.710> starter<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.280> bad

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
doing a starter on this a starter is bad

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.820 
doing a starter on this a starter is bad
and<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:10.229> I'm<00:01:10.409> up<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.740> there<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:12.920> find<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.220> I

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
and is I'm up in there I find this I

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.350 
and is I'm up in there I find this I
don't<00:01:16.830> know<00:01:16.979> if<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.159> can<00:01:17.280> see<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.640> see<00:01:18.180> those

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
don't know if you can see that see those

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.109 
don't know if you can see that see those
two<00:01:18.540> bite<00:01:18.750> marks<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.380> black<00:01:19.590> wire<00:01:20.119> that's

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
two bite marks in the black wire that's

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.950 
two bite marks in the black wire that's
like<00:01:21.360> Barenaked<00:01:22.080> wire<00:01:22.909> and<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.420> that's<00:01:24.720> been

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
like Barenaked wire and so that's been

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.390 
like Barenaked wire and so that's been
causing<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.650> fuse<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.159> blow

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
causing the fuse to blow

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.609 
causing the fuse to blow
that's<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.420> wiring<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.080> goes<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
that's the wiring that goes to the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.190 
that's the wiring that goes to the
torque<00:01:29.040> converter<00:01:29.220> clutch<00:01:29.850> or<00:01:30.720> whatever<00:01:31.049> you

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
torque converter clutch or whatever you

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.410 
torque converter clutch or whatever you
want<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.439> call<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:32.430> wire<00:01:32.670> harness<00:01:33.030> was

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
want to call it this wire harness was

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.859 
want to call it this wire harness was
all<00:01:33.600> bound<00:01:34.560> up<00:01:34.799> underneath<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.729> above<00:01:36.720> this

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
all bound up underneath the above this

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.899 
all bound up underneath the above this
starter<00:01:37.290> but<00:01:37.470> under<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.799> intake<00:01:38.100> manifold<00:01:38.640> so

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
starter but under the intake manifold so

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.249 
starter but under the intake manifold so
you<00:01:38.970> see<00:01:39.150> they're<00:01:39.299> just<00:01:39.329> kind<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.720> shiny<00:01:39.960> I

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
you see they're just kind of shiny I

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.920 
you see they're just kind of shiny I
don't<00:01:41.159> know<00:01:41.250> how<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.460> can<00:01:41.700> see<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.000> anyway

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
don't know how I can see that anyway

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.510 
don't know how I can see that anyway
she's<00:01:43.140> getting<00:01:43.439> computer<00:01:43.829> codes<00:01:44.100> for<00:01:44.399> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
she's getting computer codes for the

she's getting computer codes for the
torque<00:01:44.850> converter<00:01:44.970> clutch<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:46.170> like<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.560> say

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
torque converter clutch and like I say

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.969 
torque converter clutch and like I say
is<00:01:47.070> also<00:01:47.509> blowing<00:01:48.509> fuses<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.799> would<00:01:49.950> just

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
is also blowing fuses so that would just

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.679 
is also blowing fuses so that would just
die<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.369> leave<00:01:50.670> her<00:01:50.850> stranded<00:01:51.890> anyway<00:01:53.689> that's

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
die and leave her stranded anyway that's

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.359
