think it's because like I have growth

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.140 
think it's because like I have growth
coming<00:05:26.110> in<00:05:26.349> and<00:05:27.010> that's<00:05:27.310> probably<00:05:27.610> from<00:05:27.910> the

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
coming in and that's probably from the

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.300 
coming in and that's probably from the
nature<00:05:28.360> of<00:05:28.539> any<00:05:28.960> hair<00:05:29.229> skin<00:05:29.500> Adele<00:05:29.770> gummies
