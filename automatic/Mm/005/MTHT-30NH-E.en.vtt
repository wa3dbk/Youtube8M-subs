it that's just me I'm so stupid when it
comes<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.459> reason<00:03:06.030> why<00:03:06.150> i<00:03:06.180> use<00:03:06.360> powers<00:03:06.750> but<00:03:06.870> i

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
comes to reason why i use powers but i

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.350 
comes to reason why i use powers but i
like<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.370> because<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.640> way<00:03:08.730> it<00:03:08.760> looks<00:03:08.970> and

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
like it because the way it looks and

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.170 
like it because the way it looks and
also<00:03:09.690> because<00:03:09.870> it<00:03:10.410> activates<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.310> advanced

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
also because it activates the advanced

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.180

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
here's the thing that that I did change

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:27.290 
here's the thing that that I did change
because<00:05:21.060> on<00:05:21.210> the<00:05:21.360> end<00:05:21.540> I<00:05:21.900> have<00:05:22.620> i<00:05:22.980> er<00:05:26.300> usually

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.960 
because on the end I have i er usually
normally<00:05:28.140> instead<00:05:28.620> of<00:05:28.710> Eire<00:05:28.980> I<00:05:29.340> would<00:05:29.760> have

normally instead of Eire I would have

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.360 
normally instead of Eire I would have
bloodlust<00:05:30.960> because<00:05:31.620> bloodlust<00:05:32.010> you<00:05:32.280> know

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
bloodlust because bloodlust you know

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.280 
bloodlust because bloodlust you know
gives<00:05:32.580> you<00:05:32.730> obviously<00:05:33.480> more<00:05:33.690> damage<00:05:34.050> more

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
gives you obviously more damage more

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.670 
gives you obviously more damage more

precision but you're always going to do
damage<00:05:37.890> and<00:05:38.540> the<00:05:39.540> fight<00:05:40.380> may<00:05:40.590> last<00:05:40.830> a<00:05:41.040> little

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160

PvP<00:06:36.229> let's<00:06:36.889> just<00:06:37.130> call<00:06:37.340> it<00:06:37.370> what<00:06:37.550> it<00:06:37.669> is<00:06:37.760> I'd

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 
PvP let's just call it what it is I'd

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.060 
PvP let's just call it what it is I'd
use<00:06:38.570> the<00:06:38.930> worst<00:06:39.380> weapon<00:06:39.800> that<00:06:39.889> you<00:06:40.040> could

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.070 
use the worst weapon that you could

possibly use for PvP also I could

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:49.140 
possibly use for PvP also I could
possibly<00:06:43.820> do<00:06:44.690> this<00:06:44.900> I<00:06:47.289> get<00:06:48.289> that<00:06:48.320> on<00:06:48.620> somebody

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.150 
possibly do this I get that on somebody

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:53.320 
possibly do this I get that on somebody
dead<00:06:50.380> alright<00:06:51.380> two-handed<00:06:51.860> sucks<00:06:52.100> I<00:06:52.370> wish<00:06:53.180> it

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.330 
dead alright two-handed sucks I wish it

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.060 
dead alright two-handed sucks I wish it
did<00:06:53.479> more<00:06:53.630> damage<00:06:53.690> because<00:06:54.320> it's<00:06:54.350> so<00:06:54.620> slow<00:06:54.889> but

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:55.070 
did more damage because it's so slow but

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.890 
did more damage because it's so slow but
it<00:06:55.160> doesn't<00:06:55.490> and<00:06:55.669> I<00:06:56.000> think<00:06:56.270> would<00:06:56.360> probably<00:06:56.780> be

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:56.900 
it doesn't and I think would probably be

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.510 
it doesn't and I think would probably be
a<00:06:56.930> little<00:06:57.050> bit<00:06:57.260> too<00:06:57.410> easy<00:06:57.620> if<00:06:57.830> it<00:06:57.979> did<00:06:58.160> do<00:06:58.340> too

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520 
a little bit too easy if it did do too

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.920 
a little bit too easy if it did do too
much<00:06:58.639> damage<00:06:58.700> because<00:06:59.030> I<00:06:59.360> know<00:06:59.419> how<00:06:59.660> to<00:06:59.720> use

00:06:59.920 --> 00:06:59.930 
much damage because I know how to use

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.170 
much damage because I know how to use
the<00:07:00.050> weapon<00:07:00.350> and<00:07:00.650> here's<00:07:01.100> the<00:07:01.220> thing<00:07:01.430> alright

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:02.180 
the weapon and here's the thing alright

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.620 
the weapon and here's the thing alright
and<00:07:02.389> this<00:07:02.479> is<00:07:02.600> just<00:07:02.690> my<00:07:02.900> opinion<00:07:04.090> any<00:07:05.090> weapon

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:05.630 
and this is just my opinion any weapon

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.320 
and this is just my opinion any weapon
will<00:07:05.840> work<00:07:06.050> it<00:07:06.320> just<00:07:06.979> depends<00:07:07.520> on<00:07:07.669> if<00:07:07.940> you<00:07:08.300> like

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:08.330 
will work it just depends on if you like

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.110 
will work it just depends on if you like
using<00:07:09.320> the<00:07:09.590> weapon<00:07:09.950> because<00:07:10.520> if<00:07:10.669> you<00:07:10.820> like

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 
using the weapon because if you like

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.700 
using the weapon because if you like
using<00:07:11.419> the<00:07:11.599> weapon<00:07:11.930> you're<00:07:12.110> going<00:07:12.349> to<00:07:12.470> learn

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:12.710 
using the weapon you're going to learn

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.129 
using the weapon you're going to learn
how<00:07:12.770> to<00:07:13.220> use<00:07:14.120> the<00:07:14.300> weapon<00:07:14.570> if<00:07:14.660> that<00:07:14.810> makes<00:07:15.020> any

of<00:07:21.440> me<00:07:21.620> using<00:07:21.830> it<00:07:22.130> was<00:07:22.370> explosive<00:07:22.880> block<00:07:23.330> but
