00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
hey how's it going guys it's Clinton

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.660 
hey how's it going guys it's Clinton
here<00:00:14.480> today<00:00:14.809> I've<00:00:15.110> got<00:00:15.139> a<00:00:15.440> tutorial<00:00:15.920> on<00:00:16.370> how<00:00:16.460> to

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
here today I've got a tutorial on how to

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.940 
here today I've got a tutorial on how to
do<00:00:17.030> the<00:00:17.300> accelerated<00:00:18.110> backwards<00:00:18.500> hopping<00:00:18.800> I

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:18.950 
do the accelerated backwards hopping I

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.710 
do the accelerated backwards hopping I
did<00:00:19.100> this<00:00:19.220> in<00:00:19.400> my<00:00:19.430> polar<00:00:19.700> speedrun<00:00:20.210> and<00:00:20.450> lots

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
did this in my polar speedrun and lots

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.870 
did this in my polar speedrun and lots
of<00:00:20.780> people<00:00:21.110> are<00:00:21.170> asking<00:00:21.200> me<00:00:21.619> on<00:00:21.949> what<00:00:22.760> that

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
of people are asking me on what that

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.509 
of people are asking me on what that
glitches<00:00:23.330> or<00:00:23.510> whatever<00:00:23.990> it<00:00:24.170> is<00:00:24.289> so<00:00:25.039> it<00:00:25.369> is<00:00:25.490> a

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
glitches or whatever it is so it is a

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.900 
glitches or whatever it is so it is a
glitch<00:00:25.789> it's<00:00:26.269> a<00:00:26.660> glitch<00:00:26.990> based<00:00:27.619> on<00:00:28.009> the<00:00:28.699> source

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
glitch it's a glitch based on the source

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.490 
glitch it's a glitch based on the source
engine<00:00:29.119> and<00:00:29.449> if<00:00:29.539> you're<00:00:29.720> wondering<00:00:29.929> why<00:00:30.230> I'm

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
engine and if you're wondering why I'm

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.560 
engine and if you're wondering why I'm
in<00:00:30.619> gmod<00:00:31.130> you're<00:00:31.429> like<00:00:31.550> oh<00:00:31.730> my<00:00:32.029> god<00:00:32.240> this<00:00:32.419> is

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
in gmod you're like oh my god this is

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.100 
in gmod you're like oh my god this is
gmod<00:00:32.960> op<00:00:33.110> freakin<00:00:33.530> polar<00:00:33.740> hours<00:00:34.010> before<00:00:35.110> it's

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
gmod op freakin polar hours before it's

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.889 
gmod op freakin polar hours before it's
in<00:00:36.350> gmod<00:00:36.740> because<00:00:37.160> they<00:00:37.460> run<00:00:37.610> same<00:00:37.910> source

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
in gmod because they run same source

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.880 
in gmod because they run same source
engines<00:00:41.200> everything<00:00:42.200> works<00:00:42.410> the<00:00:42.559> same

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
engines everything works the same

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.100 
engines everything works the same
there's<00:00:43.430> no<00:00:43.520> difference<00:00:44.120> in<00:00:44.390> how<00:00:44.420> you<00:00:44.690> move

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
there's no difference in how you move

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.970 
there's no difference in how you move
and<00:00:45.559> how<00:00:45.649> the<00:00:45.949> speed<00:00:46.340> glitches<00:00:46.760> go<00:00:47.140> also<00:00:48.140> it's

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
and how the speed glitches go also it's

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.660 
and how the speed glitches go also it's
got<00:00:49.129> this<00:00:49.309> map<00:00:49.670> it's<00:00:50.059> flat<00:00:50.449> completely<00:00:50.989> flat

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
got this map it's flat completely flat

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.049 
got this map it's flat completely flat
except<00:00:52.670> for<00:00:52.820> this<00:00:52.879> building<00:00:53.270> up<00:00:53.359> here<00:00:53.920> so

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
except for this building up here so

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.400 
except for this building up here so
firstly<00:00:56.059> what<00:00:56.210> you<00:00:56.329> need<00:00:56.480> to<00:00:56.600> do<00:00:56.780> if<00:00:57.079> you<00:00:57.199> want

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
firstly what you need to do if you want

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.330 
firstly what you need to do if you want
to<00:00:57.710> get<00:00:58.640> and<00:00:59.210> the<00:00:59.719> ABH<00:01:00.320> well<00:01:00.800> accelerator

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
to get and the ABH well accelerator

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.529 
to get and the ABH well accelerator
backward<00:01:01.699> talking<00:01:01.850> that's<00:01:02.059> what<00:01:02.149> you<00:01:02.329> call

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
backward talking that's what you call

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.660 
backward talking that's what you call
that<00:01:02.660> AVH<00:01:03.170> if<00:01:03.769> you<00:01:03.890> want<00:01:04.040> to<00:01:04.100> get<00:01:04.190> that<00:01:04.340> to<00:01:04.489> work

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
that AVH if you want to get that to work

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.640 
that AVH if you want to get that to work
you<00:01:04.910> have<00:01:05.000> to<00:01:05.059> get<00:01:05.239> a<00:01:05.269> script<00:01:05.690> spanning<00:01:06.350> jump

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
you have to get a script spanning jump

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.430 
you have to get a script spanning jump
will<00:01:06.800> just<00:01:07.010> not<00:01:07.160> do<00:01:07.370> it<00:01:07.400> because<00:01:07.580> well<00:01:08.480> even<00:01:09.320> if

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
will just not do it because well even if

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.219 
will just not do it because well even if
you<00:01:09.530> time<00:01:09.830> it<00:01:10.210> like<00:01:11.210> you'll<00:01:11.720> you're<00:01:12.080> gonna

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
you time it like you'll you're gonna

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.649 
you time it like you'll you're gonna
stop<00:01:12.470> up<00:01:12.650> sometime<00:01:13.100> it's<00:01:13.310> just<00:01:14.060> not<00:01:14.450> good

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
stop up sometime it's just not good

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:14.980 
stop up sometime it's just not good
enough

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
enough

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.560 
enough
yep<00:01:15.590> it's<00:01:16.100> it<00:01:16.610> requires<00:01:16.970> a<00:01:17.030> lot<00:01:17.210> of<00:01:17.240> accuracy

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
yep it's it requires a lot of accuracy

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.200 
yep it's it requires a lot of accuracy
if<00:01:17.930> you<00:01:18.020> want<00:01:18.170> to<00:01:18.259> span<00:01:18.560> it<00:01:18.770> or<00:01:19.030> time<00:01:20.030> it

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
if you want to span it or time it

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.020 
if you want to span it or time it
properly<00:01:20.570> so<00:01:21.079> you<00:01:21.140> need<00:01:21.320> a<00:01:21.350> script<00:01:21.740> to<00:01:22.100> let<00:01:22.909> the

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
properly so you need a script to let the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.910 
properly so you need a script to let the
computers<00:01:23.509> help<00:01:23.750> you<00:01:23.930> spam<00:01:24.170> junk<00:01:24.500> every

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
computers help you spam junk every

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.399 
computers help you spam junk every
millisecond<00:01:25.549> also<00:01:25.820> that<00:01:26.030> is<00:01:26.180> you<00:01:27.079> can't<00:01:27.259> do

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
millisecond also that is you can't do

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.080 
millisecond also that is you can't do
that<00:01:27.590> with<00:01:27.710> the<00:01:27.860> human<00:01:27.979> body<00:01:28.280> it's<00:01:28.520> physically

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
that with the human body it's physically

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.010 
that with the human body it's physically
impossible<00:01:29.439> pretty<00:01:30.439> much<00:01:30.680> so<00:01:31.750> what<00:01:32.750> you<00:01:32.869> want

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
impossible pretty much so what you want

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.690 
impossible pretty much so what you want
to<00:01:33.110> do<00:01:33.229> first<00:01:33.650> is<00:01:34.420> you<00:01:35.420> want<00:01:35.450> to<00:01:36.159> jump<00:01:37.159> forward

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
to do first is you want to jump forward

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.050 
to do first is you want to jump forward
and<00:01:38.229> then<00:01:39.229> after<00:01:39.920> you<00:01:40.040> jump<00:01:40.250> all<00:01:40.430> we<00:01:40.520> do<00:01:40.700> a<00:01:40.729> 180

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
and then after you jump all we do a 180

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.520 
and then after you jump all we do a 180
degree<00:01:41.600> turn<00:01:41.649> like<00:01:42.649> this<00:01:43.990> during<00:01:44.990> that<00:01:45.259> time

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
degree turn like this during that time

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.740 
degree turn like this during that time
you<00:01:46.009> crouch<00:01:46.579> as<00:01:47.090> well<00:01:47.659> so<00:01:48.649> if<00:01:49.490> you<00:01:50.149> got<00:01:50.329> that

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
you crouch as well so if you got that

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.480 
you crouch as well so if you got that
landing<00:01:51.110> correctly<00:01:51.560> then<00:01:51.799> you<00:01:52.159> pretty<00:01:52.340> much

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
landing correctly then you pretty much

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.149 
landing correctly then you pretty much
got<00:01:52.670> it<00:01:52.700> right<00:01:52.939> and<00:01:53.350> after<00:01:54.350> your<00:01:54.710> first<00:01:54.890> jump

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
got it right and after your first jump

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.590 
got it right and after your first jump
just<00:01:55.369> keeps<00:01:55.990> spamming<00:01:56.990> jump<00:01:57.170> with<00:01:57.320> the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
just keeps spamming jump with the

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.149 
just keeps spamming jump with the
autohotkey<00:01:59.600> script<00:01:59.840> I'm<00:02:00.409> gonna<00:02:00.740> leave<00:02:00.979> the

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
autohotkey script I'm gonna leave the

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.010 
autohotkey script I'm gonna leave the
script<00:02:01.430> and<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:02.119> download<00:02:02.479> link<00:02:02.719> to

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
script and the download link to

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.310 
script and the download link to
autohotkey<00:02:03.590> in<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:03.950> description<00:02:04.490> so<00:02:05.360> this<00:02:06.200> is

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
autohotkey in the description so this is

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.360 
autohotkey in the description so this is
what<00:02:06.500> it<00:02:06.560> should<00:02:06.680> look<00:02:06.740> like

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.180 

yeah<00:02:13.480> that's<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:15.170> power<00:02:15.680> of<00:02:15.800> a<00:02:16.550> be<00:02:17.120> aging<00:02:17.540> and

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
yeah that's the power of a be aging and

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.470 
yeah that's the power of a be aging and
let's<00:02:19.190> comparative<00:02:19.670> bunny-hopping<00:02:19.940> it's<00:02:20.360> a

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
let's comparative bunny-hopping it's a

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.610 
let's comparative bunny-hopping it's a
lot<00:02:20.840> lot<00:02:21.170> slow<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:22.030> if<00:02:23.030> you<00:02:23.390> want<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.200> do<00:02:24.320> any

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
lot lot slow and if you want to do any

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.070 
lot lot slow and if you want to do any
speedrun<00:02:25.340> with<00:02:25.640> half-life<00:02:26.270> 2<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:26.570> half-life

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
speedrun with half-life 2 and half-life

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.320 
speedrun with half-life 2 and half-life
2<00:02:27.350> episode<00:02:27.680> 1<00:02:27.710> or<00:02:28.100> half-life<00:02:28.340> 2<00:02:28.670> episode<00:02:28.700> 2<00:02:29.090> or

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
2 episode 1 or half-life 2 episode 2 or

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.200 
2 episode 1 or half-life 2 episode 2 or
portal<00:02:30.010> you<00:02:31.010> will<00:02:31.340> pretty<00:02:31.580> much<00:02:31.670> have<00:02:31.910> to<00:02:31.940> use

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
portal you will pretty much have to use

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.330 
portal you will pretty much have to use
this<00:02:32.420> to<00:02:32.780> get<00:02:32.930> a<00:02:33.170> 5<00:02:33.530> speed<00:02:33.650> run<00:02:33.890> unless<00:02:34.070> you

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
this to get a 5 speed run unless you

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.740 
this to get a 5 speed run unless you
want<00:02:34.520> to<00:02:34.580> use<00:02:34.640> no<00:02:34.940> glitches<00:02:35.300> at<00:02:35.450> all<00:02:35.570> in<00:02:35.690> the

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
want to use no glitches at all in the

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.500 
want to use no glitches at all in the
game<00:02:35.900> which<00:02:36.290> I'm<00:02:36.710> fine<00:02:36.920> with

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
game which I'm fine with

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.260 
game which I'm fine with
so<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:39.380> explanation<00:02:40.010> behind<00:02:40.130> this<00:02:40.550> glitch<00:02:41.000> is

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
so the explanation behind this glitch is

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.300 
so the explanation behind this glitch is
because<00:02:41.720> when<00:02:42.110> I<00:02:42.140> meet<00:02:42.350> jump<00:02:42.620> forward<00:02:43.070> you<00:02:43.220> get

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
because when I meet jump forward you get

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.770 
because when I meet jump forward you get
a<00:02:43.370> speed<00:02:43.670> but<00:02:43.880> it's<00:02:43.970> like<00:02:44.090> this<00:02:44.240> is<00:02:44.360> no<00:02:44.510> more

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
a speed but it's like this is no more

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.500 
a speed but it's like this is no more
you<00:02:45.380> jump<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:45.950> can<00:02:46.430> clearly<00:02:46.730> see<00:02:46.850> there's<00:02:47.210> a

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
you jump you can clearly see there's a

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.260 
you jump you can clearly see there's a
huge<00:02:47.990> speed<00:02:48.320> boosts<00:02:48.530> you<00:02:48.650> get<00:02:48.860> so<00:02:49.460> whenever

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
huge speed boosts you get so whenever

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.430 
huge speed boosts you get so whenever
you<00:02:50.510> jump<00:02:52.090> pretty<00:02:53.090> much<00:02:53.390> what<00:02:53.630> happens<00:02:54.080> is

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
you jump pretty much what happens is

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.190 
you jump pretty much what happens is
that<00:02:55.030> you<00:02:56.030> get<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.300> speed<00:02:56.540> boost<00:02:56.750> when<00:02:57.080> you

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
that you get the speed boost when you

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.280 
that you get the speed boost when you
land<00:02:57.500> and<00:02:57.860> you<00:02:58.640> do<00:02:58.760> another<00:02:59.030> jump<00:02:59.360> the<00:03:00.020> game

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
land and you do another jump the game

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.710 
land and you do another jump the game
slows<00:03:01.040> you<00:03:01.220> down<00:03:01.250> because<00:03:01.790> they<00:03:02.330> don't<00:03:02.600> want

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
slows you down because they don't want

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.270 
slows you down because they don't want
you<00:03:02.810> like<00:03:03.050> getting<00:03:03.560> infinite<00:03:04.130> speed<00:03:04.400> and<00:03:06.280> they

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
you like getting infinite speed and they

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.010 
you like getting infinite speed and they
do<00:03:07.340> that<00:03:07.610> by<00:03:07.850> pushing<00:03:08.120> you<00:03:08.420> backwards<00:03:08.660> a

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
do that by pushing you backwards a

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.470 
do that by pushing you backwards a
little<00:03:09.050> bit<00:03:09.350> and<00:03:09.910> when<00:03:10.910> you<00:03:11.000> jump<00:03:11.240> forward

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
little bit and when you jump forward

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.890 
little bit and when you jump forward
like<00:03:11.720> this<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.140> turn<00:03:12.320> around<00:03:12.820> you<00:03:13.820> and<00:03:14.660> the

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
like this and turn around you and the

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.510 
like this and turn around you and the
game<00:03:15.050> thinks<00:03:15.350> you're<00:03:15.470> moving<00:03:15.740> forward<00:03:15.950> but

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
game thinks you're moving forward but

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.180 
game thinks you're moving forward but
you're<00:03:16.970> actually<00:03:17.270> moving<00:03:17.510> backwards<00:03:18.230> so<00:03:18.890> they

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
you're actually moving backwards so they

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.070 
you're actually moving backwards so they
give<00:03:19.370> you<00:03:19.490> that<00:03:19.670> backwards<00:03:20.090> push<00:03:20.270> again<00:03:20.870> and

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
give you that backwards push again and

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.010 
give you that backwards push again and
then<00:03:21.530> what<00:03:22.280> happens<00:03:22.640> is<00:03:22.790> that<00:03:22.820> they<00:03:23.690> give<00:03:23.930> you

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
then what happens is that they give you

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.870 
then what happens is that they give you
the<00:03:24.140> speed<00:03:24.410> boost<00:03:25.060> instead<00:03:26.060> of<00:03:26.180> a<00:03:26.270> slowdown<00:03:26.660> um

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
the speed boost instead of a slowdown um

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.340 
the speed boost instead of a slowdown um
the<00:03:28.880> reason<00:03:29.060> why<00:03:29.270> you<00:03:29.330> crouch<00:03:29.720> is<00:03:29.990> because

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
the reason why you crouch is because

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.620 
the reason why you crouch is because
crouching<00:03:30.950> makes<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.670> whole<00:03:31.880> process<00:03:32.150> a<00:03:32.420> bit

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
crouching makes the whole process a bit

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.360 
crouching makes the whole process a bit
faster<00:03:33.050> so<00:03:33.080> if<00:03:33.320> I<00:03:33.410> don't<00:03:33.470> crouch<00:03:33.980> and<00:03:34.250> then

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
faster so if I don't crouch and then

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.440 
faster so if I don't crouch and then
this<00:03:34.730> it's<00:03:35.030> a<00:03:35.950> lot<00:03:36.950> slower<00:03:37.220> but<00:03:37.610> it<00:03:37.730> still<00:03:37.910> has

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
this it's a lot slower but it still has

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.750 
this it's a lot slower but it still has
that<00:03:38.480> bit<00:03:39.020> of<00:03:39.140> a<00:03:39.230> speed<00:03:39.500> boost<00:03:39.740> for<00:03:39.980> you<00:03:40.160> just

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
that bit of a speed boost for you just

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.570 
that bit of a speed boost for you just
not<00:03:40.970> much<00:03:41.180> and<00:03:41.540> there's<00:03:42.110> a<00:03:42.170> huge<00:03:42.380> cap<00:03:42.709> so<00:03:43.430> if

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
not much and there's a huge cap so if

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.460 
not much and there's a huge cap so if
you<00:03:43.700> crouch<00:03:43.970> like<00:03:44.360> if<00:03:44.540> you<00:03:44.630> crouch<00:03:44.870> jump<00:03:45.290> like

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
you crouch like if you crouch jump like

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.890 
you crouch like if you crouch jump like
this<00:03:45.500> you're<00:03:46.040> really<00:03:46.370> really<00:03:46.520> slow<00:03:46.850> and<00:03:47.120> the

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
this you're really really slow and the

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.920 
this you're really really slow and the
game<00:03:48.110> is<00:03:48.380> slowing<00:03:49.280> you<00:03:49.459> down<00:03:49.490> much<00:03:50.360> faster

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
game is slowing you down much faster

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.470 
game is slowing you down much faster
than<00:03:51.110> usual<00:03:51.350> so<00:03:52.220> if<00:03:52.580> you<00:03:52.760> look<00:03:52.910> backwards<00:03:53.120> and

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
than usual so if you look backwards and

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.520 
than usual so if you look backwards and
then<00:03:53.600> you<00:03:53.720> crouch<00:03:53.990> like<00:03:54.470> this<00:03:55.450> you<00:03:56.450> get<00:03:56.660> a<00:03:57.020> lot

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
then you crouch like this you get a lot

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.740 
then you crouch like this you get a lot
of<00:03:57.680> speed<00:03:57.890> really<00:03:58.220> quickly<00:03:58.520> and<00:03:58.790> you<00:03:59.060> can<00:03:59.330> get

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
of speed really quickly and you can get

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.940 
of speed really quickly and you can get
very<00:04:00.080> fast<00:04:00.620> which<00:04:01.580> is<00:04:01.730> awesome<00:04:02.090> so<00:04:02.780> I<00:04:03.470> hope<00:04:03.830> you

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
very fast which is awesome so I hope you

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.430 
very fast which is awesome so I hope you
