00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.960
 Youtube channel 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.790

 I have turned it on for all of you 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.260
 do not know yet I stand briefly 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.699
 in front 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.350
 my name is christopher boy i am 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.059
 in berkeley predator I stand for 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.860
 you something very special planned and 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.269
 though i will give you all in ten videos 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.820
 tips and tricks to the zander other 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.409
 betrayed my new series is called at the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.820
 angel with rubber bait in the i you 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:03.570
 every week of one of these videos 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.460
 present 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.020
 today we start with the right one 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.580
 route and the right role for zander 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.170
 Act and what the next week too 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.679
 I'll always tell you 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.119
 So stay tuned at the end of the video 

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:17.130
 When zander trade is the device 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.810
 especially important we want that 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.399
 zander which has a very very hard one 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.050
 hook safely even on long distances 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:23.850
 That's why we need a route 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.140
 with a very strong backbone so that 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.450
 the stop also at full distance 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.250
 right through, we also want the 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.259
 Bite and the bait on the ground 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.880
 or the reason is very good 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.979
 that's why we need one 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.840
 sensitive and quick point action 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.130
 I have a route that this 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.009
 characteristics met man brought 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.610
 that is the abu ghazi aridi in that case 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.170
 mgs the model is the 8 122 nh that has 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.450
 a length of two feet and fifty 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.340
 Throw weight from 15 to 50 grams and 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.429
 this route has just the same 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.009
 see characteristics and the burden 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:57.420
 we only go the way in the top and 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.860
 has very much from the fifth wrestling 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.560
 strong backbone i demonstrate 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.369
 how can I be the sharpest 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.989
 pull down 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.229
 and she goes back very fast 

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:08.759
 and from the 5 here nothing happens anymore 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.229
 I can push down as I like 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.660
 I have almost no action left in here 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.239
 the route de very very stiff we can 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.520
 so ideal stop on big distances 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.570
 put 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.620
 at the right route length 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.120
 divide the spirits 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.950
 If you carry ten attackers you get 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.720
 usually eleven different answers because 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.700
 its a bit rather short route to 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.260
 the 1 meter 80 and others prefer 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.260
 good from three meters and more 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.050
 I find ideal good between 210 and 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.150
 270 the shorter a route the more 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.580
 It is easier to animate the bait 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.140
 and the longer the route, the harder it gets 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.860
 Of course it is the more wide-ranging 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.840
 have here 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.520
 So you have to make the ideal compromise for 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.320
 his waters can be found here 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.420
 on the Neckar and on the Rhine 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.890
 I do not have to throw too far and 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.480
 I would like to animate the bait well 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.670
 namely a route with two meters 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.800
 fifty length in the role is before 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.870
 all with a finely adjustable brake 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.670
 a nice clean run very important 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.470
 so that we a third on with larger 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.930
 always keep control and fishing 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.490
 In addition, the cushions can ideally cushion 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.130
 is the string catching a roll 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.830
 crucially between 65 and 80 cm 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.930
 I think the cord is perfect too 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.340
 big the bait makes big jumps 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.600
 the fast train is too small 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.670
 we will not get the bait fast 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.050
 enough off the floor is also one 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.000
 Cleaner running a lot 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.520
 pleasant to fish without fatigue too 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.560
 that was it from the first episode 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.910
 by zander angel lure with rubber 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.050
 I hope you enjoyed it and you 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.940
 could have something for you 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.520
 take it next week 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.810
 with part 2 this time to the topic that 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.160
 real zander incident 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.420
 Until then I wish you much success 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.420
 and petri safe on the water 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.069
 brought
