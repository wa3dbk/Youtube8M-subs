00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.170
 and good 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.120
 Hey 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:13.270
 there was once a separate day two together 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.560
 then we stand you can tell us what is 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.850
 happened 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.260
 yesterday we have been through technical 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.600
 defects 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.010
 that means the behind this is 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.900
 jammed 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.930
 then the in between to have flown out 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.940
 the bin broke so we stood at 60 pounds 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.050
 more on the pants 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.030
 yes it took a long time for the 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.060
 Cell came to us because it was precisely on that 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.680
 the moment we fell silent the went 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.510
 drugs that went a different way so that 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.330
 had to come back so has an hour or 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.160
 six lasted before they were and they 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.369
 have found that yes it is 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.580
 six to eight hours away and almost work 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:54.210
 not to do so we had to give up that 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.210
 was very unfortunate 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.470
 yes if it broke it is 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.660
 incomprehensible 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.460

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.320

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.790

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.790
 incomprehensibly disappointed 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.050
