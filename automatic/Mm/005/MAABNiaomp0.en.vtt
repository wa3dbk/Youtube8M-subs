00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
had a good team and we thought we could

had a good team and we thought we could
go<00:01:17.040> hell<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.460> long<00:01:17.640> way<00:01:17.850> here<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.570> we'd<00:01:18.960> win

go hell of a long way here and we'd win
game<00:01:19.380> after<00:01:19.680> game<00:01:19.830> after<00:01:19.890> game<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.730> it<00:01:21.570> was

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
game after game after game and it was

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.390 
game after game after game and it was
almost<00:01:21.870> as<00:01:22.110> if<00:01:22.140> people<00:01:22.650> were<00:01:22.920> saying<00:01:23.160> oh

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
almost as if people were saying oh

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.370 
almost as if people were saying oh
they'll<00:01:23.610> they'll<00:01:24.060> trip<00:01:24.450> up<00:01:24.600> sooner<00:01:24.960> or<00:01:25.020> later

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
they'll they'll trip up sooner or later

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.500 
they'll they'll trip up sooner or later
and<00:01:25.740> we<00:01:25.860> never<00:01:25.980> did<00:01:26.250> when<00:01:26.760> we<00:01:26.790> finished<00:01:27.240> third

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
and we never did when we finished third

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.600 
and we never did when we finished third
we<00:01:28.110> missed<00:01:28.350> out<00:01:28.530> on<00:01:28.560> Europe<00:01:29.190> which<00:01:29.400> should

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
we missed out on Europe which should

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.160 
we missed out on Europe which should
have<00:01:29.700> been<00:01:29.730> rightfully<00:01:30.360> ours<00:01:30.390> which<00:01:30.960> would

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
have been rightfully ours which would

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.320 
have been rightfully ours which would
have<00:01:31.290> been<00:01:31.410> the<00:01:31.560> next<00:01:31.740> step<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.280> think<00:01:32.330> not

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
have been the next step I think not

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.590 
have been the next step I think not
getting<00:01:33.630> Europe<00:01:34.050> and<00:01:34.320> then<00:01:35.130> being<00:01:35.760> right<00:01:36.120> in

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
getting Europe and then being right in

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.300 
getting Europe and then being right in
particular<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.530> know<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.680> would<00:01:38.040> have<00:01:38.160> to

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
particular you know I would have to

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.450 
particular you know I would have to
single<00:01:38.610> him<00:01:38.670> out<00:01:38.850> decide<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:40.050> that<00:01:40.080> his<00:01:40.500> to

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
single him out decide in that his to

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.550 
single him out decide in that his to
satisfy<00:01:42.000> his<00:01:42.180> footballing<00:01:42.600> ambitions<00:01:43.290> he<00:01:43.440> had

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
satisfy his footballing ambitions he had

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.860 
satisfy his footballing ambitions he had
to<00:01:43.680> go<00:01:43.800> elsewhere<00:01:43.980> I<00:01:44.550> think<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.720> was<00:01:45.840> a

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
to go elsewhere I think that was a

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.110 
to go elsewhere I think that was a
signal<00:01:46.350> for<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> lot<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.800> people<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.430> we

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 
signal for a lot of people that we

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:55.389 
signal for a lot of people that we
touched<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.960> glass<00:01:49.050> ceiling

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.370 

obviously<00:01:55.969> first<00:01:56.179> impressions<00:01:56.570> allowed<00:01:56.810> no

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
obviously first impressions allowed no

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.539 
obviously first impressions allowed no
superb

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549

feel this is their special Club I think

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.330 
feel this is their special Club I think
that<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.250> volume<00:03:01.609> of<00:03:01.760> support<00:03:02.150> is<00:03:02.420> such<00:03:03.340> that

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
that the volume of support is such that

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.940 
that the volume of support is such that
it<00:03:04.639> can<00:03:05.000> be<00:03:05.420> sustained<00:03:05.900> I<00:03:06.290> think<00:03:06.739> there<00:03:06.920> is

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
it can be sustained I think there is

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.509 
it can be sustained I think there is
wealth<00:03:07.340> in<00:03:07.579> the<00:03:07.700> area<00:03:08.950> there<00:03:09.950> there<00:03:10.340> is
