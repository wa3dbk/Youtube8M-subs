00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
looks solid from the start and each

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.180 
looks solid from the start and each
stage<00:01:26.750> just<00:01:27.020> looks<00:01:27.260> better<00:01:27.470> and<00:01:27.650> better<00:01:27.860> I

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
stage just looks better and better I

once<00:01:28.790> heard<00:01:28.940> an<00:01:29.090> artist<00:01:29.450> say<00:01:29.600> that<00:01:29.810> every

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
once heard an artist say that every

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.140 
once heard an artist say that every
painting<00:01:30.380> begins<00:01:30.710> with<00:01:31.130> a<00:01:31.160> single<00:01:31.430> line<00:01:31.790> and

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
painting begins with a single line and

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.540 
painting begins with a single line and
that<00:01:32.300> line<00:01:32.360> all<00:01:32.780> by<00:01:32.930> itself<00:01:33.320> is<00:01:33.590> wrong<00:01:34.190> and

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
that line all by itself is wrong and

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.120 
that line all by itself is wrong and
broken<00:01:35.090> so<00:01:35.660> you<00:01:35.690> fix<00:01:35.960> a<00:01:36.080> little<00:01:36.320> here<00:01:36.530> and<00:01:36.890> fix

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
of silly but it actually makes sense to

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.040 
of silly but it actually makes sense to
me<00:01:45.770> in<00:01:46.070> terms<00:01:46.310> of<00:01:46.640> how<00:01:47.180> I<00:01:47.570> put<00:01:47.600> an<00:01:47.900> image

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
me in terms of how I put an image

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.440 
me in terms of how I put an image
together<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:49.130> later<00:01:49.340> see<00:01:49.610> that<00:01:49.790> afterburn<00:01:50.240> is

together to later see that afterburn is

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.180 
together to later see that afterburn is
taken<00:01:50.780> off<00:01:50.930> and<00:01:51.170> even<00:01:51.410> progress<00:01:51.830> to<00:01:52.040> the<00:01:52.070> next
