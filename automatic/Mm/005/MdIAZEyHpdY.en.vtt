00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
much insane it makes it look like it's a

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.459 
much insane it makes it look like it's a
in<00:00:43.219> infinite<00:00:44.219> world<00:00:44.930> just<00:00:45.930> like<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.230> just

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
in infinite world just like it just

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.440 
in infinite world just like it just
makes<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.829> look<00:00:47.070> like<00:00:47.100> it's<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.700> gigantic

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
makes it look like it's the gigantic

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.340 
makes it look like it's the gigantic
world<00:00:48.690> anyways<00:00:49.469> um<00:00:50.460> he<00:00:51.390> just<00:00:51.420> hacked<00:00:51.809> into<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
world anyways um he just hacked into the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.020 
world anyways um he just hacked into the
game<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.940> do<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.120> but<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.960> max<00:00:55.199> distance<00:00:55.590> is

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
game and do that but the max distance is

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.180 
game and do that but the max distance is
256<00:00:57.030> i<00:00:57.239> believe<00:00:57.539> from<00:00:58.079> what<00:00:58.170> he<00:00:58.410> said<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:58.949> far

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
256 i believe from what he said so far

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.020 
256 i believe from what he said so far
so<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.390> decreases<00:01:01.289> your<00:01:02.010> battery<00:01:02.609> life<00:01:02.640> like

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
so it decreases your battery life like

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.380 
so it decreases your battery life like
crazy<00:01:03.359> though<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:03.930> don't<00:01:04.170> do<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.439> um<00:01:04.939> in<00:01:05.939> order

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
crazy though so don't do it um in order

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.270 
crazy though so don't do it um in order
to<00:01:06.510> do<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.900> need<00:01:07.200> like<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.560> Explorer<00:01:08.100> or

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
to do this you need like I Explorer or

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.170 
to do this you need like I Explorer or
like<00:01:08.729> um<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:10.020> file<00:01:10.890> if<00:01:11.220> you're<00:01:11.460> jailbroken<00:01:11.850> of

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
anyways um um yeah so this guy asked him

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.969 
anyways um um yeah so this guy asked him
if<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.680> would<00:01:22.979> work<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.759> galaxy<00:01:24.479> s<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:25.500> Samsung

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
if it would work on galaxy s the Samsung

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.090 
if it would work on galaxy s the Samsung
galaxies<00:01:26.490> but<00:01:27.210> apparently<00:01:27.930> um<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.890> would

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
galaxies but apparently um it would

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.109 
galaxies but apparently um it would
decrease<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:30.180> battery<00:01:30.570> life<00:01:30.750> mmm<00:01:31.350> I

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
decrease the battery life mmm I

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.219 
decrease the battery life mmm I
drastically<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:34.040> yeah<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.549> um<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.689> says<00:01:36.869> alpha
