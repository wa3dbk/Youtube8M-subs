so I'll take that in consideration it

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.039 
so I'll take that in consideration it
has<00:01:51.990> excellent<00:01:52.590> stability<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.390> accuracy<00:01:54.390> so

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
has excellent stability and accuracy so

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.830 
has excellent stability and accuracy so

your target anymore middle range yeah
that's<00:02:21.090> not<00:02:21.540> something<00:02:21.780> you<00:02:21.810> can<00:02:21.870> expect<00:02:22.170> the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
that's not something you can expect the

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.080 
that's not something you can expect the
boat<00:02:22.410> for<00:02:22.590> Cindy<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:22.950> do<00:02:23.040> it's<00:02:23.370> not<00:02:23.490> that<00:02:23.550> good

but if other than that it is basically

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.410 
but if other than that it is basically
optimal<00:02:28.319> at<00:02:28.470> any<00:02:28.800> range<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:30.000> is<00:02:30.120> it's

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
optimal at any range and it is it's

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.940 
optimal at any range and it is it's
pretty<00:02:30.660> insane<00:02:30.959> how<00:02:31.170> good<00:02:31.380> this<00:02:31.560> is<00:02:31.620> it<00:02:31.770> thing

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.560 
isn't really a factor i mean the recoil
you<00:03:21.959> can<00:03:22.110> compare<00:03:22.380> it<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.829> recoil<00:03:23.160> on<00:03:23.310> the

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
you can compare it to the recoil on the

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.319 
you can compare it to the recoil on the
m4a1<00:03:24.570> and<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:25.769> even<00:03:26.489> then<00:03:26.670> then<00:03:26.940> foreign<00:03:27.150> ones

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
m4a1 and and even then then foreign ones

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.060 
m4a1 and and even then then foreign ones
rico<00:03:27.600> even<00:03:27.900> though<00:03:27.989> it<00:03:28.019> is<00:03:28.200> very<00:03:28.590> noticeable

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
rico even though it is very noticeable

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.130 
rico even though it is very noticeable
it's<00:03:29.370> not<00:03:29.519> at<00:03:29.700> all<00:03:29.880> difficult<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.600> a<00:03:30.630> control

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
it's not at all difficult to a control

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.500 
it's not at all difficult to a control
so<00:03:31.530> just<00:03:31.980> apply<00:03:32.220> this<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:32.489> both<00:03:32.670> 417<00:03:33.269> as<00:03:33.360> well

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
so just apply this to both 417 as well

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.170 
so just apply this to both 417 as well
and<00:03:33.720> you<00:03:33.810> should<00:03:34.019> be<00:03:34.049> good<00:03:34.220> on<00:03:35.220> top<00:03:35.850> that<00:03:36.030> the

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
and you should be good on top that the

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.360 
and you should be good on top that the
iron<00:03:36.360> sights<00:03:36.720> on<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.320> bolt<00:03:37.590> for<00:03:37.769> 17<00:03:38.190> are

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
iron sights on the bolt for 17 are

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.460 
iron sights on the bolt for 17 are
relatively<00:03:38.880> good<00:03:39.120> as<00:03:39.239> well<00:03:39.480> I<00:03:39.690> like<00:03:40.320> them

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
relatively good as well I like them

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.050 
relatively good as well I like them
personally<00:03:40.829> I<00:03:40.890> mean<00:03:40.980> really<00:03:41.549> in<00:03:41.730> this<00:03:41.850> game

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
personally I mean really in this game

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.330 
personally I mean really in this game
there<00:03:42.299> isn't<00:03:42.630> any<00:03:42.840> like<00:03:43.530> set<00:03:43.829> of<00:03:43.950> a<00:03:44.010> sort<00:03:44.250> of

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
there isn't any like set of a sort of

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.330 
there isn't any like set of a sort of
iron<00:03:44.760> sights<00:03:45.060> that<00:03:45.209> I<00:03:45.420> don't<00:03:45.810> like<00:03:46.079> but<00:03:46.890> it<00:03:47.070> may

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
iron sights that I don't like but it may

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.000 
iron sights that I don't like but it may
be<00:03:47.720> something<00:03:48.720> that<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:49.290> know<00:03:49.380> some<00:03:49.980> people

be something that you know some people

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.069 
be something that you know some people
don't<00:03:50.459> like<00:03:50.549> the<00:03:51.060> iron<00:03:51.269> sights<00:03:51.450> only<00:03:51.780> ball<00:03:51.930> for

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
don't like the iron sights only ball for

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.110 
don't like the iron sights only ball for
17<00:03:52.410> though<00:03:52.530> is<00:03:52.680> relatively<00:03:53.459> true<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:53.940> real

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
17 though is relatively true to real

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.699 
17 though is relatively true to real
life<00:03:54.150> though<00:03:54.540> so<00:03:54.810> if<00:03:55.140> you<00:03:55.350> guys<00:03:55.470> have<00:03:55.620> ever

seen any pictures or or any other models
of<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.430> m4<00:04:00.000> 17<00:04:00.359> or<00:04:00.480> and<00:04:00.600> for<00:04:00.720> 16<00:04:01.049> for<00:04:01.260> that

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
of the m4 17 or and for 16 for that

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.930 
of the m4 17 or and for 16 for that
matter<00:04:01.620> in<00:04:01.859> real<00:04:02.190> life<00:04:02.370> or<00:04:02.400> in<00:04:02.579> other<00:04:02.700> games

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
matter in real life or in other games

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.120 
matter in real life or in other games
then<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.900> social<00:04:04.410> front<00:04:04.470> to<00:04:04.709> closed<00:04:04.950> beta

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
then the social front to closed beta

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.280 
then the social front to closed beta
does<00:04:05.430> follow<00:04:05.640> that<00:04:05.940> trend<00:04:06.750> I<00:04:06.989> guess<00:04:07.170> you<00:04:07.260> could

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
does follow that trend I guess you could

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.140 
does follow that trend I guess you could
say<00:04:07.530> it<00:04:07.650> basically<00:04:08.310> has<00:04:08.489> the<00:04:08.549> same<00:04:08.790> irons<00:04:09.060> I

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
say it basically has the same irons I

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.479 
say it basically has the same irons I
see<00:04:09.269> you<00:04:09.390> would<00:04:09.510> see<00:04:09.630> an<00:04:09.690> endgame<00:04:10.190> so<00:04:11.190> yeah<00:04:11.310> the

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
see you would see an endgame so yeah the

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.280 
see you would see an endgame so yeah the
boat<00:04:11.609> for<00:04:11.820> 17<00:04:12.239> it<00:04:12.420> is<00:04:12.600> an<00:04:12.720> extremely<00:04:13.109> good

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
boat for 17 it is an extremely good

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.289 
boat for 17 it is an extremely good
assault<00:04:13.620> rifle<00:04:13.950> one<00:04:14.549> of<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:14.730> best<00:04:15.000> in<00:04:15.209> my

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
assault rifle one of the best in my

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.300 
assault rifle one of the best in my
personal<00:04:15.540> opinion<00:04:15.750> with<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.680> fact<00:04:16.979> that<00:04:17.100> it

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
personal opinion with the fact that it

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.430 
personal opinion with the fact that it
has<00:04:17.430> it<00:04:17.669> has<00:04:17.729> basically<00:04:18.390> in<00:04:18.750> between<00:04:19.229> Dan

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
has it has basically in between Dan

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.770 
has it has basically in between Dan
shooting<00:04:19.769> the<00:04:19.859> m4<00:04:20.010> a1<00:04:20.280> and<00:04:20.579> the<00:04:20.640> ak-103<00:04:21.060> and<00:04:21.539> in

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
shooting the m4 a1 and the ak-103 and in

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.750 
shooting the m4 a1 and the ak-103 and in
between<00:04:21.959> there<00:04:22.320> or<00:04:22.560> in<00:04:22.830> between<00:04:22.950> rate<00:04:23.460> of<00:04:23.550> fire

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
between there or in between rate of fire

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.960 
between there or in between rate of fire
between<00:04:24.120> the<00:04:24.570> m4a1<00:04:25.200> and<00:04:25.380> the

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
between the m4a1 and the

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.420 
between the m4a1 and the
k<00:04:26.180> 13<00:04:26.690> so<00:04:26.930> I<00:04:27.140> would<00:04:27.500> have<00:04:27.650> to<00:04:27.800> say<00:04:27.830> that<00:04:28.250> this<00:04:28.370> is

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
k 13 so I would have to say that this is

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.780 
k 13 so I would have to say that this is
as<00:04:28.730> good<00:04:29.330> as<00:04:29.720> a<00:04:30.020> balance<00:04:30.560> between<00:04:30.680> the<00:04:31.160> m4<00:04:31.610> and

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
as good as a balance between the m4 and

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.660 
as good as a balance between the m4 and
the<00:04:31.880> AK<00:04:32.210> as<00:04:32.390> you<00:04:33.080> know<00:04:33.200> this<00:04:33.770> game<00:04:34.010> will<00:04:34.190> get<00:04:34.400> in

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
the AK as you know this game will get in

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.400 
the AK as you know this game will get in
terms<00:04:35.120> of<00:04:35.300> what<00:04:35.480> kind<00:04:35.660> of<00:04:35.690> weapon<00:04:35.990> has<00:04:36.170> that

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
terms of what kind of weapon has that

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.250 
terms of what kind of weapon has that
balance<00:04:36.740> but<00:04:37.220> again<00:04:38.000> it's<00:04:38.240> all<00:04:38.390> up<00:04:38.570> to<00:04:38.690> you<00:04:38.720> to

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
balance but again it's all up to you to

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.570 
balance but again it's all up to you to
figure<00:04:39.500> you<00:04:39.770> know<00:04:39.860> discern<00:04:40.220> that<00:04:40.370> for

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
figure you know discern that for

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.250 
figure you know discern that for
yourself<00:04:40.670> and<00:04:41.090> you<00:04:41.570> know<00:04:41.600> decide<00:04:41.990> whether<00:04:42.170> or

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
yourself and you know decide whether or

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260 
yourself and you know decide whether or
not<00:04:42.350> you<00:04:42.440> ultimately<00:04:42.920> want<00:04:43.040> to<00:04:43.340> get<00:04:43.970> this<00:04:44.120> gun

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
not you ultimately want to get this gun

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.060 
not you ultimately want to get this gun
I<00:04:44.420> personally<00:04:45.050> heavily<00:04:45.440> recommended<00:04:45.920> because

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
I personally heavily recommended because

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.950 
I personally heavily recommended because
the<00:04:46.370> bolt<00:04:46.550> for<00:04:46.700> 17<00:04:47.030> is<00:04:47.120> just<00:04:47.360> such<00:04:47.540> a<00:04:47.570> kickass

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
the bolt for 17 is just such a kickass

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.250 
the bolt for 17 is just such a kickass
gun<00:04:48.290> and<00:04:48.470> it<00:04:49.070> does<00:04:49.490> work<00:04:49.820> at<00:04:50.030> any<00:04:50.420> range<00:04:50.990> and

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260
