00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.660
 hi my name is wind to valbuena i am the 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.400
 founder and mentor of like study and 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.980
 you are seeing at this moment the team 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.470
 ninja number 27 of trimeste I remember that 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.539
 all ninja tips are videos 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.359
 specials that are tips for 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:34.240
 help you to use tries max and 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.430
 you can use it like a professional 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.840
 invest less time in making your 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.870
 projects and your works have a 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.340
 even higher quality then out of this 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.770
 I will explain what this is about 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.570
 ninja tip because as in the name 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.400
 indicates of the video we will learn to 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.620
 make wireline materials but for 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.030
 that a wired material works I'm 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.270
 doing this video because I have it 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.250
 I asked for a lot for quite some time 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.350
 I shared this project this is the photo 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.820
 real I saw on the internet and this is my 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.830
 recreation of the model in three 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.199
 dimensions this I did I am a 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.850
 original work of mine one of the 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.380
 projects I liked that 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.540
 I've seen on the internet I really like myself 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.350
 I follow many architecture magazines and 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.660
 this one I particularly loved and decided 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.160
 do it in 3d because it seemed pretty 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.130
 nice and I thought it was a good challenge 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.490
 then this is about this 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.900
 project and the photo is recreated but a 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.340
 once the course of 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.840
 photoshop and there's a class where 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.300
 taught in the photoshop course how 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.150
 make a mask show them how to create 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.430
 or how to get this mesh out this image 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.369
 wired and merge it with this image 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.140
 to create a very special effect and 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.700
 many people 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.710
 how did you do this under as you did 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.960
 you render as and 67 material as 17 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.640
 material if you have seen the course of 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.990
 study obviously when they finish the 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.240
 project course exterior architecture 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.400
 commercial will be able to make a result 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.590
 like this one if you have seen all the courses 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.420
 published in the school will know what is 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.340
 the importance that I give to this guy 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.680
 of white render but so far 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.020
 I had not been able to teach them how to make a 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.600
 render wire or how to render 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.700
 wired and the process or what I plan 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.430
 do with this video then I'm going to 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.360
 open trimax I have the same scene 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.830
 open 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.360
 ok this can be done with any 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.300
 project so I will not include the 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.739
 files plus the files of this from 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.750
 this project are included in the 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.890
 prizes available at school as well 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.160
 who can enter like study 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.750
 dotcom bar prizes and get the 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.820
 awards and help the school in the 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.800
 process although he continued with the process 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.380
 We will make all the materials 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.120
 wired I will pay efe 4 we can see 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.909
 that the project is 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.489
 created here if I render did and do a 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:44.140
 render in this case the render is going to 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.819
 take a little bit because a render scan 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.319
 line I do not have viceroy I do not have any 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.000
 render engine activated I'm just 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.489
 working with the default rendering that 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.409
 comes scan line is taking a bit 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.480
 because the resolution of my file is 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:58.209
 a little big are three thousand three hundred 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.340
 thirty pixels by 5000 so that's why 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.340
 it's going to take a little bit but it's still 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.870
 being a good render for the goal 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.819
 of this class then note that it is 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.590
 the render here and everything has a material 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.599
 white on writing has a material 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.370
 white over I will teach them to 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.650
 make them a wire render the first thing 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.989
 what you have to do is change the background or 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.819
 the background tone of the image I'm going 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.470
 to place on an almost absolute target 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.680
 this is going to do that every time I 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.989
 press a render 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.180
 the background of the image is going to be white 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.969
 I was going to make it much easier to edit it 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.109
 in photoshop another tip that I'm going to 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:32.849
 give when they are doing render 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.010
 wired is that they try to have a 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:38.579
 good resolution the larger 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.290
 the largest wireframe render but more 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.870
 versatile will be at the time of editing in 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.810
 photoshop if your original image is 1000 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.870
 pixel x 2000 then that this render 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.730
 wired be 3000 by 6000 that is to say that 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.769
 keep the same proportion of the 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.049
 original resolution this easily what 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.540
 can solve with the candadito 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:00.720
 example if my original image has 800 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.980
 pixels because the height was 1200 ok 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.609
 let's suppose that this was my image 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.260
 original 800 x 1200 but I will do the 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.459
 Wired render good let's try to 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.389
 that the wireframe render has a 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:15.629
 Higher resolution 2500 pixel by 3.750 or 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:17.729
 in my case three thousand 330 for almost 5,000 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:20.060
 pixels and this proportion is going to 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:22.550
 keep this going to be that 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.530
 the photoshop edition is very much 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.870
 easier because they are going to have a render 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.490
 with much more pixel was going to 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.800
 be clearer when editing the 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.470
 now this is a piece of advice how to create 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.970
 the material is very very simple we are going to 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.650
 open the materials palette I'm going to 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.380
 support in a new sphere and I'm going to 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.889
 call wire material or material 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:48.129
 wired 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:50.199
 Wire material or wire material ok and 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:51.939
 we are simply going to select the color 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.249
 of what is going to be our wire in this 

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:55.599
 case I want it to be black if I display 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:57.310
 the sphere and I see them outside I see that no 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:59.710
 nothing absolutely nothing is happening 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.749
 but the key is here to turn on this 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.310
 option in the wire option when the 

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:05.289
 I'm going to be able to see all the 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.870
 wired structure that conforms this 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:09.480
 geometry 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.610
 and now it's just as simple as 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.920
 have the entire selection filter in the 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.290
 to be able to select all press 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.810
 control and to select everything that 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.120
 is in the scene apply this 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.120
 material think that immediately what 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.710
 let's be able to see in the render forgiveness in 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.180
 the video because I work all wire 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.409
 because now we 're seeing it wire 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.089
 and we are going to apply a render 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:33.499
 this render again is going to take a 

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:35.779
 a little bit of time because the resolution 

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:37.099
 It's very big but you can see what it looks like 

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:39.229
 the entire wire structure of the 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:41.389
 project and again while more 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:43.849
 big is the project the more 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:45.439
 big the resolution for better because 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:47.360
 notice that there is more control over these 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:49.219
 lines still these lines are being 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.889
 pixelated a little bit so they could even 

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:54.110
 make this bigger image abuse this 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:56.800
 option can abuse because it 's a render 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.939
 scan innovates on saturating the 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.309
 or processor capacity 

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:03.079
 computer processing and it's going to 

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:05.749
 allow having this wireframe render 

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:07.459
 perfect to be able to create that kind of 

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:10.399
 montages that I taught you in the course of 

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:12.469
 photoshop then I hope it serves you already 

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:15.559
 you know how to create this wireframe render 

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:17.989
 please use it to your advantage and 

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:19.789
 make these nice montages 

00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:21.259
 for the sale of your weeks this is 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:23.089
 everything for this video I hope you have them 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:25.639
 served a very big hug and 

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:27.919
 remember to visit 23 studio dotcom there 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:30.529

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:32.479
 that can watch for free on one Spanish 

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:34.249
 hug very big until then and before 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:35.990
