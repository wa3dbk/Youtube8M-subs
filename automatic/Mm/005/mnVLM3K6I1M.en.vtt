coin tumbler for free it's a it's an old
printer<00:00:28.929> I<00:00:29.109> got<00:00:29.529> it<00:00:29.650> from<00:00:29.740> a<00:00:29.849> recycling<00:00:30.849> center

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
printer I got it from a recycling center

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.780 
printer I got it from a recycling center
Canon<00:00:32.439> printers<00:00:32.920> usually<00:00:33.400> have<00:00:33.520> the<00:00:33.610> best

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
Canon printers usually have the best

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.880 
Canon printers usually have the best
layout<00:00:34.090> and<00:00:34.540> it's<00:00:35.140> really<00:00:35.380> easy<00:00:35.440> to<00:00:35.710> work<00:00:35.830> with

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
layout and it's really easy to work with

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.620 
layout and it's really easy to work with
them<00:00:36.130> just<00:00:36.280> rip<00:00:36.490> them<00:00:36.670> apart<00:00:36.700> and<00:00:37.210> the<00:00:37.270> motors

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.630 
them just rip them apart and the motors

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.030 
them just rip them apart and the motors
in<00:00:37.750> the<00:00:37.840> right<00:00:37.960> place<00:00:38.230> and<00:00:38.560> you<00:00:38.650> really<00:00:38.860> don't

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
in the right place and you really don't

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.670 
in the right place and you really don't
have<00:00:39.160> to<00:00:39.250> do<00:00:39.400> much<00:00:40.050> as<00:00:41.050> you<00:00:41.170> can<00:00:41.320> see<00:00:41.440> with<00:00:41.590> this

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
have to do much as you can see with this

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.980 
have to do much as you can see with this
one<00:00:41.860> as<00:00:41.950> well<00:00:42.070> it's<00:00:42.280> actually<00:00:42.790> running<00:00:43.210> it's

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:43.990 
one as well it's actually running it's

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.690 
one as well it's actually running it's
going<00:00:44.200> to<00:00:44.260> roll<00:00:44.410> the<00:00:44.560> two<00:00:44.800> rollers<00:00:45.160> you<00:00:45.340> can

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:45.700 
going to roll the two rollers you can

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.610 
going to roll the two rollers you can
see<00:00:45.850> the<00:00:46.330> first<00:00:46.720> one's<00:00:46.930> got<00:00:47.050> a<00:00:47.080> belt<00:00:47.260> on<00:00:47.440> is

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
see the first one's got a belt on is

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.080 
see the first one's got a belt on is
that<00:00:47.950> go<00:00:48.100> straight<00:00:48.160> to<00:00:48.460> the<00:00:48.520> motor<00:00:48.760> and<00:00:49.030> then

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
that go straight to the motor and then

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.360 
that go straight to the motor and then
there's<00:00:49.330> a<00:00:49.390> small<00:00:50.290> agir<00:00:50.740> between<00:00:51.070> the<00:00:51.160> two<00:00:51.280> of

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
there's a small agir between the two of

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.710 
there's a small agir between the two of
them<00:00:51.460> that<00:00:51.610> drives<00:00:51.820> the<00:00:52.000> second<00:00:52.360> roller<00:00:52.540> as

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
them that drives the second roller as

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.980 
them that drives the second roller as
well<00:00:52.870> so<00:00:53.080> just<00:00:53.640> if<00:00:54.640> your<00:00:54.940> pass<00:00:55.420> is<00:00:55.600> a<00:00:55.630> bit<00:00:55.810> heavy

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:55.990 
well so just if your pass is a bit heavy

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.280 
well so just if your pass is a bit heavy
to<00:00:56.080> steadily<00:00:56.980> turn<00:00:57.100> it<00:00:57.250> no<00:00:57.370> no<00:00:57.760> hassle<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:59.140> can

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
to steadily turn it no no hassle you can

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.480 
to steadily turn it no no hassle you can
see<00:00:59.440> here<00:00:59.680> I've<00:00:59.800> sought<00:01:00.010> our<00:01:00.160> two<00:01:00.280> wires

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:00.490 
see here I've sought our two wires

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.020 
see here I've sought our two wires
directly<00:01:00.730> onto<00:01:01.270> the<00:01:01.750> motor<00:01:01.900> +<00:01:02.380> -<00:01:02.890> I<00:01:03.100> need<00:01:03.700> 12

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
directly onto the motor + - I need 12

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.880 
directly onto the motor + - I need 12
volts<00:01:04.390> then<00:01:04.570> to<00:01:04.780> run<00:01:04.989> that<00:01:05.140> motor<00:01:05.409> so<00:01:05.740> what<00:01:05.859> I

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
volts then to run that motor so what I

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.590 
volts then to run that motor so what I
did<00:01:06.130> is<00:01:06.310> while<00:01:06.850> I<00:01:06.880> was<00:01:07.090> at<00:01:07.210> the<00:01:07.299> recycling

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
did is while I was at the recycling

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.709 
did is while I was at the recycling
center<00:01:07.840> I<00:01:08.439> got<00:01:09.310> a<00:01:09.579> power<00:01:09.850> supply<00:01:10.060> from<00:01:10.450> an<00:01:10.539> old

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:10.719 
center I got a power supply from an old

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:16.020 
center I got a power supply from an old
PC<00:01:12.929> so<00:01:13.950> when<00:01:14.950> you<00:01:15.189> get<00:01:15.340> your<00:01:15.490> power<00:01:15.640> supply<00:01:15.789> be

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
PC so when you get your power supply be

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.989 
PC so when you get your power supply be
like<00:01:16.149> this<00:01:16.329> and<00:01:16.630> you'll<00:01:16.810> have<00:01:16.960> a<00:01:17.729> ton<00:01:18.729> of<00:01:18.759> wires

00:01:18.989 --> 00:01:18.999 
like this and you'll have a ton of wires

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:23.219 
like this and you'll have a ton of wires
coming<00:01:19.359> out<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:19.859> PC<00:01:20.859> side<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.810> you'll<00:01:23.049> see

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
coming out the PC side and you'll see

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:24.870 
coming out the PC side and you'll see
the<00:01:23.320> big<00:01:23.469> connector<00:01:23.920> it's<00:01:24.039> usually<00:01:24.189> got<00:01:24.399> 20<00:01:24.759> or

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
the big connector it's usually got 20 or

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.919 
the big connector it's usually got 20 or
24<00:01:25.329> connections<00:01:25.810> on<00:01:25.960> it<00:01:26.079> and<00:01:27.600> see<00:01:28.600> here<00:01:28.810> this

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:28.929 
24 connections on it and see here this

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:33.059 
24 connections on it and see here this
is<00:01:29.109> a<00:01:29.140> multi<00:01:29.530> so<00:01:30.009> I<00:01:30.039> can<00:01:30.429> do<00:01:30.579> 20<00:01:31.240> or<00:01:31.359> 24<00:01:31.859> but<00:01:32.859> what

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:33.069 
is a multi so I can do 20 or 24 but what

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:34.620 
is a multi so I can do 20 or 24 but what
you're<00:01:33.219> looking<00:01:33.460> for<00:01:33.670> is<00:01:33.909> you<00:01:34.179> can<00:01:34.329> see<00:01:34.450> in<00:01:34.569> the

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
you're looking for is you can see in the

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.340 
you're looking for is you can see in the
bottom<00:01:34.840> left<00:01:34.990> it's<00:01:35.859> the<00:01:36.130> yellow<00:01:36.429> cable<00:01:36.880> there

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
bottom left it's the yellow cable there

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.169 
bottom left it's the yellow cable there
that<00:01:38.350> is<00:01:38.619> 12<00:01:38.979> volts<00:01:39.249> plus<00:01:39.399> and<00:01:39.789> we're<00:01:40.090> just

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
that is 12 volts plus and we're just

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:41.580 
that is 12 volts plus and we're just
going<00:01:40.359> to<00:01:40.420> pick<00:01:40.569> one<00:01:40.600> of<00:01:40.749> the<00:01:40.869> blacks<00:01:41.079> any<00:01:41.380> one

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
going to pick one of the blacks any one

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.830 
going to pick one of the blacks any one
that<00:01:41.740> will<00:01:41.859> do<00:01:41.979> it's<00:01:42.219> not<00:01:42.399> and<00:01:42.719> that'll<00:01:43.719> give

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
that will do it's not and that'll give

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.410 
that will do it's not and that'll give
us<00:01:43.869> a<00:01:43.960> full<00:01:44.079> circuit<00:01:44.789> so<00:01:45.789> that's<00:01:46.090> just<00:01:46.270> running

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
us a full circuit so that's just running

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.779 
us a full circuit so that's just running
straight<00:01:46.780> into<00:01:47.499> the<00:01:48.100> motor<00:01:48.280> from<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.579> power

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
straight into the motor from the power

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:51.270 
straight into the motor from the power
supply<00:01:49.060> and<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:50.409> only<00:01:50.560> other<00:01:50.770> thing<00:01:51.009> with<00:01:51.189> the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
supply and the only other thing with the

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.300 
supply and the only other thing with the
power<00:01:51.460> supply<00:01:51.609> is<00:01:51.939> because<00:01:52.270> it's<00:01:52.450> from<00:01:52.600> a<00:01:52.659> PC

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
power supply is because it's from a PC

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.889 
power supply is because it's from a PC
any<00:01:54.310> power<00:01:54.639> supply<00:01:54.909> is<00:01:54.969> really<00:01:55.270> from<00:01:55.450> a<00:01:55.479> PC

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
any power supply is really from a PC

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.099 
any power supply is really from a PC
you're<00:01:56.889> going<00:01:57.100> to<00:01:57.189> have<00:01:57.310> to<00:01:57.459> jump<00:01:57.789> to<00:01:58.119> cables

00:01:59.099 --> 00:01:59.109 
you're going to have to jump to cables

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:00.989 
you're going to have to jump to cables
in<00:01:59.259> the<00:01:59.350> center<00:01:59.649> center<00:02:00.459> of<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.579> picture<00:02:00.759> here

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:00.999 
in the center center of the picture here

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:02.999 
in the center center of the picture here
I'll<00:02:01.090> show<00:02:01.240> you<00:02:01.270> now<00:02:01.450> to<00:02:01.509> the<00:02:02.109> limey<00:02:02.350> green<00:02:02.770> one

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
I'll show you now to the limey green one

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.690 
I'll show you now to the limey green one
and<00:02:03.219> again<00:02:03.939> any<00:02:04.359> of<00:02:04.479> the<00:02:04.569> blacks<00:02:05.249> this<00:02:06.249> is

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
and again any of the blacks this is

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.180 
and again any of the blacks this is
and<00:02:08.110> usually<00:02:09.110> don't<00:02:09.410> when<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:09.649> connect<00:02:09.950> it<00:02:10.039> to

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
and usually don't when you connect it to

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.620 
and usually don't when you connect it to
the<00:02:10.280> motherboard<00:02:10.310> of<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.819> PC<00:02:11.150> it'll<00:02:11.360> do<00:02:11.450> this

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
the motherboard of the PC it'll do this

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.000 
the motherboard of the PC it'll do this
automatically<00:02:12.200> but<00:02:12.410> if<00:02:12.500> you're<00:02:12.590> not<00:02:12.709> plugging

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
automatically but if you're not plugging

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.400 
automatically but if you're not plugging
it<00:02:13.190> into<00:02:13.370> a<00:02:13.400> PC<00:02:13.849> itself<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:15.110> want<00:02:15.319> the

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
it into a PC itself and you want the

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.690 
it into a PC itself and you want the
power<00:02:15.530> supply<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:15.890> run<00:02:16.010> you're<00:02:16.370> going<00:02:16.520> to<00:02:16.610> have

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
power supply to run you're going to have

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:30.880 
power supply to run you're going to have
to<00:02:16.849> jump<00:02:17.090> these<00:02:17.209> two<00:02:17.420> cables

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.280 

so<00:02:31.460> here<00:02:31.850> you<00:02:31.940> can<00:02:32.000> see<00:02:32.360> I've<00:02:32.600> done<00:02:32.660> the

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
so here you can see I've done the

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.140 
so here you can see I've done the
connection<00:02:33.590> nice<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.160> easy<00:02:34.280> in<00:02:34.580> close<00:02:34.940> to<00:02:35.090> the

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150

power supply and of course I've I've

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.030 
power supply and of course I've I've
used<00:02:38.170> insulating<00:02:39.170> tape<00:02:39.200> just<00:02:39.590> to<00:02:39.680> cover<00:02:39.860> up

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
used insulating tape just to cover up

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.840 
used insulating tape just to cover up
the<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:40.700> expose<00:02:41.060> wires<00:02:42.340> so<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.490> way<00:02:43.580> I<00:02:43.610> turn

sure if they're doing any good aren't
them<00:03:51.769> but<00:03:51.890> we'll<00:03:52.040> try<00:03:52.190> them<00:03:52.340> for<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:52.580> time

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
them but we'll try them for the time

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.140 
them but we'll try them for the time
being<00:03:52.940> and<00:03:54.130> don't<00:03:55.130> overfill<00:03:55.549> the<00:03:55.640> part<00:03:55.850> I<00:03:56.000> mean

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
being and don't overfill the part I mean

being and don't overfill the part I mean
it's<00:03:56.450> a<00:03:56.540> small<00:03:56.660> enough<00:03:56.930> motor<00:03:57.200> you<00:03:57.680> can<00:03:57.709> do<00:03:57.980> 10

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
it'd be too abrasive

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.790

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
pot and then just stick it between the

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.120 
whatsoever it's running a bit sluggish
here<00:04:40.410> because<00:04:42.530> it's<00:04:43.530> just<00:04:43.650> it<00:04:43.830> seems<00:04:43.919> to<00:04:44.070> be

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
here because it's just it seems to be

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.920 
here because it's just it seems to be
sweet<00:04:44.400> but<00:04:44.580> if<00:04:44.729> I<00:04:44.789> just<00:04:44.940> go<00:04:45.060> down<00:04:45.300> one<00:04:45.720> of<00:04:45.840> the

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
sweet but if I just go down one of the

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.930 
sweet but if I just go down one of the
rubber<00:04:46.080> grips<00:04:46.440> again<00:04:46.740> just<00:04:47.430> go<00:04:47.520> down<00:04:47.669> further

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
rubber grips again just go down further

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.270 
rubber grips again just go down further
away<00:04:48.240> from<00:04:48.449> the<00:04:48.509> motor<00:04:48.690> it'll<00:04:49.080> spin<00:04:49.320> fair<00:04:50.160> bit

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
away from the motor it'll spin fair bit

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.589 
away from the motor it'll spin fair bit
faster<00:04:50.720> if<00:04:52.220> the<00:04:53.220> motor<00:04:53.880> gets<00:04:54.090> hot<00:04:54.150> standing

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
faster if the motor gets hot standing

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:56.540 
faster if the motor gets hot standing
stages<00:04:54.930> well<00:04:55.050> use<00:04:55.349> the<00:04:55.560> exhaust<00:04:55.979> from<00:04:56.490> the

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
stages well use the exhaust from the

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.820 
stages well use the exhaust from the
power<00:04:56.880> supply<00:04:57.120> it's<00:04:58.080> usually<00:04:58.229> pretty<00:04:58.470> cold

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
power supply it's usually pretty cold

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:59.900 
power supply it's usually pretty cold
because<00:04:59.009> the<00:04:59.130> power<00:04:59.280> supply<00:04:59.490> isn't<00:04:59.669> really

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
because the power supply isn't really

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.640 
because the power supply isn't really
doing<00:05:00.030> any<00:05:00.270> work<00:05:00.419> to<00:05:00.750> power<00:05:00.960> that<00:05:01.139> motor<00:05:01.380> and

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
doing any work to power that motor and

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.070 
doing any work to power that motor and
that'll<00:05:02.520> just<00:05:02.610> keep<00:05:02.789> a<00:05:02.880> nice<00:05:03.000> stream<00:05:03.539> of<00:05:03.750> cold

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
that'll just keep a nice stream of cold

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.860 
that'll just keep a nice stream of cold
air<00:05:04.229> just<00:05:04.530> going<00:05:04.710> over<00:05:04.770> your<00:05:04.860> motor<00:05:05.509> as<00:05:06.509> I<00:05:06.690> said

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
air just going over your motor as I said

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.600 
air just going over your motor as I said
I've<00:05:07.020> left<00:05:07.199> this<00:05:07.320> running<00:05:07.650> for<00:05:07.949> general<00:05:08.220> 24

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
I've left this running for general 24

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.200 
I've left this running for general 24
hours<00:05:08.849> and<00:05:09.060> it's<00:05:10.160> the<00:05:11.160> motor<00:05:11.370> stays<00:05:11.910> cool

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
hours and it's the motor stays cool

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.570 
hours and it's the motor stays cool
still<00:05:13.020> running<00:05:13.349> don't<00:05:13.650> think<00:05:13.830> it's<00:05:13.949> doing<00:05:14.370> is

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
still running don't think it's doing is

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.610 
still running don't think it's doing is
it<00:05:14.699> is<00:05:14.820> taken<00:05:15.240> on<00:05:15.509> the<00:05:16.020> front<00:05:16.229> roller<00:05:16.409> there

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
it is taken on the front roller there

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.620 
it is taken on the front roller there
closest<00:05:17.310> to<00:05:17.430> us<00:05:17.460> it<00:05:17.699> has<00:05:17.820> rubber<00:05:18.060> feet<00:05:18.330> on<00:05:18.539> the

closest to us it has rubber feet on the

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.629 
closest to us it has rubber feet on the
back<00:05:19.440> one<00:05:19.680> it<00:05:19.770> has<00:05:19.889> like<00:05:20.039> a<00:05:20.070> ceramic<00:05:20.460> finish
