so<00:02:23.579> let's<00:02:23.760> review<00:02:23.939> the<00:02:24.719> three<00:02:25.019> things<00:02:25.230> that

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
so let's review the three things that

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.500 
so let's review the three things that
are<00:02:25.560> needed<00:02:25.799> to<00:02:25.920> create<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.670> sustain<00:02:26.909> a<00:02:27.180> fire

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510

so<00:02:41.130> far<00:02:41.430> we<00:02:41.610> have<00:02:41.730> discussed<00:02:41.880> what<00:02:42.420> is<00:02:42.540> needed

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
so far we have discussed what is needed

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.410 
so far we have discussed what is needed
to<00:02:43.080> create<00:02:43.350> and<00:02:43.740> sustain<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.280> fire<00:02:44.790> we<00:02:45.300> have

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
to create and sustain a fire we have

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.690 
to create and sustain a fire we have
also<00:02:45.660> discussed<00:02:46.380> how<00:02:46.470> fire<00:02:46.920> or<00:02:47.190> heat<00:02:47.459> is

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
also discussed how fire or heat is

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.090 
also discussed how fire or heat is
transferred<00:02:48.390> now<00:02:49.080> we<00:02:49.140> will<00:02:49.560> go<00:02:49.709> over<00:02:49.740> the

transferred now we will go over the

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.770

three<00:02:50.430> things<00:02:50.640> that<00:02:50.819> influence<00:02:51.510> fire

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
three things that influence fire

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
remember when discussing terrain is

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.870 
remember when discussing terrain is
slope<00:03:42.480> slope<00:03:43.410> refers<00:03:43.830> to<00:03:43.860> how<00:03:44.220> steep<00:03:44.670> a<00:03:44.850> hill

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610

for example the slope leading up to this

why<00:03:54.170> is<00:03:54.230> that<00:03:54.409> important<00:03:55.099> because<00:03:55.280> fire<00:03:56.120> moves

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
why is that important because fire moves

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.080 
why is that important because fire moves

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
of the weather factors that affect fire

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.510 
of the weather factors that affect fire
behavior<00:04:51.660> are<00:04:51.960> the<00:04:52.140> Sun<00:04:52.440> which<00:04:52.830> heats<00:04:53.220> things

behavior are the Sun which heats things

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.510 
behavior are the Sun which heats things

dynamic influence on fire behavior but

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.030 
dynamic influence on fire behavior but
its<00:05:06.060> greatest<00:05:06.420> influence<00:05:07.050> comes<00:05:07.380> from<00:05:07.800> the

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
its greatest influence comes from the

is<00:05:37.740> the<00:05:38.070> one<00:05:38.400> thing<00:05:38.730> that<00:05:38.790> we<00:05:39.180> can<00:05:39.600> do<00:05:39.780> a<00:05:39.810> great

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.230 
is the one thing that we can do a great

there is one final thing we should
discuss<00:06:08.350> as<00:06:08.590> we<00:06:08.620> begin<00:06:09.010> to<00:06:09.220> understand<00:06:09.730> fire

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.840 
established in larger taller fuels you
are<00:06:55.750> now<00:06:55.960> at<00:06:56.169> risk<00:06:56.200> of<00:06:56.620> larger<00:06:57.070> flame<00:06:57.370> lengths

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:57.850 
are now at risk of larger flame lengths

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.659 
are now at risk of larger flame lengths
blowing<00:06:58.330> Sparks<00:06:58.840> and<00:06:58.990> embers<00:06:59.979> as<00:07:00.280> well<00:07:00.520> as

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:00.669 
blowing Sparks and embers as well as

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:02.790 
blowing Sparks and embers as well as
increased<00:07:01.120> fire<00:07:01.419> behavior<00:07:01.960> as<00:07:02.110> the<00:07:02.320> main<00:07:02.470> fire

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 
increased fire behavior as the main fire

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.370 
increased fire behavior as the main fire
becomes<00:07:03.160> exposed<00:07:03.700> to<00:07:03.910> the<00:07:04.030> wind<00:07:04.240> if<00:07:04.540> at<00:07:05.350> all

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:05.380 
becomes exposed to the wind if at all

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.650 
becomes exposed to the wind if at all
possible<00:07:05.590> it<00:07:06.310> is<00:07:06.340> best<00:07:06.460> to<00:07:06.850> keep<00:07:06.970> an<00:07:07.180> oncoming

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:07.660 
possible it is best to keep an oncoming

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.400 
possible it is best to keep an oncoming
wildfire<00:07:08.350> on<00:07:08.620> the<00:07:08.800> ground

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:11.410 

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:14.379 

so<00:07:12.410> let's<00:07:12.620> review<00:07:12.880> what<00:07:13.880> are<00:07:13.970> the<00:07:14.120> three

00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:14.389 
so let's review what are the three

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:16.409 
so let's review what are the three
things<00:07:14.419> that<00:07:14.930> affect<00:07:15.229> wildfire<00:07:15.800> behavior

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:16.419 
things that affect wildfire behavior

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:21.700 
things that affect wildfire behavior
fuels<00:07:17.650> topography<00:07:18.650> and<00:07:18.860> weather<00:07:20.590> what<00:07:21.590> are

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:21.710 
fuels topography and weather what are

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:23.939 
fuels topography and weather what are
the<00:07:21.860> three<00:07:22.160> ways<00:07:22.400> that<00:07:22.430> heat<00:07:22.910> is<00:07:23.090> transferred

00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:23.949 
the three ways that heat is transferred

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:28.730 
the three ways that heat is transferred
radiation<00:07:24.949> convection<00:07:25.720> conduction

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:28.740 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.200 

what<00:07:29.740> are<00:07:29.860> the<00:07:30.010> three<00:07:30.280> things<00:07:30.310> needed<00:07:31.030> to

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:31.210 
what are the three things needed to

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:34.430 
what are the three things needed to
create<00:07:31.450> and<00:07:31.810> sustain<00:07:31.990> fire<00:07:32.760> oxygen<00:07:33.760> heats

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:34.440 
create and sustain fire oxygen heats

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.920 
create and sustain fire oxygen heats
fuel

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:36.930 
fuel

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.100 
fuel
and<00:07:37.729> finally<00:07:38.729> what<00:07:39.210> do<00:07:39.330> we<00:07:39.419> call<00:07:39.630> the<00:07:39.810> fuels

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:40.110 
and finally what do we call the fuels

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:41.960 
and finally what do we call the fuels
that<00:07:40.199> can<00:07:40.320> move<00:07:40.650> a<00:07:40.800> wildfire<00:07:41.310> from<00:07:41.520> the<00:07:41.699> ground

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:41.970 
that can move a wildfire from the ground

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:46.350 
that can move a wildfire from the ground
into<00:07:42.300> the<00:07:42.479> trees<00:07:43.039> latter<00:07:44.039> fuels

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:46.360 
into the trees latter fuels

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.420 
into the trees latter fuels
now<00:07:47.169> that<00:07:47.349> we<00:07:47.439> have<00:07:47.560> become<00:07:47.860> familiar<00:07:48.039> with

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:48.430 
now that we have become familiar with

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.119 
now that we have become familiar with
some<00:07:48.849> basic<00:07:49.270> wildfire<00:07:49.810> terminology<00:07:50.650> as<00:07:50.860> well

00:07:51.119 --> 00:07:51.129 
some basic wildfire terminology as well

00:07:51.129 --> 00:07:53.640 
some basic wildfire terminology as well
as<00:07:51.250> some<00:07:51.460> basic<00:07:51.669> wildfire<00:07:52.479> behavior<00:07:53.050> let's

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:53.650 
as some basic wildfire behavior let's

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:56.070 
as some basic wildfire behavior let's
move<00:07:53.919> on<00:07:54.129> and<00:07:54.400> explore<00:07:54.789> what<00:07:55.030> you<00:07:55.270> can<00:07:55.509> do<00:07:55.780> to

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.080 
move on and explore what you can do to

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.749 
move on and explore what you can do to
improve<00:07:56.560> the<00:07:56.800> chances<00:07:57.280> of<00:07:57.310> your<00:07:57.520> home

00:07:57.749 --> 00:07:57.759 
improve the chances of your home

00:07:57.759 --> 00:08:00.810 
improve the chances of your home
surviving<00:07:58.330> a<00:07:58.389> wildfire
