the game and it is just incredible I
can't<00:00:47.489> believe<00:00:47.700> how<00:00:47.879> fast<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.079> guys

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
can't believe how fast it is so you guys

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.569 
can't believe how fast it is so you guys
want<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.500> make<00:00:49.649> sure<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.920> follow<00:00:50.160> what<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.489> do

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
want to make sure you follow what I do

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.160 
want to make sure you follow what I do
in<00:00:50.969> this<00:00:51.059> video<00:00:51.390> when<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.719> comes<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
in this video when it comes to the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.500 
in this video when it comes to the
tuning<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:53.340> if<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.699> do<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.059> then<00:00:54.329> you'll

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
tuning and if you do that then you'll

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.810 
tuning and if you do that then you'll
have<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.870> same<00:00:55.199> exact<00:00:55.739> speed<00:00:56.100> as<00:00:56.309> what<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.520> get

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
have the same exact speed as what I get

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.819 
have the same exact speed as what I get
in<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.090> video<00:00:57.390> not<00:00:58.050> too<00:00:58.289> hard

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
in this video not too hard

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.069 
in this video not too hard
I<00:00:58.859> made<00:00:59.670> an<00:00:59.760> all-wheel<00:01:00.149> drive<00:01:00.390> because<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.809> is

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
I made an all-wheel drive because it is

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.560 
I made an all-wheel drive because it is
faster<00:01:01.500> off<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.859> line<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.850> has<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:03.030> faster

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
faster off the line and it has a faster

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.859 
faster off the line and it has a faster
top-end<00:01:03.809> speed<00:01:04.100> for<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.189> spoiler<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:06.630> want

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
top-end speed for the spoiler you want

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.810 
top-end speed for the spoiler you want
to<00:01:06.960> make<00:01:07.110> sure<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.500> upgrade<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.490> conus

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
to make sure you upgrade it to the conus

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.480 
to make sure you upgrade it to the conus
ex<00:01:09.000> spoiler<00:01:09.450> do<00:01:10.229> not<00:01:10.439> leave<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.650> stock<00:01:11.040> because

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
ex spoiler do not leave it stock because

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.600 
ex spoiler do not leave it stock because
you<00:01:11.640> will<00:01:11.909> gain<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.740> point<00:01:13.740> one<00:01:14.040> mile<00:01:14.280> per<00:01:14.520> hour

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
you will gain a point one mile per hour

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.810 
you will gain a point one mile per hour
if<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.150> upgrade<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.920> know<00:01:17.040> when<00:01:17.729> you

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
if you upgrade it and you know when you

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.030 
if you upgrade it and you know when you
get<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.180> these<00:01:18.330> high<00:01:18.600> speeds<00:01:19.020> every<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:20.009> know

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
get to these high speeds every you know

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.880 
get to these high speeds every you know
point<00:01:20.640> mile-per-hour<00:01:20.939> counts<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.770> know

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
point mile-per-hour counts so you know

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.490 
point mile-per-hour counts so you know
even<00:01:23.850> though<00:01:23.970> it's<00:01:24.150> only<00:01:24.330> by<00:01:24.509> 0.1<00:01:25.110> that's

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
even though it's only by 0.1 that's

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.140 
even though it's only by 0.1 that's
still<00:01:25.860> matters<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.520> if<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.700> want<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.970> get<00:01:27.119> a

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
still matters so if you want to get a

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.090 
still matters so if you want to get a
faster<00:01:27.720> car<00:01:27.930> make<00:01:28.409> sure<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.680> upgrade<00:01:29.070> the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
faster car make sure you upgrade the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.429 
faster car make sure you upgrade the
rear<00:01:29.460> ring<00:01:29.700> as<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.659> can<00:01:30.810> see<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.020> did<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.380> that

doesn't affect your car you know more it
doesn't<00:01:54.509> affect<00:01:54.780> your<00:01:54.899> speed<00:01:55.350> like<00:01:55.680> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
doesn't affect your speed like the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.260 
doesn't affect your speed like the
top-end<00:01:55.979> speed<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.579> car<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:56.820> should<00:01:56.880> say

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
top-end speed of the car I should say

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.209 
top-end speed of the car I should say
unless<00:01:58.110> if<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.500> know<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.680> do<00:01:58.890> something

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
unless if you know you do something

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.950 
unless if you know you do something
completely<00:01:59.729> stupid<00:02:00.420> then<00:02:00.719> you'll<00:02:00.840> probably

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
completely stupid then you'll probably

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.020 
completely stupid then you'll probably
make<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.380> slower<00:02:01.680> but<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.490> can't<00:02:02.729> really<00:02:02.909> make

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
make it slower but you can't really make

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.850 
make it slower but you can't really make
it<00:02:03.090> faster<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:03.810> then<00:02:04.229> when<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.409> comes<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.740> the

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
it faster and then when it comes to the

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.560 
it faster and then when it comes to the
diff<00:02:05.070> as<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.399> can<00:02:05.520> see<00:02:05.700> here<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.360> want<00:02:06.509> to

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
diff as you can see here you want to

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.690 
diff as you can see here you want to
make<00:02:06.659> sure<00:02:06.840> where<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.009> diff<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.459> at<00:02:08.610> the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
make sure where the diff is at the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.190 
make sure where the diff is at the
bottom<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.239> have<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.539> at<00:02:09.629> 96<00:02:10.289> percent<00:02:10.709> not<00:02:10.920> a

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
bottom you have it at 96 percent not a

won't<00:02:13.420> get<00:02:13.690> it<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.080> speed<00:02:14.349> that<00:02:14.470> I<00:02:14.530> get<00:02:14.739> in

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
won't get it to the speed that I get in

won't get it to the speed that I get in
this<00:02:15.010> video<00:02:15.340> make<00:02:16.060> sure<00:02:16.209> you<00:02:16.300> put<00:02:16.480> at<00:02:16.599> 96%
