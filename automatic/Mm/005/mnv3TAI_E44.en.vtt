00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
probably a little bit less than two

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.910 
probably a little bit less than two
years<00:02:02.340> but<00:02:02.610> this<00:02:03.540> was<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.810> rooftop<00:02:04.409> before<00:02:04.590> the

years but this was a rooftop before the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.270 
years but this was a rooftop before the
rooftop<00:02:05.250> from<00:02:05.700> 2k<00:02:05.969> even<00:02:06.479> existed<00:02:06.990> as<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.160> can

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
rooftop from 2k even existed as you can

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.240 
rooftop from 2k even existed as you can
see<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.429> didn't<00:02:08.670> know<00:02:08.729> how<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:08.940> change<00:02:09.360> the

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
see I didn't know how to change the

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.710 
see I didn't know how to change the
brightness<00:02:11.250> settings<00:02:11.640> on<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.420> court<00:02:12.630> the

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
brightness settings on the court the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.320 
brightness settings on the court the
light<00:02:12.840> maps<00:02:13.050> so<00:02:13.980> that's<00:02:14.100> why<00:02:14.250> we<00:02:14.459> have<00:02:14.670> all

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
light maps so that's why we have all

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.100 
light maps so that's why we have all
these<00:02:15.840> dark<00:02:16.440> areas<00:02:16.650> on<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.130> court<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:18.110> the

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
these dark areas on the court and the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.010 
these dark areas on the court and the
roof<00:02:19.459> shaped<00:02:20.459> the<00:02:20.580> way<00:02:20.700> it<00:02:20.790> is<00:02:20.940> but<00:02:21.750> it's<00:02:21.959> just

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
roof shaped the way it is but it's just

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.949 
roof shaped the way it is but it's just
a<00:02:22.140> simple<00:02:22.470> rooftop<00:02:22.980> court<00:02:23.310> with<00:02:23.610> some

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
a simple rooftop court with some

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.440 
a simple rooftop court with some
buildings<00:02:24.959> in<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.140> background<00:02:26.209> still<00:02:27.209> pretty

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
buildings in the background still pretty

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.090 
buildings in the background still pretty
basic<00:02:27.600> stuff<00:02:27.870> I<00:02:28.020> mean<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.170> could<00:02:28.350> probably<00:02:28.560> do<00:02:29.070> a

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
basic stuff I mean I could probably do a

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.699 
basic stuff I mean I could probably do a
lot<00:02:29.430> better<00:02:29.670> job<00:02:29.880> now<00:02:30.390> I<00:02:30.690> have<00:02:31.110> my<00:02:31.230> templates

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
lot better job now I have my templates

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.440 
lot better job now I have my templates
and<00:02:31.830> everything<00:02:32.330> this<00:02:33.330> was<00:02:33.510> done<00:02:33.690> before<00:02:33.840> I

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
and everything this was done before I

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.240 
and everything this was done before I
could<00:02:36.450> remove<00:02:37.290> people<00:02:37.739> walking<00:02:38.130> in<00:02:38.220> the

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
could remove people walking in the

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.890 
could remove people walking in the
background<00:02:38.459> which<00:02:38.790> is<00:02:38.910> why<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.090> had<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.510> extend

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
background which is why I had to extend

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.800 
background which is why I had to extend
the<00:02:40.110> roof<00:02:40.920> back<00:02:41.489> as<00:02:41.730> far<00:02:41.940> as<00:02:42.030> I<00:02:42.120> could<00:02:42.330> I

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
the roof back as far as I could I

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.979 
the roof back as far as I could I
couldn't<00:02:43.530> get<00:02:44.220> rid<00:02:44.250> of<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.720> stands<00:02:45.720> I

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
couldn't get rid of the stands I

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.229 
couldn't get rid of the stands I
couldn't<00:02:46.260> get<00:02:46.380> rid<00:02:46.590> of<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:47.640> fences<00:02:48.030> in<00:02:48.150> the

NBA live practice one which is terribly

I<00:03:26.459> don't<00:03:26.640> know<00:03:26.700> what<00:03:26.820> else<00:03:26.970> that<00:03:27.030> really<00:03:27.299> is<00:03:27.390> to

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
I don't know what else that really is to

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.449 
I don't know what else that really is to
say<00:03:27.660> about<00:03:27.750> it

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
say about it

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.789

god<00:03:29.459> I've<00:03:29.910> come<00:03:30.239> a<00:03:30.269> long<00:03:30.510> way<00:03:30.930> well<00:03:31.500> actually<00:03:31.650> I

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
god I've come a long way well actually I

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.380 
god I've come a long way well actually I
really<00:03:32.010> haven't<00:03:32.190> because<00:03:32.579> the<00:03:32.760> last<00:03:32.940> course<00:03:33.269> I

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
really haven't because the last course I

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.850 
really haven't because the last course I
really<00:03:33.570> made<00:03:33.720> were<00:03:33.930> midnight<00:03:34.230> ballers<00:03:34.590> and

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
really made were midnight ballers and

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.110 
really made were midnight ballers and
that's<00:03:34.980> as<00:03:35.130> lazy<00:03:35.340> as<00:03:35.489> you<00:03:35.640> can<00:03:35.760> get<00:03:35.910> when<00:03:36.030> it

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
that's as lazy as you can get when it

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.319 
that's as lazy as you can get when it
comes<00:03:36.269> to<00:03:36.360> environments<00:03:36.870> so<00:03:37.850> this<00:03:38.850> was<00:03:39.060> made

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
comes to environments so this was made

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.490 
comes to environments so this was made
using<00:03:39.600> I<00:03:40.079> think<00:03:40.140> it<00:03:40.410> was<00:03:40.560> Rucker<00:03:40.829> day<00:03:41.310> as<00:03:41.610> the

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
using I think it was Rucker day as the

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.130 
using I think it was Rucker day as the
the<00:03:43.500> base<00:03:44.480> what<00:03:45.480> you<00:03:45.600> know<00:03:45.690> that's<00:03:45.840> smart<00:03:46.110> and

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
the base what you know that's smart and

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.470 
the base what you know that's smart and
everything<00:03:46.470> to<00:03:46.560> do<00:03:46.680> but<00:03:47.610> you<00:03:48.209> know<00:03:48.299> there's

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
everything to do but you know there's

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.130 
everything to do but you know there's
still<00:03:48.660> so<00:03:48.930> much<00:03:49.049> more<00:03:49.320> I<00:03:49.350> could<00:03:49.470> have<00:03:49.769> done<00:03:51.140> in

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
still so much more I could have done in

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.449 
still so much more I could have done in
terms<00:03:52.320> of<00:03:52.590> just<00:03:52.769> getting<00:03:52.950> rid<00:03:53.070> of<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.250> things

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
terms of just getting rid of the things

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.220 
terms of just getting rid of the things
that<00:03:53.610> you<00:03:53.730> can't<00:03:54.000> get<00:03:54.090> rid<00:03:54.269> of<00:03:54.299> because<00:03:54.840> as<00:03:55.049> we

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
that you can't get rid of because as we

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.720 
that you can't get rid of because as we
see<00:03:55.350> him<00:03:55.470> in<00:03:55.560> my<00:03:55.590> ballers<00:03:55.980> using<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.340> stadiums

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
see him in my ballers using the stadiums

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.729 
see him in my ballers using the stadiums
I<00:03:57.030> can<00:03:57.510> get<00:03:57.630> rid<00:03:57.750> of<00:03:57.870> anything<00:03:58.140> and<00:03:58.440> make

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
I can get rid of anything and make

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.069 
I can get rid of anything and make
