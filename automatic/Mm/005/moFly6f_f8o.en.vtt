00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
like one of these torsos but exploded by

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.330 
like one of these torsos but exploded by
green<00:01:57.749> fire<00:01:57.780> which<00:01:58.319> I<00:01:58.439> presume<00:01:58.679> is<00:01:58.799> when<00:01:58.950> Morel

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
green fire which I presume is when Morel

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.309 
green fire which I presume is when Morel
possesses<00:01:59.759> him<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.569> think<00:02:00.630> that's<00:02:01.020> really

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:01.319 
possesses him so I think that's really

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:03.109 
possesses him so I think that's really
cool<00:02:01.499> that<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.829> looks<00:02:02.069> like<00:02:02.249> battle<00:02:02.700> damaged

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
cool that it looks like battle damaged

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.289 
cool that it looks like battle damaged

they have the same arms they've the same
torso<00:04:27.090> printing<00:04:27.450> just<00:04:27.600> slightly<00:04:28.500> different

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
torso printing just slightly different

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.070 
torso printing just slightly different
for<00:04:29.400> each<00:04:29.430> one<00:04:29.700> the<00:04:30.300> same<00:04:30.450> kind<00:04:30.690> of<00:04:30.720> patterns

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
for each one the same kind of patterns

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.460 
for each one the same kind of patterns
in<00:04:31.229> different<00:04:31.729> patterns<00:04:32.729> as<00:04:32.880> you<00:04:32.910> can<00:04:33.120> see<00:04:33.470> we

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
in different patterns as you can see we

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.749 
in different patterns as you can see we
have<00:04:34.560> a<00:04:34.590> ninja<00:04:34.830> mask<00:04:35.490> I<00:04:35.880> think<00:04:36.810> this<00:04:36.960> is<00:04:37.250> yokai

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 
have a ninja mask I think this is yokai

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:42.110 
have a ninja mask I think this is yokai
so<00:04:39.240> that's<00:04:39.689> the<00:04:39.990> mask<00:04:40.430> different<00:04:41.430> masks<00:04:41.669> just

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
so that's the mask different masks just

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.619 
so that's the mask different masks just
like<00:04:42.599> I<00:04:42.949> don't<00:04:43.949> know<00:04:44.189> half<00:04:44.909> mask<00:04:45.330> from

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:45.629 
like I don't know half mask from

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:48.350 
like I don't know half mask from

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.159 
the headpiece is awesome else it's
actually<00:05:41.219> I<00:05:41.370> feel<00:05:41.699> like<00:05:41.849> like<00:05:42.300> it<00:05:42.419> was<00:05:42.509> a<00:05:42.539> bit

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
actually I feel like like it was a bit

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:44.779 
actually I feel like like it was a bit
lazy<00:05:43.439> your<00:05:43.830> doesn't<00:05:44.009> matter<00:05:44.399> to<00:05:44.550> me<00:05:44.580> because

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789 
lazy your doesn't matter to me because

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:46.399 
lazy your doesn't matter to me because
they're<00:05:44.879> mostly<00:05:45.060> covered<00:05:45.479> but<00:05:45.990> a<00:05:46.020> bit<00:05:46.229> lazy

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:46.409 
they're mostly covered but a bit lazy

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:48.829 
they're mostly covered but a bit lazy
because<00:05:46.800> the<00:05:47.039> face<00:05:47.759> print<00:05:48.120> things<00:05:48.330> are<00:05:48.539> the

00:05:48.829 --> 00:05:48.839 
because the face print things are the

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:51.019 
because the face print things are the
same<00:05:49.139> on<00:05:49.499> these<00:05:49.680> two<00:05:49.919> figures<00:05:50.159> but<00:05:50.819> they<00:05:50.909> are

00:05:51.019 --> 00:05:51.029 
same on these two figures but they are

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:52.519 
same on these two figures but they are
generic<00:05:51.300> ghost<00:05:51.599> soldiers<00:05:51.779> that<00:05:52.139> doesn't<00:05:52.439> make

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:52.529 
generic ghost soldiers that doesn't make

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:54.829 
generic ghost soldiers that doesn't make

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
which I'll go over it a little bit and

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.629 
which I'll go over it a little bit and

00:06:02.239 --> 00:06:02.249 
back which really makes it look like

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:05.659 
back which really makes it look like
this<00:06:02.459> kind<00:06:02.669> of<00:06:02.729> gradient<00:06:03.689> fading<00:06:04.469> away<00:06:04.669> which

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669 
this kind of gradient fading away which

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:07.939 
this kind of gradient fading away which
looks<00:06:06.060> really<00:06:06.930> cool<00:06:07.139> and<00:06:07.529> then<00:06:07.740> they<00:06:07.830> also

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:07.949 
looks really cool and then they also

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:09.290 
looks really cool and then they also
have<00:06:08.129> the<00:06:08.189> mint<00:06:08.399> green<00:06:08.459> hands<00:06:08.879> which<00:06:09.089> really

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
have the mint green hands which really

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.149 
have the mint green hands which really
contributes<00:06:09.959> to<00:06:10.050> their<00:06:10.169> ghost<00:06:10.379> look<00:06:10.620> alright

00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:11.159
