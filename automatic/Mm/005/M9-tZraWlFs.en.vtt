getting<00:00:04.410> a<00:00:04.440> lot<00:00:04.560> of<00:00:04.589> questions<00:00:04.980> lately<00:00:05.130> about

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
getting a lot of questions lately about

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.629 
getting a lot of questions lately about
thermogenic<00:00:05.940> fat<00:00:06.089> burners<00:00:06.660> I<00:00:07.560> don't<00:00:08.490> really

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
thermogenic fat burners I don't really

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.830 
thermogenic fat burners I don't really
like<00:00:08.970> using<00:00:09.780> thermogenic<00:00:10.590> fat<00:00:10.620> burners<00:00:11.219> or

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 
like using thermogenic fat burners or

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.450 
like using thermogenic fat burners or
anything<00:00:12.840> with<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.230> word<00:00:13.349> thermogenic<00:00:13.920> in<00:00:14.280> it

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
anything with the word thermogenic in it

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.939 
anything with the word thermogenic in it
for<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.059> couple<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.420> reasons<00:00:15.570> one<00:00:16.020> there<00:00:16.800> isn't

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
for a couple of reasons one there isn't

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.950 
for a couple of reasons one there isn't
really<00:00:17.340> any<00:00:17.730> compound<00:00:18.359> that's<00:00:18.480> ever<00:00:18.750> been

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
proven to be actually thermogenic most

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.870 
proven to be actually thermogenic most
of<00:00:22.439> these<00:00:23.779> products<00:00:24.779> are<00:00:25.670> products<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:26.760> are

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
going to make you you know super

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.680 
going to make you you know super
stimulated<00:00:30.810> they're<00:00:31.349> gonna<00:00:31.500> make<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:32.660> have<00:00:33.660> a

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
little bit of higher energy they're

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.690 
little bit of higher energy they're
gonna<00:00:35.010> suppress<00:00:35.460> your<00:00:35.610> appetite<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:37.700> right

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
during the process they're going to

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.600 
during the process they're going to
maybe<00:00:42.540> increase<00:00:43.020> your<00:00:43.230> caloric<00:00:43.500> burn<00:00:44.129> just<00:00:44.430> a

and what you have to understand is that

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.799 
and what you have to understand is that
fat<00:00:52.829> doesn't<00:00:53.160> just<00:00:53.579> friggin<00:00:54.090> melt<00:00:54.360> off<00:00:54.600> your

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
fat doesn't just friggin melt off your

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:55.340 
fat doesn't just friggin melt off your
body

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
body

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.990 
body
fat<00:00:56.309> has<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.940> process<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:57.989> which<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.829> needs<00:00:59.730> to

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
fat has a process in which it needs to

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.619 
fat has a process in which it needs to
be<00:01:00.320> taken<00:01:01.320> out<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.710> cell<00:01:02.239> mobilized<00:01:03.239> and

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
be taken out of the cell mobilized and

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.359 
be taken out of the cell mobilized and
then<00:01:04.199> released<00:01:04.589> into<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.100> bloodstream

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
then released into the bloodstream

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.630 
then released into the bloodstream
before<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.450> can<00:01:06.570> actually<00:01:06.780> be<00:01:07.369> oxidized<00:01:08.369> or

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
before it can actually be oxidized or

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.130 
before it can actually be oxidized or
burnt<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:11.490> thing<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:12.030> none<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.900> these

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
burnt the thing is none of these

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.890 
burnt the thing is none of these
so-called<00:01:13.799> thermogenic<00:01:14.640> products<00:01:15.210> actually

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
so-called thermogenic products actually

so-called thermogenic products actually
do<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.759> there<00:01:17.759> are<00:01:17.939> some<00:01:18.210> great<00:01:18.630> things<00:01:18.990> you

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
do this there are some great things you

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.550 
do this there are some great things you
can<00:01:19.710> do<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.250> increase<00:01:20.430> fat<00:01:20.970> mobilization<00:01:21.560> but

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
can do to increase fat mobilization but

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.640 
can do to increase fat mobilization but
it's<00:01:23.130> not<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.400> simply<00:01:24.390> it's<00:01:24.930> not<00:01:25.110> just<00:01:25.350> simply

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.899 
able to just pop out of there
you<00:01:58.290> need<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.530> have<00:01:58.710> some<00:01:58.950> sort<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.280> medium<00:01:59.670> for
