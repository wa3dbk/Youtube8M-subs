questions about how the NEX six dozen in
lower<00:00:07.500> light<00:00:07.770> so<00:00:08.730> I've<00:00:09.030> done<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.480> quick<00:00:09.660> test

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
lower light so I've done a quick test

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.330 
lower light so I've done a quick test
here<00:00:10.050> just<00:00:10.440> put<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.590> few<00:00:10.769> things<00:00:10.800> on<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.160> table

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
here just put a few things on the table

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.670 
here just put a few things on the table
set<00:00:12.150> up<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.360> light<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:13.490> right<00:00:14.490> now<00:00:14.639> it's<00:00:14.969> in

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
set up a light and right now it's in

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.769 
set up a light and right now it's in
aperture<00:00:16.680> priority<00:00:16.859> mode<00:00:17.340> with<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:18.000> Fuji<00:00:18.690> on

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779

thirty five-millimeter

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.090 
thirty five-millimeter
F<00:00:19.830> one<00:00:20.070> point<00:00:20.310> seven<00:00:20.670> wide-open<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:22.100> what

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
F one point seven wide-open and what

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.980 
F one point seven wide-open and what
that<00:00:23.220> means<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.539> camera<00:00:24.750> will

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
that means is that the camera will

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.769 
that means is that the camera will
automatically<00:00:25.529> control<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.130> shutter<00:00:26.340> speed

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
automatically control the shutter speed

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.830 
automatically control the shutter speed
when<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:27.810> change<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.380> ISO<00:00:28.849> so<00:00:29.849> right<00:00:30.599> now<00:00:30.750> I'm

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
when I change the ISO so right now I'm

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.770 
when I change the ISO so right now I'm
moving<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.710> ISOs<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.969> exposure<00:00:33.420> looks

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
moving the ISOs and the exposure looks

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.170 
moving the ISOs and the exposure looks
like<00:00:34.020> I'm<00:00:34.230> not<00:00:34.410> changing<00:00:34.649> anything<00:00:35.180> but

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
like I'm not changing anything but

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.069 
like I'm not changing anything but
that's<00:00:36.329> because<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.780> camera<00:00:37.050> is

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
that's because the camera is

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.350 
that's because the camera is
automatically<00:00:38.180> compensating<00:00:39.180> for<00:00:39.270> the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
automatically compensating for the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.940 
automatically compensating for the
exposure<00:00:39.660> with<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.020> shutter<00:00:40.850> so<00:00:42.800> here<00:00:43.800> we<00:00:43.920> are

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
exposure with the shutter so here we are

00:00:43.950 --> 00:01:02.099 
exposure with the shutter so here we are
at<00:00:44.280> iso<00:00:44.789> 100<00:00:47.480> iso<00:00:48.480> 200<00:00:52.610> 400<00:00:57.260> 800

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:11.830 

sixteen<00:01:03.109> hundred<00:01:06.790> thirty<00:01:07.790> two<00:01:08.000> hundred<00:01:10.840> and

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
sixteen hundred thirty two hundred and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.450 
sixteen hundred thirty two hundred and
then<00:01:12.200> finally<00:01:12.530> 6400<00:01:14.170> as<00:01:15.170> you<00:01:15.350> can<00:01:15.470> see<00:01:15.619> at<00:01:15.710> 6400
