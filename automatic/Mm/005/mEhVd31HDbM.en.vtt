this is an old ant that has a molex plug
as<00:01:03.460> you<00:01:03.550> can<00:01:03.699> see<00:01:03.940> it<00:01:04.059> even<00:01:04.120> has<00:01:04.480> the<00:01:04.839> model

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
as you can see it even has the model

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.520 
as you can see it even has the model
number<00:01:05.710> there<00:01:05.890> on<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.310> molex<00:01:06.909> plug<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:08.409> we've

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
number there on the molex plug and we've

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.700 
number there on the molex plug and we've
got<00:01:08.680> a<00:01:08.710> nice<00:01:09.570> ice<00:01:10.570> a<00:01:10.810> nice<00:01:11.050> there's<00:01:11.560> not<00:01:11.680> a

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
got a nice ice a nice there's not a

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.330 
got a nice ice a nice there's not a
whole<00:01:11.890> lot<00:01:11.920> nice<00:01:12.340> about<00:01:12.730> having<00:01:13.090> these<00:01:14.340> wiring

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
whole lot nice about having these wiring

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.800 
whole lot nice about having these wiring
harnesses<00:01:15.880> instead<00:01:16.240> of<00:01:16.360> having<00:01:16.540> terminal

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
harnesses instead of having terminal

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.420 
harnesses instead of having terminal
strip<00:01:17.229> so<00:01:17.380> as<00:01:17.500> you<00:01:17.590> can<00:01:17.710> see<00:01:18.300> looks<00:01:19.300> like<00:01:20.430> about

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
strip so as you can see looks like about

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.480 
strip so as you can see looks like about
10<00:01:21.850> maybe<00:01:22.120> 12<00:01:22.540> gauge<00:01:22.930> power<00:01:23.770> wire<00:01:24.070> coming<00:01:24.400> out

p.m.<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:35.770> 2030<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:38.590> as<00:02:39.040> you<00:02:39.190> can<00:02:39.340> see<00:02:39.400> it's<00:02:39.880> a

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
p.m. a 2030 and as you can see it's a

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.220 
p.m. a 2030 and as you can see it's a
small<00:02:40.420> app<00:02:40.810> as<00:02:41.110> we<00:02:41.620> would<00:02:41.740> expect<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:43.810> outputs

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
small app as we would expect the outputs

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.140 
small app as we would expect the outputs
up<00:02:44.620> here<00:02:44.950> sandwich<00:02:45.550> them<00:02:45.730> between<00:02:46.030> the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
up here sandwich them between the

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.750 
up here sandwich them between the
heatsink<00:02:46.600> get<00:02:47.380> some<00:02:47.560> more<00:02:48.270> in<00:02:49.270> this<00:02:49.450> end

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
heatsink get some more in this end

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.440 
heatsink get some more in this end
rather<00:02:51.760> small<00:02:52.150> toroid<00:02:53.080> and<00:02:53.709> small<00:02:54.520> caps<00:02:54.819> again

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
rather small toroid and small caps again

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.320 
rather small toroid and small caps again
this<00:02:55.569> is<00:02:55.720> only<00:02:56.010> 30<00:02:57.010> watts<00:02:57.280> by<00:02:57.550> 2<00:02:57.610> so<00:02:58.060> it's<00:02:58.209> not

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
this is only 30 watts by 2 so it's not

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.530 
this is only 30 watts by 2 so it's not
going<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:58.569> be<00:02:58.660> a<00:02:58.690> big<00:02:58.840> power<00:02:59.080> now<00:03:00.540> something

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
going to be a big power now something

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.330 
going to be a big power now something
that<00:03:01.660> may<00:03:01.810> happen<00:03:02.200> with<00:03:02.319> old<00:03:02.620> apps<00:03:02.830> you<00:03:03.190> can

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
that may happen with old apps you can

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.720 
that may happen with old apps you can
probably<00:03:03.610> see<00:03:03.910> there<00:03:04.769> unsightly<00:03:05.769> caps<00:03:06.220> have

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
probably see there unsightly caps have

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.540 
probably see there unsightly caps have
leaked<00:03:07.769> onto<00:03:08.769> the<00:03:09.040> board

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
leaked onto the board

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.580 
leaked onto the board
those<00:03:10.269> are<00:03:10.540> 35<00:03:11.170> volt<00:03:12.570> 1000<00:03:13.570> micro<00:03:13.870> farad<00:03:14.080> and

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
those are 35 volt 1000 micro farad and

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.650 
those are 35 volt 1000 micro farad and
there's<00:03:14.920> another<00:03:16.110> 50<00:03:17.110> volt<00:03:18.090> 1000<00:03:19.090> micro<00:03:19.330> farad

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
there's another 50 volt 1000 micro farad

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.600 
there's another 50 volt 1000 micro farad
which<00:03:19.810> is<00:03:19.989> leaked<00:03:21.209> so<00:03:22.769> this<00:03:23.769> amp<00:03:23.980> still<00:03:24.340> works

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
which is leaked so this amp still works

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.520 
which is leaked so this amp still works
and<00:03:24.850> it<00:03:24.940> turns<00:03:25.180> on<00:03:25.450> but<00:03:25.810> I<00:03:26.080> would<00:03:26.350> not

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
and it turns on but I would not

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.990 
and it turns on but I would not
recommend<00:03:27.480> using<00:03:28.480> it<00:03:28.840> for<00:03:29.580> long<00:03:30.580> without

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
recommend using it for long without

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000 
recommend using it for long without
changing<00:03:31.690> out<00:03:31.810> those<00:03:31.989> caps<00:03:32.319> and<00:03:32.590> cleaning<00:03:32.890> up

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
changing out those caps and cleaning up

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.479 
changing out those caps and cleaning up
those<00:03:34.769> electrolytic<00:03:35.769> fluid<00:03:36.100> there<00:03:36.250> that's

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
those electrolytic fluid there that's

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.420 
those electrolytic fluid there that's
dried<00:03:36.760> up<00:03:37.000> so<00:03:37.420> anyway<00:03:37.840> let<00:03:38.799> me<00:03:38.860> put<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.130> bottom

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
dried up so anyway let me put the bottom

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.740 
dried up so anyway let me put the bottom
back<00:03:39.579> on<00:03:39.730> real<00:03:39.880> quick<00:03:40.120> and<00:03:40.299> I've<00:03:40.390> just<00:03:40.510> got<00:03:40.690> a

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
back on real quick and I've just got a

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.170 
back on real quick and I've just got a
little<00:03:41.100> test<00:03:42.100> speaker<00:03:42.370> here<00:03:42.670> we'll<00:03:42.820> just<00:03:42.850> try

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
little test speaker here we'll just try

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.759 
little test speaker here we'll just try
it<00:03:43.239> out<00:03:43.390> and<00:03:43.450> just<00:03:43.720> see<00:03:43.870> if<00:03:43.900> it<00:03:44.049> works<00:03:44.260> so<00:03:44.620> give

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
it out and just see if it works so give

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:51.610 
it out and just see if it works so give
me<00:03:44.860> just<00:03:45.040> a<00:03:45.130> second

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:58.580 

right<00:03:52.620> now<00:03:53.190> the<00:03:53.250> sonic<00:03:53.790> PM<00:03:54.150> a<00:03:55.370> 2030<00:03:57.590> is

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
right now the sonic PM a 2030 is

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.850 
right now the sonic PM a 2030 is
powering<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.970> speaker<00:04:00.360> it<00:04:00.720> does<00:04:00.930> work<00:04:03.860> I've

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
powering the speaker it does work I've

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.009 
powering the speaker it does work I've
got<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.310> microphone<00:04:05.910> faced<00:04:06.269> toward<00:04:06.629> me<00:04:06.780> see

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
got the microphone faced toward me see

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.270 
got the microphone faced toward me see
man<00:04:07.170> I've<00:04:07.319> had<00:04:07.440> to<00:04:07.500> hear<00:04:07.650> it<00:04:07.680> very<00:04:07.890> well<00:04:08.010> but<00:04:08.160> it

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
man I've had to hear it very well but it

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.059 
man I've had to hear it very well but it
is<00:04:08.370> working<00:04:08.790> so<00:04:09.260> amp<00:04:10.260> does<00:04:10.410> work<00:04:10.650> there's<00:04:10.890> not

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
is working so amp does work there's not

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.720 
is working so amp does work there's not
any<00:04:11.930> LED<00:04:12.930> or<00:04:13.080> anything<00:04:13.380> on<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.709> panel<00:04:14.400> to<00:04:14.580> let

any LED or anything on the panel to let
you<00:04:14.819> know<00:04:14.940> that<00:04:15.090> it's<00:04:15.209> turned<00:04:15.480> on<00:04:15.660> but<00:04:16.049> it<00:04:16.500> is

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
you know that it's turned on but it is

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.629 
you know that it's turned on but it is
