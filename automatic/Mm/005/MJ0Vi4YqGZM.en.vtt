00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.200
 I first start by asking my base 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.150
 on my eye 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.820

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.020
 palette of bold blushes I will come 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:36.840
 only to pose also below 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:38.610

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.309
 so take this color so the color 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.330
 blitz of the pallet rhb indicated the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:50.850
 ball is so with a flat brush 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:53.720
 like this and so I come to ask it on 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.720
 the entire eyelid 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.229

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:33.350
 outer corner going inward 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:38.470
