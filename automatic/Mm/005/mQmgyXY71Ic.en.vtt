00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
doing nothing not only that is the

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.640 
doing nothing not only that is the
biggest<00:03:21.740> thing<00:03:22.040> for<00:03:22.070> me<00:03:22.250> is<00:03:22.400> uh<00:03:22.810> come<00:03:23.810> when<00:03:24.530> we

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
biggest thing for me is uh come when we

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.220 
biggest thing for me is uh come when we
get<00:03:24.770> back<00:03:24.920> to<00:03:25.100> LA<00:03:25.220> 29th<00:03:25.760> up<00:03:25.940> leave<00:03:26.150> we<00:03:27.050> go<00:03:27.170> to

adapt<00:03:27.470> but<00:03:27.680> I<00:03:27.740> think<00:03:28.040> we<00:03:28.490> have<00:03:28.610> about<00:03:28.730> 12<00:03:29.570> to<00:03:29.780> 14

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230
