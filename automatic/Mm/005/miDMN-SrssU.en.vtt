00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:07.180
Hey guys, Kevin and Ryan from ExtremeTerrain.com
and we are here at Bantam Festival 2015 celebrating

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.810
75 years of Jeep.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.840
There is no better place on the planet than
right here, right now to reveal finally to

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.140
the public Project Trail Force, our 2015 Rubicon
that we are giving away.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.140
Absolutely.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.830
In conjunction with Barricade, we've built
this Jeep full Barricade armor, ripp supercharger,

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.780
rock krawler, long arm, coil over suspension.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.800
Anything and everything you could want in
a Jeep, and someone's going to win it.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.960
And there's been a ton of people coming over,
checking it out, smoking it over, and a lot

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.870
of people have commented on the fact that
it's not a trailer queen.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.289
There's dirt in the suspension.

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:39.019
We took this sucker off road and put it through
its paces, and let me tell you what it performed

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:41.030
great on and off road.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.219

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.979
It looks fantastic.

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.330
It really looks great.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.230
I mean we beat the heck out of it off road
and it does great on road.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.000
Let's see your stuff on the inside.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.240
Let me tell you, man, for a dual-purpose rig
these floor mats are awesome because we wheeled

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.670
this thing in the mud, and it's clotty, concrete
mud when it dries.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.880
I was able to pull these mats out, power wash
them out, hang them, wash the rest of the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.170
Jeep, and I didn't mess my carpet up.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.219
Yeah, that's perfect.

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:39.219
That's awesome.

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:40.219
That's why we designed them.

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:43.729
They have the deep treads to hold all the
mud and slush and whatever.

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.659
Yup, and me as the short guy.

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.170
I want to thank you, too, for the grab handles.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.170
For one of those.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.310
I can get in this thing without looking like
an idiot, so thank you very much for that.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.499
This is a pretty cool rig.

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:59.859
The X Factor long arm kit on it with the coil
lovers, it looks like it's pretty badass.

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:01.740
It's definitely going to go wherever you want
to point it.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.420
It's trail tested and the guy that wins it,
we're not going to be able to smack the grin

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.420
off of him.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.420
No, he's one lucky person.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.420
Yeah.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.420
He or she.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.420
Yeah.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.420
Well thank you so much for helping us with
this rig.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.730
We know that it's good quality stuff on it.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.480
Now today's what we've been waiting for.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.920
We're done talking, now it's time to start
wheeling and this is going to be a good one.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.920
Absolutely.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.440
We've got a Project Trail Force out on the
trail today.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.180
We're going to hit all the on-site trails,
we're going to hit the playground, I cannot

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.180
wait to get through that.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.170
Yeah, and I think I saw a car wash on the
way out of town so no worries.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.170
Let's hit it.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.170
Let's get the quarters ready.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.070
All right, here we go.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.161
First major trail of the day.

00:02:37.161 --> 00:02:38.161
Muddy slop, good ruts.

00:02:38.161 --> 00:02:39.161
Nice and off-camber.

00:02:39.161 --> 00:02:45.910
Yeah, and the confidence that the gear ratio,
the lockers...

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:54.180
Yup... the 37's, and the armor gives me driving
it.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:01.370
I don't feel as if I'm going anywhere with
this thing.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.430
Our first big downhill obstacle.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.401
I can see nothing but hood and horizon.

00:03:05.401 --> 00:03:07.280
Throw it in first gear and stare at the ground.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.480
Here we go.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.010
That is a steep one.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.750
Oh mama.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.040
Okay, my foot is not on the brake.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.280
This is awesome.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.200
We're gearing down this on first gear.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.880
These trails are sloppy.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:35.910
Going for the deep stuff, here we go.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.130
There's that supercharger.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.610
Finally, playground.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.830
I Love it.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:56.500
After hitting those trails we'll see what
this has to offer.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:26.230
It looks pretty cool.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.100
Definitely picked the most challenging trail.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.730
Flexing the legs a little bit of Project Trail
Force.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:31.730
We know it can handle it.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.490
This is just going to be fun.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.740
Found a slider.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.160
There you go.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.740
That's what they're there for.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.382
Yeah, I think you got it there.

00:04:46.382 --> 00:04:49.650
Left-side tire and just make sure you don't
fall off the edge here.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.770
Keep as far left as we can.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.920
That's what you get these bumpers for, man.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.920
That's an approach angle.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.650
The approach the departure, we used the sliders
once or twice.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.260
We armored this thing for a reason.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.090
Barricade hooked us up and it worked.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.170
Man, what an incredible time.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.150
Bantam Jeep Festival celebrating 75 years
of Jeep.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.330
We set a world record for the longest Jeep
parade.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.700
Talked to a ton of people, talked to a ton
of great vendors, had a bunch of fun.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:15.700
Met some great people.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.770
We did and my favorite part was running the
trails.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.990
We hit all the on-site trails, we hit the
playground over here, really got to stretch

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.050
the legs of Project Trail Force.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.060
We knew what it could do from before, but
this just confirms it.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.060
Absolutely.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.750
And remember guys, you could win this rig.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.720
The winner's going to get the keys handed

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.000
