the<00:01:42.689> reason<00:01:42.990> I'm<00:01:43.079> taking<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.350> plus<00:01:43.649> half

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
the reason I'm taking that plus half

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.350 
the reason I'm taking that plus half
goal<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.280> due<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.670> fact<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:44.939> we<00:01:45.119> could

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
goal is due to the fact that we could

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.969 
goal is due to the fact that we could
see<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.540> time<00:01:45.780> match<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.229> 90<00:01:46.500> minutes<00:01:46.740> time

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
see a time match in the 90 minutes time

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.830 
see a time match in the 90 minutes time
of<00:01:47.130> regulation<00:01:47.640> which<00:01:48.240> would<00:01:48.450> mean<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.630> they

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
of regulation which would mean that they

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.179 
of regulation which would mean that they
would<00:01:48.960> have<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.170> go<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.320> extra<00:01:49.680> times<00:01:49.920> and

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
would have to go to extra times and

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.310 
would have to go to extra times and
penalties<00:01:50.640> if<00:01:50.790> necessary<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.780> if<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.110> does

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
penalties if necessary so if that does

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.690 
penalties if necessary so if that does
happen<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:52.799> half<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.100> goal<00:01:53.280> gives<00:01:53.460> us<00:01:53.640> a

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
happen this half a goal gives us a

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.310 
happen this half a goal gives us a
winning<00:01:54.000> ticket<00:01:54.149> without<00:01:54.600> having<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.140> worry

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
winning ticket without having to worry

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.289 
winning ticket without having to worry
of<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.619> final<00:01:55.890> outcome<00:01:56.009> if<00:01:56.340> Colombia<00:01:56.790> doesn't

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
of the final outcome if Colombia doesn't

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.270 
of the final outcome if Colombia doesn't
win<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.479> regulation<00:01:57.689> time<00:01:57.960> which<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.799> highly

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
win in regulation time which I highly

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.039 
win in regulation time which I highly
doubt<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.640> will<00:02:00.000> happen<00:02:00.030> since<00:02:00.540> Uruguay<00:02:00.990> is

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
doubt that will happen since Uruguay is

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.260 
doubt that will happen since Uruguay is
