hey you might want to do one more video
for<00:00:02.010> you<00:00:02.220> guys<00:00:02.399> talking<00:00:03.060> about<00:00:03.149> octane

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
for you guys talking about octane

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.480 
for you guys talking about octane
ratings<00:00:04.230> and<00:00:04.440> why<00:00:04.620> it's<00:00:04.799> important

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
ratings and why it's important

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.369 
ratings and why it's important
I<00:00:05.520> don't<00:00:06.240> remember<00:00:06.390> my<00:00:06.690> first<00:00:06.930> video<00:00:07.230> if<00:00:07.319> I

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
I don't remember my first video if I

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.530 
I don't remember my first video if I
talked<00:00:07.680> about<00:00:07.919> it<00:00:08.010> at<00:00:08.099> all<00:00:08.400> but<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:08.970> wanted<00:00:09.420> to

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
talked about it at all but I wanted to

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.240 
talked about it at all but I wanted to
kind<00:00:09.719> of<00:00:09.780> go<00:00:09.900> end<00:00:10.290> up<00:00:10.440> with<00:00:10.620> it<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:10.950> make<00:00:11.219> sure

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
kind of go end up with it and make sure

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.430 
kind of go end up with it and make sure
people<00:00:11.730> realize<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.450> importance<00:00:12.929> of<00:00:13.170> an

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
people realize the importance of an

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.210 
people realize the importance of an
octane<00:00:13.769> rating<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.250> everything<00:00:14.549> else<00:00:15.740> so<00:00:16.740> for

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
octane rating and everything else so for

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.640 
octane rating and everything else so for
bikes<00:00:17.490> especially<00:00:18.390> on<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.810> sport<00:00:19.109> bike<00:00:19.170> as<00:00:19.529> you

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
bikes especially on a sport bike as you

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.490 
bikes especially on a sport bike as you
can<00:00:19.800> see<00:00:20.010> this<00:00:20.250> one<00:00:20.460> red<00:00:20.699> lines<00:00:20.939> at<00:00:21.150> 13<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.960> don't

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
can see this one red lines at 13 I don't

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.689 
can see this one red lines at 13 I don't
know<00:00:22.560> if<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:22.769> guys<00:00:22.890> didn't<00:00:23.189> see<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.430> or<00:00:23.609> not

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
know if you guys didn't see that or not

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.910 
know if you guys didn't see that or not
but<00:00:24.029> it's<00:00:24.539> much<00:00:24.960> higher<00:00:25.199> than<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.470> car<00:00:25.680> which

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
but it's much higher than the car which

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.160 
but it's much higher than the car which
could<00:00:26.189> stop<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.640> 5<00:00:26.970> on<00:00:27.330> like<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.539> diesel<00:00:27.779> truck

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
could stop it 5 on like a diesel truck

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.589 
could stop it 5 on like a diesel truck
or<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.500> could<00:00:28.650> stop<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.070> maybe<00:00:29.250> 9<00:00:29.820> or<00:00:29.849> 10<00:00:30.269> for<00:00:30.570> a

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
or it could stop it maybe 9 or 10 for a

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.060 
or it could stop it maybe 9 or 10 for a
high<00:00:30.750> performance<00:00:31.260> vehicle<00:00:31.679> or<00:00:31.769> things<00:00:31.980> like

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
high performance vehicle or things like

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.260 
high performance vehicle or things like
that

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
that

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.080 
that
the<00:00:33.630> biggest<00:00:34.170> deal<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.890> it's<00:00:35.579> all<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:35.850> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
the biggest deal is it's all in the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.459 
the biggest deal is it's all in the
compression<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.809> how<00:00:37.050> how<00:00:37.410> high<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:37.710> rpm<00:00:38.340> is

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
compression and how how high that rpm is

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:42.350 
compression and how how high that rpm is
that<00:00:40.469> when<00:00:40.620> an<00:00:40.710> octane<00:00:41.040> rating<00:00:41.239> especially<00:00:42.239> on

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
that when an octane rating especially on

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.420 
that when an octane rating especially on
a<00:00:42.690> car<00:00:43.020> everyone<00:00:43.829> thinks<00:00:44.070> oh<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.250> get<00:00:44.370> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
a car everyone thinks oh you get the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.549 
a car everyone thinks oh you get the
higher<00:00:44.610> octane<00:00:45.030> B<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.750> know<00:00:45.870> because<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.410> has

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
higher octane B you know because it has

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.369 
higher octane B you know because it has
a<00:00:46.640> better<00:00:47.640> miles<00:00:47.940> per<00:00:48.180> gallon<00:00:48.510> some<00:00:49.140> people

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
a better miles per gallon some people

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.810 
a better miles per gallon some people
say<00:00:49.590> some<00:00:49.739> people<00:00:49.980> have<00:00:50.190> proven<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.700> said

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
say some people have proven it and said

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.459 
say some people have proven it and said
it's<00:00:50.940> not<00:00:51.059> true<00:00:51.270> some<00:00:51.600> people<00:00:51.629> say<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.230> true

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
it's not true some people say it is true

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.549 
it's not true some people say it is true
I<00:00:52.829> really<00:00:53.610> don't<00:00:54.449> care<00:00:54.510> about<00:00:54.870> miles<00:00:55.289> per

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
I really don't care about miles per

I really don't care about miles per
gallon<00:00:55.920> you're<00:00:56.100> gonna<00:00:56.190> get<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:57.090> know<00:00:57.120> if<00:00:57.660> you

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
gallon you're gonna get you know if you

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.420 
gallon you're gonna get you know if you
did<00:00:58.050> get<00:00:58.170> maybe<00:00:58.320> one<00:00:58.440> more<00:00:58.890> or<00:00:59.070> something<00:00:59.340> like

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
did get maybe one more or something like

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.099 
did get maybe one more or something like
that<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.910> is<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.000> really<00:01:00.359> worth<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.989> spend

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
that and is it really worth it to spend

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.799 
that and is it really worth it to spend
the<00:01:01.410> extra<00:01:01.440> money<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.219> get<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.640> higher<00:01:03.329> price

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
the extra money to get the higher price

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
it's really not so as far as the car

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.429 
it's really not so as far as the car
goes<00:01:09.240> their<00:01:09.720> cars<00:01:09.930> going<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.170> get<00:01:10.290> whatever

miles<00:01:10.710> per<00:01:10.920> gallon<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.640> know<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:11.939> made<00:01:12.090> by

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
miles per gallon you know it's made by

miles per gallon you know it's made by
the<00:01:12.330> engine<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.720> everything<00:01:12.840> else<00:01:13.170> but<00:01:13.530> for<00:01:14.130> a

the engine and everything else but for a
sport<00:01:14.430> bike<00:01:14.580> it's<00:01:14.820> really<00:01:15.030> important<00:01:15.390> that

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
sport bike it's really important that

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.850 
sport bike it's really important that
you<00:01:15.540> always<00:01:15.869> get<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> highest<00:01:16.320> octane

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
you always get the highest octane

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.160 
you always get the highest octane
available<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.640> if<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.299> can't<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.049> have

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
available and if you can't and you have

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.289 
available and if you can't and you have
to<00:01:19.290> get<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.500> lowest<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.250> baby<00:01:20.580> you're<00:01:21.000> a

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
to get the lowest that you baby you're a

to get the lowest that you baby you're a
thousand<00:01:22.229> until<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.560> get<00:01:22.770> higher<00:01:23.070> octane<00:01:23.549> in

thousand until you get higher octane in
there<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.570> reason<00:01:24.869> why<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.049> because

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
there and the reason why is because

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.539 
there and the reason why is because
octane<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.540> rating<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.049> Wendie<00:01:28.710> gasoline

the use of a spark or anything else and

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
the reason why is such a big deal is if

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.090 
the reason why is such a big deal is if
you're<00:01:36.720> in<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.079> higher<00:01:37.259> rpms<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.829> you've<00:01:37.950> got

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
you're in the higher rpms and you've got

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.899 
you're in the higher rpms and you've got
a<00:01:38.130> low<00:01:38.369> octane<00:01:38.820> like<00:01:39.000> 87<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.340> you<00:01:41.340> are<00:01:41.549> you

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
a low octane like 87 and you are you

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.210 
a low octane like 87 and you are you
know<00:01:42.060> revving<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.079> bike<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.500> max<00:01:43.740> you've

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
know revving the bike to the max you've

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.770 
know revving the bike to the max you've
got<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.549> engine<00:01:44.820> heated<00:01:45.090> up<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.630> has<00:01:45.750> a

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
got the engine heated up and it has a

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.960 
got the engine heated up and it has a
lot<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.049> compression<00:01:46.649> in<00:01:46.740> there<00:01:46.920> what<00:01:47.850> can

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
lot of compression in there what can

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.490 
lot of compression in there what can
happen<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.450> because<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.899> compression<00:01:49.229> the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
happen is because of the compression the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.179 
happen is because of the compression the
heat<00:01:49.710> or<00:01:49.829> whatnot

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
heat or whatnot

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.050 
heat or whatnot
the<00:01:50.869> gasoline<00:01:51.869> will<00:01:52.110> actually<00:01:52.649> ignite<00:01:53.369> before

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
the gasoline will actually ignite before

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.630 
the gasoline will actually ignite before
the<00:01:54.420> spark<00:01:54.689> plug<00:01:54.899> sets<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.259> off<00:01:55.409> which<00:01:56.340> means

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
the spark plug sets it off which means

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.690 
the spark plug sets it off which means
that<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.479> piston<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.320> not<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.250> correct

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
that the piston is not in the correct

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.429 
that the piston is not in the correct
area<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.329> needs<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.869> be<00:02:01.079> too<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:03.000> know<00:02:03.149> and

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
area it needs to be too you know and

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.719 
area it needs to be too you know and
that's<00:02:04.439> where<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:04.740> spark<00:02:05.280> comes<00:02:05.490> from<00:02:05.640> that

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
that's where that spark comes from that

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.399 
that's where that spark comes from that
spark<00:02:06.000> plug<00:02:06.180> because<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.540> piston<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.200> in<00:02:07.320> the

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
spark plug because the piston is in the

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.680 
spark plug because the piston is in the
right<00:02:07.590> area<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.580> because<00:02:08.879> that<00:02:08.910> piston<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:09.509> not

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
right area so because that piston is not

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.170 
right area so because that piston is not
in<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.899> right<00:02:10.020> area<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:11.039> are<00:02:11.069> going<00:02:11.250> against

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
in the right area you are going against

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.940 
in the right area you are going against
the<00:02:12.959> motion<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:13.739> if

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
the motion so if

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.710 
the motion so if
nights<00:02:14.250> before<00:02:14.489> it's<00:02:14.910> supposed<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.420> then

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
nights before it's supposed to then

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.660 
nights before it's supposed to then
you're<00:02:15.870> slamming<00:02:16.560> that<00:02:16.650> piston<00:02:17.069> down<00:02:17.250> and

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
you're slamming that piston down and

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.180 
you're slamming that piston down and
moving<00:02:17.879> the<00:02:18.120> rods<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:18.690> everything<00:02:18.989> else

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
moving the rods and everything else

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.229 
moving the rods and everything else
where<00:02:20.190> they're<00:02:20.340> not<00:02:20.430> supposed<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.940> be<00:02:21.060> which

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
where they're not supposed to be which

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.300 
where they're not supposed to be which
is<00:02:21.269> how<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.510> can<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:22.050> know<00:02:22.170> snap<00:02:22.739> a<00:02:22.800> piston

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
is how you can you know snap a piston

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.089 
is how you can you know snap a piston
snap<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.670> rod<00:02:23.970> things<00:02:24.510> like<00:02:24.690> that<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.590> that's

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
snap a rod things like that and that's

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.770 
snap a rod things like that and that's
why<00:02:26.280> it's<00:02:26.459> so<00:02:26.580> important<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.000> have<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.239> higher

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
why it's so important to have a higher

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.110 
why it's so important to have a higher
octane<00:02:28.349> rating<00:02:28.830> is<00:02:29.370> because<00:02:29.670> it's<00:02:29.790> not<00:02:29.940> four

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
octane rating is because it's not four

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.520 
octane rating is because it's not four
miles<00:02:30.269> per<00:02:30.450> gallon<00:02:30.690> or<00:02:30.780> anything<00:02:30.959> else<00:02:31.200> it's

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
miles per gallon or anything else it's

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.559 
miles per gallon or anything else it's
four<00:02:31.769> predetonation<00:02:32.670> so<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.060> mean<00:02:33.209> you<00:02:33.300> don't

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
four predetonation so I mean you don't

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.210 
four predetonation so I mean you don't
want<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:34.019> ever<00:02:34.170> happen<00:02:34.500> on<00:02:34.739> sport<00:02:35.069> pike

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
want to ever happen on sport pike

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.589 
want to ever happen on sport pike
especially<00:02:36.090> when<00:02:36.180> you're<00:02:36.300> on<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.450> motorcycle

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
especially when you're on a motorcycle

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.199 
especially when you're on a motorcycle
because<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:38.010> know<00:02:38.130> that's<00:02:38.519> it<00:02:38.730> if<00:02:38.940> you<00:02:38.970> have

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
because you know that's it if you have

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.759 
because you know that's it if you have
something<00:02:39.480> wrong<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.290> shoot<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.620> rod

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
something wrong and you shoot a rod

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.170 
something wrong and you shoot a rod
through<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.069> tank<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.580> hits<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:41.880> or

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
through the tank and it hits you or

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.520 
through the tank and it hits you or
anything<00:02:42.420> else<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:42.900> mean<00:02:43.019> that<00:02:43.140> could<00:02:43.260> be<00:02:43.290> death

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
anything else I mean that could be death

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.300 
anything else I mean that could be death
or<00:02:43.709> whatnot

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
or whatnot

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.430 
or whatnot
plus<00:02:44.849> all<00:02:45.180> this<00:02:45.360> on<00:02:45.510> your<00:02:45.599> engine<00:02:45.959> goes

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
plus all this on your engine goes

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.229 
plus all this on your engine goes
and<00:02:46.650> then<00:02:46.920> your<00:02:47.069> back<00:02:47.250> wheels<00:02:47.489> locked<00:02:47.730> up<00:02:47.940> now

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
and then your back wheels locked up now

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.640 
and then your back wheels locked up now
you're<00:02:48.450> getting<00:02:48.660> thrown<00:02:48.930> off<00:02:49.049> the<00:02:49.200> bike<00:02:49.380> for

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
you're getting thrown off the bike for

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.870 
you're getting thrown off the bike for
something<00:02:49.890> stupid<00:02:50.280> just<00:02:50.489> because<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:50.730> could

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
something stupid just because you could

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.339 
something stupid just because you could
have<00:02:50.970> put<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.150> higher<00:02:51.360> octane<00:02:51.750> rating<00:02:52.110> in<00:02:52.200> there

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
have put a higher octane rating in there

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.080 
have put a higher octane rating in there
and<00:02:52.799> you<00:02:53.280> should<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:53.489> should<00:02:53.700> never<00:02:53.819> bitch

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
and you should I should never bitch

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.210 
and you should I should never bitch
about<00:02:54.360> prices<00:02:55.019> of<00:02:55.170> gas<00:02:55.380> or<00:02:55.620> anything<00:02:55.799> else<00:02:56.040> on

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
about prices of gas or anything else on

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.460 
about prices of gas or anything else on
a<00:02:56.250> motorcycle<00:02:56.579> anyways<00:02:57.180> because<00:02:57.390> we<00:02:58.380> get

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
a motorcycle anyways because we get

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.479 
a motorcycle anyways because we get
better<00:02:58.650> miles<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.130> gallon

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
better miles to the gallon

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.390 
better miles to the gallon
regardless<00:03:00.420> plus<00:03:00.959> we<00:03:01.560> take<00:03:01.590> much<00:03:02.040> better<00:03:02.280> care

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
regardless plus we take much better care

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.559 
regardless plus we take much better care
of<00:03:02.670> these<00:03:02.760> because<00:03:02.970> these<00:03:03.090> are<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.450> know

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
of these because these are you know

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:04.940 
of these because these are you know
we're<00:03:03.810> riding<00:03:04.110> on<00:03:04.200> top<00:03:04.410> of<00:03:04.530> them<00:03:04.650> there's<00:03:04.799> no

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
we're riding on top of them there's no

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.160 
we're riding on top of them there's no
protection<00:03:05.459> like<00:03:05.849> an<00:03:05.970> airbag<00:03:06.269> or<00:03:06.480> anything<00:03:06.690> so

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
protection like an airbag or anything so

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.470
