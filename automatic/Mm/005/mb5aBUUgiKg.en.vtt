disciplinary core idea ESS tewi it's on
bio<00:00:09.150> geology<00:00:09.960> and<00:00:10.170> that's<00:00:10.380> really<00:00:10.860> how<00:00:11.160> the

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
bio geology and that's really how the

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.669 
bio geology and that's really how the
life<00:00:11.670> on<00:00:11.940> our<00:00:11.969> planet<00:00:12.120> interact<00:00:13.080> with<00:00:13.380> the

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
life on our planet interact with the

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.950 
life on our planet interact with the
planet<00:00:14.160> itself<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:15.030> so<00:00:15.480> again<00:00:15.719> in<00:00:15.929> summary

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
planet itself and so again in summary

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.200 
planet itself and so again in summary
there<00:00:16.529> are<00:00:16.560> four<00:00:16.920> spheres<00:00:17.340> on<00:00:17.609> our<00:00:17.760> planet<00:00:18.000> we

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
there are four spheres on our planet we

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.060 
there are four spheres on our planet we
have<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.449> geosphere<00:00:18.869> which<00:00:19.410> is<00:00:19.590> going<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.890> be

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
have the geosphere which is going to be

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.099 
have the geosphere which is going to be
the<00:00:20.279> planet<00:00:20.789> itself<00:00:21.210> we<00:00:21.900> have<00:00:22.020> the

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
the planet itself we have the

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.599 
the planet itself we have the
hydrosphere<00:00:22.560> which<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.189> going<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.369> be<00:00:23.490> the

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
hydrosphere which is going to be the

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.519 
hydrosphere which is going to be the
water<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.390> atmosphere<00:00:24.570> which<00:00:25.260> are<00:00:25.410> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
water and the atmosphere which are the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.679 
water and the atmosphere which are the
gases<00:00:25.740> on<00:00:26.160> its<00:00:26.310> surface<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.480> in<00:00:27.570> this

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
gases on its surface and so in this

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.720 
gases on its surface and so in this
diagram<00:00:27.990> where<00:00:28.529> these<00:00:28.740> three<00:00:29.130> things<00:00:29.429> come

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
diagram where these three things come

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.849 
diagram where these three things come
together<00:00:29.910> like<00:00:30.420> right<00:00:30.960> here<00:00:31.619> we're<00:00:31.800> gonna

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
together like right here we're gonna

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.889 
together like right here we're gonna
have<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.489> biosphere<00:00:32.969> that's<00:00:33.540> going<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.780> be

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
have the biosphere that's going to be

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.290 
have the biosphere that's going to be
where<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.260> life<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.620> on<00:00:35.190> our<00:00:35.399> planet<00:00:35.730> it's

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
where the life is on our planet it's

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.970 
where the life is on our planet it's
where<00:00:36.540> these<00:00:36.719> three<00:00:37.020> spheres<00:00:37.200> come<00:00:37.800> together

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
where these three spheres come together

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.520 
where these three spheres come together
and<00:00:38.340> allow<00:00:38.640> life<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.000> exist<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.379> can

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
and allow life to exist and so you can

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.100 
and allow life to exist and so you can
see<00:00:40.770> how<00:00:41.010> these<00:00:41.280> three<00:00:41.730> things<00:00:42.000> could<00:00:42.329> affect

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
see how these three things could affect

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.680 
see how these three things could affect
life<00:00:43.469> but<00:00:43.950> could<00:00:44.160> life<00:00:44.489> ever<00:00:44.879> affect<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
life but could life ever affect the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.900 
life but could life ever affect the
other<00:00:45.870> three<00:00:46.350> for<00:00:47.309> sure<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.730> that

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
other three for sure and that

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.430 
other three for sure and that
interaction<00:00:48.239> between<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.989> two

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
interaction between the two

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.200 
interaction between the two
especially<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.190> earth<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.700> life<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.090> going

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
especially the earth and life is going

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.240 
especially the earth and life is going
to<00:00:51.300> be<00:00:51.420> bio<00:00:51.690> geology<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:52.890> what's<00:00:53.070> an<00:00:53.160> example

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
to be bio geology so what's an example

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.240 
to be bio geology so what's an example
of<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.020> cyanobacteria<00:00:55.020> are<00:00:55.649> bacteria

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
of that cyanobacteria are bacteria

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.099 
of that cyanobacteria are bacteria
they've<00:00:56.699> been<00:00:56.850> around<00:00:57.059> for<00:00:57.329> billions<00:00:57.660> of

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
they've been around for billions of

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.630 
they've been around for billions of
years<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.739> when<00:00:58.920> they<00:00:59.039> started<00:00:59.370> doing

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
years and when they started doing

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.580 
years and when they started doing
photosynthesis<00:01:00.510> on<00:01:00.660> our<00:01:00.780> planet<00:01:01.170> they

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
photosynthesis on our planet they

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.470 
photosynthesis on our planet they
started<00:01:01.949> producing<00:01:02.129> oxygen<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.329> oxygen

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
started producing oxygen and that oxygen

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.530 
started producing oxygen and that oxygen
on<00:01:04.260> our<00:01:04.409> planet<00:01:04.680> started<00:01:05.519> making<00:01:05.850> rock<00:01:06.150> that

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
on our planet started making rock that

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.450 
on our planet started making rock that
was<00:01:06.720> read<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.200> was<00:01:07.320> rusting<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.189> we<00:01:08.280> saw

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
was read it was rusting and so we saw

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.730 
was read it was rusting and so we saw
these<00:01:08.640> banded<00:01:09.330> rock<00:01:09.659> found<00:01:10.049> within<00:01:10.380> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
these banded rock found within the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.950 
these banded rock found within the
planet<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.000> life<00:01:12.210> was<00:01:12.479> actually

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
planet and so the life was actually

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.219 
planet and so the life was actually
shaping<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:14.040> rock<00:01:14.369> itself<00:01:15.090> or<00:01:15.330> changing<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
shaping the rock itself or changing the

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.770 
shaping the rock itself or changing the
rock<00:01:16.439> itself<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.759> carbon<00:01:18.150> cycle<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.570> great

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
rock itself the carbon cycle is a great

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.020 
rock itself the carbon cycle is a great
example<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.259> see<00:01:19.470> how<00:01:19.500> life<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.310> interacting

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
example to see how life is interacting

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.600 
example to see how life is interacting
with<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.240> planet<00:01:21.750> itself<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:22.890> as<00:01:23.100> we<00:01:23.340> go

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
with the planet itself and so as we go

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.280 
with the planet itself and so as we go
through<00:01:23.810> photosynthesis<00:01:24.810> we're<00:01:24.990> taking

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
through photosynthesis we're taking

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.039 
through photosynthesis we're taking
carbon<00:01:25.590> from<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.159> atmosphere<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:27.450> actually

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
carbon from the atmosphere and actually

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.870 
carbon from the atmosphere and actually
making<00:01:28.259> sugar<00:01:28.650> out<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.340> as<00:01:29.549> we<00:01:29.759> do

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
making sugar out of it and as we do

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.390 
making sugar out of it and as we do
respiration<00:01:30.600> we're<00:01:30.780> returning<00:01:31.619> some<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.070> that

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
respiration we're returning some of that

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.149 
respiration we're returning some of that
into<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.329> atmosphere<00:01:33.450> as<00:01:34.020> carbon<00:01:34.229> dioxide<00:01:34.409> as

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide as

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.550 
into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide as
we<00:01:35.850> start<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.270> burn<00:01:36.509> fossil<00:01:36.810> fuels<00:01:37.049> we're

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
we start to burn fossil fuels we're

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.740 
we start to burn fossil fuels we're
taking<00:01:37.890> carbon<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.579> was<00:01:38.700> locked<00:01:39.090> away<00:01:39.329> in

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
taking carbon that was locked away in

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.660 
taking carbon that was locked away in
the<00:01:39.900> earth<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.439> we're<00:01:40.590> releasing<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.490> into

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
the earth and we're releasing it into

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.370 
the earth and we're releasing it into
the<00:01:41.909> atmosphere<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.630> that's<00:01:43.079> going<00:01:43.320> to

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
the atmosphere and that's going to

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.550 
the atmosphere and that's going to
change<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:44.630> atmosphere<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:46.200> hydrosphere

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
change the atmosphere the hydrosphere

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.789 
change the atmosphere the hydrosphere
and<00:01:46.890> even<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.579> earth<00:01:47.759> itself<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.799> bacteria

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
and even the earth itself and bacteria

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.560 
and even the earth itself and bacteria
are<00:01:49.829> incredibly<00:01:50.399> important<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.090> as<00:01:51.329> well

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
are incredibly important in this as well

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.940 
are incredibly important in this as well
and<00:01:51.869> they're<00:01:52.140> important<00:01:52.530> in<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.710> nitrogen

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
and they're important in the nitrogen

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.730 
and they're important in the nitrogen
cycle<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.630> really<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.229> message<00:01:55.590> I'm

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
cycle and so really the message I'm

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.920 
cycle and so really the message I'm
trying<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.100> get<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.700> we<00:01:56.820> have<00:01:57.030> landforms

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
trying to get is that we have landforms

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.780 
trying to get is that we have landforms
on<00:01:58.110> our<00:01:58.259> planet<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.799> geosphere<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.610> we<00:01:59.700> have

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
on our planet the geosphere and we have

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.109 
on our planet the geosphere and we have
life<00:02:00.090> forms<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.600> our<00:02:00.780> plane

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
life forms on our plane

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.950 
life forms on our plane
and<00:02:01.359> so<00:02:01.929> as<00:02:02.109> the<00:02:02.590> landforms<00:02:03.429> change<00:02:03.880> as<00:02:04.390> we

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
and so as the landforms change as we

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.169 
and so as the landforms change as we
change<00:02:04.990> our<00:02:05.679> planet<00:02:06.159> the<00:02:06.340> life<00:02:06.640> has<00:02:06.969> to

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
change our planet the life has to

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:08.880 
change our planet the life has to
respond<00:02:07.659> to<00:02:07.840> that<00:02:07.990> and<00:02:08.229> so<00:02:08.349> what<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.619> life

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
respond to that and so what the life

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.820 
respond to that and so what the life
does<00:02:09.220> is<00:02:09.519> evolve<00:02:10.060> and<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:11.019> land<00:02:11.260> will<00:02:11.500> change

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
does is evolve and the land will change

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.339 
does is evolve and the land will change
again<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:12.670> life<00:02:12.940> will<00:02:13.239> change<00:02:13.269> again<00:02:14.140> and

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
again and the life will change again and

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.650 
again and the life will change again and
so<00:02:14.470> they're<00:02:14.680> linked<00:02:15.190> together<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.849> so<00:02:16.269> how<00:02:16.599> do

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
so they're linked together and so how do

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.479 
so they're linked together and so how do
you<00:02:16.780> teach<00:02:17.050> this<00:02:17.379> progression<00:02:17.799> well<00:02:18.220> in<00:02:18.370> the

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
you teach this progression well in the

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.460 
you teach this progression well in the
lower<00:02:18.730> elementary<00:02:18.910> grades<00:02:19.540> we<00:02:19.900> want<00:02:19.989> to<00:02:20.260> talk

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
lower elementary grades we want to talk

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.820 
lower elementary grades we want to talk
about<00:02:20.650> life<00:02:21.390> plants<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:22.690> animals<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.470> we<00:02:23.769> are

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
about life plants and animals and we are

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.800 
about life plants and animals and we are
animals<00:02:24.280> for<00:02:24.549> sure<00:02:24.700> and<00:02:24.910> what<00:02:25.180> do<00:02:25.269> we<00:02:25.390> need

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
animals for sure and what do we need

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.550 
animals for sure and what do we need
well<00:02:26.650> we<00:02:26.920> need<00:02:27.099> land<00:02:27.519> to<00:02:27.910> live<00:02:28.180> on<00:02:28.450> we<00:02:29.110> need<00:02:29.290> air

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
well we need land to live on we need air

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.940 
well we need land to live on we need air
to<00:02:30.160> breathe<00:02:30.190> and<00:02:30.910> then<00:02:31.000> we<00:02:31.209> need<00:02:31.420> water<00:02:32.080> and<00:02:32.470> so

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
to breathe and then we need water and so

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.850 
to breathe and then we need water and so
as<00:02:33.190> we<00:02:33.610> take<00:02:34.239> all<00:02:34.510> of<00:02:34.540> these<00:02:34.870> things<00:02:35.260> in<00:02:35.620> we

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
as we take all of these things in we

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.220 
as we take all of these things in we
also<00:02:36.160> change<00:02:36.849> them<00:02:37.239> as<00:02:37.540> well<00:02:37.750> so<00:02:38.079> we're

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
also change them as well so we're

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.569 
also change them as well so we're
changing<00:02:38.650> our<00:02:39.720> environment<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:42.280> we're<00:02:42.459> doing

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
changing our environment and we're doing

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.710 
changing our environment and we're doing
that<00:02:42.880> by<00:02:43.620> plowing<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.829> fields<00:02:45.549> as<00:02:45.670> we<00:02:46.360> chop

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
that by plowing the fields as we chop

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.410 
that by plowing the fields as we chop
down<00:02:47.019> trees<00:02:47.290> as<00:02:47.980> we<00:02:48.190> use<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:48.790> water<00:02:48.940> and<00:02:49.299> we

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
down trees as we use the water and we

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.630 
down trees as we use the water and we
put<00:02:49.660> into<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.319> atmosphere<00:02:50.440> we're<00:02:51.040> changing

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
put into the atmosphere we're changing

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.880 
put into the atmosphere we're changing
our<00:02:51.879> environment<00:02:52.120> and<00:02:52.989> so<00:02:53.110> as<00:02:53.200> we<00:02:53.349> move<00:02:53.379> into

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
our environment and so as we move into

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.650 
our environment and so as we move into
the<00:02:54.069> upper<00:02:54.099> elementary<00:02:54.370> grades<00:02:54.940> we<00:02:55.390> want<00:02:55.420> to

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
the upper elementary grades we want to

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.330 
the upper elementary grades we want to
explain<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.260> our<00:02:56.290> students<00:02:56.769> that<00:02:56.799> living

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
explain to our students that living

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.569 
explain to our students that living
things<00:02:57.900> affect<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.230> environment<00:02:59.410> and<00:03:00.129> so

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
things affect the environment and so

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.640 
things affect the environment and so
here's<00:03:00.819> a<00:03:00.879> great<00:03:01.239> great<00:03:01.629> couple<00:03:01.989> of<00:03:02.110> examples

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
here's a great great couple of examples

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.460 
here's a great great couple of examples
and<00:03:02.920> so<00:03:03.099> as<00:03:03.760> plants<00:03:04.360> start<00:03:04.599> to<00:03:04.660> live<00:03:04.959> they<00:03:05.230> put

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
and so as plants start to live they put

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.500 
and so as plants start to live they put
roots<00:03:05.799> into<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.250> soil<00:03:06.579> and<00:03:06.880> that's<00:03:07.269> going<00:03:07.420> to

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
roots into the soil and that's going to

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.569 
roots into the soil and that's going to
hold<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.200> soil<00:03:08.440> in<00:03:08.739> place<00:03:08.799> it's<00:03:09.250> gonna<00:03:09.310> hold

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
hold the soil in place it's gonna hold

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.599 
hold the soil in place it's gonna hold
water<00:03:09.730> in<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.840> soil<00:03:11.109> as<00:03:11.380> well<00:03:11.410> and<00:03:12.040> so<00:03:12.430> by

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
water in the soil as well and so by

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.849 
water in the soil as well and so by
adding<00:03:12.880> life<00:03:13.359> we're<00:03:13.630> actually<00:03:13.859> stabilizing

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
adding life we're actually stabilizing

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:18.150 
adding life we're actually stabilizing
that<00:03:15.040> soil<00:03:15.870> beavers<00:03:16.870> for<00:03:17.290> example<00:03:17.739> can<00:03:17.920> build

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
that soil beavers for example can build

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.069 
that soil beavers for example can build
dams<00:03:18.459> and<00:03:19.030> they're<00:03:19.180> gonna<00:03:19.269> change<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.870> flow

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
dams and they're gonna change the flow

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.349 
dams and they're gonna change the flow
of<00:03:20.109> the<00:03:20.440> water<00:03:20.620> or<00:03:20.980> that<00:03:21.130> hydrosphere<00:03:21.639> on<00:03:22.120> the

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
of the water or that hydrosphere on the

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:24.720 
of the water or that hydrosphere on the
geosphere<00:03:22.660> and<00:03:23.079> as<00:03:23.500> we<00:03:23.739> build<00:03:24.069> dams<00:03:24.190> we're

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
geosphere and as we build dams we're

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.000 
geosphere and as we build dams we're
gonna<00:03:24.880> do<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.299> same<00:03:25.480> thing<00:03:25.540> as<00:03:26.349> you<00:03:26.560> move<00:03:26.799> into

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
gonna do the same thing as you move into

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.490 
gonna do the same thing as you move into
middle<00:03:27.340> school<00:03:27.579> you<00:03:27.760> want<00:03:27.970> to<00:03:28.060> talk<00:03:28.239> about

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
middle school you want to talk about

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.990 
middle school you want to talk about
landforms<00:03:29.500> changing<00:03:30.190> and<00:03:30.400> sometimes<00:03:30.609> that's

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
landforms changing and sometimes that's

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.720 
landforms changing and sometimes that's
gradual<00:03:31.660> and<00:03:31.870> sometimes<00:03:32.290> it's<00:03:32.560> dramatic<00:03:33.250> so<00:03:33.700> a

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
gradual and sometimes it's dramatic so a

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.520 
gradual and sometimes it's dramatic so a
meteor<00:03:34.239> impact<00:03:34.480> like<00:03:34.989> this<00:03:35.169> could<00:03:35.410> be

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
meteor impact like this could be

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.129 
meteor impact like this could be
dramatic<00:03:36.190> change<00:03:36.489> to<00:03:36.609> the<00:03:36.730> landforms<00:03:37.540> we

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
dramatic change to the landforms we

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:40.170 
dramatic change to the landforms we
could<00:03:38.290> have<00:03:38.410> volcanism<00:03:39.010> so<00:03:39.340> volcanoes<00:03:39.970> can

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
could have volcanism so volcanoes can

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.180 
could have volcanism so volcanoes can
change<00:03:40.419> the<00:03:40.599> landforms<00:03:41.139> as<00:03:41.290> well<00:03:41.500> and<00:03:41.739> once<00:03:42.010> we

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
change the landforms as well and once we

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.430 
change the landforms as well and once we
have<00:03:42.400> that<00:03:42.549> change<00:03:42.940> then<00:03:43.569> the<00:03:43.750> life<00:03:43.989> forms

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
have that change then the life forms

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.110 
have that change then the life forms
have<00:03:44.650> to<00:03:44.859> evolve<00:03:45.190> and<00:03:45.579> so<00:03:45.639> what's<00:03:45.880> an<00:03:46.000> example

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
have to evolve and so what's an example

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.069 
have to evolve and so what's an example
of<00:03:46.660> that

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
of that

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.080 
of that
well<00:03:47.440> dinosaurs<00:03:48.069> are<00:03:48.250> a<00:03:48.280> great<00:03:48.549> example<00:03:48.849> of

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
well dinosaurs are a great example of

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.460 
well dinosaurs are a great example of
that<00:03:49.299> they<00:03:49.480> lived<00:03:49.720> on<00:03:49.840> our<00:03:49.959> planet<00:03:50.200> for

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
that they lived on our planet for

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.400 
that they lived on our planet for
millions<00:03:50.799> and<00:03:51.370> millions<00:03:51.970> of<00:03:52.150> years<00:03:52.599> and<00:03:52.900> they

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
millions and millions of years and they

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.920 
millions and millions of years and they
went<00:03:53.620> extinct<00:03:54.160> relatively<00:03:54.819> shortly<00:03:55.209> why<00:03:55.599> was

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
went extinct relatively shortly why was

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.589 
went extinct relatively shortly why was
that<00:03:56.169> we<00:03:56.470> had<00:03:56.590> changes<00:03:57.310> to<00:03:57.609> the<00:03:57.760> landforms<00:03:58.480> we

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
that we had changes to the landforms we

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.080 
that we had changes to the landforms we
had<00:03:58.720> a<00:03:58.750> meteor<00:03:59.440> impact<00:03:59.709> an<00:04:00.310> asteroid<00:04:00.910> impact

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
had a meteor impact an asteroid impact

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.539 
had a meteor impact an asteroid impact
and<00:04:01.630> that<00:04:01.989> changed<00:04:02.500> the<00:04:02.620> climate<00:04:02.859> and<00:04:03.099> they

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
and that changed the climate and they

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.610 
and that changed the climate and they
couldn't<00:04:03.910> adapt<00:04:04.209> but<00:04:04.840> certain<00:04:05.260> organisms

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
couldn't adapt but certain organisms

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.640 
couldn't adapt but certain organisms
could<00:04:06.010> and<00:04:06.370> a<00:04:06.430> group<00:04:06.639> called<00:04:07.299> the<00:04:07.419> mammals<00:04:07.870> did

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
could and a group called the mammals did

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.619 
could and a group called the mammals did
really<00:04:09.040> well<00:04:09.400> and<00:04:09.610> started<00:04:09.939> to<00:04:10.090> fill<00:04:10.299> some<00:04:10.540> of

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
really well and started to fill some of

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:11.950 
really well and started to fill some of
the<00:04:10.719> niches<00:04:10.930> that<00:04:11.079> were<00:04:11.379> at<00:04:11.530> once

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:11.960 
the niches that were at once

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.070 
the niches that were at once
I'm<00:04:12.020> filled<00:04:12.470> by<00:04:12.740> the<00:04:13.340> dinosaurs<00:04:13.640> and<00:04:14.240> also<00:04:14.930> as

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
I'm filled by the dinosaurs and also as

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.480 
I'm filled by the dinosaurs and also as
we<00:04:15.230> talk<00:04:15.410> about<00:04:15.560> middle<00:04:15.920> school<00:04:15.950> we<00:04:16.340> should

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:16.490 
we talk about middle school we should

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:17.860 
we talk about middle school we should
students<00:04:16.850> should<00:04:16.970> understand<00:04:17.390> that<00:04:17.480> the<00:04:17.660> life

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
students should understand that the life

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.630 
students should understand that the life
can<00:04:18.080> actually<00:04:18.470> change<00:04:18.800> the<00:04:18.920> earth<00:04:19.220> and<00:04:19.550> so

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
can actually change the earth and so

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.230 
can actually change the earth and so
this<00:04:19.790> idea<00:04:19.970> of<00:04:20.240> cyanobacteria<00:04:21.670> changing<00:04:22.670> the

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
this idea of cyanobacteria changing the

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.940 
this idea of cyanobacteria changing the
earth<00:04:23.570> adding<00:04:24.230> oxygen<00:04:24.380> to<00:04:24.770> the<00:04:24.920> atmosphere

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
earth adding oxygen to the atmosphere

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.460 
earth adding oxygen to the atmosphere
and<00:04:25.610> adding<00:04:26.180> oxidation<00:04:26.870> to<00:04:26.960> the<00:04:27.050> rocks<00:04:27.260> is

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
and adding oxidation to the rocks is

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.350 
and adding oxidation to the rocks is
important<00:04:28.010> and<00:04:28.130> I<00:04:28.190> read<00:04:28.460> that<00:04:28.640> bacteria<00:04:29.180> can

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
important and I read that bacteria can

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.690 
important and I read that bacteria can
even<00:04:29.690> help<00:04:30.170> in<00:04:30.380> the<00:04:30.470> formation<00:04:30.830> of<00:04:31.130> pyrite

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
even help in the formation of pyrite

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.180 
even help in the formation of pyrite
pyrite<00:04:32.540> or<00:04:32.720> fool's<00:04:32.780> gold<00:04:33.680> I<00:04:33.890> think<00:04:34.040> that's

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
pyrite or fool's gold I think that's

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.280 
pyrite or fool's gold I think that's
really<00:04:34.550> really<00:04:34.580> cool<00:04:35.060> and<00:04:35.300> then<00:04:35.870> as<00:04:36.020> we<00:04:36.140> get

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
really really cool and then as we get

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.600 
really really cool and then as we get
into<00:04:36.470> high<00:04:36.680> school<00:04:36.710> we<00:04:36.950> want<00:04:37.340> them<00:04:37.580> to

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
into high school we want them to

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.010 
into high school we want them to
understand<00:04:38.210> this<00:04:38.390> whole<00:04:38.570> idea<00:04:38.810> of

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
understand this whole idea of

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.500 
understand this whole idea of
coevolution<00:04:39.460> that<00:04:40.460> the<00:04:40.610> landforms<00:04:41.240> on<00:04:41.390> our

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
coevolution that the landforms on our

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.660 
coevolution that the landforms on our
planet<00:04:41.900> will<00:04:42.020> constantly<00:04:42.620> be<00:04:42.800> changing<00:04:43.490> as

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
planet will constantly be changing as

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.360 
planet will constantly be changing as
they<00:04:43.910> do<00:04:44.020> life<00:04:45.020> forms<00:04:45.380> have<00:04:45.590> to<00:04:45.740> evolve<00:04:46.130> in

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
they do life forms have to evolve in

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.550 
they do life forms have to evolve in
response<00:04:46.400> to<00:04:47.060> that<00:04:47.240> but<00:04:47.780> it's<00:04:47.900> a<00:04:47.990> never<00:04:48.290> ending

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
response to that but it's a never ending

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.030 
response to that but it's a never ending
story<00:04:49.160> and<00:04:49.490> I<00:04:49.550> hope<00:04:49.700> that<00:04:49.850> was<00:04:50.000> helpful
