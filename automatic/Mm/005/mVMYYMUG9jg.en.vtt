00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
is kind of expected with the wii u

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.449 
is kind of expected with the wii u
coming<00:03:15.230> out<00:03:15.349> i'm<00:03:15.470> sure<00:03:15.650> companies<00:03:15.980> will<00:03:16.310> put

coming out i'm sure companies will put

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.039 
coming out i'm sure companies will put
in<00:03:16.549> a<00:03:16.609> lot<00:03:16.790> more<00:03:16.970> work<00:03:17.150> a<00:03:17.299> lot<00:03:17.450> more<00:03:17.569> testing<00:03:18.019> to

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
in a lot more work a lot more testing to

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.110 
in a lot more work a lot more testing to
make<00:03:18.139> sure<00:03:18.310> that<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:19.400> games<00:03:19.609> they<00:03:19.790> released

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
make sure that the games they released

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.460 
make sure that the games they released
for<00:03:20.329> the<00:03:20.359> wii<00:03:20.569> u<00:03:20.720> will<00:03:20.870> be<00:03:20.989> the<00:03:21.079> best<00:03:21.290> that<00:03:21.410> they

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
for the wii u will be the best that they

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.949 
for the wii u will be the best that they
can<00:03:21.590> be<00:03:21.760> but<00:03:22.760> however<00:03:22.940> i<00:03:23.209> mean<00:03:23.510> in<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:23.930> past

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
can be but however i mean in the past

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.869 
can be but however i mean in the past
with<00:03:24.349> call<00:03:24.530> of<00:03:24.620> duty<00:03:24.799> games<00:03:25.010> on<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.250> wii<00:03:25.370> u

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
with call of duty games on the wii u

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.629 
with call of duty games on the wii u
know<00:03:26.000> obviously<00:03:26.359> they<00:03:26.750> have<00:03:26.959> been<00:03:27.169> tested<00:03:27.639> but

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639 
know obviously they have been tested but

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:30.819 
know obviously they have been tested but
i<00:03:28.940> can<00:03:29.389> imagine<00:03:29.569> the<00:03:29.870> testing<00:03:30.290> has<00:03:30.409> been<00:03:30.620> very

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
i can imagine the testing has been very

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.909 
i can imagine the testing has been very
minimal<00:03:31.340> at<00:03:31.609> the<00:03:32.120> best<00:03:32.329> because<00:03:32.720> take<00:03:33.680> for

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:33.919 
minimal at the best because take for

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:35.680 
minimal at the best because take for
take<00:03:34.250> modern<00:03:34.549> warfare<00:03:34.669> reflex<00:03:34.940> or<00:03:35.359> world<00:03:35.599> at

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
take modern warfare reflex or world at

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.930 
take modern warfare reflex or world at
war<00:03:35.810> for<00:03:35.840> example<00:03:36.440> if<00:03:36.650> you<00:03:36.799> log<00:03:37.220> online<00:03:37.430> for

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
war for example if you log online for

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.520 
war for example if you log online for
one<00:03:38.120> match<00:03:38.329> you<00:03:38.569> could<00:03:38.750> tell<00:03:38.930> that<00:03:39.169> the<00:03:39.290> game

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
one match you could tell that the game

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.439 
one match you could tell that the game
is<00:03:40.220> a<00:03:40.280> little<00:03:40.519> bit<00:03:40.639> messed<00:03:40.849> up<00:03:41.030> with<00:03:41.209> the<00:03:41.299> hit

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:41.449 
is a little bit messed up with the hit

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:43.869 
is a little bit messed up with the hit
detection<00:03:41.569> i<00:03:41.989> mean<00:03:42.169> anybody<00:03:42.799> who<00:03:43.069> who<00:03:43.609> played

detection i mean anybody who who played
that<00:03:44.090> game<00:03:44.269> could<00:03:44.540> tell<00:03:44.810> from<00:03:45.109> one<00:03:45.650> match<00:03:45.859> that

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 
that game could tell from one match that

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:47.199 
that game could tell from one match that
things<00:03:46.340> were<00:03:46.489> messed<00:03:46.669> up<00:03:46.849> with<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:47.030> hit

things were messed up with the hit
detection<00:03:47.299> all<00:03:47.780> that<00:03:47.900> kind<00:03:48.049> of<00:03:48.079> stuff<00:03:48.139> and<00:03:48.319> it

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
detection all that kind of stuff and it

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.439 
detection all that kind of stuff and it
kind<00:03:48.769> of<00:03:48.919> got<00:03:49.549> me<00:03:49.729> thinking<00:03:49.760> when<00:03:50.150> i<00:03:50.180> played

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:50.449 
kind of got me thinking when i played

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:51.839 
kind of got me thinking when i played
that<00:03:50.629> it<00:03:50.750> kind<00:03:50.900> of<00:03:50.959> annoyed<00:03:51.229> me<00:03:51.440> at<00:03:51.530> the<00:03:51.650> time

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
that it kind of annoyed me at the time

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.039 
that it kind of annoyed me at the time
how<00:03:52.849> they<00:03:53.000> could<00:03:53.180> release<00:03:53.510> a<00:03:53.540> game<00:03:53.870> without

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
how they could release a game without

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.170 
how they could release a game without
really<00:03:54.440> fixing<00:03:55.250> that<00:03:55.370> issue<00:03:55.609> without<00:03:55.970> really

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
really fixing that issue without really

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.240 
really fixing that issue without really
testing<00:03:56.659> it<00:03:56.780> out<00:03:56.840> it<00:03:57.709> kind<00:03:57.919> of<00:03:57.979> got<00:03:58.099> me

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
testing it out it kind of got me

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.890 
testing it out it kind of got me
questioning<00:03:58.760> if<00:03:58.879> they<00:03:59.060> actually<00:03:59.389> tested<00:03:59.780> it

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
questioning if they actually tested it

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.830 
questioning if they actually tested it
at<00:04:00.079> all<00:04:00.549> because<00:04:01.549> those<00:04:01.879> games<00:04:02.150> are<00:04:02.329> you<00:04:02.720> know

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
at all because those games are you know

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.020 
at all because those games are you know
look<00:04:03.079> at<00:04:03.169> reflex<00:04:03.859> the<00:04:04.190> lag<00:04:04.370> shooting<00:04:04.760> is<00:04:04.849> so

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
look at reflex the lag shooting is so

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.119 
look at reflex the lag shooting is so
evident<00:04:05.510> in<00:04:05.690> that<00:04:05.810> game<00:04:06.019> that<00:04:06.199> it's<00:04:06.379> it's<00:04:06.919> hard

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.129 
evident in that game that it's it's hard

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:08.770 
evident in that game that it's it's hard
to<00:04:07.220> imagine<00:04:07.400> they<00:04:07.669> did<00:04:07.849> any<00:04:08.090> testing<00:04:08.540> at<00:04:08.659> all

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
to imagine they did any testing at all

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.449 
to imagine they did any testing at all
but<00:04:09.049> pretty<00:04:09.650> much<00:04:09.829> like<00:04:09.949> i<00:04:10.040> said<00:04:10.220> with<00:04:10.340> the

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
but pretty much like i said with the

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:11.979 
but pretty much like i said with the
release<00:04:10.729> of<00:04:10.849> the<00:04:10.909> wii<00:04:11.090> u<00:04:11.209> game<00:04:11.510> companies<00:04:11.900> are

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
going to step it up with testing there's

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.740 
going to step it up with testing there's
gonna<00:04:13.430> be<00:04:13.639> a<00:04:13.669> lot<00:04:13.819> less<00:04:14.030> bugs<00:04:14.359> and<00:04:14.599> glitches

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
gonna be a lot less bugs and glitches

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.960 
gonna be a lot less bugs and glitches
and<00:04:15.139> all<00:04:15.199> that<00:04:15.290> kind<00:04:15.440> of<00:04:15.500> stuff<00:04:15.560> and<00:04:15.919> you<00:04:16.760> can

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.909 
and all that kind of stuff and you can
pretty<00:04:17.389> much<00:04:17.479> assure<00:04:17.810> that<00:04:17.840> black<00:04:18.169> ops<00:04:18.409> 2<00:04:18.650> will

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
pretty much assure that black ops 2 will

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:20.289 
pretty much assure that black ops 2 will
be<00:04:19.039> the<00:04:19.310> best<00:04:19.459> that<00:04:19.669> it<00:04:19.789> can<00:04:19.880> be<00:04:20.060> on<00:04:20.209> the

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
kind of stuff but pretty much that it

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.520

Nintendo<00:04:41.040> developed<00:04:41.520> its<00:04:41.670> Wii<00:04:41.910> U<00:04:42.090> pro

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
Nintendo developed its Wii U pro

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.510 
Nintendo developed its Wii U pro
controller<00:04:42.560> specifically<00:04:43.560> to<00:04:44.130> convince

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
controller specifically to convince

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.520 
controller specifically to convince
Activision<00:04:45.240> to<00:04:45.390> make<00:04:45.540> a<00:04:45.570> wii<00:04:45.870> u<00:04:46.050> version<00:04:46.290> of

call<00:04:46.710> of<00:04:46.740> duty<00:04:47.040> now<00:04:47.520> I'm<00:04:47.640> not<00:04:47.700> sure<00:04:47.820> if<00:04:48.030> this<00:04:48.150> is

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
call of duty now I'm not sure if this is

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.970 
call of duty now I'm not sure if this is
true<00:04:48.510> but<00:04:48.780> I<00:04:48.990> definitely<00:04:49.350> think<00:04:49.620> that<00:04:49.770> one

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
true but I definitely think that one

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.250 
true but I definitely think that one
call<00:04:50.160> of<00:04:50.250> duty<00:04:50.490> black<00:04:50.520> ops<00:04:50.880> 2<00:04:51.120> hits<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:51.930> wii<00:04:52.080> u

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
call of duty black ops 2 hits the wii u

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.080 
call of duty black ops 2 hits the wii u
here<00:04:52.560> I<00:04:52.740> definitely<00:04:53.310> think<00:04:53.520> that<00:04:53.640> the<00:04:53.850> Wii<00:04:53.970> U

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
here I definitely think that the Wii U

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.490 
here I definitely think that the Wii U
pro<00:04:54.150> controller<00:04:54.360> will<00:04:54.930> be<00:04:55.020> the<00:04:55.140> dominant

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
pro controller will be the dominant

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.710 
pro controller will be the dominant
controller<00:04:55.890> here<00:04:56.130> it's<00:04:56.610> kind<00:04:56.850> of<00:04:57.030> most

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
controller here it's kind of most

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.800 
controller here it's kind of most
similarly<00:04:58.260> compared<00:04:58.650> to<00:04:58.830> an<00:04:59.160> Xbox<00:04:59.580> controller

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
similarly compared to an Xbox controller

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.030 
similarly compared to an Xbox controller
but<00:05:00.810> I<00:05:00.840> do<00:05:00.930> say<00:05:01.230> that<00:05:01.260> because<00:05:01.560> I<00:05:01.710> mean<00:05:01.920> in

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
but I do say that because I mean in

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.590 
but I do say that because I mean in
black<00:05:02.250> ops<00:05:02.460> a<00:05:02.610> lot<00:05:02.790> of<00:05:02.910> people<00:05:03.120> switched<00:05:03.360> over

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
black ops a lot of people switched over

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.660 
black ops a lot of people switched over
to<00:05:03.630> the<00:05:03.780> classic<00:05:04.080> controller<00:05:04.170> pro<00:05:04.490> but<00:05:05.490> since

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
to the classic controller pro but since

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.910 
to the classic controller pro but since
this<00:05:05.850> controller<00:05:06.420> will<00:05:06.720> be<00:05:06.900> more<00:05:07.230> of<00:05:07.620> a

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
this controller will be more of a

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.850 
this controller will be more of a
hardcore<00:05:08.790> genre<00:05:09.420> controller<00:05:10.140> kind<00:05:10.530> of<00:05:10.680> with

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
hardcore genre controller kind of with

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.250 
hardcore genre controller kind of with
like<00:05:11.220> the<00:05:11.370> Xbox<00:05:11.670> I'm<00:05:12.570> sure<00:05:12.780> that<00:05:12.930> more<00:05:13.080> people

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
like the Xbox I'm sure that more people

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.930 
like the Xbox I'm sure that more people
will<00:05:13.500> switch<00:05:13.770> over<00:05:13.920> to<00:05:14.070> that<00:05:14.250> controller<00:05:14.640> and

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
will switch over to that controller and

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.280 
will switch over to that controller and
I<00:05:15.060> think<00:05:15.240> more<00:05:15.450> people<00:05:15.570> will<00:05:15.750> be<00:05:15.810> using<00:05:16.200> that

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
I think more people will be using that

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.260 
I think more people will be using that
than<00:05:16.560> the<00:05:16.650> wii<00:05:16.830> remote<00:05:17.130> and<00:05:17.340> the<00:05:17.370> nunchuck

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
than the wii remote and the nunchuck

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.240 
than the wii remote and the nunchuck
those<00:05:18.510> classic<00:05:18.930> controllers<00:05:19.350> I<00:05:19.530> definitely

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
those classic controllers I definitely

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.430 
those classic controllers I definitely
will<00:05:20.730> have<00:05:20.880> my<00:05:21.030> fair<00:05:21.240> share<00:05:21.270> of<00:05:21.540> both<00:05:21.900> I<00:05:22.200> mean<00:05:22.410> I

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
will have my fair share of both I mean I

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.290 
will have my fair share of both I mean I
definitely<00:05:22.560> think<00:05:23.130> i'll<00:05:23.340> be<00:05:23.550> playing<00:05:24.000> both

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
definitely think i'll be playing both

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.020 
definitely think i'll be playing both
with<00:05:25.200> both<00:05:25.410> controllers<00:05:25.860> but<00:05:26.190> I<00:05:26.370> I<00:05:26.400> don't<00:05:26.940> know

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
with both controllers but I I don't know

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.110 
with both controllers but I I don't know
about<00:05:27.150> this<00:05:27.300> um<00:05:27.840> this<00:05:28.560> theory<00:05:29.040> that<00:05:29.120> Nintendo

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
about this um this theory that Nintendo

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.210 
about this um this theory that Nintendo
made<00:05:30.600> the<00:05:30.750> wii<00:05:30.870> u<00:05:31.050> controller<00:05:31.440> specifically

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
made the wii u controller specifically

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.010 
made the wii u controller specifically
for<00:05:32.520> call<00:05:32.820> of<00:05:32.850> duty<00:05:33.150> i<00:05:33.180> think<00:05:33.480> i<00:05:33.600> think<00:05:33.720> it<00:05:33.960> was

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
for call of duty i think i think it was

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.750 
for call of duty i think i think it was
more<00:05:34.260> for<00:05:34.530> just<00:05:34.830> the<00:05:34.950> hardcore<00:05:35.310> games<00:05:35.580> in

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
more for just the hardcore games in

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.030 
more for just the hardcore games in
general<00:05:35.790> like<00:05:36.300> people<00:05:36.690> who<00:05:36.870> can<00:05:37.650> come<00:05:37.830> over

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
general like people who can come over

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.070 
general like people who can come over
from<00:05:38.190> maybe<00:05:38.430> the<00:05:38.610> xbox<00:05:38.970> or<00:05:39.150> ps3<00:05:39.300> and<00:05:39.750> use<00:05:39.930> this

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
from maybe the xbox or ps3 and use this

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.470 
from maybe the xbox or ps3 and use this
controller<00:05:40.500> as<00:05:40.800> a<00:05:41.130> kind<00:05:41.790> of<00:05:41.880> a<00:05:41.940> gateway<00:05:42.240> i<00:05:42.270> mean

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:42.480 
controller as a kind of a gateway i mean

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.630 
controller as a kind of a gateway i mean
if<00:05:42.570> you<00:05:42.630> remember<00:05:42.990> from<00:05:43.380> black<00:05:44.160> ops<00:05:44.370> like<00:05:44.550> i

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
if you remember from black ops like i

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.250 
if you remember from black ops like i
said<00:05:44.820> with<00:05:44.940> a<00:05:44.970> width<00:05:45.330> of<00:05:45.480> classic<00:05:45.930> controller

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
said with a width of classic controller

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.770 
said with a width of classic controller
pro<00:05:46.350> a<00:05:46.530> lot<00:05:46.800> of<00:05:46.950> guys<00:05:47.490> came<00:05:47.760> over<00:05:48.030> from<00:05:48.120> ps3<00:05:48.450> or

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
pro a lot of guys came over from ps3 or

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.930 
pro a lot of guys came over from ps3 or
xbox<00:05:49.200> that's<00:05:49.440> just<00:05:49.920> to<00:05:50.010> try<00:05:50.220> it<00:05:50.250> out<00:05:50.430> and<00:05:50.490> what

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
xbox that's just to try it out and what

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.480 
xbox that's just to try it out and what
the<00:05:51.210> controller<00:05:51.600> they<00:05:51.780> used<00:05:52.050> there<00:05:52.350> was<00:05:52.490> that

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
the controller they used there was that

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.190 
the controller they used there was that
was<00:05:53.790> the<00:05:53.970> classic<00:05:54.480> controller<00:05:54.570> pro<00:05:54.870> as<00:05:55.110> you

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.200 
was the classic controller pro as you

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.750 
was the classic controller pro as you
could<00:05:55.350> imagine<00:05:55.440> so<00:05:55.920> that<00:05:56.100> was<00:05:56.220> easiest<00:05:56.520> for

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
could imagine so that was easiest for

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:57.950 
could imagine so that was easiest for
them<00:05:56.790> to<00:05:56.970> use<00:05:57.090> i<00:05:57.240> think<00:05:57.420> that's<00:05:57.600> why<00:05:57.780> they

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
them to use i think that's why they

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.960 
them to use i think that's why they
brought<00:05:58.110> it<00:05:58.260> in<00:05:58.350> there<00:05:58.530> probably<00:05:59.520> to<00:05:59.610> increase

00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970 
brought it in there probably to increase

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.390 
brought it in there probably to increase
sales<00:06:00.180> a<00:06:00.300> little<00:06:00.480> bit<00:06:00.890> with<00:06:01.890> their<00:06:02.070> more

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
sales a little bit with their more

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.920 
sales a little bit with their more
hardcore<00:06:02.790> titles<00:06:03.240> because<00:06:03.390> as<00:06:03.660> you<00:06:03.780> guys<00:06:03.900> know

think<00:06:08.430> it<00:06:08.730> should<00:06:08.910> be<00:06:08.940> pretty<00:06:09.180> interesting

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.350 
think it should be pretty interesting

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.050 
think it should be pretty interesting
when<00:06:10.350> when<00:06:10.650> black<00:06:10.890> ops<00:06:11.040> 2<00:06:11.310> does<00:06:11.490> hit<00:06:11.700> the<00:06:11.790> wii<00:06:11.910> u

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
when when black ops 2 does hit the wii u

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.580 
when when black ops 2 does hit the wii u
i<00:06:12.090> think<00:06:12.390> it<00:06:12.480> should<00:06:12.600> be<00:06:12.630> really<00:06:13.560> interesting

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
i think it should be really interesting

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.230 
i think it should be really interesting
to<00:06:13.980> see<00:06:14.160> how<00:06:14.280> many<00:06:14.340> people<00:06:14.490> are<00:06:14.820> using<00:06:14.970> which

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
to see how many people are using which

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.180 
to see how many people are using which
controller<00:06:15.690> probably<00:06:16.230> you<00:06:16.650> can<00:06:16.830> tell<00:06:17.040> from

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
controller probably you can tell from

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.830 
controller probably you can tell from
the<00:06:17.400> killcam<00:06:17.820> like<00:06:18.060> if<00:06:18.180> they're<00:06:18.330> using<00:06:18.450> a<00:06:18.690> wii

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
the killcam like if they're using a wii

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.210 
the killcam like if they're using a wii
remote<00:06:19.110> you<00:06:19.230> can<00:06:19.260> tell<00:06:19.530> that<00:06:19.560> it's<00:06:19.740> more<00:06:20.010> of<00:06:20.190> a

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
remote you can tell that it's more of a

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.820 
remote you can tell that it's more of a
kind<00:06:21.030> of<00:06:21.090> like<00:06:21.180> a<00:06:21.210> free<00:06:21.600> like<00:06:22.320> it<00:06:22.530> like<00:06:22.710> the

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
kind of like a free like it like the

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.440 
kind of like a free like it like the
guns<00:06:23.070> more<00:06:23.340> free<00:06:23.610> it's<00:06:23.790> like<00:06:24.000> Wiggly<00:06:24.420> and

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450 
guns more free it's like Wiggly and

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.050 
guns more free it's like Wiggly and
stuff<00:06:24.930> like<00:06:25.080> that<00:06:25.250> while<00:06:26.250> you<00:06:26.700> know<00:06:26.790> if<00:06:26.910> you're

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
stuff like that while you know if you're

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.420 
stuff like that while you know if you're
using<00:06:27.240> a<00:06:27.480> classic<00:06:27.960> controller<00:06:28.380> pro<00:06:28.470> or<00:06:28.920> who

using a classic controller pro or who

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.890 
using a classic controller pro or who
knows<00:06:29.460> maybe<00:06:29.850> you<00:06:30.000> can<00:06:30.180> even<00:06:30.270> use<00:06:30.420> the<00:06:30.660> gamepad

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
knows maybe you can even use the gamepad

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.810 
knows maybe you can even use the gamepad
for<00:06:31.200> some<00:06:31.620> things<00:06:31.860> like<00:06:32.070> if<00:06:32.280> you<00:06:32.520> guys<00:06:32.640> have

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820 
for some things like if you guys have

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.700 
for some things like if you guys have
seen<00:06:32.880> any<00:06:33.150> black<00:06:33.540> ops<00:06:33.870> 2<00:06:34.050> gameplay<00:06:34.260> you<00:06:34.500> could

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
seen any black ops 2 gameplay you could

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.620 
seen any black ops 2 gameplay you could
see<00:06:34.890> that<00:06:35.040> when<00:06:35.280> they<00:06:35.850> call<00:06:36.030> in<00:06:36.060> certain<00:06:36.450> kill

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
see that when they call in certain kill

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:37.940 
see that when they call in certain kill
streaks<00:06:36.900> they<00:06:37.050> take<00:06:37.230> out<00:06:37.410> that<00:06:37.590> kind<00:06:37.830> of

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:37.950 
streaks they take out that kind of

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.430 
streaks they take out that kind of
little<00:06:38.310> tablet<00:06:39.240> thing<00:06:39.390> it<00:06:39.540> looks<00:06:39.930> exactly

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
little tablet thing it looks exactly

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.390 
little tablet thing it looks exactly
like<00:06:40.710> the

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 
like the

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.580 
like the
the<00:06:41.729> wii<00:06:41.910> u<00:06:42.060> controller<00:06:42.540> the<00:06:43.080> new<00:06:43.259> wii<00:06:43.440> u

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590 
the wii u controller the new wii u

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.409 
the wii u controller the new wii u
controller<00:06:43.979> i<00:06:44.220> wonder<00:06:44.520> if<00:06:44.669> you<00:06:44.699> could<00:06:45.090> maybe

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:45.419 
controller i wonder if you could maybe

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:47.689 
controller i wonder if you could maybe
switch<00:06:45.810> like<00:06:46.380> if<00:06:46.590> you<00:06:46.770> had<00:06:47.190> your<00:06:47.370> wii<00:06:47.520> u

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:47.699 
switch like if you had your wii u

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:49.249 
switch like if you had your wii u
controller<00:06:48.150> on<00:06:48.360> if<00:06:48.479> you<00:06:48.570> could<00:06:48.720> maybe<00:06:48.870> swap

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:49.259 
controller on if you could maybe swap

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:51.499 
controller on if you could maybe swap
out<00:06:49.500> to<00:06:50.100> that<00:06:50.250> controller<00:06:50.669> and<00:06:50.940> control<00:06:51.389> the

00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:51.509 
out to that controller and control the

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:53.140 
out to that controller and control the
killstreak<00:06:51.900> with<00:06:52.050> that<00:06:52.229> kind<00:06:52.500> of<00:06:52.590> like

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.150 
killstreak with that kind of like

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.580 
killstreak with that kind of like
possibly<00:06:54.150> like<00:06:54.360> if<00:06:54.479> you<00:06:54.570> get<00:06:54.720> an<00:06:54.810> RC<00:06:55.110> car<00:06:55.350> maybe

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:55.590 
possibly like if you get an RC car maybe

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.249 
possibly like if you get an RC car maybe
you<00:06:55.800> could<00:06:56.009> take<00:06:56.580> your<00:06:56.759> wii<00:06:57.090> u<00:06:57.240> controller<00:06:57.660> the

00:06:58.249 --> 00:06:58.259 
you could take your wii u controller the

00:06:58.259 --> 00:06:59.930 
you could take your wii u controller the
new<00:06:58.410> one<00:06:58.620> and<00:06:58.800> kind<00:06:59.039> of<00:06:59.250> mess<00:06:59.490> around<00:06:59.639> with<00:06:59.910> it

00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 
new one and kind of mess around with it

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.700 
new one and kind of mess around with it
maybe<00:07:00.240> drive<00:07:00.570> the<00:07:00.750> RC<00:07:01.080> car<00:07:01.320> with<00:07:01.350> it<00:07:01.560> that

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:01.710 
maybe drive the RC car with it that

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.620 
maybe drive the RC car with it that
would<00:07:01.770> be<00:07:01.919> really<00:07:02.070> cool<00:07:02.240> like<00:07:03.240> I<00:07:03.330> said<00:07:03.389> you

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:03.630 
would be really cool like I said you

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:04.969 
would be really cool like I said you
wouldn't<00:07:03.840> be<00:07:03.870> really<00:07:04.080> required<00:07:04.530> to<00:07:04.680> do<00:07:04.830> that

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:04.979 
wouldn't be really required to do that

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:06.710 
wouldn't be really required to do that
only<00:07:05.160> if<00:07:05.430> you<00:07:05.550> had<00:07:05.669> a<00:07:05.699> plugged<00:07:06.030> in<00:07:06.180> and<00:07:06.330> on<00:07:06.479> or

something like that who knows what

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.860 
something like that who knows what
charak<00:07:09.000> will<00:07:09.120> do<00:07:09.270> here<00:07:09.479> with<00:07:09.660> the<00:07:09.750> new

charak will do here with the new

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:11.120 
charak will do here with the new
controller<00:07:10.289> schemes<00:07:10.650> it<00:07:10.860> should<00:07:11.039> be

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.130 
controller schemes it should be

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:12.560 
controller schemes it should be
interesting<00:07:11.280> to<00:07:11.580> see<00:07:11.789> how<00:07:11.910> it<00:07:12.060> goes<00:07:12.210> like<00:07:12.449> I

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:12.570 
interesting to see how it goes like I

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.360 
interesting to see how it goes like I
said<00:07:12.780> it<00:07:13.380> also<00:07:13.680> should<00:07:13.860> be<00:07:13.949> interesting<00:07:14.340> to

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:14.370 
said it also should be interesting to

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.159 
said it also should be interesting to
see<00:07:14.610> what<00:07:14.639> controllers<00:07:15.240> people<00:07:15.570> use<00:07:15.750> so<00:07:15.960> who's
