00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
around it because the corners where they

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.730 
around it because the corners where they
are<00:02:46.490> now<00:02:46.700> it<00:02:47.270> won't<00:02:47.570> allow<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:47.930> corners<00:02:48.410> to<00:02:48.590> be

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
are now it won't allow the corners to be

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.340 
are now it won't allow the corners to be
pushed<00:02:49.040> right<00:02:49.250> there<00:02:49.490> so<00:02:49.700> I'm<00:02:49.790> just<00:02:49.970> gonna

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350
