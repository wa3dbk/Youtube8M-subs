00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:05.330
 Hamburg gets it in the preliminary round a 3 1 2 price comparisons a bit ahead 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.619
 and completely on the table 

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:12.709
 but who assumes that the striker is the ball to 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:14.709
 the city council has filed 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.170
 and to her research made clear what length and we shoot 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:18.720
 can 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.990
 that once seen the course should be 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.189
 at 11 20 clock 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.159
 Cabbage would 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:24.909
 bossard arena 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:26.250
 Hundreds of meters in length 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.689
 and the long corridors 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.710
 Porsche usually demonstrates once an exit these quantities and percent 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.710
 The technology really is that they are always the same 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.070
 so and also it is apparent that there are now these shortcomings 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.470
 to turn up to down 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.100
 you see Bernd Rabehl about three lengths him a future indeed 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.180
 but only two samples that is 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.170
 we have to set one to move 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.109
 as always 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:53.989
 if possible before the second arise us to move alternately to it 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.860
 the striker of the 7 of our scheme cordially 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.070
 Gate for the meantime there are people the numbers for the first quarter 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.620
 where they are very 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.180
 clear distance 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.430
 to BRA 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.090
 Work not so fast 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.740
 after an obvious 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.750
 In principle, it should be avoided that ours 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.320
 attentively 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.720
 Last call a very difficult box when migrants Schumacher 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.450
 Environmentalists want to protest 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.020
 and from there 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.330
 Trying to clean up roots in the room 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.380
 now it is always there again alternately 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.170
 the two defenders change 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.520
 around the product so Hofmann found the Falcon 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.710
 that is of course that way 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.200
 that the big rest is easy and fast to shoot so it should be 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.600
 as relatively as possible relatively often arise from art 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.289
 so it's just a variant that can support the mood 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.560
 around he may have but until the beginning that would be just fair flowers 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.610
 Ballack "It's now 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.710
 of course for presence during the holidays 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.469
 m just to make the ATM or you have switched 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:02.530
 I had there I hold myself there 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.590
 and percent 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.440
 yes the corners are of course you do the Rieder 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.779
 and put it in such as possible in the topic 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:12.579
 often succeed 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:14.089
 You can also leave that out 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.879
 so far 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.159
 Beware also a 1 0 would be self-nourish 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.200
 the ship off 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.669
 install the flash estimate on perennial burner in the basement 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:26.139
 So, where normally we have to take care of it 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:27.849
 watching 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.319
 then they test us 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.569
 at the premiere in Moscow won 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.279
 is expressed 

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:35.979
 waiting there 

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:39.519
 this is a novelty the countries are to ask for the chancellor 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:42.129
 when can you already be seen 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.539
 So that means they can shoot at us 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:46.999
 SAS and now seen that way 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:48.080
 it was at the beginning 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.799
 and now very short 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.399
 and of course to make a pure short film 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:54.909
 Of course, that does not happen to the children, of course, that the 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:56.749
 short wake up cover 

00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:58.949
 but there it is usually changing 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:01.299
 he is mostly unsuccessful 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.539
 that is, if I wait a while now 

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:06.689
 cover with a zoom 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:09.689
 since both shortly before the ditching in the Hudson 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:14.459
 You should not even if you focus on the customers but finally 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:15.659
 also the banks 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.339
 Bruns on the 4th 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:20.149
 so that is sufficient
