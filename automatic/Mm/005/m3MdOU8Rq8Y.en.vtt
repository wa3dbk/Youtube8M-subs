there<00:00:58.010> longer<00:00:58.220> after<00:00:58.670> everyone<00:00:59.120> else<00:00:59.290> he<00:01:00.290> I

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
there longer after everyone else he I

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.149 
there longer after everyone else he I
think<00:01:01.460> he<00:01:01.670> was<00:01:01.820> of<00:01:02.000> the<00:01:02.180> opinion<00:01:02.989> that<00:01:03.409> you

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
think he was of the opinion that you

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.030 
think he was of the opinion that you
could<00:01:04.460> never<00:01:04.909> not<00:01:05.239> improve<00:01:05.690> even<00:01:06.290> if<00:01:06.590> you<00:01:06.830> were

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
could never not improve even if you were

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.950 
could never not improve even if you were
the<00:01:07.220> best<00:01:07.430> goalkeeper<00:01:08.030> in<00:01:08.060> the<00:01:08.240> country<00:01:08.720> which

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
the best goalkeeper in the country which

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.410 
the best goalkeeper in the country which
many<00:01:09.200> thought<00:01:09.380> it<00:01:09.590> was<00:01:09.770> you<00:01:10.549> know<00:01:10.670> you<00:01:10.940> can

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
many thought it was you know you can

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.969 
many thought it was you know you can
always<00:01:11.570> improve<00:01:11.840> in<00:01:12.200> that<00:01:12.229> I<00:01:12.530> suppose<00:01:12.770> that's

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
always improve in that I suppose that's

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:19.899 
always improve in that I suppose that's
a<00:01:13.070> lesson<00:01:13.280> for<00:01:13.400> all<00:01:13.549> of<00:01:13.790> us<00:01:18.579> remember<00:01:19.579> I<00:01:19.729> don't

a lesson for all of us remember I don't

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.840 
a lesson for all of us remember I don't
think<00:01:20.090> we<00:01:20.210> conceded<00:01:20.750> about<00:01:21.229> one<00:01:21.710> goal<00:01:22.009> in<00:01:22.520> that

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850

round<00:01:27.890> Preston<00:01:28.430> North<00:01:28.609> End<00:01:28.789> where<00:01:29.210> we<00:01:29.810> were

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
round Preston North End where we were

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:31.719 
round Preston North End where we were
really<00:01:30.289> under<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:30.950> cost<00:01:31.189> you<00:01:31.310> saved<00:01:31.609> the

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
really under the cost you saved the

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.690 
really under the cost you saved the
penalty<00:01:32.180> but<00:01:32.840> Spartan<00:01:33.619> that<00:01:33.770> he<00:01:33.890> made<00:01:34.159> two<00:01:34.460> or

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
it was just a youngster then it probably

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.510

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
was superb and you still at this this

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.570 
was superb and you still at this this
con<00:02:05.630> figure<00:02:06.110> standing<00:02:06.500> there<00:02:06.710> even<00:02:07.130> at<00:02:07.370> that

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
con figure standing there even at that

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.719 
con figure standing there even at that
young<00:02:07.850> age<00:02:07.910> who<00:02:08.780> was<00:02:08.929> assured<00:02:09.350> and<00:02:09.710> who<00:02:10.250> I

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
young age who was assured and who I

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.670 
young age who was assured and who I
don't<00:02:11.000> know<00:02:11.060> if<00:02:11.120> he<00:02:11.210> was<00:02:11.300> assured<00:02:11.540> inside<00:02:12.050> but

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
don't know if he was assured inside but

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.430 
don't know if he was assured inside but
certainly<00:02:13.280> gave<00:02:13.580> that<00:02:13.880> air<00:02:14.360> off<00:02:14.720> when<00:02:15.080> winning

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
certainly gave that air off when winning

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.200 
certainly gave that air off when winning
when<00:02:15.740> he<00:02:15.830> was<00:02:15.950> there<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:16.340> that<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:17.000> is

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
when he was there and that that is

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.390 
when he was there and that that is
perhaps<00:02:17.510> you<00:02:17.840> know<00:02:17.960> part<00:02:18.800> of<00:02:18.860> a<00:02:18.920> goalkeepers

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
perhaps you know part of a goalkeepers

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.910 
perhaps you know part of a goalkeepers
make<00:02:19.580> up<00:02:19.820> if<00:02:19.970> you<00:02:20.150> look<00:02:20.450> difficult<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.710> be

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
make up if you look difficult to be
