00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.050 
hi I'm sue Daly and I'm here to
introduce<00:00:22.919> jigsaw<00:00:23.919> second<00:00:24.340> edition<00:00:24.759> in<00:00:24.880> month

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
introduce jigsaw second edition in month

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.259 
introduce jigsaw second edition in month
one<00:00:25.329> now<00:00:26.019> the<00:00:26.800> first<00:00:27.009> edition<00:00:27.489> was<00:00:27.699> so<00:00:27.849> popular

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:28.269 
one now the first edition was so popular

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:29.729 
one now the first edition was so popular
we<00:00:28.419> decided<00:00:28.840> to<00:00:28.989> bring<00:00:29.140> on<00:00:29.289> the<00:00:29.410> second

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:29.739 
we decided to bring on the second

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:31.349 
we decided to bring on the second
division<00:00:29.919> so<00:00:30.519> that<00:00:30.730> you<00:00:30.849> can<00:00:31.000> build<00:00:31.239> your

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 
division so that you can build your

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.619 
division so that you can build your
library<00:00:31.779> to<00:00:32.259> a<00:00:32.290> much<00:00:32.579> greater<00:00:33.579> scale<00:00:33.850> and<00:00:34.360> have

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:34.629 
library to a much greater scale and have

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:36.210 
library to a much greater scale and have
so<00:00:34.870> many<00:00:35.019> more<00:00:35.290> shapes<00:00:35.559> for<00:00:35.800> you<00:00:35.890> to<00:00:35.980> play<00:00:36.190> with

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
so many more shapes for you to play with

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.910 
so many more shapes for you to play with
so<00:00:37.000> all<00:00:37.809> that<00:00:37.989> interacting<00:00:38.620> and<00:00:38.769> like<00:00:38.890> a

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
so all that interacting and like a

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.829 
so all that interacting and like a
jigsaw<00:00:39.309> puzzle<00:00:39.339> and<00:00:39.760> and<00:00:40.180> you<00:00:40.300> can't<00:00:40.540> put<00:00:40.690> some

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:40.839 
jigsaw puzzle and and you can't put some

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:43.619 
jigsaw puzzle and and you can't put some
amazing<00:00:41.290> designs<00:00:41.649> so<00:00:42.339> this<00:00:42.970> month<00:00:43.300> we're

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
amazing designs so this month we're

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.939 
amazing designs so this month we're
introducing<00:00:44.440> the<00:00:44.589> kite<00:00:44.979> and<00:00:45.430> the<00:00:45.579> double<00:00:45.879> kite

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
introducing the kite and the double kite

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.310 
introducing the kite and the double kite
so<00:00:47.949> here<00:00:48.220> we<00:00:48.339> have<00:00:48.550> a<00:00:48.579> kite<00:00:49.000> shape<00:00:49.210> and<00:00:49.510> this<00:00:50.140> is

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
so here we have a kite shape and this is

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.920 
so here we have a kite shape and this is
a<00:00:50.500> double<00:00:50.920> pipe<00:00:51.100> now<00:00:51.729> these<00:00:51.970> actually<00:00:52.390> are

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
a double pipe now these actually are

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.369 
a double pipe now these actually are
segments<00:00:53.530> of<00:00:53.589> a<00:00:54.360> hexagon<00:00:55.360> again

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
segments of a hexagon again

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:06.420 
segments of a hexagon again
so<00:00:56.530> it's<00:00:56.890> again<00:00:57.869> you<00:01:04.560> can<00:01:05.560> cut<00:01:05.740> a<00:01:05.770> hexagon<00:01:05.950> in

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
so it's again you can cut a hexagon in

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.510 
so it's again you can cut a hexagon in
two<00:01:06.790> different<00:01:07.890> ways<00:01:08.890> you<00:01:08.920> can<00:01:09.220> cut<00:01:09.400> it<00:01:09.490> down

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
two different ways you can cut it down

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.039 
two different ways you can cut it down
the<00:01:09.820> center<00:01:10.000> this<00:01:10.240> way<00:01:10.450> you<00:01:10.509> can<00:01:10.720> come<00:01:10.869> across

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
the center this way you can come across

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.190 
the center this way you can come across
this<00:01:11.409> way<00:01:11.619> but<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:12.640> kite<00:01:12.909> is<00:01:13.210> a<00:01:13.270> section<00:01:13.930> that

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
this way but the kite is a section that

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.469 
this way but the kite is a section that
comes<00:01:14.470> and<00:01:15.430> it's<00:01:15.579> probably<00:01:15.790> really<00:01:16.240> difficult

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
comes and it's probably really difficult

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.840 
comes and it's probably really difficult
either<00:01:16.869> see<00:01:17.170> white<00:01:17.409> on<00:01:17.439> white<00:01:17.740> but<00:01:18.490> it<00:01:18.670> is<00:01:18.820> a

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
either see white on white but it is a

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.510 
either see white on white but it is a
section<00:01:19.270> of<00:01:19.390> a<00:01:19.479> hexagon<00:01:19.720> here<00:01:20.290> okay<00:01:21.159> so<00:01:21.220> it's

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
section of a hexagon here okay so it's

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.580 
section of a hexagon here okay so it's
just<00:01:21.610> a<00:01:21.880> segment<00:01:22.329> and<00:01:22.450> there<00:01:22.929> would<00:01:23.049> be<00:01:23.079> six<00:01:23.409> of

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
just a segment and there would be six of

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.029 
just a segment and there would be six of
those<00:01:23.740> would<00:01:23.979> make<00:01:24.009> a<00:01:24.369> hexagon<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:26.229> what<00:01:26.890> we've

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
those would make a hexagon so what we've

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:29.639 
those would make a hexagon so what we've
got<00:01:27.069> is<00:01:27.280> in<00:01:28.270> your<00:01:28.479> little<00:01:28.659> layout<00:01:28.899> we've<00:01:29.409> shown

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
got is in your little layout we've shown

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:31.859 
got is in your little layout we've shown
you<00:01:29.799> a<00:01:29.829> few<00:01:29.920> different<00:01:30.310> ways<00:01:30.429> to<00:01:30.490> well<00:01:31.060> to<00:01:31.719> lay

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
you a few different ways to well to lay

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.139 
you a few different ways to well to lay
this<00:01:32.079> block<00:01:32.439> out<00:01:32.649> so<00:01:33.009> we<00:01:33.159> have<00:01:33.429> our<00:01:33.640> kite<00:01:33.880> shape

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
this block out so we have our kite shape

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.450 
this block out so we have our kite shape
in<00:01:34.420> here<00:01:34.719> so<00:01:35.259> we've<00:01:35.409> used<00:01:35.619> different<00:01:35.829> fabrics

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
in here so we've used different fabrics

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.800 
in here so we've used different fabrics
just<00:01:36.729> the<00:01:37.270> same

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
just the same

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.230 
just the same
Chevron<00:01:38.229> fabric<00:01:38.560> here<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:39.700> same<00:01:39.939> kind<00:01:40.179> of

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
Chevron fabric here the same kind of

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.669 
Chevron fabric here the same kind of
care<00:01:40.479> but<00:01:40.630> cut<00:01:40.840> from<00:01:41.020> a<00:01:41.139> different<00:01:41.170> pattern

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
care but cut from a different pattern

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.450 
care but cut from a different pattern
repeat<00:01:42.130> and<00:01:42.369> then<00:01:42.880> our<00:01:43.060> double<00:01:43.420> pipe<00:01:44.009> sits<00:01:45.009> on

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
repeat and then our double pipe sits on

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.239 
repeat and then our double pipe sits on
the<00:01:45.670> outside<00:01:45.700> here<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:47.619> here's<00:01:47.859> a<00:01:47.920> couple<00:01:48.130> of

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:48.249 
the outside here so here's a couple of

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:51.090 
the outside here so here's a couple of
different<00:01:48.609> variations<00:01:48.999> that<00:01:49.619> we've<00:01:50.619> done<00:01:50.859> on

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
different variations that we've done on

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.319 
different variations that we've done on
the<00:01:51.130> same<00:01:51.399> fabric<00:01:51.729> in<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:51.969> middle<00:01:52.209> now

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
the same fabric in the middle now

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:54.300 
the same fabric in the middle now
classic<00:01:52.749> cutting<00:01:53.079> just<00:01:53.289> randomly<00:01:53.740> cut<00:01:54.100> and

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
classic cutting just randomly cut and

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.639 
classic cutting just randomly cut and
then<00:01:54.969> of<00:01:55.389> course<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:55.840> ship<00:01:55.899> I'm<00:01:56.200> throwing<00:01:56.409> on

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
then of course the ship I'm throwing on

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.949 
then of course the ship I'm throwing on
the<00:01:56.859> outside<00:01:57.249> and<00:01:57.639> it's<00:01:58.090> facet<00:01:58.479> cut<00:01:58.659> a<00:01:58.689> little

00:01:58.949 --> 00:01:58.959 
the outside and it's facet cut a little

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:01.630 
the outside and it's facet cut a little
bit<00:01:59.079> just<00:01:59.259> so<00:01:59.350> we<00:01:59.469> can<00:01:59.740> join<00:01:59.889> us

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
bit just so we can join us

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.490 
bit just so we can join us
again<00:02:02.640> quite<00:02:03.120> scrappy<00:02:03.690> this<00:02:03.840> one<00:02:04.080> using<00:02:04.440> the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
again quite scrappy this one using the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.580 
again quite scrappy this one using the
fabrics<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.720> different<00:02:06.720> ways<00:02:06.870> this<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.320> just

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
fabrics in different ways this is just

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.110 
fabrics in different ways this is just
using<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.310> double<00:02:09.000> kite<00:02:09.290> there's<00:02:10.290> no<00:02:11.120> single

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
using the double kite there's no single

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.190 
using the double kite there's no single
kites<00:02:12.360> in<00:02:12.600> there<00:02:12.750> that's<00:02:12.930> at<00:02:13.020> they're<00:02:13.170> all

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
kites in there that's at they're all

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.710 
kites in there that's at they're all
doubles<00:02:14.510> and<00:02:15.510> again<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:17.250> same<00:02:17.520> just<00:02:18.480> other

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
doubles and again the same just other

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.740 
doubles and again the same just other
parts<00:02:19.110> in<00:02:19.290> this<00:02:19.440> one<00:02:19.820> now<00:02:20.820> if<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.270> want<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:21.600> put

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
parts in this one now if you want to put

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.470 
parts in this one now if you want to put
it<00:02:21.840> together<00:02:22.070> in<00:02:23.070> a<00:02:23.520> different<00:02:23.670> way<00:02:23.880> just<00:02:24.240> play

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
it together in a different way just play

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.210 
it together in a different way just play
with<00:02:24.660> it<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.020> so<00:02:25.200> I'm<00:02:25.680> going<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.010> show<00:02:26.190> you

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
with it and so I'm going to show you

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.980 
with it and so I'm going to show you
some<00:02:26.550> more<00:02:26.580> ways<00:02:26.970> of<00:02:27.300> placing<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:27.780> together

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
some more ways of placing that together

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.460 
some more ways of placing that together
on<00:02:28.350> my<00:02:28.530> in<00:02:28.830> my<00:02:28.950> little<00:02:29.160> black<00:02:29.250> book<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:30.470> take

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
on my in my little black book and take

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.930 
on my in my little black book and take
one's<00:02:31.770> attention<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.370> then<00:02:32.460> you<00:02:32.550> may<00:02:32.670> be<00:02:32.730> able

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
one's attention and then you may be able

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.800 
one's attention and then you may be able
to<00:02:33.030> make<00:02:33.210> those<00:02:33.420> designs<00:02:33.840> as<00:02:34.050> well<00:02:35.750> okay<00:02:36.750> so

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
to make those designs as well okay so

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.770 
to make those designs as well okay so
we've<00:02:37.170> got<00:02:37.200> our<00:02:37.350> kite<00:02:37.710> shape<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:39.360> if<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.570> put

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
we've got our kite shape and if you put

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.910 
we've got our kite shape and if you put
your<00:02:39.900> six<00:02:40.110> together<00:02:40.940> into<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.030> center<00:02:42.920> we're

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
your six together into the center we're

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
your six together into the center we're
going<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:44.280> have<00:02:46.580> end<00:02:47.580> up<00:02:47.730> with<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:47.880> hexagon<00:02:48.450> a

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
going to have end up with a hexagon a

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.860 
going to have end up with a hexagon a
three-inch<00:02:50.940> X<00:02:51.180> at<00:02:51.330> them<00:02:51.480> because<00:02:51.570> each<00:02:51.840> of

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
three-inch X at them because each of

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.810 
three-inch X at them because each of
those<00:02:52.140> edges<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.920> bottom<00:02:53.220> of<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.550> kite

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
those edges of the bottom of the kite

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.390 
those edges of the bottom of the kite
for<00:02:54.300> one<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.570> half<00:02:54.600> inches<00:02:55.080> so<00:02:55.190> two<00:02:56.190> times

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
for one and a half inches so two times

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.370 
for one and a half inches so two times
one<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.760> half<00:02:56.910> gives<00:02:57.150> you<00:02:57.270> three<00:02:57.600> so<00:02:58.260> that

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
one and a half gives you three so that

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.000 
one and a half gives you three so that
would<00:02:58.530> give<00:02:58.710> you<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:58.920> whole<00:02:59.250> 3-inch<00:02:59.940> hexagon

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
would give you a whole 3-inch hexagon

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.980 
would give you a whole 3-inch hexagon
now<00:03:02.010> what<00:03:02.160> we've<00:03:02.340> done<00:03:02.370> with<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.360> in<00:03:03.810> your

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
now what we've done with the in your

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.590 
now what we've done with the in your
pattern<00:03:04.350> sheet<00:03:04.680> we've<00:03:05.310> just<00:03:05.580> placed<00:03:05.850> the

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
pattern sheet we've just placed the

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.270 
pattern sheet we've just placed the
double<00:03:06.959> kites<00:03:07.200> around<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.740> outside<00:03:08.070> edge

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
double kites around the outside edge

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.410 
double kites around the outside edge
like<00:03:08.970> this<00:03:09.350> okay

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420

you could then place your kites just

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:24.350 
you could then place your kites just
using<00:03:17.670> kites<00:03:22.280> can<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.370> see<00:03:23.550> that<00:03:23.820> your<00:03:24.090> double

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
using kites can you see that your double

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.940 
using kites can you see that your double

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
pipe there your single kite if you want

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.610 
pipe there your single kite if you want
different<00:03:26.340> fabrics<00:03:26.910> coming<00:03:27.360> in<00:03:27.510> there<00:03:27.750> sorry

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
single kites around the outside edge and

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.110 
single kites around the outside edge and
the<00:03:40.560> other<00:03:40.590> thing<00:03:40.980> you<00:03:41.100> can<00:03:41.280> do<00:03:41.489> is<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:41.970> can

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
the other thing you can do is you can

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:49.870 
the other thing you can do is you can
bring<00:03:42.300> your<00:03:42.450> double<00:03:42.750> kites<00:03:42.989> in<00:03:46.220> and<00:03:47.220> we<00:03:48.209> can

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
bring your double kites in and we can

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:58.880 
bring your double kites in and we can
place<00:03:50.880> them<00:03:51.090> around<00:03:51.239> the<00:03:51.510> outside<00:03:53.239> like<00:03:54.239> this

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.270 

and<00:03:59.890> like<00:04:00.100> this<00:04:01.440> you're<00:04:02.440> gonna<00:04:02.500> get<00:04:02.740> a<00:04:02.980> rather

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
and like this you're gonna get a rather

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.130 
and like this you're gonna get a rather
large<00:04:04.410> flower<00:04:05.410> looking<00:04:06.750> shape<00:04:07.750> so<00:04:08.020> you're

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
large flower looking shape so you're

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.490 
large flower looking shape so you're
doing<00:04:08.380> one<00:04:09.340> shape<00:04:10.300> on<00:04:10.540> and<00:04:10.750> then<00:04:10.900> one<00:04:11.110> reverse

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
doing one shape on and then one reverse

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.190 
doing one shape on and then one reverse
so<00:04:11.980> you<00:04:12.070> can<00:04:12.250> see<00:04:12.459> that<00:04:13.360> one<00:04:13.510> goes<00:04:13.690> that<00:04:13.900> way<00:04:14.020> in

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
so you can see that one goes that way in

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.349 
so you can see that one goes that way in
your<00:04:14.410> reverse<00:04:14.709> this<00:04:15.340> one<00:04:15.580> over<00:04:15.850> this<00:04:15.970> way<00:04:16.150> so

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
your reverse this one over this way so

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:17.310 
your reverse this one over this way so
be<00:04:16.480> careful<00:04:16.780> when<00:04:16.900> you're<00:04:16.989> cutting<00:04:17.109> your

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
be careful when you're cutting your

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.670 
be careful when you're cutting your
fabric<00:04:17.470> out<00:04:17.769> that<00:04:18.430> you<00:04:18.579> cut<00:04:18.930> one<00:04:19.930> and<00:04:20.320> one

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
fabric out that you cut one and one

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.400 
fabric out that you cut one and one
reverse<00:04:21.900> particular<00:04:22.900> if<00:04:22.960> you're<00:04:23.080> fussy

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
reverse particular if you're fussy

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.560 
reverse particular if you're fussy
cutting<00:04:23.650> something<00:04:24.060> then<00:04:25.060> we<00:04:25.150> continue

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
cutting something then we continue

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.190 
cutting something then we continue
around<00:04:26.940> and<00:04:28.530> so<00:04:29.530> you<00:04:29.620> get<00:04:29.770> a<00:04:29.830> whole<00:04:30.100> shape

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
around and so you get a whole shape

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.540 
around and so you get a whole shape
coming<00:04:32.200> around<00:04:32.500> the<00:04:32.680> outside<00:04:35.190> ok<00:04:36.190> so<00:04:36.250> there's

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
coming around the outside ok so there's

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.180 
coming around the outside ok so there's
many<00:04:36.700> things<00:04:36.850> you<00:04:37.090> can<00:04:37.270> do<00:04:37.390> with<00:04:37.510> these<00:04:37.950> now<00:04:38.950> if

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
many things you can do with these now if

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.710 
many things you can do with these now if
you<00:04:39.310> didn't<00:04:39.580> want<00:04:39.700> to<00:04:39.760> piece<00:04:39.970> the<00:04:40.180> middle<00:04:40.480> and

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
you didn't want to piece the middle and

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.870 
you didn't want to piece the middle and
you<00:04:40.870> had<00:04:41.080> some<00:04:41.290> three-inch<00:04:41.710> exit<00:04:42.130> bonds<00:04:42.310> you

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
you had some three-inch exit bonds you

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.830 
you had some three-inch exit bonds you
could<00:04:43.060> just<00:04:43.270> replace<00:04:43.510> all<00:04:43.960> of<00:04:43.990> that<00:04:44.200> with<00:04:45.840> one

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
could just replace all of that with one

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.760 
could just replace all of that with one
3-inch<00:04:47.260> hexagon<00:04:48.780> so<00:04:49.780> what<00:04:49.990> we've<00:04:50.169> done<00:04:50.410> is

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
3-inch hexagon so what we've done is

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.890 
3-inch hexagon so what we've done is
we've<00:04:50.950> made<00:04:51.190> up<00:04:51.400> some<00:04:51.669> placemats<00:04:52.300> or<00:04:52.510> table

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
we've made up some placemats or table

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.760 
we've made up some placemats or table
centers<00:04:53.290> using<00:04:53.590> the<00:04:53.940> reproduction<00:04:54.940> fabric<00:04:55.770> so

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
centers using the reproduction fabric so

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.730 
centers using the reproduction fabric so
you<00:04:56.800> can<00:04:57.040> see<00:04:57.270> that<00:04:58.270> they're<00:04:58.690> very<00:04:58.870> similar<00:04:59.200> to

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
you can see that they're very similar to

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.870 
you can see that they're very similar to
these<00:05:00.030> that<00:05:01.030> we<00:05:01.210> have<00:05:01.390> down<00:05:01.930> here<00:05:02.350> now<00:05:02.880> right

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
these that we have down here now right

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.090 
these that we have down here now right
probably<00:05:04.270> that's<00:05:05.229> very<00:05:05.470> different<00:05:05.710> in<00:05:05.979> our

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
probably that's very different in our

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.570 
probably that's very different in our
reproduction<00:05:06.760> fabric<00:05:07.890> same<00:05:08.890> pattern<00:05:09.280> design

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
reproduction fabric same pattern design

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.580 
reproduction fabric same pattern design
same<00:05:10.000> layer<00:05:10.270> but<00:05:10.990> just

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
same layer but just

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.250 
same layer but just
appliquéd<00:05:12.130> onto<00:05:12.430> a<00:05:12.490> background<00:05:12.729> and<00:05:13.360> then<00:05:13.930> a

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
appliquéd onto a background and then a

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.530 
appliquéd onto a background and then a
binding<00:05:14.710> so<00:05:14.919> this<00:05:15.100> is<00:05:15.220> a<00:05:15.250> hexagon<00:05:15.880> to<00:05:16.210> take<00:05:16.390> the

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
binding so this is a hexagon to take the

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.540 
binding so this is a hexagon to take the
same<00:05:16.750> shape<00:05:17.020> as<00:05:17.229> the<00:05:17.260> finished<00:05:17.800> hexagon<00:05:18.280> here

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
same shape as the finished hexagon here

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
same shape as the finished hexagon here
this<00:05:19.270> one's<00:05:19.510> done<00:05:19.780> a<00:05:20.110> little<00:05:20.770> different

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
this one's done a little different

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.360 
this one's done a little different
layout<00:05:22.570> just<00:05:23.500> saw<00:05:23.800> see<00:05:23.860> coming

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
layout just saw see coming

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.000 
layout just saw see coming
the<00:05:24.729> striped<00:05:25.470> reproduction<00:05:26.470> fabric<00:05:26.770> in<00:05:26.919> the

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
the striped reproduction fabric in the

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.010 
the striped reproduction fabric in the
middle<00:05:27.340> to<00:05:27.790> give<00:05:27.910> it<00:05:28.000> a<00:05:28.060> different<00:05:28.390> effect<00:05:28.660> and

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
middle to give it a different effect and

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.960 
middle to give it a different effect and
again<00:05:29.169> then<00:05:29.620> just<00:05:29.950> with<00:05:30.310> a<00:05:30.340> binding<00:05:30.820> around

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
again then just with a binding around

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.780 
again then just with a binding around
the<00:05:31.150> outside<00:05:31.479> of<00:05:31.630> a<00:05:31.690> hexagon<00:05:32.490> and<00:05:33.490> you<00:05:33.640> can

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
the outside of a hexagon and you can

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.560 
the outside of a hexagon and you can
also<00:05:33.940> see<00:05:34.330> that<00:05:34.540> this<00:05:34.690> one's<00:05:34.960> placed<00:05:36.570> placed

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
also see that this one's placed placed

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.780 
also see that this one's placed placed
the<00:05:38.110> same<00:05:38.290> way<00:05:38.500> the<00:05:38.680> explorers<00:05:38.979> in<00:05:39.430> this<00:05:39.520> one's

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
the same way the explorers in this one's

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.340 
the same way the explorers in this one's
place<00:05:40.120> the<00:05:40.360> other<00:05:40.570> way<00:05:40.840> so<00:05:40.900> you<00:05:41.169> get<00:05:41.290> a

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:41.350 
place the other way so you get a

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.790 
place the other way so you get a
different<00:05:41.740> effect<00:05:41.830> again<00:05:42.700> so<00:05:43.510> that's<00:05:44.380> it<00:05:44.620> for

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
different effect again so that's it for

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.250 
different effect again so that's it for
me<00:05:44.950> this<00:05:45.280> week<00:05:45.400> and<00:05:46.000> I'll<00:05:46.150> be<00:05:46.300> back<00:05:46.479> to<00:05:47.050> see<00:05:47.229> you

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
me this week and I'll be back to see you

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.340 
me this week and I'll be back to see you
again<00:05:47.470> next<00:05:47.919> week<00:05:48.190> with<00:05:48.870> multi<00:05:49.870> number<00:05:50.110> two

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
again next week with multi number two

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.390 
again next week with multi number two
and<00:05:51.130> we've<00:05:51.640> got<00:05:51.790> some<00:05:51.940> exciting<00:05:52.270> things
