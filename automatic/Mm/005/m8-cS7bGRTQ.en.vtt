00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.090

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:09.969
 German soldiers nothing better 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:12.700
 to happen as after paris order 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.629
 it was the cooperative sste and 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:19.039
 most disciplined of the occupied areas 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:20.630
 in europe an officer of the here 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.519
 was ordered that he knew the war 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.470
 She had missed it 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.810
 to nothing 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.929
 the only ones fighting here 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:33.009
 at most those who were around the 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.009
 best table in the restaurant 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.270
 the French are cowards 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.410

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.250
 The landing of the enemies in Normandy 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.170
 has a few of them and lured out 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.520

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.720
 but they will pay me 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.340
 and I will not make a difference 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.340
 between the rebels and the others 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.149
 in herning i can only guess the city 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.149
 As soon as possible they have to leave 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.799
 nothing to do with it 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:15.859
 I'm supposed to leave Paris and where should I go 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:20.119

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:22.359

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.189

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.189
 arrived 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.100
 I know the men and women who 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.550
 people of resistance underestimate them 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.740
 Not 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.930
 They have to give up their job more 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.430
 privacy your family and you will 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.380

 war is not a pleasure trip yes it is 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.660
 But war is like many men have 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.770
 a few thousand against three 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.840
 a million inhabitants 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.160
 and they make short work of them 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.810
 if not today then tomorrow 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.250

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.440
 they think they know her 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.910
 They are diplomats uplink a soldier 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.800
 So save your advice 3 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.940
 million civilians that's it 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.810
 nothing hot air this rubbish 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.810
 I with his art 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:32.390
 europe 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.390
 flames we would all die 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.500
 the Allies had landed and 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.120
 marched on paris to the Germans 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.310
 they wanted to destroy everything 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.770
 equalize soil 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.030
 especially the blow up of the paris 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.360
 Bridges will be spectacular 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.090
 flood that can leach out 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.680
 henceforth was five minutes to the bridges 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.230
 Notre Dame is blown up and the 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.860
 Stations Nothing stays that way 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.860
 command of the leader 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.850
 why do you really want this city? 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.850
 destroy the city commander 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.210
 she does not care about the nordlinger 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.800
 They hear each other when they talk to me today 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.060
 tomorrow would not have asked in with them 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.010
 I would contact you now 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.510

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.370
 people who want to kill them soon 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.390
 hear them on the theater and be 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.460
 finally ask her 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.050
 civilians are civilians for the 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.930
 this click is a joke around the 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.160
 have done absolutely nothing to them 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.810
 how many children are as old as 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.200
 their are probably among those dead since 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.400
 they have ever held it 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.810
 I was ordered to paris 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.700
 to restore order I will 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.890
 do more than that and what exactly do you have 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.590
 I'm going to crush them all up 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.540
 on the last man 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.640
 I was deceived and signal him 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.380
 in myself I thought so 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.930
 could it be from such a madman 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:57.230
 dissuade projects 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.060
 So we're going to print that lion 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.010
 or the plaste la concorde never again 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.900

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:07.710
 We will no longer have children in the day 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:12.410
 play mon dieu towers of others 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.410
 All this will disappear forever 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:25.409
