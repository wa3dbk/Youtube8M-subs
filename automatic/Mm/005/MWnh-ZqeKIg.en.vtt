00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.690
 Hello dear friends 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.400
 final lesson on how to create 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.230
 back for bristow bk 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.410
 and in this tutorial I will show in detail how 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:20.670
 connect this model here 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:25.880
 stylet so let's edit the taurus 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:30.480
 that is, we remove unnecessary bones so 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:33.570
 here we don't need to remove the bones 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:40.250
 legs, we just remove these here we are not 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.250
 will need so head 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:51.260
 let's take the bones of the face we will remove 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:01:00.000
 that we will leave the fallen and still more we 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:01:06.330
 do that we remove the elbow but the bones 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:10.619
 shoulders at us and so something like this 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:15.390
 it turned out now let's join 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:22.040
 try to hold shift and select 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:26.549
 bone ends and is automatic afraid 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:31.670
 Well so so so so so let's 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.670
 try to export the land format 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:44.390
 so dota run so now click on 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.970
 pause 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:55.390
 so dota started let's load 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:58.030
 workshop so choose a hero lure without 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:03.850
 word sum 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:09.759
 choose our model and files type sku 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.759
 click and here is the moment of truth 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:25.000
 this I certainly did not expect but still here 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.000
 we drew such a texture 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:37.910
 join this well we see textures 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:42.340
 have applied normally see it his 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.340
 folds somehow normal ok 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:52.880
 applied damn it writes let's see 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:03:00.940
 how will it be the board looks like i will click on 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:00.940
 pause so we choose shining bk 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:17.030
 he and stare at how handsome he is 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.549
 this here do not be afraid of something that shine through 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:26.480
 it is on all models as it should be 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:32.299
 so here we see what happened here for 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:35.440
 garbage that is, this shoulder is needed still 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.440
 add weight 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:43.370
 to whether the choke interacted struck 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.920
 more power 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.909
 let's see how it will apply 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:55.069
 ability 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:04:07.629
 oh my god it's just some kind of tin I 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:14.569
 didn't expect just like god guys so 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:17.410
 now let's do what we do 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:26.240
 try to add weight here to this shoulder 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:28.729
 now click on pause and so that 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.610
 add weight we need to go into this 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:38.810
 tab that is when 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:40.510
 and choose choose the right shoulder let's 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:45.010
 choose bones 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.010
 in the reinforcement tab we 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:59.320
 to lead the bones and and what we do here 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:03.430
 to this caste of conversations find he go here on 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:08.660
 we are a little bit here in this place 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:14.240
 add weight how do we do it to us 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:20.479
 you need to be about 0.5 to line up 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:23.020
 and quietly add here this way 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.020
 that's about 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:40.759
 somewhere I do not know the main thing in this 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:44.229
 really do not overdo it here in general how 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:44.229
 so and the key 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:54.669
 since you too much 0.2 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:07.779
 you can try something like this 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:07.779
 it comes out of this by exporting and 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:23.569
 we load in dota and so we select 3 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:30.789
 column and look so well, that's something 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:36.579
 more or less something has become less 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:40.639
 Well, something like this, so in general on this 

00:06:36.579 --> 00:06:44.119
 our lesson is over all i wanted 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:46.999
