00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
was his attention to storytelling which

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.360 
was his attention to storytelling which
really<00:05:01.900> is<00:05:02.080> a<00:05:02.110> very<00:05:02.290> important<00:05:02.770> element<00:05:02.889> in<00:05:03.250> a

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
really is a very important element in a

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.180 
really is a very important element in a
a<00:05:03.520> tiger<00:05:03.940> I<00:05:04.570> think<00:05:05.139> the<00:05:05.229> storytelling<00:05:05.860> in<00:05:06.070> the

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
a tiger I think the storytelling in the

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.670 
a tiger I think the storytelling in the
action<00:05:06.520> sequences<00:05:07.090> is<00:05:07.330> what<00:05:07.680> differentiates

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
action sequences is what differentiates

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.800 
action sequences is what differentiates
our<00:05:09.039> action<00:05:09.430> from<00:05:09.580> other<00:05:09.789> films<00:05:10.060> you<00:05:10.539> know<00:05:10.570> a

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
our action from other films you know a

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.469 
our action from other films you know a
lot<00:05:11.590> of<00:05:11.710> action<00:05:12.310> films<00:05:12.520> sometimes<00:05:12.789> do<00:05:13.090> action

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
lot of action films sometimes do action

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.240 
lot of action films sometimes do action
for<00:05:13.630> the<00:05:13.720> sake<00:05:13.840> of<00:05:13.990> action<00:05:14.350> so<00:05:14.500> it's<00:05:14.620> like<00:05:14.800> okay

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
for the sake of action so it's like okay

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.620 
for the sake of action so it's like okay
let's<00:05:15.430> stop<00:05:15.610> and<00:05:15.789> fight<00:05:15.940> and<00:05:16.180> then<00:05:16.389> there's<00:05:16.570> a

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
let's stop and fight and then there's a

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.390 
let's stop and fight and then there's a
fight<00:05:16.810> for<00:05:16.990> five<00:05:17.169> minutes<00:05:17.350> in<00:05:17.860> extra<00:05:18.220> time<00:05:18.250> I

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
fight for five minutes in extra time I

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.860 
fight for five minutes in extra time I
feel<00:05:18.669> very<00:05:18.850> aware<00:05:19.120> that<00:05:19.180> we<00:05:19.330> don't<00:05:19.570> want<00:05:19.720> to<00:05:19.750> do

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
feel very aware that we don't want to do

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.050 
feel very aware that we don't want to do
that<00:05:20.080> the<00:05:20.229> action<00:05:20.740> has<00:05:21.039> to<00:05:21.340> take<00:05:21.669> the<00:05:21.850> story

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
that the action has to take the story

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.730 
that the action has to take the story
forward<00:05:22.450> it<00:05:22.690> has<00:05:22.810> to<00:05:22.960> become<00:05:23.110> a<00:05:23.260> part<00:05:23.530> of<00:05:23.620> the

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
forward it has to become a part of the

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.140 
forward it has to become a part of the
narrative<00:05:23.919> and<00:05:24.400> Conrad<00:05:25.300> is<00:05:25.450> excellent<00:05:26.020> in

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
narrative and Conrad is excellent in

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.730 
narrative and Conrad is excellent in
bringing<00:05:28.150> the<00:05:28.300> story<00:05:28.539> forward<00:05:28.840> in<00:05:29.200> his<00:05:29.410> action

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
bringing the story forward in his action

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.570 
bringing the story forward in his action
scenes

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.700 

then<00:05:33.150> there<00:05:33.479> was<00:05:33.599> of<00:05:33.720> course<00:05:33.750> Marcos<00:05:34.289> Marcos

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
then there was of course Marcos Marcos

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.260 
then there was of course Marcos Marcos
rounds<00:05:35.069> with<00:05:35.250> who<00:05:35.580> was<00:05:35.729> a<00:05:35.819> stunt<00:05:36.120> coordinator

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
rounds with who was a stunt coordinator

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.839 
rounds with who was a stunt coordinator
now<00:05:36.840> Marcos<00:05:37.229> Marcos<00:05:38.129> hasn't<00:05:38.490> had<00:05:38.699> an

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
now Marcos Marcos hasn't had an

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:40.550 
now Marcos Marcos hasn't had an
association<00:05:39.449> with<00:05:39.569> the<00:05:39.660> bond<00:05:39.870> series<00:05:40.169> he<00:05:40.470> had

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
association with the bond series he had

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.499 
association with the bond series he had
worked<00:05:40.830> on<00:05:40.889> the<00:05:40.949> Bourne<00:05:41.159> Ultimatum<00:05:41.280> and<00:05:41.940> that

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:42.509 
worked on the Bourne Ultimatum and that

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:44.240 
worked on the Bourne Ultimatum and that
is<00:05:42.629> what<00:05:42.750> attracted<00:05:43.139> me<00:05:43.199> to<00:05:43.319> Marco's<00:05:43.860> because

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
is what attracted me to Marco's because

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.089 
is what attracted me to Marco's because
that's<00:05:44.970> the<00:05:45.270> kind<00:05:45.539> of<00:05:45.710> stunts<00:05:46.710> and<00:05:46.860> those<00:05:46.979> are

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:47.099 
that's the kind of stunts and those are

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:49.189 
that's the kind of stunts and those are
the<00:05:47.220> kind<00:05:47.400> of<00:05:47.520> action<00:05:48.270> sequences<00:05:48.629> I<00:05:48.750> had<00:05:49.020> in

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 
the kind of action sequences I had in

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:51.409 
the kind of action sequences I had in
mind<00:05:49.409> you<00:05:49.889> know<00:05:50.009> because<00:05:50.250> they<00:05:50.460> are<00:05:50.610> lodges<00:05:51.330> in

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
mind you know because they are lodges in

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:52.850 
mind you know because they are lodges in
life<00:05:51.569> yet<00:05:51.810> they<00:05:51.930> very<00:05:52.110> is<00:05:52.229> real<00:05:52.500> they're<00:05:52.740> very

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
life yet they very is real they're very

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.649 
life yet they very is real they're very
logical<00:05:53.460> if<00:05:53.639> somebody<00:05:53.970> is<00:05:54.090> jumping<00:05:54.449> across

00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:54.659 
logical if somebody is jumping across

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:56.930 
logical if somebody is jumping across
the<00:05:54.870> street<00:05:55.139> it<00:05:55.379> looks<00:05:55.830> that<00:05:56.039> like<00:05:56.550> that<00:05:56.699> jump

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
the street it looks that like that jump

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.399 
the street it looks that like that jump
jump<00:05:57.330> can<00:05:57.539> be<00:05:57.569> done<00:05:57.900> by<00:05:58.050> a<00:05:58.080> trained

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:58.409 
jump can be done by a trained

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:00.920 
jump can be done by a trained
professional<00:05:58.620> it<00:05:59.250> doesn't<00:05:59.490> look<00:05:59.639> like<00:05:59.930> you

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
professional it doesn't look like you

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.570 
professional it doesn't look like you
know<00:06:01.050> you're<00:06:01.199> a<00:06:01.229> superhero<00:06:01.680> or<00:06:01.860> a<00:06:01.979> Superman<00:06:02.460> to

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
know you're a superhero or a Superman to

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.580 
know you're a superhero or a Superman to
jump<00:06:02.759> across<00:06:02.970> that<00:06:03.180> so<00:06:03.629> I<00:06:04.169> think<00:06:04.530> the

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
jump across that so I think the

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.080 
jump across that so I think the
combination<00:06:04.800> of<00:06:05.250> these<00:06:05.430> two<00:06:05.669> has<00:06:05.819> worked

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
combination of these two has worked

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.159 
combination of these two has worked
brilliantly<00:06:06.720> and<00:06:07.289> I'm<00:06:08.069> really<00:06:08.550> happy<00:06:08.849> with

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:09.169 
brilliantly and I'm really happy with

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:12.740 
brilliantly and I'm really happy with
the<00:06:10.169> way<00:06:10.319> the<00:06:10.530> action<00:06:10.800> sequences<00:06:11.280> of<00:06:11.539> egg<00:06:12.539> that

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
the way the action sequences of egg that

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.230 
the way the action sequences of egg that
I<00:06:12.870> can<00:06:13.080> have<00:06:13.199> worked<00:06:13.380> out<00:06:13.639> there<00:06:14.639> was<00:06:14.729> one<00:06:14.940> shot

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
I can have worked out there was one shot

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.760 
I can have worked out there was one shot
on<00:06:15.449> the<00:06:15.569> scaffolding<00:06:16.050> where<00:06:16.229> it<00:06:16.319> kind<00:06:16.470> of<00:06:16.530> goes

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
on the scaffolding where it kind of goes

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.040 
on the scaffolding where it kind of goes
from<00:06:17.009> one<00:06:17.490> building<00:06:17.729> to<00:06:17.909> another<00:06:18.060> that<00:06:18.810> shot

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
from one building to another that shot

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.600 
from one building to another that shot
they<00:06:19.199> had<00:06:19.289> planned<00:06:19.560> the<00:06:19.800> wide<00:06:19.949> shot<00:06:20.250> with<00:06:20.490> the

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
they had planned the wide shot with the

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.790 
they had planned the wide shot with the
double<00:06:20.909> and<00:06:21.090> when<00:06:21.599> I<00:06:21.630> saw<00:06:21.900> it<00:06:21.930> I<00:06:22.110> said<00:06:22.349> I<00:06:22.380> felt<00:06:22.680> I

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
double and when I saw it I said I felt I

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.839 
double and when I saw it I said I felt I
could<00:06:22.949> do<00:06:23.069> it<00:06:23.190> and<00:06:23.340> everyone<00:06:23.580> is<00:06:23.610> a<00:06:23.729> little

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:23.849 
could do it and everyone is a little

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:26.240 
could do it and everyone is a little
nervous<00:06:24.300> at<00:06:24.449> first<00:06:24.479> but<00:06:25.020> I<00:06:25.289> think<00:06:26.069> that's

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
nervous at first but I think that's

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.070 
nervous at first but I think that's
that's<00:06:26.490> the<00:06:26.639> fun<00:06:26.909> of<00:06:26.940> filmmaking<00:06:27.509> as<00:06:27.719> long<00:06:27.900> as

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
that's the fun of filmmaking as long as

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.870 
that's the fun of filmmaking as long as
you<00:06:28.259> know<00:06:28.380> it's<00:06:28.680> not<00:06:28.830> they're<00:06:29.490> not<00:06:29.639> saying

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 
you know it's not they're not saying

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.059 
you know it's not they're not saying
okay<00:06:30.150> it's<00:06:30.300> really<00:06:30.930> dangerous<00:06:31.080> it's<00:06:31.800> just<00:06:32.009> a

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:32.069 
okay it's really dangerous it's just a

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:33.499 
okay it's really dangerous it's just a
matter<00:06:32.280> I<00:06:32.370> think<00:06:32.430> of<00:06:32.699> being<00:06:32.849> afraid<00:06:33.389> of

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:33.509 
matter I think of being afraid of

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:35.360 
matter I think of being afraid of
heights<00:06:33.810> and<00:06:34.080> afraid<00:06:34.319> of<00:06:34.349> falling<00:06:34.680> but<00:06:35.099> I
