what are antibiotics antibiotics are

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.290 
what are antibiotics antibiotics are
compounds<00:00:16.010> that<00:00:16.129> are<00:00:16.250> used<00:00:16.490> to<00:00:16.670> treat<00:00:16.910> disease

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
compounds that are used to treat disease

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.270 
compounds that are used to treat disease
specifically<00:00:17.960> bacterial<00:00:18.650> diseases<00:00:18.980> they

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:19.280 
specifically bacterial diseases they

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.060 
specifically bacterial diseases they
kill<00:00:19.520> bacteria<00:00:20.380> where<00:00:21.380> do<00:00:21.470> these<00:00:21.560> things<00:00:21.800> come

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
kill bacteria where do these things come

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.630 
kill bacteria where do these things come
from<00:00:22.100> well<00:00:23.290> it's<00:00:24.290> I<00:00:24.590> think<00:00:25.070> a<00:00:25.160> lot<00:00:25.310> of<00:00:25.400> people

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
from well it's I think a lot of people

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.460 
from well it's I think a lot of people
don't<00:00:25.820> understand<00:00:26.330> that<00:00:26.630> that<00:00:26.840> antibiotics

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
don't understand that that antibiotics

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.890 
don't understand that that antibiotics
are<00:00:27.680> natural<00:00:28.490> compounds<00:00:28.700> they're<00:00:29.480> produced

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
are natural compounds they're produced

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.920 
are natural compounds they're produced
by<00:00:30.110> moulds<00:00:30.710> that<00:00:30.770> grow<00:00:31.130> in<00:00:31.310> the<00:00:31.400> soil<00:00:31.840> some<00:00:32.840> of

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
by moulds that grow in the soil some of

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.990 
by moulds that grow in the soil some of
these<00:00:33.020> molds<00:00:33.320> are<00:00:33.530> very<00:00:33.710> bacterial<00:00:34.399> like<00:00:34.670> and

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
these molds are very bacterial like and

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.420 
these molds are very bacterial like and
they've<00:00:35.870> been<00:00:36.020> doing<00:00:36.230> this<00:00:36.440> for<00:00:36.500> millions<00:00:37.309> of

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
they've been doing this for millions of

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.579 
they've been doing this for millions of
years

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:38.589 
years

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:41.529 
years
moulds<00:00:39.589> grow<00:00:39.800> pretty<00:00:40.070> slowly<00:00:40.370> so<00:00:40.730> there's<00:00:41.449> a

00:00:41.529 --> 00:00:41.539 
moulds grow pretty slowly so there's a

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:43.619 
moulds grow pretty slowly so there's a
lot<00:00:41.690> of<00:00:41.780> competition<00:00:42.440> in<00:00:42.559> the<00:00:42.679> soil<00:00:42.949> for

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
lot of competition in the soil for

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:45.880 
lot of competition in the soil for
nutrients<00:00:44.629> and<00:00:44.749> whatnot<00:00:45.170> and<00:00:45.199> and<00:00:45.589> there<00:00:45.769> it

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
nutrients and whatnot and and there it

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.290 
nutrients and whatnot and and there it
kind<00:00:46.190> of<00:00:46.280> at<00:00:46.399> a<00:00:46.429> disadvantage

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
kind of at a disadvantage

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.419 
kind of at a disadvantage
so<00:00:47.870> they<00:00:47.989> produced<00:00:48.409> these<00:00:48.559> antibiotics<00:00:49.309> to

00:00:49.419 --> 00:00:49.429 
so they produced these antibiotics to

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:51.250 
so they produced these antibiotics to
sort<00:00:49.670> of<00:00:49.699> keep<00:00:49.850> bacteria<00:00:50.510> back<00:00:50.749> so<00:00:51.109> they'll

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
sort of keep bacteria back so they'll

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
sort of keep bacteria back so they'll
have<00:00:51.379> a<00:00:51.499> place<00:00:51.769> to<00:00:51.980> live<00:00:53.649> this<00:00:54.649> was<00:00:54.859> not<00:00:55.039> known

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
have a place to live this was not known

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.669 
have a place to live this was not known
for<00:00:55.550> a<00:00:55.579> long<00:00:55.730> long<00:00:55.999> time<00:00:56.300> obviously<00:00:56.629> in<00:00:57.199> the

00:00:57.669 --> 00:00:57.679 
for a long long time obviously in the

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:00.719 
for a long long time obviously in the
earliest<00:00:57.979> early<00:00:58.489> 20th<00:00:58.909> century<00:00:59.300> a<00:00:59.690> few

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:00.729 
earliest early 20th century a few

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:03.579 
earliest early 20th century a few
scientists<00:01:01.729> kind<00:01:01.940> of<00:01:02.030> observed<00:01:02.420> that<00:01:02.749> you

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
scientists kind of observed that you

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.760 
scientists kind of observed that you
know<00:01:03.710> what<00:01:03.970> seems<00:01:04.970> like<00:01:05.180> fungi<00:01:05.900> or<00:01:06.170> molds<00:01:06.620> are

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
know what seems like fungi or molds are

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.880 
know what seems like fungi or molds are
producing<00:01:07.340> something<00:01:07.820> that<00:01:08.000> kills<00:01:08.210> bacteria

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
producing something that kills bacteria

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.709 
producing something that kills bacteria
there<00:01:09.890> was<00:01:10.009> a<00:01:10.040> guy<00:01:10.280> named<00:01:10.579> Alexander<00:01:11.270> Fleming

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:11.719 
there was a guy named Alexander Fleming

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:14.230 
there was a guy named Alexander Fleming
who<00:01:11.899> said<00:01:12.320> you<00:01:12.469> know<00:01:12.590> I<00:01:12.619> I've<00:01:13.280> got<00:01:13.579> a<00:01:13.610> mold<00:01:13.909> here

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
who said you know I I've got a mold here

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.969 
who said you know I I've got a mold here
that<00:01:14.780> I<00:01:14.810> know<00:01:14.930> is<00:01:15.500> doing<00:01:15.920> something<00:01:16.219> to<00:01:17.979> kill

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
that I know is doing something to kill

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.980 
that I know is doing something to kill
bacteria<00:01:19.460> or<00:01:19.820> prevent<00:01:20.210> them<00:01:20.299> from<00:01:20.360> growing<00:01:20.600> or

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
bacteria or prevent them from growing or

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.459 
bacteria or prevent them from growing or
something<00:01:22.570> he<00:01:23.570> was<00:01:23.600> working<00:01:24.049> with<00:01:24.079> a<00:01:24.200> mold

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:24.469 
something he was working with a mold

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:28.600 
something he was working with a mold
called<00:01:24.740> Penicillium<00:01:25.570> that<00:01:26.570> mold<00:01:27.610> was

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
called Penicillium that mold was

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.190 
called Penicillium that mold was
producing<00:01:29.119> something<00:01:29.509> to<00:01:29.570> kill<00:01:29.780> bacteria

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
producing something to kill bacteria

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.499 
producing something to kill bacteria
years<00:01:30.619> later<00:01:30.890> he<00:01:31.520> figured<00:01:31.880> it<00:01:32.000> out<00:01:32.119> make<00:01:32.479> a

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
years later he figured it out make a

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.599 
years later he figured it out make a
long<00:01:32.750> story<00:01:33.049> short<00:01:33.170> and<00:01:33.680> that's<00:01:34.340> where

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:34.609 
long story short and that's where

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:37.060 
long story short and that's where
penicillin<00:01:35.240> came<00:01:35.479> from<00:01:35.719> the<00:01:36.469> first<00:01:36.740> wonder

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
penicillin came from the first wonder

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.099 
penicillin came from the first wonder
drug<00:01:37.310> so<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.390> discovery<00:01:38.780> of<00:01:38.930> penicillin

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:39.109 
drug so the discovery of penicillin

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:41.380 
drug so the discovery of penicillin
really<00:01:39.890> triggered<00:01:40.369> the<00:01:40.579> age<00:01:40.820> of<00:01:41.030> discovery

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
really triggered the age of discovery

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.289 
really triggered the age of discovery
for<00:01:42.020> antibiotics<00:01:42.829> scientists<00:01:43.640> scoured<00:01:44.149> the

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
for antibiotics scientists scoured the

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.749 
for antibiotics scientists scoured the
whole<00:01:44.329> world<00:01:45.039> literally<00:01:46.039> digging<00:01:46.460> through

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
whole world literally digging through

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.330 
whole world literally digging through
the<00:01:46.880> soil<00:01:47.149> looking<00:01:47.630> for<00:01:47.689> all<00:01:48.020> these<00:01:48.340> novel

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
the soil looking for all these novel

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.300 
the soil looking for all these novel
little<00:01:50.259> molds<00:01:51.259> that<00:01:51.409> were<00:01:51.560> producing

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
little molds that were producing

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.130 
little molds that were producing
antibiotics<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:53.240> lo<00:01:53.329> and<00:01:53.450> behold<00:01:53.570> they<00:01:53.929> found

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
antibiotics and lo and behold they found

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.260 
antibiotics and lo and behold they found
many<00:01:54.590> many<00:01:54.829> of<00:01:55.070> them<00:01:55.219> all<00:01:55.399> over<00:01:55.429> the<00:01:55.759> world<00:01:55.969> and

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
many many of them all over the world and

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.149 
many many of them all over the world and
found<00:01:56.960> out<00:01:57.170> that<00:01:57.200> these<00:01:57.530> things<00:01:57.770> had<00:01:58.009> been

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
found out that these things had been

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.010 
found out that these things had been
here<00:01:58.369> all<00:01:58.579> along<00:01:58.609> so<00:02:01.060> that<00:02:02.060> the

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
here all along so that the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.630 
here all along so that the
pharmaceutical<00:02:03.799> companies<00:02:04.189> began<00:02:04.490> to

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
pharmaceutical companies began to

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.060 
pharmaceutical companies began to
develop<00:02:04.939> these<00:02:05.299> products<00:02:05.869> for<00:02:06.140> use<00:02:06.350> in<00:02:06.649> humans

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
develop these products for use in humans

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.140 
develop these products for use in humans
and<00:02:07.340> also<00:02:07.700> in<00:02:07.909> animals<00:02:08.420> and<00:02:09.520> in<00:02:10.520> the<00:02:10.700> beginning

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
and also in animals and in the beginning

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.970 
and also in animals and in the beginning
they<00:02:11.300> they<00:02:11.630> produce<00:02:11.870> these<00:02:12.230> by<00:02:12.470> growing<00:02:12.740> up

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
they they produce these by growing up

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.330 
they they produce these by growing up
the<00:02:13.190> fungi<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:13.700> large<00:02:14.239> vats<00:02:15.069> purifying<00:02:16.069> the

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
the fungi and large vats purifying the

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.679 
the fungi and large vats purifying the
antibiotic<00:02:16.849> out<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.269> that<00:02:17.390> became<00:02:17.659> the

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:18.689 
antibiotic out and that became the

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:20.940 
antibiotic out and that became the
mostly<00:02:19.689> today<00:02:19.900> they're<00:02:20.260> produced

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950
