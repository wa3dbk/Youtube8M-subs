going to show you is circular spreading
and<00:00:49.110> that's<00:00:49.620> basically<00:00:49.829> taking<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.760> and

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
and that's basically taking it and

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.049 
and that's basically taking it and
splitting<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.140> center<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:53.059> drawing

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
splitting it in the center and drawing

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.000 
splitting it in the center and drawing
these<00:00:54.180> little<00:00:54.539> slash<00:00:54.780> lines<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.710> then<00:00:55.829> we're

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
these little slash lines and then we're

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.639 
these little slash lines and then we're
going<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.250> open<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.730> up<00:00:56.879> out<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.180> way<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.960> our

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
going to open it up out that way and our

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.950 
going to open it up out that way and our
outside<00:00:59.129> edge<00:00:59.399> here<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.210> going<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.600> stay<00:01:00.780> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
outside edge here is going to stay the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.310 
outside edge here is going to stay the
same<00:01:01.230> cream<00:01:05.510> alrighty<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.930> first<00:01:07.200> thing

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320

pattern<00:01:10.130> retrace<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.310> on<00:01:11.430> another<00:01:11.640> piece<00:01:11.909> of

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
pattern retrace it on another piece of

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.020 
pattern retrace it on another piece of
paper<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.920> we're<00:01:13.920> going<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.280> start<00:01:14.670> by

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
paper and we're going to start by

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.510 
paper and we're going to start by
drawing<00:01:15.330> these<00:01:15.630> horizontal<00:01:16.080> lines<00:01:16.520> across

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
drawing these horizontal lines across

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.370 
drawing these horizontal lines across
and<00:01:18.000> we're<00:01:18.090> going<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.299> divide<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.810> up<00:01:18.900> kind<00:01:19.259> of

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
and we're going to divide it up kind of

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.179 
and we're going to divide it up kind of
easy<00:01:19.680> evenly<00:01:20.600> going<00:01:21.600> down<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.799> we're<00:01:23.040> only

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
easy evenly going down and we're only

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.870 
easy evenly going down and we're only
going<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.610> mess<00:01:23.759> with<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.060> camp<00:01:24.330> area<00:01:25.610> so<00:01:26.610> draw

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
going to mess with the camp area so draw

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:35.310 
going to mess with the camp area so draw
a<00:01:26.909> bunch<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.390> these

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.740 

okay<00:01:36.320> so<00:01:36.380> after<00:01:37.100> you've<00:01:37.460> drawn<00:01:37.760> your<00:01:37.910> lines<00:01:38.270> it

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
okay so after you've drawn your lines it

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.020 
okay so after you've drawn your lines it
should<00:01:39.050> look<00:01:39.530> like<00:01:39.800> this<00:01:40.340> you<00:01:40.670> should<00:01:40.700> have<00:01:40.970> a

should look like this you should have a
bunch<00:01:41.270> of<00:01:41.330> lines<00:01:41.510> going<00:01:41.750> horizontally<00:01:42.650> then

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
bunch of lines going horizontally then

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.270 
bunch of lines going horizontally then
what<00:01:44.150> we're<00:01:44.360> going<00:01:44.390> to<00:01:44.780> do<00:01:44.990> is<00:01:45.229> cut<00:01:45.710> it<00:01:45.890> down

have<00:01:49.250> your<00:01:49.280> center<00:01:49.700> line<00:01:49.729> on<00:01:50.120> your<00:01:50.270> pattern

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
have your center line on your pattern

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.650 
have your center line on your pattern
you<00:01:50.840> need<00:01:51.050> that<00:01:51.520> if<00:01:52.520> not<00:01:52.910> then<00:01:53.180> just<00:01:53.210> fold<00:01:53.510> your

cut<00:02:25.130> from<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.489> center<00:02:25.880> out<00:02:26.090> to<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.840> end

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
cut from the center out to the end

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.670 
cut from the center out to the end
center<00:02:27.620> to<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:27.830> edge<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.550> then<00:02:29.510> we're<00:02:30.500> going

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
center to the edge and then we're going

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.610 
center to the edge and then we're going
to<00:02:30.770> start<00:02:30.980> spreading<00:02:31.700> it<00:02:32.050> let<00:02:33.050> me<00:02:33.080> show<00:02:33.320> you<00:02:33.350> an

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
to start spreading it let me show you an

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.229 
to start spreading it let me show you an
example<00:02:33.739> of<00:02:34.310> what<00:02:34.610> I<00:02:34.640> mean<00:02:36.730> let's<00:02:37.730> spread<00:02:38.030> it

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
example of what I mean let's spread it

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.590 
example of what I mean let's spread it
like<00:02:38.269> this<00:02:40.090> each<00:02:41.090> piece<00:02:41.420> just<00:02:41.870> a<00:02:42.230> little<00:02:42.560> bit

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
like this each piece just a little bit

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.210 
like this each piece just a little bit
and<00:02:44.600> if<00:02:44.810> I<00:02:44.930> can<00:02:45.110> get<00:02:45.230> this<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.709> meet<00:02:45.920> back<00:02:46.190> up

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
and if I can get this to meet back up

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.390 
and if I can get this to meet back up
exactly<00:02:47.260> you<00:02:48.260> see<00:02:48.290> each<00:02:48.680> piece<00:02:48.950> is<00:02:49.130> going<00:02:49.310> to

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
exactly you see each piece is going to

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.539 
exactly you see each piece is going to
be<00:02:49.549> spread<00:02:49.910> like<00:02:50.239> that<00:02:50.950> then<00:02:51.950> once<00:02:52.130> you<00:02:52.250> spread

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
be spread like that then once you spread

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.460 
be spread like that then once you spread
one<00:02:52.790> then<00:02:53.030> you<00:02:53.150> continue<00:02:53.330> spreading<00:02:53.840> each<00:02:54.200> one

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
one then you continue spreading each one

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.130 
one then you continue spreading each one
this<00:02:55.190> age<00:02:55.489> should<00:02:56.060> stay<00:02:56.360> together<00:02:56.630> though

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
this age should stay together though

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.470 
this age should stay together though
don't<00:02:57.620> separate<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.700> edge<00:02:58.850> of<00:02:59.030> your<00:02:59.180> sleeve

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
don't separate the edge of your sleeve

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.180 
don't separate the edge of your sleeve
we're<00:03:00.080> just<00:03:00.260> going<00:03:00.380> to<00:03:00.410> be<00:03:00.500> separating<00:03:01.070> from

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
we're just going to be separating from

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:08.640 
we're just going to be separating from
the<00:03:01.370> inside<00:03:01.760> out

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.720 

so<00:03:10.000> now<00:03:11.000> I'm<00:03:11.500> one<00:03:12.500> side<00:03:12.830> and<00:03:13.160> this<00:03:13.280> is<00:03:13.490> what<00:03:13.640> it

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
so now I'm one side and this is what it

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.040 
so now I'm one side and this is what it
looks<00:03:13.910> like<00:03:14.030> when<00:03:14.210> all<00:03:14.420> your<00:03:14.570> pieces<00:03:14.720> are

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
looks like when all your pieces are

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.790 
looks like when all your pieces are
spread<00:03:15.350> apart<00:03:15.500> and<00:03:16.010> so<00:03:17.000> you<00:03:17.900> see<00:03:17.930> each<00:03:18.290> one<00:03:18.560> you

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
spread apart and so you see each one you

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.770 
spread apart and so you see each one you
should<00:03:19.070> still<00:03:19.580> stay<00:03:19.880> connected<00:03:20.240> on<00:03:20.600> this

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
should still stay connected on this

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.560 
should still stay connected on this
outside<00:03:21.350> edge<00:03:21.730> don't<00:03:22.730> cut<00:03:23.090> through<00:03:23.270> the<00:03:23.360> edge

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
outside edge don't cut through the edge

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.120 
outside edge don't cut through the edge
and<00:03:23.900> this<00:03:24.080> is<00:03:24.230> just<00:03:24.440> a<00:03:24.530> little<00:03:24.680> mistake<00:03:24.890> here

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
and this is just a little mistake here

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.400 
and this is just a little mistake here
and<00:03:26.090> someone<00:03:26.300> computers<00:03:26.780> a<00:03:26.810> little<00:03:27.110> harder<00:03:27.380> to

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
and someone computers a little harder to

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.610 
and someone computers a little harder to
show<00:03:27.740> but<00:03:28.900> anyway<00:03:29.900> if<00:03:30.140> you're<00:03:30.320> doing<00:03:30.530> this

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
show but anyway if you're doing this

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.560 
show but anyway if you're doing this
manually<00:03:31.070> like<00:03:31.430> I<00:03:31.550> said<00:03:31.760> don't<00:03:31.910> cut<00:03:32.330> through

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
manually like I said don't cut through

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.050 
manually like I said don't cut through
this<00:03:32.750> edge<00:03:32.960> leave<00:03:33.500> that<00:03:33.530> alone<00:03:33.830> and<00:03:34.280> then

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
this edge leave that alone and then

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.750 
this edge leave that alone and then
after<00:03:35.750> you<00:03:35.900> do<00:03:36.110> that<00:03:36.250> what<00:03:37.250> you're<00:03:37.430> going<00:03:37.640> to

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
after you do that what you're going to

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.160 
after you do that what you're going to
do<00:03:37.850> is<00:03:38.920> connect<00:03:39.920> all<00:03:40.130> of<00:03:40.190> this<00:03:40.640> these<00:03:41.600> inside

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
do is connect all of this these inside

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.190 
do is connect all of this these inside
edges<00:03:43.120> until<00:03:44.120> it<00:03:44.270> makes<00:03:44.450> sort<00:03:44.690> of<00:03:44.750> like<00:03:44.840> a<00:03:44.870> V

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
edges until it makes sort of like a V

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:52.540 
edges until it makes sort of like a V
shape<00:03:45.550> okay<00:03:50.260> okay<00:03:51.260> so<00:03:51.470> this<00:03:51.890> is<00:03:52.070> what<00:03:52.250> it<00:03:52.370> looks

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
shape okay okay so this is what it looks

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.670 
shape okay okay so this is what it looks
like<00:03:52.700> after<00:03:52.910> I've<00:03:53.210> merged<00:03:54.110> that<00:03:54.500> edge

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
like after I've merged that edge

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.400 
like after I've merged that edge
together<00:03:55.450> you<00:03:56.450> can<00:03:56.570> still<00:03:56.810> see<00:03:56.990> all<00:03:57.110> my<00:03:57.260> little

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
together you can still see all my little

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:06.160 
together you can still see all my little
pieces<00:03:57.680> in<00:03:57.980> there<00:03:58.100> that's<00:03:58.340> okay<00:04:04.030> okay<00:04:05.030> so<00:04:05.170> this

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
pieces in there that's okay okay so this

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.670 
pieces in there that's okay okay so this
is<00:04:06.440> basically<00:04:06.620> it<00:04:07.400> for<00:04:07.790> the<00:04:07.910> sleeve<00:04:08.260> and<00:04:09.260> since

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
is basically it for the sleeve and since

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.250 
is basically it for the sleeve and since
this<00:04:09.800> is<00:04:09.860> knit<00:04:10.280> remember<00:04:10.880> i<00:04:11.180> usually<00:04:11.870> don't

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
this is knit remember i usually don't

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.770 
this is knit remember i usually don't
add<00:04:12.590> extra<00:04:13.490> seam<00:04:13.760> allowances<00:04:14.300> to<00:04:14.360> my<00:04:14.630> net

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
add extra seam allowances to my net

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.479 
add extra seam allowances to my net
pattern<00:04:15.140> because<00:04:15.320> i<00:04:15.380> just<00:04:15.410> served<00:04:15.860> search<00:04:16.310> it

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
pattern because i just served search it

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.780 
pattern because i just served search it
off<00:04:16.610> anyway<00:04:17.200> and<00:04:18.200> it's<00:04:18.440> knit<00:04:18.770> so<00:04:19.100> the<00:04:19.549> fit

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
off anyway and it's knit so the fit

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.970 
off anyway and it's knit so the fit
isn't<00:04:20.060> all<00:04:20.420> that<00:04:20.480> particular<00:04:21.350> as<00:04:21.590> it<00:04:21.770> would<00:04:21.950> be

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
isn't all that particular as it would be

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.660 
isn't all that particular as it would be
in<00:04:22.220> woven<00:04:22.460> so<00:04:22.910> you<00:04:22.970> don't<00:04:23.270> have<00:04:23.480> to<00:04:23.690> you<00:04:24.380> know

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
in woven so you don't have to you know

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.180 
in woven so you don't have to you know
keep<00:04:25.670> or<00:04:25.910> keep<00:04:26.780> track<00:04:27.050> of<00:04:27.080> every<00:04:27.620> little<00:04:28.040> piece

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
keep or keep track of every little piece

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.420 
keep or keep track of every little piece
of<00:04:28.400> fabric<00:04:28.580> that<00:04:28.880> you<00:04:28.940> use<00:04:29.210> it<00:04:29.450> so<00:04:30.280> anyway<00:04:31.280> this

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
of fabric that you use it so anyway this

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.130 
of fabric that you use it so anyway this
is<00:04:31.610> about<00:04:31.820> it<00:04:32.030> it<00:04:32.180> looks<00:04:32.360> kind<00:04:32.660> of<00:04:32.690> like<00:04:32.750> ram's

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
is about it it looks kind of like ram's

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.300 
is about it it looks kind of like ram's
horns<00:04:33.860> um<00:04:34.300> and<00:04:35.300> what<00:04:35.990> this<00:04:36.260> is<00:04:36.560> in<00:04:36.860> the<00:04:36.980> center

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
horns um and what this is in the center

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.120 
horns um and what this is in the center
part<00:04:37.490> this<00:04:37.700> is<00:04:37.760> going<00:04:38.090> to<00:04:38.180> gather<00:04:38.390> and<00:04:38.830> be<00:04:39.830> sewn

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
part this is going to gather and be sewn

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.850 
part this is going to gather and be sewn
together<00:04:40.460> almost<00:04:41.000> like<00:04:41.510> a<00:04:41.750> dart<00:04:42.140> that's<00:04:42.650> been

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
together almost like a dart that's been

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.280 
together almost like a dart that's been
spread<00:04:43.190> open<00:04:43.370> and<00:04:43.730> then<00:04:44.360> this<00:04:44.570> age<00:04:44.840> is<00:04:45.230> going
