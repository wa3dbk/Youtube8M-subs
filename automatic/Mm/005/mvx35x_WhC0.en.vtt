be kind of challenging to work the
wicked<00:00:45.690> edge<00:00:45.780> it's<00:00:45.989> actually<00:00:46.260> pretty<00:00:46.440> easy

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
wicked edge it's actually pretty easy

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.319 
wicked edge it's actually pretty easy
this<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.340> first<00:00:47.579> one<00:00:47.730> I've<00:00:47.879> had<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.030> chance

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
this is the first one I've had a chance

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.170 
this is the first one I've had a chance
to<00:00:48.539> mess<00:00:49.200> around<00:00:49.350> with<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.160> was<00:00:50.340> just<00:00:51.030> very

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
to mess around with and I was just very

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.850 
to mess around with and I was just very
very<00:00:51.750> pleased<00:00:51.960> at<00:00:52.110> how<00:00:52.199> well<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.500> turned<00:00:52.530> out

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
very pleased at how well it turned out

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.720 
very pleased at how well it turned out
so<00:00:53.550> basically<00:00:53.969> what<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.390> do<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.989> set<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.100> here

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
so basically what I do I set it here

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.930 
so basically what I do I set it here
with<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:58.379> pommel<00:00:58.859> resting<00:00:59.579> right<00:00:59.699> on<00:00:59.760> the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
with the pommel resting right on the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.229 
with the pommel resting right on the
base<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.329> sharpener<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.260> then<00:01:02.100> just<00:01:02.460> push

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
base of the sharpener and then just push

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.830 
base of the sharpener and then just push
it<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.510> here<00:01:03.660> as<00:01:03.750> far<00:01:03.930> as<00:01:03.989> it'll<00:01:04.229> go<00:01:05.420> and<00:01:06.420> clamp

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
it in here as far as it'll go and clamp

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.350 
it in here as far as it'll go and clamp
it<00:01:07.110> just<00:01:07.950> snagging<00:01:08.369> up<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.580> top<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:09.150> and

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
it just snagging up the top of it and

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.380 
it just snagging up the top of it and
then<00:01:10.320> go<00:01:11.130> ahead<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.490> find<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.790> remaining

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
then go ahead and find the remaining

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.160 
then go ahead and find the remaining
pressure<00:01:12.689> with<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.020> bottom<00:01:14.810> so<00:01:15.810> now<00:01:15.990> it's

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
pressure with the bottom so now it's

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.020 
pressure with the bottom so now it's
it's<00:01:16.680> clamped<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.070> there<00:01:17.220> really<00:01:17.430> firmly<00:01:17.759> and

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
it's clamped in there really firmly and

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.660 
it's clamped in there really firmly and
you<00:01:18.119> can<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.930> can<00:01:19.080> see<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.409> from<00:01:19.670> my

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
you can you can see it from my

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.359 
you can you can see it from my
perspective<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:21.560> just<00:01:22.560> sits<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:22.860> there<00:01:23.009> nicely

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
perspective to just sits in there nicely

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.700 
perspective to just sits in there nicely
like<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.689> this<00:01:24.689> particular<00:01:24.990> knife<00:01:25.500> was<00:01:25.680> a

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
like that this particular knife was a

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.850 
like that this particular knife was a
challenge<00:01:26.220> for<00:01:26.310> me<00:01:26.490> because<00:01:27.770> you<00:01:28.770> know

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
challenge for me because you know

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.679 
challenge for me because you know
everything<00:01:29.310> was<00:01:29.520> hand<00:01:29.729> done<00:01:29.909> including<00:01:30.479> the

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
everything was hand done including the

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.080 
everything was hand done including the
forming<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.560> actual<00:01:31.920> edge<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:33.000> it

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
forming of the actual edge and so it

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.030 
forming of the actual edge and so it
just<00:01:33.119> slopes<00:01:33.630> all<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.259> way<00:01:34.409> down<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.710> flat<00:01:34.920> of

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
just slopes all the way down the flat of

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.249 
just slopes all the way down the flat of
the<00:01:35.070> blade<00:01:35.130> out<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.060> edge<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.570> along

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
the blade out to the edge and along

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.289 
the blade out to the edge and along
curvature<00:01:37.740> kind<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.159> kind<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.610> convex<00:01:39.060> but

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
curvature kind of a kind of a convex but

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.719 
curvature kind of a kind of a convex but
just<00:01:39.509> sort<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.979> really<00:01:40.979> its<00:01:41.100> own<00:01:41.189> thing<00:01:41.460> based

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
just sort of really its own thing based

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:42.800 
just sort of really its own thing based
on<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.090> way<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
on the way that the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.460 
on the way that the
the<00:01:43.080> knife<00:01:44.000> so<00:01:45.110> replicating<00:01:46.110> us<00:01:46.229> basically

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
the knife so replicating us basically

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.580 
the knife so replicating us basically
impossible<00:01:47.479> even<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.780> know<00:01:48.869> even<00:01:49.049> on<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.380> flat

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
impossible even you know even on a flat

impossible even you know even on a flat
stone<00:01:49.860> or<00:01:50.159> with<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.310> straw<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:51.210> know<00:01:51.330> whoever

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
is going to be applying the technique

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.910 
is going to be applying the technique
are<00:01:54.540> going<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.840> be<00:01:54.930> creating<00:01:55.380> or<00:01:55.530> recreating

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
are going to be creating or recreating

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.160 
are going to be creating or recreating
their<00:01:56.190> own<00:01:56.340> edge<00:01:56.610> on<00:01:56.790> him<00:01:56.970> so<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.900> wicked

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
their own edge on him so in the wicked

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.910 
their own edge on him so in the wicked
edge<00:01:58.350> what<00:01:59.190> I<00:01:59.220> did<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.940> I<00:02:00.240> used<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.899> marker<00:02:01.320> to

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
edge what I did is I used a marker to

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.580 
edge what I did is I used a marker to
just<00:02:02.130> color<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:03.180> actual<00:02:03.570> edge<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.320> try

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
just color in the actual edge and try

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.260 
just color in the actual edge and try
and<00:02:04.680> find<00:02:04.830> out<00:02:04.950> what<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.220> angle<00:02:05.580> was<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.149> it

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
and find out what that angle was and it

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.540 
and find out what that angle was and it
turned<00:02:06.509> out<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.869> on<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.170> knife<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.560> was<00:02:07.680> it

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
turned out that on this knife it was it

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.070 
turned out that on this knife it was it
was<00:02:08.670> wildly<00:02:09.060> off<00:02:09.239> one<00:02:09.509> side<00:02:09.720> was<00:02:09.929> very

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
was wildly off one side was very

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.160 
was wildly off one side was very
different<00:02:10.500> from<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.739> other<00:02:11.000> so<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.510> said<00:02:12.870> okay

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
different from the other so I said okay

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.380 
different from the other so I said okay
I'm<00:02:13.290> going<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.500> just<00:02:13.800> take<00:02:14.730> an<00:02:14.850> average<00:02:15.000> and

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
I'm going to just take an average and

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.259 
I'm going to just take an average and
set<00:02:15.630> it<00:02:15.780> at<00:02:15.989> 17<00:02:16.709> degrees<00:02:16.830> per<00:02:17.220> side<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.790> do<00:02:18.239> a

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
set it at 17 degrees per side and do a

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.000 
set it at 17 degrees per side and do a
little<00:02:18.480> bit<00:02:18.630> of<00:02:18.690> work<00:02:18.900> of<00:02:19.140> cutting<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.590> bevel<00:02:19.890> in

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
little bit of work of cutting a bevel in

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.210 
little bit of work of cutting a bevel in
and<00:02:20.310> for<00:02:21.090> that<00:02:21.209> I<00:02:21.269> used<00:02:21.690> I<00:02:22.080> started<00:02:23.010> with<00:02:23.130> the

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
and for that I used I started with the

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.180 
and for that I used I started with the
100<00:02:23.670> grit<00:02:23.820> stones<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.630> cycled<00:02:25.380> through<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.620> 200

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
100 grit stones I cycled through the 200

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.330 
100 grit stones I cycled through the 200
on<00:02:26.730> through<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:29.720> 400<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:30.870> 600<00:02:31.170> grit<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.800> then

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
on through the 400 and 600 grit and then

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.979 
on through the 400 and 600 grit and then
from<00:02:32.489> there<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:32.819> with<00:02:32.910> our<00:02:33.120> ceramic<00:02:33.630> stones

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
from there and with our ceramic stones

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.490 
from there and with our ceramic stones
and<00:02:35.510> so<00:02:36.510> basically<00:02:36.930> what<00:02:37.080> I<00:02:37.170> did<00:02:37.230> is<00:02:37.350> I<00:02:37.470> just

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
and so basically what I did is I just

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.860 
and so basically what I did is I just
cut<00:02:37.769> in<00:02:37.920> two<00:02:38.190> brand-new<00:02:38.970> bevels<00:02:39.360> at<00:02:39.450> 17

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
cut in two brand-new bevels at 17

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.800 
cut in two brand-new bevels at 17
degrees<00:02:40.160> got<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.610> sharpening<00:02:42.390> all<00:02:42.569> the<00:02:42.690> way

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
degrees got the sharpening all the way

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.740 
degrees got the sharpening all the way
out<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:43.110> edge<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:44.300> so<00:02:45.300> that<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.480> could<00:02:45.630> can

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
out to the edge and so that I could can

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.479 
out to the edge and so that I could can
detect<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.140> burr<00:02:46.260> first<00:02:46.590> on<00:02:46.769> one<00:02:46.950> side<00:02:46.980> and

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
detect the burr first on one side and

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.490 
detect the burr first on one side and
then<00:02:47.610> on<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.820> other<00:02:47.989> and<00:02:48.989> then<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:49.200> knew<00:02:49.320> that

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
then on the other and then I knew that

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.890 
then on the other and then I knew that
my<00:02:49.620> bevel<00:02:49.950> was<00:02:50.070> set<00:02:50.310> go<00:02:51.299> ahead<00:02:51.420> and<00:02:51.630> I<00:02:51.690> polished

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
my bevel was set go ahead and I polished

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.960 
my bevel was set go ahead and I polished
it<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.380> then<00:02:52.799> I<00:02:52.860> went<00:02:52.980> back<00:02:53.100> in<00:02:53.430> stages<00:02:53.850> from

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
it and then I went back in stages from

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.710 
it and then I went back in stages from
17<00:02:54.480> degrees<00:02:54.810> on<00:02:55.140> down<00:02:55.769> through<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.340> various

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
17 degrees on down through the various

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.470 
17 degrees on down through the various
degrees<00:02:57.720> back<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.860> about<00:02:59.040> 11<00:02:59.459> degrees<00:02:59.760> so<00:03:00.420> I

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
degrees back to about 11 degrees so I

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.170 
degrees back to about 11 degrees so I
could<00:03:00.660> just<00:03:00.840> blend<00:03:01.350> that<00:03:01.620> flat<00:03:01.890> surface<00:03:02.180> into

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
could just blend that flat surface into

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.080 
could just blend that flat surface into
my<00:03:03.840> bevel<00:03:04.110> creating<00:03:05.070> basically<00:03:05.610> a<00:03:05.640> convex

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
my bevel creating basically a convex

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.710 
my bevel creating basically a convex
edge<00:03:06.329> and<00:03:06.690> not<00:03:07.290> quite<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:07.709> fully<00:03:08.720> Scandinavian

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
edge and not quite a fully Scandinavian

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.780 
edge and not quite a fully Scandinavian
grind<00:03:09.959> but<00:03:10.140> something<00:03:10.680> close<00:03:10.890> to<00:03:10.920> it<00:03:11.160> you<00:03:11.609> can

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
grind but something close to it you can

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.080 
grind but something close to it you can
still<00:03:12.030> see<00:03:12.239> a<00:03:12.269> slight<00:03:13.400> transition<00:03:14.400> zone<00:03:14.790> here

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
still see a slight transition zone here

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.690 
still see a slight transition zone here
when<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:15.359> bevel<00:03:15.630> starts<00:03:16.049> but<00:03:16.500> I've<00:03:16.680> sort<00:03:17.579> of

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
when the bevel starts but I've sort of

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.560 
when the bevel starts but I've sort of
scaled<00:03:18.000> that<00:03:18.090> way<00:03:18.329> back<00:03:18.570> in<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.840> shoulders<00:03:19.260> so

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
scaled that way back in the shoulders so

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.000 
scaled that way back in the shoulders so
what<00:03:21.570> it<00:03:21.660> looks<00:03:21.690> like<00:03:21.930> in<00:03:22.109> practice<00:03:22.260> now<00:03:22.709> is

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
what it looks like in practice now is

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.810 
what it looks like in practice now is
that<00:03:23.310> I<00:03:23.579> slide<00:03:24.090> my<00:03:24.120> straps<00:03:25.100> onto<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.340> rods

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
that I slide my straps onto the rods

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.050 
that I slide my straps onto the rods
here<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.390> I<00:03:27.690> can

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
here and I can

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.730 
here and I can
do<00:03:28.690> a<00:03:28.720> nice<00:03:30.540> upward<00:03:31.540> in<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:31.959> way<00:03:32.110> motion<00:03:32.590> like

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
do a nice upward in the way motion like

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.770 
do a nice upward in the way motion like
this<00:03:32.950> as<00:03:33.280> I<00:03:33.660> sharpen<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:34.750> knife<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:37.120> you<00:03:37.150> can

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
this as I sharpen the knife and you can

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.540 
this as I sharpen the knife and you can
see<00:03:37.959> I'm<00:03:38.050> just<00:03:38.080> just<00:03:38.740> past<00:03:38.950> the<00:03:39.100> center<00:03:39.370> line

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
see I'm just just past the center line

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.320 
see I'm just just past the center line
here<00:03:39.819> and<00:03:40.060> coming<00:03:40.870> back<00:03:41.020> towards<00:03:41.440> myself<00:03:41.890> I

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
here and coming back towards myself I

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.300 
here and coming back towards myself I
can<00:03:43.330> work<00:03:43.420> all<00:03:43.600> the<00:03:43.750> way<00:03:43.810> down<00:03:44.020> to<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.380> very

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
can work all the way down to the very

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.580 
can work all the way down to the very
edge<00:03:45.520> here<00:03:47.069> and<00:03:48.420> then<00:03:49.420> what<00:03:50.080> I<00:03:50.110> want<00:03:50.319> to<00:03:50.380> do<00:03:50.440> the

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
edge here and then what I want to do the

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.260
