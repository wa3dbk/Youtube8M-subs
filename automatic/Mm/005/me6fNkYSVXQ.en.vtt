is actually pretty nice when you look at
a<00:00:56.430> computer<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.879> regular<00:00:57.239> relay<00:00:57.540> you'd<00:00:57.989> have

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
a computer in regular relay you'd have

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.479 
a computer in regular relay you'd have
to<00:00:58.199> seal<00:00:58.470> this<00:00:58.650> so<00:00:58.830> this<00:00:58.980> looks<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.250> lot<00:00:59.340> nicer

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
to seal this so this looks a lot nicer

easy so I'm going to step by step on how
to<00:01:17.070> do<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.729> first<00:01:17.910> step<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.180> want<00:01:18.330> to

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
to do it so the first step you want to

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.460 
to do it so the first step you want to
do<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.509> remove<00:01:18.690> the<00:01:18.840> headlight<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.229> these

post right here and mount the fuse but
they<00:01:43.200> also<00:01:43.320> want<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.740> ground<00:01:44.010> it<00:01:44.130> here<00:01:44.369> now

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
they also want you to ground it here now

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.859 
they also want you to ground it here now
I'm<00:01:44.700> not<00:01:44.909> going<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.090> do<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.330> because<00:01:45.479> I'm<00:01:45.689> so

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
I'm not going to do that because I'm so

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.450 
I'm not going to do that because I'm so
close<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.260> battery<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.770> want<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.159> go<00:01:47.220> ahead

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
close to the battery I want to go ahead

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.090 
close to the battery I want to go ahead
and<00:01:47.670> ground<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.810> relay<00:01:49.500> directly<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.010> the

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
and ground the relay directly to the

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.550 
and ground the relay directly to the
battery<00:01:50.369> on<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.610> application<00:01:51.170> so<00:01:52.170> right<00:01:52.409> now

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
battery on this application so right now

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.330 
battery on this application so right now
doing<00:01:52.830> mock<00:01:53.100> up<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:54.350> we<00:01:55.350> have<00:01:55.500> our<00:01:55.770> trigger

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
doing mock up so we have our trigger

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.580 
doing mock up so we have our trigger
wire<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.790> sending<00:01:57.060> wire<00:01:57.210> over<00:01:57.450> here<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:58.320> what

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
wire and sending wire over here so what

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.990 
wire and sending wire over here so what
I'm<00:01:58.710> going<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.860> do<00:01:58.950> on<00:01:59.070> this<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.400> I'm<00:01:59.820> going<00:01:59.939> to

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
I'm going to do on this is I'm going to

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.880 
I'm going to do on this is I'm going to
run<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.210> down<00:02:00.240> from<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.780> battery<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.770> will

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
run it down from the battery this will

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.200 
run it down from the battery this will
all<00:02:01.950> get<00:02:02.070> loom<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.520> reason<00:02:02.729> running<00:02:02.909> here<00:02:03.119> is

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
all get loom the reason running here is

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.340 
all get loom the reason running here is
because<00:02:03.299> my<00:02:03.390> loom<00:02:03.659> will<00:02:03.810> fit<00:02:03.990> here<00:02:04.229> it's

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
because my loom will fit here it's

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.740 
because my loom will fit here it's
pretty<00:02:04.500> tight<00:02:04.830> and<00:02:05.100> then<00:02:06.090> if<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.299> look<00:02:06.450> over

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
pretty tight and then if you look over

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.880 
pretty tight and then if you look over
here<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:07.320> can<00:02:07.979> run<00:02:08.220> through<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:09.000> rad<00:02:09.209> support

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
here I can run through the rad support

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.130 
here I can run through the rad support
I'll<00:02:10.890> have<00:02:11.040> to<00:02:11.190> extend<00:02:11.430> these<00:02:11.640> but<00:02:12.030> then<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.450> can

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
I'll have to extend these but then I can

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.729 
I'll have to extend these but then I can
go<00:02:13.260> from<00:02:13.590> yellow<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.549> the<00:02:14.640> low<00:02:14.760> beam<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:16.170> green

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
go from yellow to the low beam to green

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.940 
go from yellow to the low beam to green
and<00:02:16.860> white<00:02:17.010> on<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.220> high<00:02:17.400> beam<00:02:17.610> now<00:02:18.860> for<00:02:19.860> the

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
and white on the high beam now for the

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.800 
and white on the high beam now for the
power<00:02:20.160> wire<00:02:20.400> this<00:02:20.940> is<00:02:21.090> actually<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.480> good

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
power wire this is actually a good

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.220 
power wire this is actually a good
length<00:02:22.079> so<00:02:22.560> I<00:02:22.860> got<00:02:23.790> this<00:02:23.940> line<00:02:24.360> over<00:02:24.600> here<00:02:24.630> you

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
length so I got this line over here you

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.420 
length so I got this line over here you
won't<00:02:25.320> have<00:02:25.500> this<00:02:25.650> at<00:02:25.799> your<00:02:25.829> trucks<00:02:26.100> could<00:02:26.250> put

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
won't have this at your trucks could put

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.120 
won't have this at your trucks could put
completely<00:02:27.030> stock<00:02:27.269> I<00:02:27.450> added<00:02:27.750> this<00:02:27.900> but<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.470> can

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
completely stock I added this but I can

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.620 
completely stock I added this but I can
secure<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:29.760> onto<00:02:29.850> here<00:02:30.000> when<00:02:30.150> it's<00:02:30.269> looms<00:02:30.420> can

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
secure it onto here when it's looms can

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.610 
secure it onto here when it's looms can
look<00:02:30.720> all<00:02:30.840> nice<00:02:31.019> such<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.590> proper<00:02:31.890> length

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
look all nice such the proper length

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.720 
look all nice such the proper length
and<00:02:32.709> I'm<00:02:33.099> going<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.280> go<00:02:33.370> straight<00:02:33.610> on<00:02:33.670> the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
and I'm going to go straight on the

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:34.949 
and I'm going to go straight on the
battery<00:02:34.030> now<00:02:34.120> what<00:02:34.300> they<00:02:34.390> want<00:02:34.569> you<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.750> do<00:02:34.840> is

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
battery now what they want you to do is

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.089 
battery now what they want you to do is
they<00:02:35.050> want<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.379> open<00:02:35.530> this<00:02:35.800> up<00:02:36.069> and<00:02:36.400> here

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
they want you to open this up and here

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.150 
they want you to open this up and here
and<00:02:39.510> secure<00:02:40.510> it<00:02:40.660> on<00:02:40.840> to<00:02:41.230> that<00:02:41.349> nut<00:02:41.560> that's<00:02:41.800> cool

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
and secure it on to that nut that's cool

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.040 
and secure it on to that nut that's cool
you<00:02:42.370> can<00:02:42.489> do<00:02:42.670> that<00:02:42.849> but<00:02:43.120> this<00:02:43.209> is<00:02:43.390> actually<00:02:43.780> a

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
you can do that but this is actually a

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.160 
you can do that but this is actually a
shorter<00:02:44.620> distance<00:02:44.769> you're<00:02:45.700> not<00:02:45.989> going<00:02:46.989> to<00:02:47.080> go

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
shorter distance you're not going to go

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.630 
shorter distance you're not going to go
over<00:02:47.349> here<00:02:47.530> where<00:02:47.709> the<00:02:47.830> motors<00:02:48.129> vibrating<00:02:48.580> a

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
over here where the motors vibrating a

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.430 
over here where the motors vibrating a
lot<00:02:48.819> and<00:02:49.060> you're<00:02:49.420> staying<00:02:49.660> away<00:02:49.780> from<00:02:49.840> more

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
lot and you're staying away from more

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.589 
lot and you're staying away from more
heat<00:02:50.680> sources<00:02:51.040> so<00:02:51.370> this<00:02:51.610> to<00:02:52.000> me<00:02:52.180> makes<00:02:52.420> more

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
heat sources so this to me makes more

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.210 
heat sources so this to me makes more
sense<00:02:52.989> and<00:02:53.230> because<00:02:53.890> I<00:02:53.950> have<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.069> ultimate

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
sense and because I have the ultimate

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.890 
sense and because I have the ultimate
yellow<00:02:54.519> top<00:02:54.730> I<00:02:54.849> got<00:02:54.970> these<00:02:55.060> top<00:02:55.299> post<00:02:55.569> so<00:02:55.690> I<00:02:55.750> can

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
yellow top I got these top post so I can

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.270 
yellow top I got these top post so I can
do<00:02:56.110> this<00:02:56.319> nicely<00:02:56.830> and<00:02:56.950> cleanly

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
do this nicely and cleanly

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.539 
do this nicely and cleanly
as<00:02:58.060> for<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.450> ground<00:02:58.750> wire<00:02:59.049> like<00:02:59.950> they<00:03:00.280> said

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
as for the ground wire like they said

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.190 
as for the ground wire like they said
before<00:03:00.970> they<00:03:01.330> want<00:03:01.510> you<00:03:01.599> to<00:03:01.690> go<00:03:01.780> right<00:03:01.959> here

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
before they want you to go right here

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.229 
before they want you to go right here
the<00:03:02.950> battery<00:03:03.340> so<00:03:03.519> close<00:03:03.760> I'm<00:03:03.970> just<00:03:04.120> gonna

the battery so close I'm just gonna

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:05.789 
the battery so close I'm just gonna
extend<00:03:04.450> this<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:04.870> hit<00:03:05.019> this<00:03:05.170> ground<00:03:05.440> post<00:03:05.650> on

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
extend this and hit this ground post on

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.020 
extend this and hit this ground post on
the<00:03:05.860> battery<00:03:06.130> right<00:03:06.250> over<00:03:06.430> here<00:03:08.549> so<00:03:09.549> right<00:03:09.910> now

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
the battery right over here so right now

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.339 
the battery right over here so right now
we're<00:03:10.209> hooking<00:03:10.450> up<00:03:10.540> our<00:03:10.690> trigger<00:03:10.989> and<00:03:11.260> our

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
we're hooking up our trigger and our

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:12.600 
we're hooking up our trigger and our
sending<00:03:11.709> wires<00:03:11.860> now<00:03:12.099> the<00:03:12.160> nice<00:03:12.370> thing<00:03:12.579> about

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
sending wires now the nice thing about

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.030 
sending wires now the nice thing about
the<00:03:12.819> kit<00:03:13.060> from<00:03:13.180> LMC<00:03:13.720> is<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:14.650> wires<00:03:14.860> are

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
the kit from LMC is the wires are

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.550 
the kit from LMC is the wires are
color-coded<00:03:15.640> so<00:03:16.120> you<00:03:16.780> have<00:03:16.900> your<00:03:17.049> yellow<00:03:17.290> and

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
color-coded so you have your yellow and

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.990 
color-coded so you have your yellow and
your<00:03:17.799> green<00:03:17.980> and<00:03:18.099> white<00:03:18.220> now<00:03:18.459> if<00:03:18.730> you're

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
your green and white now if you're

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.430 
your green and white now if you're
wondering<00:03:19.299> why<00:03:19.390> I<00:03:19.420> have<00:03:19.510> two<00:03:19.690> mains<00:03:19.989> here<00:03:20.260> is

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
wondering why I have two mains here is

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.259 
wondering why I have two mains here is
because<00:03:21.069> I<00:03:21.129> had<00:03:21.280> to<00:03:21.370> extend<00:03:21.730> it<00:03:21.879> and<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.120> wires

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
because I had to extend it and the wires

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:23.789 
because I had to extend it and the wires
I<00:03:22.420> have<00:03:22.569> right<00:03:22.720> now<00:03:22.750> are<00:03:22.870> a<00:03:22.959> little<00:03:23.049> bit<00:03:23.230> inside

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
I have right now are a little bit inside

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.140 
I have right now are a little bit inside
so<00:03:24.430> just<00:03:24.459> to<00:03:24.640> make<00:03:24.700> sure<00:03:24.760> I<00:03:24.879> have<00:03:25.000> enough

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
so just to make sure I have enough

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.729 
so just to make sure I have enough
capacity<00:03:25.269> for<00:03:25.780> amperage<00:03:26.110> I<00:03:26.230> just<00:03:26.440> doubled<00:03:26.680> up

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
capacity for amperage I just doubled up

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.440 
capacity for amperage I just doubled up
just<00:03:26.980> to<00:03:27.069> make<00:03:27.190> sure<00:03:27.340> once<00:03:27.849> I<00:03:27.970> limit<00:03:28.239> you<00:03:28.299> won't

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
just to make sure once I limit you won't

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.330 
just to make sure once I limit you won't
even<00:03:28.599> notice<00:03:28.750> so<00:03:29.110> right<00:03:29.799> now<00:03:29.920> we're<00:03:30.099> trying<00:03:30.190> to

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
even notice so right now we're trying to

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.780 
even notice so right now we're trying to
test<00:03:30.459> this<00:03:30.610> right<00:03:30.970> now<00:03:31.150> so<00:03:32.079> this<00:03:33.069> is<00:03:33.129> our<00:03:33.459> high

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
test this right now so this is our high

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.080 
test this right now so this is our high
beam<00:03:34.060> and<00:03:34.650> this<00:03:35.650> is<00:03:35.739> our<00:03:35.860> low<00:03:36.040> beam<00:03:36.280> so<00:03:37.000> I'm

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
beam and this is our low beam so I'm

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.920 
beam and this is our low beam so I'm
gonna<00:03:37.180> do<00:03:37.299> is<00:03:37.389> my<00:03:37.480> turn<00:03:37.660> on<00:03:37.690> my<00:03:37.840> headlights

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:49.370 

you<00:03:42.930> can<00:03:43.080> see<00:03:43.230> now<00:03:47.390> so<00:03:48.390> that's<00:03:48.720> low<00:03:48.990> beam<00:03:49.200> on

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
you can see now so that's low beam on

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.550 
you can see now so that's low beam on
and<00:03:50.300> we<00:03:51.300> can<00:03:51.420> just<00:03:51.540> test<00:03:51.780> our<00:03:52.050> high<00:03:52.260> beam<00:03:52.470> over

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
and we can just test our high beam over

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.170 
and we can just test our high beam over
here<00:03:52.830> when<00:03:53.100> it<00:03:53.280> gets<00:03:53.310> triggered<00:03:55.730> it<00:03:56.730> turns<00:03:57.000> on

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
here when it gets triggered it turns on

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:04.619 
here when it gets triggered it turns on
so<00:03:58.040> pot<00:03:59.040> went<00:03:59.280> on

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.539 

turn<00:04:05.629> off<00:04:05.750> recip<00:04:06.110> ground<00:04:06.349> so<00:04:07.129> I'm<00:04:07.310> going<00:04:07.430> to<00:04:07.459> go

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
turn off recip ground so I'm going to go

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:08.709 
turn off recip ground so I'm going to go
ahead<00:04:07.640> and<00:04:07.849> solder<00:04:07.969> these<00:04:08.180> now<00:04:08.329> now<00:04:08.540> in<00:04:08.629> the

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:08.719 
ahead and solder these now now in the

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:10.630 
ahead and solder these now now in the
kit<00:04:08.930> they<00:04:09.049> give<00:04:09.230> you<00:04:09.379> tea<00:04:09.560> taps<00:04:09.829> I'm<00:04:10.099> not<00:04:10.310> a<00:04:10.340> fan

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
kit they give you tea taps I'm not a fan

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.530 
kit they give you tea taps I'm not a fan
so<00:04:10.849> I'm<00:04:10.909> going<00:04:11.030> to<00:04:11.060> go<00:04:11.150> ahead<00:04:11.209> and<00:04:11.390> solder

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
so I'm going to go ahead and solder

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.300 
so I'm going to go ahead and solder
these<00:04:11.719> wires<00:04:11.930> on<00:04:12.200> that<00:04:12.950> way<00:04:13.040> I<00:04:13.069> know<00:04:13.189> it's

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
these wires on that way I know it's

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.709 
these wires on that way I know it's
going<00:04:13.400> to<00:04:13.459> be<00:04:13.609> good<00:04:13.819> for<00:04:14.000> life<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.329> vehicle

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
all right so prints just finished up

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.830 
all right so prints just finished up
mock<00:04:22.639> up<00:04:22.850> for<00:04:23.090> the<00:04:23.150> wiring<00:04:23.509> and<00:04:23.600> we're<00:04:23.690> great

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
mock up for the wiring and we're great

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.390 
mock up for the wiring and we're great
abundance<00:04:24.110> thing<00:04:24.410> I'll<00:04:24.560> show<00:04:24.889> you<00:04:24.949> I<00:04:25.009> got<00:04:25.039> so

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
abundance thing I'll show you I got so

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.249 
abundance thing I'll show you I got so
far<00:04:25.580> so<00:04:25.850> go<00:04:26.389> ahead<00:04:26.509> and<00:04:26.720> taped<00:04:26.960> everything

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:27.259 
far so go ahead and taped everything

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:29.409 
far so go ahead and taped everything
loom<00:04:27.919> to<00:04:28.070> everything<00:04:28.430> for<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:28.669> zap<00:04:28.850> strap<00:04:29.150> so

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
loom to everything for the zap strap so

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:31.480 
loom to everything for the zap strap so
because<00:04:29.750> this<00:04:29.900> tape<00:04:30.110> will<00:04:30.380> dry<00:04:30.770> up<00:04:30.919> over<00:04:31.190> time

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
because this tape will dry up over time

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.879 
because this tape will dry up over time
so<00:04:32.150> so<00:04:32.389> doesn't<00:04:32.600> unravel<00:04:32.720> just<00:04:33.259> put<00:04:33.410> a<00:04:33.440> strap

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
so so doesn't unravel just put a strap

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.700 
so so doesn't unravel just put a strap
on<00:04:34.009> there<00:04:34.600> so<00:04:35.600> we<00:04:35.960> got<00:04:36.080> the<00:04:36.169> wiring<00:04:36.470> in<00:04:36.560> from
