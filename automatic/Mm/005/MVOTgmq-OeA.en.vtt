and I know you were probably thinking
spot<00:00:50.809> was<00:00:50.960> probably<00:00:51.199> gonna<00:00:51.320> do<00:00:51.559> Spider<00:00:52.159> Girl

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
spot was probably gonna do Spider Girl

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.329

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:55.339 
next but you know what I thought Spider

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:56.859 
next but you know what I thought Spider
Girl<00:00:55.430> technically<00:00:56.030> comes<00:00:56.239> with<00:00:56.360> the<00:00:56.449> head<00:00:56.659> and

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:56.869

comes with the wings why don't we

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.270

actually put together Hobgoblin and then

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.160 
actually put together Hobgoblin and then
we'll<00:01:01.610> add<00:01:01.759> the<00:01:01.790> head<00:01:02.119> that<00:01:02.449> makes<00:01:02.659> sense<00:01:02.930> so

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
decision I think it works better than

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.020 
decision I think it works better than
giving<00:03:35.750> him<00:03:35.840> a<00:03:35.930> matte<00:03:36.230> black<00:03:36.709> that<00:03:37.519> I<00:03:37.549> think<00:03:37.880> it

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
giving him a matte black that I think it

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.309 
giving him a matte black that I think it
just<00:03:38.150> really<00:03:38.269> stands<00:03:38.840> it<00:03:39.049> a<00:03:39.079> lot<00:03:39.530> better<00:03:41.319> okay

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
another figure if you remember that I

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.640 
another figure if you remember that I
had<00:04:00.680> a<00:04:00.709> problem<00:04:01.040> with<00:04:01.810> Sabretooth<00:04:02.810> everybody

had a problem with Sabretooth everybody

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:04.990 
had a problem with Sabretooth everybody
remembers<00:04:04.010> Sabretooth<00:04:04.459> that<00:04:04.580> I<00:04:04.610> had<00:04:04.790> a<00:04:04.819> look

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
remembers Sabretooth that I had a look

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.260 
remembers Sabretooth that I had a look
at

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
at

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.970 
at
was<00:04:05.360> like<00:04:05.540> a<00:04:05.570> Wolverine<00:04:05.840> series<00:04:06.560> of<00:04:06.680> Marvel

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
was like a Wolverine series of Marvel

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.500 
was like a Wolverine series of Marvel
Legends<00:04:08.260> Sabretooth<00:04:09.260> I<00:04:09.650> think<00:04:10.460> it<00:04:10.550> was<00:04:11.090> it<00:04:11.210> was

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
Legends Sabretooth I think it was it was

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.700 
Legends Sabretooth I think it was it was
I<00:04:11.540> think<00:04:11.780> that<00:04:11.960> might've<00:04:12.200> been<00:04:12.260> the<00:04:12.410> way<00:04:12.500> that

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
I think that might've been the way that

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.460 
I think that might've been the way that
he<00:04:12.800> built<00:04:13.040> puck<00:04:13.430> I<00:04:13.730> can't<00:04:14.210> remember<00:04:14.390> but<00:04:15.320> the

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
he built puck I can't remember but the

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.080 
he built puck I can't remember but the
problem<00:04:15.890> with<00:04:16.040> Sabretooth<00:04:16.670> is<00:04:16.850> the<00:04:16.910> same

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
problem with Sabretooth is the same

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.070 
problem with Sabretooth is the same
problem<00:04:17.360> I<00:04:17.390> have<00:04:17.510> with<00:04:17.600> this<00:04:17.720> figure<00:04:17.930> because

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
problem I have with this figure because

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.470 
problem I have with this figure because
they're<00:04:18.320> using<00:04:18.560> the<00:04:18.800> same<00:04:18.980> mold<00:04:19.340> he's<00:04:20.239> too

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
they're using the same mold he's too

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.800 
they're using the same mold he's too
short<00:04:21.760> proportionately<00:04:22.760> he<00:04:23.210> is<00:04:23.420> way<00:04:23.750> too

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
short proportionately he is way too

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.090 
short proportionately he is way too
short<00:04:26.050> maybe<00:04:27.050> what<00:04:27.380> they<00:04:27.530> could<00:04:27.800> have<00:04:27.830> done

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
short maybe what they could have done

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.130 
short maybe what they could have done
and<00:04:28.400> I<00:04:28.490> don't<00:04:28.670> know<00:04:28.730> if<00:04:28.850> maybe<00:04:29.140> anti-venom

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
and I don't know if maybe anti-venom

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.210 
and I don't know if maybe anti-venom
just<00:04:30.530> isn't<00:04:32.260> interesting<00:04:33.260> enough<00:04:33.320> character

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
just isn't interesting enough character

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.740 
just isn't interesting enough character
he<00:04:34.370> gets<00:04:34.520> to<00:04:34.640> call<00:04:34.820> him<00:04:34.910> anti-venom<00:04:35.390> too<00:04:35.660> if

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
he gets to call him anti-venom too if

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.200 
he gets to call him anti-venom too if
you<00:04:35.840> want<00:04:36.100> maybe<00:04:37.100> he's<00:04:37.280> not<00:04:37.490> as<00:04:37.670> interesting

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
you want maybe he's not as interesting

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.430 
you want maybe he's not as interesting
of<00:04:38.300> a<00:04:38.360> character<00:04:38.780> that<00:04:38.810> he<00:04:39.230> would<00:04:39.350> have

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
of a character that he would have

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.260 
of a character that he would have
warranted<00:04:39.710> the<00:04:40.040> build<00:04:40.280> of<00:04:40.460> figure<00:04:40.760> but<00:04:41.240> I

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
warranted the build of figure but I

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.780 
warranted the build of figure but I
almost<00:04:41.480> would<00:04:41.780> have<00:04:41.900> released<00:04:42.580> Hobgoblin<00:04:43.580> as

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
almost would have released Hobgoblin as

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.490 
almost would have released Hobgoblin as
the<00:04:44.330> regular<00:04:45.110> figure<00:04:45.500> and<00:04:45.680> I<00:04:46.190> would<00:04:46.400> have<00:04:46.520> made

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
the regular figure and I would have made

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.320 
the regular figure and I would have made
anti-venom<00:04:48.500> or<00:04:48.770> anti-venom<00:04:49.190> here<00:04:49.670> they<00:04:49.940> build

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
anti-venom or anti-venom here they build

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.840 
anti-venom or anti-venom here they build
the<00:04:50.540> figure<00:04:50.960> peace<00:04:51.290> reason<00:04:52.250> why<00:04:52.340> I<00:04:52.370> say<00:04:52.640> that

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
the figure peace reason why I say that

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.790 
the figure peace reason why I say that
is<00:04:53.000> because<00:04:53.120> his<00:04:53.360> legs<00:04:53.660> needed<00:04:54.200> to<00:04:54.290> be<00:04:54.440> longer

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
is because his legs needed to be longer

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.030 
is because his legs needed to be longer
they<00:04:55.160> need<00:04:55.310> to<00:04:55.430> be<00:04:55.550> at<00:04:55.640> least<00:04:55.700> like<00:04:56.270> this<00:04:56.570> long

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
they need to be at least like this long

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.190 
they need to be at least like this long
to<00:04:58.040> justify<00:04:58.910> everything<00:04:59.600> else<00:04:59.810> that's<00:05:00.080> going

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
to justify everything else that's going

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.620 
to justify everything else that's going
on<00:05:00.590> the<00:05:00.860> torso<00:05:01.280> is<00:05:01.340> fine<00:05:01.580> and<00:05:01.850> really<00:05:02.450> to<00:05:02.600> a

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
on the torso is fine and really to a

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.510 
on the torso is fine and really to a
boat<00:05:02.870> there<00:05:03.320> it<00:05:03.710> works

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
boat there it works

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.180 
boat there it works
the<00:05:05.090> problem<00:05:05.540> is<00:05:05.660> he's<00:05:05.840> got<00:05:05.960> such<00:05:06.350> short<00:05:06.740> legs

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
the problem is he's got such short legs

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.130 
the problem is he's got such short legs
that<00:05:07.580> the<00:05:07.730> rest<00:05:07.970> of<00:05:08.120> his<00:05:08.210> body<00:05:08.360> looks<00:05:08.720> short

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
that the rest of his body looks short

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.340 
that the rest of his body looks short
and<00:05:09.380> stumpy<00:05:10.210> by<00:05:11.210> the<00:05:11.270> comparison<00:05:12.050> to<00:05:12.140> the<00:05:12.230> only

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
and stumpy by the comparison to the only

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.570 
and stumpy by the comparison to the only
figure<00:05:12.530> that<00:05:12.710> we<00:05:12.800> have<00:05:12.950> right<00:05:13.130> now<00:05:13.280> if<00:05:13.460> you

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
figure that we have right now if you

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.430 
figure that we have right now if you
compare<00:05:13.760> him<00:05:14.000> next<00:05:14.210> to<00:05:14.480> let's<00:05:14.990> say<00:05:15.170> Spider

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
compare him next to let's say Spider

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.130 
compare him next to let's say Spider
Woman<00:05:15.670> sure<00:05:16.670> he<00:05:17.000> is<00:05:17.180> bigger<00:05:17.480> I'll<00:05:17.750> give<00:05:17.990> him

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.140 
Woman sure he is bigger I'll give him

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.610 
Woman sure he is bigger I'll give him
that

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
that

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.060 
that
but<00:05:19.070> I<00:05:19.100> feel<00:05:19.370> like<00:05:19.400> his<00:05:19.640> legs<00:05:19.910> can't<00:05:20.420> be<00:05:21.070> they

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
but I feel like his legs can't be they

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.520 
but I feel like his legs can't be they
can't<00:05:22.370> be<00:05:22.550> this<00:05:22.760> size<00:05:23.360> without<00:05:23.900> him<00:05:24.080> looking

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
can't be this size without him looking

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.360 
can't be this size without him looking
really<00:05:25.070> stumpy<00:05:25.660> that's<00:05:26.660> the<00:05:27.050> only<00:05:27.530> problem<00:05:27.920> I

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
really stumpy that's the only problem I

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.770 
really stumpy that's the only problem I
have<00:05:28.520> with<00:05:28.640> this<00:05:28.760> figure<00:05:29.030> there's<00:05:29.480> also<00:05:29.690> have

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
have with this figure there's also have

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.160 
have with this figure there's also have
removable<00:05:30.700> like<00:05:31.700> symbian<00:05:32.420> attachment<00:05:33.020> where

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.170 
removable like symbian attachment where

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.720 
removable like symbian attachment where
you<00:05:33.260> can<00:05:33.410> leave<00:05:33.620> it<00:05:33.740> just<00:05:33.920> off<00:05:34.130> if<00:05:34.370> you<00:05:34.490> still

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.730 
you can leave it just off if you still

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.090 
you can leave it just off if you still
wish<00:05:34.940> or<00:05:35.240> you<00:05:35.810> can<00:05:35.960> put<00:05:36.140> it<00:05:36.230> on<00:05:36.320> you<00:05:36.560> can<00:05:36.590> rotate

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
wish or you can put it on you can rotate

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.100 
wish or you can put it on you can rotate
it<00:05:37.490> you<00:05:37.640> could<00:05:37.760> have<00:05:37.880> it<00:05:38.000> more<00:05:38.180> as<00:05:38.330> a<00:05:38.360> caller<00:05:38.750> I

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
it you could have it more as a caller I

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.420 
it you could have it more as a caller I
think<00:05:39.440> when<00:05:39.530> you<00:05:39.590> get<00:05:39.680> up<00:05:39.830> get<00:05:40.160> out<00:05:40.220> of

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
think when you get up get out of

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.100 
think when you get up get out of
packaging<00:05:40.850> it<00:05:40.970> looks<00:05:41.330> kind<00:05:41.540> of<00:05:41.570> like<00:05:41.690> this<00:05:41.870> but

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
packaging it looks kind of like this but

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.040 
packaging it looks kind of like this but
you<00:05:42.200> kind<00:05:42.380> of<00:05:42.440> also<00:05:42.560> like<00:05:42.830> a<00:05:42.860> caller<00:05:43.190> I<00:05:44.050> like

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
you kind of also like a caller I like

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.250 
you kind of also like a caller I like
that<00:05:45.460> but<00:05:46.460> the<00:05:47.090> short<00:05:47.450> legs<00:05:47.780> is<00:05:48.050> what's

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
that but the short legs is what's

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.740 
that but the short legs is what's
killing<00:05:48.800> it<00:05:48.890> for<00:05:48.919> this<00:05:49.220> figure<00:05:49.660> for<00:05:50.660> that

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
killing it for this figure for that

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.500 
killing it for this figure for that
reason<00:05:51.380> I<00:05:51.590> feel<00:05:52.370> like<00:05:52.520> he's<00:05:52.669> more<00:05:52.850> vibrant

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
reason I feel like he's more vibrant

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.720 
reason I feel like he's more vibrant
than<00:05:53.870> the<00:05:54.080> deep<00:05:54.290> in<00:05:54.620> the<00:05:54.800> Diamond<00:05:55.580> Select

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:55.730 
than the deep in the Diamond Select

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.120 
than the deep in the Diamond Select
version<00:05:56.240> of<00:05:56.390> anti-venom<00:05:57.080> but<00:05:57.740> I<00:05:57.770> feel<00:05:57.980> like

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
version of anti-venom but I feel like

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.800 
version of anti-venom but I feel like
anti-venom<00:05:58.700> from<00:05:59.150> Diamond<00:05:59.450> select<00:05:59.690> is<00:05:59.780> a

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
anti-venom from Diamond select is a

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.620 
anti-venom from Diamond select is a
better<00:06:00.020> figure<00:06:00.260> it<00:06:00.560> just<00:06:00.970> it<00:06:01.970> just<00:06:02.030> has<00:06:02.419> that

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630

Marvel Legends treatment I think was

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.670

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.720 
feel like other than the paint that's
saving<00:06:51.690> this<00:06:51.930> figure<00:06:52.320> and<00:06:52.500> by<00:06:53.100> paint<00:06:53.490> he
