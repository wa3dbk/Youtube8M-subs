00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.990
 hello welcome to the board we study the 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:15.039
 carbon cycle 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:17.350
 the atom that is abundant in the environment and is 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:20.529
 used mainly for the 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:23.410
 construction of organic substances which 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:27.310
 make up the body of living beings 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:31.419
 the largest source of carbon available for 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:34.980
 living things in the environment is the dioxide 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:37.120
 carbon or more commonly known as 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.059
 carbon dioxide 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:46.440
 available carbon dioxide in the 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:52.359
 atmosphere is cleared by producers and 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:56.050
 used in the photosynthesis process is 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:01:00.280
 through the process of photosynthesis that 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:03.750
 the delay molecules will be produced 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:08.200
 cozzi and all carbon atoms 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:11.200
 contained in the carbon dioxide will be 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.290
 given the glucose molecules in the 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.500
 inside the plant organism is 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.229
 giving cozzi will be used in 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.710
 different processes and I can 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:28.500
 mention two process sets 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:32.110
 the first one is the cellular respiration 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.890
 in cellular respiration 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:39.520
 the plant will break the molecules 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.880
 glucose in two different parts 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.530
 the molecule will be broken into spend 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:50.860
 monic and also in water molecules 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:56.229
 this carbon dioxide will be released 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:58.960
 back to the atmosphere and every atom 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:02.619
 of the carbon contained in the 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.719
 glucose will be part of a new molecule 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.050
 of carbon dioxide 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:12.460
 another way the plant will use the 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:16.380
 glucose is incorporating this glucose 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:20.200
 LAN or producing other biomass or 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:24.310
 substances that will go with the 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:28.150
 plant when the plant dies all pew 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.570
 mass in the band will suffer the 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:35.200
 action of the composers 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:38.770
 pyron decomposers metabolize the 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.530
 organic matter and through the process 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:46.030
 of cellular respiration 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:49.360
 they will also release the carbon under 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.240
 form of carbon dioxide is why I 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.260
 I will write composers with the same 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:59.620
 of the cellular respiration because gas 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:03.040
 carbon dioxide will return to the environment 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:06.970
 also through the breathing process 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.970
 of composers if we 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.840
 we consider that the plant remains 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:17.260
 alive but she was preached but in 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:21.670
 or by a primary consumer who 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:24.070
 I'm going to call it animal 1 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.320
 we saw in previous classes that the 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.390
 animal book made a has who 's on 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:34.390
 part of this biomass 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:39.150
 most of the biomass 90% of it is e 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:41.410
 dida through faeces and this biomass 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:46.330
 lost in feces 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:49.710
 will also suffer from composers and 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:53.590
 the carbon contained in these excesses 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:56.710
 will return to the environment in the form of gas 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:00.070
 carbon dioxide since part of this 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:02.140
 contained in the se shall be used in the 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.730
 the breathing process of the 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:08.170
 composers 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:12.610
 the other 10% of matter that will be 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:15.880
 acquitted by the animal will be partly 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:19.519
 used in the breathing process 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:23.900
 where they will be released 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:28.250
 well carbon dioxide molecules and the other 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:32.229
 part shall be incorporated into the 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:35.240
 animal and if we consider the 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:38.720
 continuity of the food chain 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:42.740
 we can repeat everything that happened 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:46.250
 for the animal to the next animal of the 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:50.360
 cycle that I can call animal 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:54.490
 2 then what we see here is that the 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:58.159
 Mono car returns to atmosphere 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:02.990
 through the processes of breathing 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:07.310
 from both the producers and the 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:10.120
 of composers and consumers 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:13.759
 this carbon returning to the atmosphere 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:17.419
 will again be disapproved by 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:20.629
 producers in the process of photosynthesis 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:23.750
 so summing up this cycle we can 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:27.680
 say that carbon participates 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:31.190
 Two processes paraticamente 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:35.120
 process of photosynthesis and also of the 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:38.419
 the process of cellular respiration of beings 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:41.949
 through photosynthesis 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:45.110
 carbon dioxide molecules are 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:48.469
 incorporated into living beings and a face 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.690
 ball is used for the construction of 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:52.849
 glucose molecules 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.310
 these glucose molecules will be 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:59.090
 used in the breathing process 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:03.050
 cell in living beings that breaks the 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:06.349
 Water molecules in soaps and also 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:08.960
 carbon dioxide spreading carbon dioxide 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:11.889
 to the atmosphere 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:15.289
 a problem that we currently have 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:18.380
 related to the carbon cycle has 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:20.300
 excessive burning of the 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.169
 fossil fuels 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:26.580
 the excessive burning of these fuels 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:29.490
 is increasing a lot 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:33.169
 city â€‹â€‹of carbon dioxide present in 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:36.990
 atmosphere as this cycle is not 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:41.189
 sufficient to absorb this excess of 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:45.229
 carbon dioxide is a phenomenon that is natural 

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:50.250
 is being increased because of this 

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:52.949
 imbalance is the greenhouse effect and 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:56.909
 increase is increasing. 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:59.129
 and much the temperature of the earth 

00:06:56.909 --> 00:07:01.199
 good people, I hope you have 

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:03.889
 understood this class continues 

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:03.889
 studying
