it Alpha Centauri I almost dropped it

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:30.570 
it Alpha Centauri I almost dropped it
from<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.180> list<00:02:29.360> it's<00:02:29.720> a<00:02:29.870> foreign<00:02:30.319> sounding

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580

hood<00:02:34.069> huh<00:02:34.520> what's<00:02:35.120> there<00:02:35.420> some<00:02:35.870> space<00:02:36.260> debris

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
hood huh what's there some space debris

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.979 
hood huh what's there some space debris
no<00:02:37.640> it's<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.180> real<00:02:38.300> deal

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
no it's the real deal

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.270 
no it's the real deal
I<00:02:39.020> spotted<00:02:39.980> aliens<00:02:40.610> take<00:02:41.420> a<00:02:41.660> look<00:02:41.870> huh<00:02:42.530> it's<00:02:43.130> a

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
I spotted aliens take a look huh it's a

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.370 
I spotted aliens take a look huh it's a
family<00:02:43.940> when<00:02:44.450> you're<00:02:44.569> right<00:02:44.840> you're<00:02:45.080> right

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
family when you're right you're right

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.070 
family when you're right you're right
that's<00:02:45.739> so<00:02:46.069> true<00:02:46.459> rural<00:02:47.180> aliens<00:02:47.750> is<00:02:47.959> you

that's so true rural aliens is you
simple<00:02:48.530> logic<00:02:48.920> so<00:02:49.310> many<00:02:49.520> movies<00:02:49.910> on<00:02:50.060> TV<00:02:50.209> shows

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
simple logic so many movies on TV shows

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.540 
simple logic so many movies on TV shows
have<00:02:50.810> space<00:02:51.170> aliens<00:02:51.800> they<00:02:52.100> can't<00:02:52.340> all<00:02:52.520> be

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
have space aliens they can't all be

00:02:52.550 --> 00:03:02.899 
have space aliens they can't all be
