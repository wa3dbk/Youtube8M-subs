00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:03.039
 ain more 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.599
 the imperious to a new 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:13.529
 title of Marquis Spanish by Rodrigo Blanco 

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:16.919
 in this opportunity I want to teach them 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:22.519
 close the session in case you withdraw from your computers something 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.569
 of your computers for a period and sweet potato about five minutes 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.140
 If you want to be calm and confident that 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.100
 during that time 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.890
 if you delay a bit more than that the session of using your computer will 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.160
 it closes automatically and in this way 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.470
 no other person can access what you are doing or enter 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.220
 your account and to achieve this explains the manzanita system preferences 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.890
 and I want you to direct your attention to the part that says security 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.380
 when you get here 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.560
 the search box and look how the session sorry as the tension goes 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.710
 towards peace 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.930
 the peak is not that they have a metal box with a combination 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.140
 safe 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.840
 what are we going to click on her 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.200
 observe you say security and in the tarp hello the button up the left 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.560
 I wanted general 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.840
 that's where I want you to click 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.840
 selection in that option 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.820
 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th that says to be close session after 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.580
 this case by said 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.780
 I have five minutes 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.990
 of inactivity by all can enlarge that time 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.720
 observe the five minutes 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.690
 once you make that change 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.770
 you are going to realize that if you are absent from your computers 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.510
 during that time lapse 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.930
 the assignment is going to close 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.470
 they were going to have to again enter the computer 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.300
 I remember now 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.720
 they have to have 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.650
 selected the button that says deactivate the login 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.990
 automatic in other words when you 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.620
 they started unifem long they opened up because there was for the first time when 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.209
 they bought their computers 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.659
 you have had to create an account or an account with at least one 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:20.469
 product that is the name where they are assigned 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:24.180
 they are all like duck like photo efe cali 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.169
 curves 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:28.169
 documents that are under that name 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:32.849
 when the session closes they will return again 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.569
 to that first pappa entry screen where he goes he is not afraid that after his password 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.869
 to fall back after entering a new session 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:44.809
 the best way to dende'l to familiarize yourself with these terms of 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:46.949
 constructions 3 

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:50.739
 putting it into practice I assure you that if you remember your password 

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:55.819
 you will be able to practice all this and not 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.669
 they will be called hourly computation on par with any type of training 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.089
 neither says buckles will it end the world in case it makes an error just 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:08.249
 always guaranteed the way to solve any type of problem in 

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:08.969
 the mac 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:12.129
 and that's why this operating system 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.419
 such has been after so much success i 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:16.910
 one of the 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.330
 I consider that some of the most obvious operational items that are there 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.529
 out to the market 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:25.629
 Well I hope this one should have lasted the authors and please leave a 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:26.459
 message 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.989
 and anything for example extreme commenting some more of the video 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:31.929
 tutorial 

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:35.339
 is for people who are at a beginner level i 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.960
 amorous pretensions showed everything possible to have more 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.810
 in a very elementary way and later we will be increasing 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:50.790
 efe the diesel in the topics and talking about the subject so a little bit let's say 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.939
 more complex than this we are handling this principle 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:57.869
 per cent the orders and taboos have rodrigo white dotcom and there they can not 

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:59.069
 send unimer 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.110
 i'm not seeing here for this same channel in the next 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.259
 then they tried 

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:06.819
 ana to bread 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:07.819
 there is more
