 yet of southern origin although they 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.590
 are part of the Mediterranean landscape 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.110
 to the point of becoming invasive in 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.590
 some regions the level it comes from 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.800

 a lot of plants that come from 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.690

 1804 the mimosa comes to us from 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.490
 australia 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.860
 I 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.990
 botanists have the incredible gift of 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.960
 complicate things 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.720
 hanging on the mimosa for 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.910
 botanists it's acacias your acacias to 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.709
 we are the robinia the one who flowers 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.790
 in the spring and which we consume 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.519
 donuts with delight 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.319
 as for mimosas for botanists and 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.390
 this little plant absolutely adorable 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.250
 that we call the sensitive and as soon as we 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.790
 touch his leaves they fold 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.400
 on themselves 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.739
 so we do not understand anything anymore and we're going 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.480
 continue to say a mimosa of course he 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:32.769
 exists one thousand two hundred species of 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.239
 mimosa acacia forgiveness as I feel that 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.670
 do you take a last small 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.160
 botanical lesson acacias mimosas 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.299
 is divided into two groups according to 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.640
 shape of their leaves 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.500
 on one side the classic mimosa with its 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.600
 compound leaves pained so very 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.310
 light graceful like feathers of a 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.739
 bird or a little the fronts of a 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.850
 fern and on the other the mimosas to 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.100
 whole leaves 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.410
 trap attention these are not 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.930
 leaves it's called fashion challenge 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.090
 in fact it is the p sial of the 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.459
 sheet that has flattened itself that has 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.950
 long and recognizable by the 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.690
 parallel veins is the peculiarity 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.070
 from his sons to death is to allow 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.579
 the plant to better withstand the 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.980
 drought 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.810
 last little thing the mimosas to 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.810
 entire sheets for example as the 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.250
 mimosa caterpillars acacias longy folha or 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.590
 the one we know very well mimosa 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.040
 of the four-season acacias retina of this 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.530
 are a little more cautious than the 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.420
 classics it resists around -5 or -8 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.440
 degrees no more this one he can 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.440
 support -10 degrees 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.650
 I propose now to discover 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.420
 a few months we particularly 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.190
 remarkable some come from the 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.870
 national collection of mimosa de 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.580
 sir gérard cahn is wrong she is 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:48.590
 located near mimosas of course 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.770
 let's start our series by the mimosas to 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.900
 leaves pained compound very fine and the 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.940
 famous acacias dealbata the mimosa 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.489
 classic with some cultivars 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.890
 interesting for example Gaulish astier 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.360
 is ideal for growing in tanks it does not 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.970
 will hardly exceed three meters in height 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.980
 on the other hand next to 8 mirandol the 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.080
 more imposing he can reach in 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.350
 full ground this time about 8 meters 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.890
 here are beautiful acacias and yana marshal 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.019
 joffre 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.269
 it will take naturally to port 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.620
 falling down he is extremely graceful and 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.959
 he can be recognized by his leaves 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.450
 extremely compact much more 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.620
 small than that of the classic mimosa a 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.990
 plant that we can very well 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.910
 cultivating pot much like the 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.970
 classic mimosas but much more 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.430

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.320
 reaches 2 4 to 6 meters in height 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.540
 they wear mostly very very big 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.090
 generous crab flowers and if you 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:44.470

 cleanings welcome a delight 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.620
 now let's go to mimosas to 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.370
 entire sheets I remind her that her 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.550
 fields 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:55.280
 gold this one auvity moonlight 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.680

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.039
 much later not before march april 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.479
 May however it will feel 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:04.220
 deliciously good you can 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:06.530
 succeed without problems in a large bin 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:10.370
 next to a curiosity 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:12.590
 the mimosa caterpillars acacias longy folha 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.289
 with its long leaves and also 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.810
 its long bunches of yellow flowers that 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.550
 will just come out in the spring this 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.770
 mozac friend who is very dense very 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.780
 compact that can serve as air curtain 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.130
 wind in the regions near the edge of 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.190
 because he does not fear 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.930
 spray the mimosa of the four seasons 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.880
 acacias retina sportsmen well his name 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.380
 because he is raising his flowers 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.300
 may be a little less dense 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.130
 than the others but it renews itself 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.320
 permanently and so we take advantage of his 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.669
 flowers throughout the season 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.590

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.010
 drought during the summer period 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.660
 so that they can form their pimples 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.540
 on the other hand when it is 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.010
