for the next episode so this is the team
I've<00:01:26.820> made<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.090> should<00:01:27.299> probably<00:01:27.450> talk<00:01:27.630> a

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
I've made I should probably talk a

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.060 
I've made I should probably talk a
little<00:01:27.990> bit<00:01:28.140> about<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.530> we've<00:01:28.619> got<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> side<00:01:29.040> II

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
little bit about it we've got a side II

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.410 
little bit about it we've got a side II
and<00:01:29.430> Wellington<00:01:29.729> silver<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.090> went<00:01:30.270> for<00:01:30.390> a

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
and Wellington silver I went for a

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.030 
and Wellington silver I went for a
hybrid<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:30.900> time<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.290> know<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.560> chemistry<00:01:31.860> is

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
hybrid this time I know the chemistry is

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.289 
hybrid this time I know the chemistry is
gonna<00:01:32.189> be<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.340> bit<00:01:32.520> off<00:01:32.640> halfway<00:01:32.939> through<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
gonna be a bit off halfway through the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.969 
gonna be a bit off halfway through the
series<00:01:33.689> but<00:01:33.900> um<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.229> mean<00:01:34.259> if<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.650> had<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.860> pick

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
series but um I mean if I had to pick

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.399 
series but um I mean if I had to pick
one<00:01:35.009> Charlie<00:01:35.520> Adams<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.850> bit<00:01:36.000> bit<00:01:36.750> questionable

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
one Charlie Adams a bit bit questionable

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.710 
one Charlie Adams a bit bit questionable
at<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.740> central<00:01:38.360> midfield<00:01:39.360> bit<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.659> a

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
at that central midfield bit of a

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.420 
at that central midfield bit of a
utility<00:01:40.200> player<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.500> think<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:40.920> these<00:01:41.070> are<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
utility player I think so these are the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.039 
utility player I think so these are the
player<00:01:41.640> edition<00:01:42.000> rules<00:01:42.150> basically<00:01:42.540> we<00:01:42.899> want

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
player edition rules basically we want

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.690 
player edition rules basically we want
to<00:01:43.110> be<00:01:43.200> scoring<00:01:43.530> as<00:01:43.649> many<00:01:43.860> goals<00:01:44.130> with<00:01:44.340> Messi

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
to be scoring as many goals with Messi

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.789 
to be scoring as many goals with Messi
as<00:01:44.850> we<00:01:45.479> can<00:01:45.810> they've<00:01:46.079> changed<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.470> little<00:01:46.619> bit

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
as we can they've changed a little bit

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.260 
as we can they've changed a little bit
since<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.159> last<00:01:47.340> series<00:01:47.670> because<00:01:48.090> we

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
since the last series because we

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.569 
since the last series because we
basically<00:01:49.079> needed<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.799> bigger<00:01:49.979> budget<00:01:50.220> buy

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
basically needed a bigger budget buy

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.420 
basically needed a bigger budget buy
some<00:01:50.909> players<00:01:51.509> some<00:01:52.110> players<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:52.740> um<00:01:52.920> yeah

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
some players some players so um yeah

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.920 
some players some players so um yeah
that's<00:01:53.759> what<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.210> rules<00:01:54.360> are<00:01:54.450> compete<00:01:54.810> I'm

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
that's what the rules are compete I'm

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.969

3-1 Messi scored though so I had 70 K to

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.660 
3-1 Messi scored though so I had 70 K to
add<00:06:27.210> on<00:06:27.390> to<00:06:27.510> the<00:06:27.600> budget<00:06:27.960> as<00:06:28.110> well<00:06:28.260> as<00:06:28.320> 150<00:06:29.040> K<00:06:29.190> to

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:29.670 
add on to the budget as well as 150 K to

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:30.950 
add on to the budget as well as 150 K to
take<00:06:29.820> away<00:06:30.030> from<00:06:30.180> the<00:06:30.270> budget<00:06:30.570> so<00:06:30.690> that<00:06:30.720> gives

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
take away from the budget so that gives

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.620 
take away from the budget so that gives
us<00:06:31.080> all<00:06:31.380> the<00:06:31.470> net<00:06:31.680> loss<00:06:31.890> of<00:06:32.130> -<00:06:32.820> 80<00:06:33.000> K<00:06:33.240> from<00:06:33.300> that

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.630 
us all the net loss of - 80 K from that

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.540 
us all the net loss of - 80 K from that
game<00:06:33.900> and<00:06:34.140> so<00:06:34.650> taking<00:06:35.010> that<00:06:35.040> away<00:06:35.190> from<00:06:35.310> the

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
game and so taking that away from the

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.839 
game and so taking that away from the
260k<00:06:36.300> in<00:06:36.630> the<00:06:36.750> first<00:06:36.930> game<00:06:37.140> gives<00:06:37.680> us<00:06:37.860> 180

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:38.849 
260k in the first game gives us 180
