this stuff's going to opened up it's a
nice<00:00:30.510> even<00:00:30.750> flow<00:00:31.380> right<00:00:31.679> up<00:00:31.769> into<00:00:31.920> here<00:00:32.130> you

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
nice even flow right up into here you

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.790 
nice even flow right up into here you
can<00:00:32.340> tell<00:00:32.520> nice<00:00:33.180> straight<00:00:33.570> edge<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:34.620> side

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
can tell nice straight edge this side

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.900 
can tell nice straight edge this side
I'll<00:00:34.920> be<00:00:34.950> are<00:00:35.070> still<00:00:35.309> rough<00:00:35.520> because<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.760> go

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
I'll be are still rough because I go

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.150 
I'll be are still rough because I go
back<00:00:35.969> over<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:39.620> get<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> little<00:00:40.829> bit<00:00:40.920> closer

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
back over it get a little bit closer

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.520 
back over it get a little bit closer
just<00:00:41.579> keep<00:00:42.360> going<00:00:42.570> back<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:42.809> forth<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.350> dis

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
just keep going back and forth the dis

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.889 
just keep going back and forth the dis
stuff<00:00:43.800> go<00:00:44.789> back<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.149> work<00:00:45.239> on<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.539> half<00:00:45.719> the

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
stuff go back and work on this half the

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.250 
stuff go back and work on this half the
port<00:00:46.110> again<00:00:47.390> it's<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.480> never-ending<00:00:48.750> process

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
port again it's a never-ending process

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.580 
port again it's a never-ending process
of<00:00:50.070> going<00:00:50.219> back<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.460> forth<00:00:51.110> so<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.320> side

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
of going back and forth so this side

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.810 
of going back and forth so this side
here<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.039> getting<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> lot<00:00:54.000> bigger<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:55.670> cut<00:00:56.670> this

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
here is getting a lot bigger I cut this

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.400 
here is getting a lot bigger I cut this
way<00:00:57.030> out<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.300> go<00:00:57.510> back<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.899> smooth<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.260> some

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
way out I go back and smooth this some

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.700 
way out I go back and smooth this some
more<00:00:58.559> again<00:00:59.960> once<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.079> get<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.350> here<00:01:01.530> you

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
more again once you get this here you

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.139 
more again once you get this here you
fixing<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.129> side<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.550> come<00:01:02.699> back<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.059> do<00:01:03.120> it

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
fixing this side you come back and do it

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.590 
fixing this side you come back and do it
from<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.420> side<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.840> blend<00:01:04.110> them<00:01:05.570> cut<00:01:06.570> a

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
from this side and blend them cut a

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.510 
from this side and blend them cut a
bunch<00:01:06.810> off<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.170> top<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.619> here<00:01:10.280> you<00:01:11.280> can<00:01:11.369> get<00:01:11.460> an

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
bunch off the top in here you can get an

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.499 
bunch off the top in here you can get an
idea<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.970> that's<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.420> pores<00:01:14.270> between<00:01:15.270> a

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
idea that that's in the pores between a

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.920 
idea that that's in the pores between a
two<00:01:15.720> here<00:01:17.060> you<00:01:18.060> see<00:01:18.240> how<00:01:18.330> much<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.600> has<00:01:18.750> been

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
two here you see how much this has been

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.420 
two here you see how much this has been
cut<00:01:19.140> back<00:01:21.229> but<00:01:22.229> we<00:01:22.350> did<00:01:22.530> not<00:01:22.650> cut<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.040> top<00:01:23.250> off

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
cut back but we did not cut the top off

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.300 
cut back but we did not cut the top off
it<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.000> still<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.330> same<00:01:24.540> up<00:01:24.720> there<00:01:25.159> it's<00:01:26.159> just

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
it is still the same up there it's just

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.950 
it is still the same up there it's just
everything<00:01:26.759> else<00:01:26.939> has<00:01:27.119> been<00:01:27.150> moved<00:01:27.720> down<00:01:27.930> to

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
everything else has been moved down to

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.490 
everything else has been moved down to
here<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.619> nice<00:01:29.369> even<00:01:29.700> angle<00:01:30.140> this<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.320> nice

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
here a nice even angle this is a nice

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.800 
here a nice even angle this is a nice
big<00:01:31.909> radius<00:01:32.909> coming<00:01:33.180> through<00:01:33.360> here<00:01:33.540> instead

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
big radius coming through here instead

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.120 
big radius coming through here instead
of<00:01:33.930> with<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.110> block<00:01:34.350> when<00:01:34.530> there<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.829> hard<00:01:35.040> to

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
of with the block when there is hard to

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.940 
of with the block when there is hard to
see<00:01:35.340> but<00:01:35.960> well<00:01:36.960> obviously<00:01:37.020> it's<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.380> lot<00:01:37.530> bigger

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.990 

the<00:01:40.950> end<00:01:41.100> result<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.549> when<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.759> look<00:01:41.880> up

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
the end result is when you look up

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.270 
the end result is when you look up
inside<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.509> bowl<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.259> seat<00:01:43.530> which<00:01:43.920> one<00:01:44.130> can

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
inside the bowl and a seat which one can

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.899 
inside the bowl and a seat which one can
you<00:01:44.340> see<00:01:44.490> more<00:01:44.729> with<00:01:44.909> that's<00:01:45.420> what<00:01:45.600> matters<00:01:45.930> to

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
you see more with that's what matters to

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.469 
you see more with that's what matters to
a<00:01:47.909> bigger<00:01:48.090> one<00:01:48.180> puts<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.570> whole<00:01:48.630> flower<00:01:48.840> up<00:01:49.140> I

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
a bigger one puts the whole flower up I

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.460 
a bigger one puts the whole flower up I
only<00:01:51.479> got<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.810> big<00:01:51.990> motor<00:01:52.170> or<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.860> lot<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.220> rpm<00:01:54.470> so

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
only got a big motor or a lot of rpm so

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.660 
only got a big motor or a lot of rpm so
I<00:01:55.500> could<00:01:55.680> come<00:01:55.799> back<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:55.979> work<00:01:56.250> on<00:01:56.340> this<00:01:56.490> area

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
I could come back and work on this area

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.370 
I could come back and work on this area
here<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:56.969> little<00:01:57.119> bit<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.479> more<00:01:57.689> equalize<00:01:58.079> it

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
here a little bit to more equalize it

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.990 
here a little bit to more equalize it
you<00:01:59.070> get<00:01:59.189> an<00:01:59.280> idea<00:01:59.610> let's<00:02:00.420> keep<00:02:00.570> plugging<00:02:00.899> away
