unity one of the commenters on a post i
made<00:00:11.280> about<00:00:11.400> that<00:00:11.700> feature<00:00:12.690> said<00:00:13.080> yeah<00:00:13.259> it's

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
made about that feature said yeah it's

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.509 
made about that feature said yeah it's
great<00:00:13.590> but<00:00:13.769> you<00:00:13.889> know<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.190> really<00:00:14.340> be

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
great but you know to really be

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.860 
great but you know to really be
integrated<00:00:14.910> in<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.030> beast<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.750> should

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
integrated in the beast and you should

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.570 
integrated in the beast and you should
be<00:00:15.900> able<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.170> store<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.920> output<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.279> beasts

way they do have that you know rendered
to<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.100> pass<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.610> then<00:00:38.700> store<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.180> as<00:00:39.719> vertex

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
and a bunch of other stuff it's sort of

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.010 
and a bunch of other stuff it's sort of
unpleasant<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:45.090> here<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.329> have<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.480> scene<00:00:45.780> in

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
unpleasant so here I have a scene in

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.229 
unpleasant so here I have a scene in
unit<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.829> know<00:00:46.980> programmer<00:00:47.520> or<00:00:47.610> morning

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
unit is you know programmer or morning

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.279 
unit is you know programmer or morning
and<00:00:50.510> I've<00:00:51.510> already<00:00:51.719> rendered<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.079> was<00:00:52.199> actually

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
and I've already rendered I was actually

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.840 
and I've already rendered I was actually
going<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.590> show<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.949> rendering<00:00:53.280> process<00:00:53.309> just

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
going to show the rendering process just

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.369 
going to show the rendering process just
do<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.059> whole<00:00:54.270> thing<00:00:54.300> from<00:00:54.600> scratch<00:00:54.719> but<00:00:55.170> it

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
do this whole thing from scratch but it

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.200 
do this whole thing from scratch but it
takes<00:00:55.590> too<00:00:55.770> long<00:00:55.800> with<00:00:56.280> beast<00:00:56.489> honestly<00:00:56.940> so

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
takes too long with beast honestly so

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.150 
takes too long with beast honestly so
here<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.719> can<00:00:57.750> see<00:00:58.020> we<00:00:58.230> have<00:00:58.260> some<00:00:58.620> orange

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
here you can see we have some orange

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.860 
here you can see we have some orange
bleeding<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.059> blue<00:01:00.180> bleeding<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.570> here<00:01:00.719> and

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
bleeding and blue bleeding in here and

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.660 
bleeding and blue bleeding in here and
you<00:01:00.930> can<00:01:01.020> say<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.320> has<00:01:01.469> been<00:01:01.680> processed<00:01:02.309> so

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
you can say this has been processed so

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.160 
you can say this has been processed so
these<00:01:02.760> nice<00:01:02.969> big<00:01:03.239> wide<00:01:03.420> soft<00:01:03.780> shadows

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170

was<00:01:43.049> actually<00:01:43.200> stored<00:01:43.649> we'd<00:01:44.399> like<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.549> do<00:01:44.759> is

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
was actually stored we'd like to do is

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.580 
was actually stored we'd like to do is
to<00:01:45.090> bake<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.390> down<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.869> vertex<00:01:46.170> scholars

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
to bake that down to vertex scholars

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.350 
to bake that down to vertex scholars
assuming<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.280> if<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.790> wanted<00:01:48.060> ambient

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
assuming that if you wanted ambient

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.249 
assuming that if you wanted ambient
occlusion<00:01:48.479> like<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:48.930> going<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.110> look<00:01:49.200> a

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
occlusion like this is going to look a

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.660 
occlusion like this is going to look a
little<00:01:49.409> weird<00:01:49.619> because<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:49.979> includes<00:01:50.250> shadows

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
little weird because it includes shadows

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.090 
little weird because it includes shadows
and<00:01:51.420> am<00:01:51.810> uniquely<00:01:52.110> dramatic<00:01:52.470> color<00:01:52.590> bouncing

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
and am uniquely dramatic color bouncing

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.980 
and am uniquely dramatic color bouncing
but<00:01:53.280> obviously<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.790> can<00:01:53.939> do<00:01:54.090> whatever<00:01:54.570> passes

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
but obviously you can do whatever passes

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.749 
but obviously you can do whatever passes
you<00:01:55.350> one<00:01:55.500> beast<00:01:55.799> independently<00:01:56.430> i<00:01:56.460> just<00:01:56.670> did

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
you one beast independently i just did

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.010 
you one beast independently i just did
this<00:01:56.820> all<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.119> one<00:01:57.240> shot<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.479> it'd<00:01:57.750> be<00:01:57.840> easy<00:01:57.960> to

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
this all in one shot so it'd be easy to

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.289 
this all in one shot so it'd be easy to
illustrate<00:01:58.799> we<00:01:59.670> want<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.909> bake<00:02:00.000> this<00:02:00.119> down

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
illustrate we want to bake this down

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.270 
illustrate we want to bake this down
into<00:02:00.630> vertex<00:02:01.229> colors<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.680> order<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.979> do<00:02:02.100> that

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
into vertex colors in order to do that

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.490 
into vertex colors in order to do that
one<00:02:03.180> thing<00:02:03.210> we<00:02:03.420> need<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.570> do<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.290> make<00:02:04.469> sure

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
one thing we need to do is to make sure

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.080 
one thing we need to do is to make sure
that<00:02:04.890> our<00:02:04.920> light<00:02:05.189> maps<00:02:05.399> which<00:02:05.670> are<00:02:05.759> over<00:02:05.939> here

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
that our light maps which are over here

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.199 
that our light maps which are over here
in<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.710> you<00:02:07.710> know<00:02:07.829> automatically<00:02:08.759> generated

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
in this you know automatically generated

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.240 
in this you know automatically generated
directory<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:09.599> unity<00:02:09.989> creates<00:02:10.289> these<00:02:11.009> are

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
directory that unity creates these are

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.320 
directory that unity creates these are
to<00:02:11.370> need<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.610> make<00:02:11.760> we<00:02:12.030> need<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.180> make<00:02:12.300> sure

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
to need to make we need to make sure

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
to need to make we need to make sure
that<00:02:12.480> these<00:02:12.569> can<00:02:12.780> be<00:02:12.870> read

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
that these can be read

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.690 
that these can be read
so<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.650> in<00:02:13.830> order<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.130> do<00:02:14.250> that<00:02:14.430> we<00:02:14.580> have<00:02:14.670> to

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
so the in order to do that we have to

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.370 
so the in order to do that we have to
detect<00:02:14.970> your<00:02:15.120> type<00:02:15.300> change<00:02:15.660> it<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.810> advanced

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
detect your type change it to advanced

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.820 
detect your type change it to advanced

and click on read write enabled and you

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:20.930 
and click on read write enabled and you
know<00:02:19.950> we're<00:02:20.040> gonna<00:02:20.100> do<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.460> for<00:02:20.610> all<00:02:20.670> of<00:02:20.790> them

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
know we're gonna do that for all of them

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.480 
know we're gonna do that for all of them
and<00:02:21.210> I'm<00:02:21.720> showing<00:02:22.320> this<00:02:22.470> because<00:02:22.890> I<00:02:23.040> forgot<00:02:23.340> to

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
and I'm showing this because I forgot to

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.880 
and I'm showing this because I forgot to
do<00:02:23.610> this<00:02:23.760> so<00:02:24.000> many<00:02:24.090> times<00:02:24.210> that<00:02:24.660> it<00:02:25.110> really

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
do this so many times that it really

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.010 
do this so many times that it really
became<00:02:26.280> essentially<00:02:27.090> obvious<00:02:27.780> that<00:02:27.930> this

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
became essentially obvious that this

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.170 
became essentially obvious that this
need<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.230> be<00:02:28.350> like<00:02:29.100> clearly<00:02:29.580> stated<00:02:29.880> up<00:02:29.970> front

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
need to be like clearly stated up front

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.200 
need to be like clearly stated up front
like<00:02:30.240> wow<00:02:30.450> do<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:30.840> need<00:02:31.020> to<00:02:31.110> do<00:02:31.230> this<00:02:31.350> okay<00:02:32.210> so

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
like wow do you need to do this okay so

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.580 
like wow do you need to do this okay so
here<00:02:33.360> we<00:02:33.450> have<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.050> here<00:02:34.230> we<00:02:34.320> have<00:02:34.350> this

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
here we have that and here we have this

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.020 
here we have that and here we have this
object<00:02:35.070> now<00:02:35.190> what<00:02:35.280> I<00:02:35.340> want<00:02:35.490> to<00:02:35.520> do<00:02:35.640> is<00:02:35.670> mentally

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
object now what I want to do is mentally

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.950 
object now what I want to do is mentally
going<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.210> put<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.770> debug<00:02:38.630> shader<00:02:39.630> on<00:02:39.780> here<00:02:39.930> that

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
going to put a debug shader on here that

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.450 
going to put a debug shader on here that
so<00:02:40.140> it's<00:02:40.230> going<00:02:40.320> to<00:02:40.380> show<00:02:40.530> vertex<00:02:40.920> colors<00:02:41.280> and

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
so it's going to show vertex colors and

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.970 
so it's going to show vertex colors and
I<00:02:41.490> want<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.760> bake<00:02:41.970> these<00:02:42.780> di<00:02:43.260> callers<00:02:43.740> in<00:02:43.890> the

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
I want to bake these di callers in the

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.500 
I want to bake these di callers in the
vertex<00:02:44.340> using<00:02:44.640> this<00:02:44.730> script<00:02:45.030> here<00:02:45.240> which<00:02:45.420> is

trying<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.500> show<00:03:13.620> too<00:03:13.800> much<00:03:13.830> of<00:03:14.070> this<00:03:14.190> but<00:03:14.400> here

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
trying to show too much of this but here

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.130 
trying to show too much of this but here
you<00:03:14.580> can<00:03:14.640> see<00:03:14.820> the<00:03:14.850> shader<00:03:15.120> here<00:03:15.330> this<00:03:15.960> is<00:03:16.110> a

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
you can see the shader here this is a

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.500 
you can see the shader here this is a
really<00:03:16.680> simple<00:03:17.040> excuse<00:03:17.790> me<00:03:17.940> vertex<00:03:18.330> and

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
fragment shader and this does not

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.730 
fragment shader and this does not
interact<00:03:20.910> with<00:03:21.300> anything<00:03:21.960> in<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.320> world<00:03:22.440> at

difficult<00:03:31.890> to<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:32.460> mean<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.820> original<00:03:33.150> version

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
difficult to I mean the original version

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.790 
difficult to I mean the original version
of<00:03:33.450> this<00:03:33.510> I<00:03:33.630> had<00:03:33.750> was<00:03:33.960> a<00:03:33.990> surface<00:03:34.380> shader<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:34.680> I

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
of this I had was a surface shader and I

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.530 
of this I had was a surface shader and I
just<00:03:34.980> I<00:03:35.160> just<00:03:35.280> wanted<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:35.970> simplest<00:03:36.300> thing<00:03:36.450> I

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
just I just wanted the simplest thing I

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.960 
just I just wanted the simplest thing I
could<00:03:36.750> to<00:03:36.840> display<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:37.320> effect<00:03:37.590> here<00:03:37.820> so<00:03:38.820> okay

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
could to display the effect here so okay

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.750 
could to display the effect here so okay
we<00:03:39.240> have<00:03:39.330> that<00:03:39.570> and<00:03:40.010> i<00:03:41.010> will<00:03:41.340> delete<00:03:41.490> this

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
we have that and i will delete this

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.950 
we have that and i will delete this
actually<00:03:42.180> were<00:03:42.240> going<00:03:42.360> to<00:03:42.420> go<00:03:42.480> ahead<00:03:42.600> and<00:03:42.840> just

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.960 
actually were going to go ahead and just

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.690 
actually were going to go ahead and just
deep<00:03:43.290> copy<00:03:43.530> all<00:03:43.830> of<00:03:43.860> these<00:03:44.130> independently

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
deep copy all of these independently

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.210 
deep copy all of these independently
individually<00:03:45.650> it<00:03:46.650> going<00:03:46.830> to<00:03:46.890> have<00:03:46.980> to<00:03:47.070> do<00:03:47.190> this

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
individually it going to have to do this

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.820 
individually it going to have to do this
one<00:03:47.520> at<00:03:47.550> a<00:03:47.670> time<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:48.090> way<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.330> script<00:03:48.570> works

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
one at a time the way the script works

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.480 
one at a time the way the script works
should<00:03:49.830> make<00:03:50.010> it<00:03:50.040> nicer<00:03:50.400> when<00:03:50.580> these<00:03:50.730> days

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
should make it nicer when these days

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:58.090 
should make it nicer when these days
dvdfab<00:03:53.490> easy

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.100 

and<00:03:59.100> I'm<00:03:59.220> just<00:03:59.370> going<00:03:59.490> to<00:03:59.610> create<00:03:59.850> an<00:04:00.660> NT<00:04:00.930> game

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
and I'm just going to create an NT game

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.830 
and I'm just going to create an NT game
object<00:04:01.560> for<00:04:01.680> storage<00:04:02.070> of<00:04:02.310> this<00:04:02.640> protects<00:04:03.150> all

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
object for storage of this protects all

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.020 
object for storage of this protects all
areas<00:04:04.170> and<00:04:06.530> I<00:04:07.530> don't<00:04:08.310> know<00:04:08.520> what<00:04:08.850> happened

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
areas and I don't know what happened

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.700 
areas and I don't know what happened
there<00:04:09.510> it<00:04:09.630> looks<00:04:09.780> like<00:04:09.870> I<00:04:09.990> click<00:04:10.380> on<00:04:10.500> one<00:04:10.680> of

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:10.710 
there it looks like I click on one of

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.040 
there it looks like I click on one of
these<00:04:10.830> things<00:04:11.070> twice<00:04:11.280> probably<00:04:12.050> terrible

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
these things twice probably terrible

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:19.699 
these things twice probably terrible
things<00:04:16.280> yeah<00:04:17.280> that<00:04:18.209> doesn't<00:04:18.390> look<00:04:18.570> great<00:04:18.720> um

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
things yeah that doesn't look great um

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.220 
things yeah that doesn't look great um
hold<00:04:20.549> on<00:04:20.609> I<00:04:20.670> think<00:04:20.910> we<00:04:20.970> just<00:04:21.090> have<00:04:21.239> too<00:04:21.420> many

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.510 

let's<00:04:25.230> pretend<00:04:25.650> that<00:04:25.830> that<00:04:25.950> goes<00:04:26.160> up<00:04:26.310> there

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
let's pretend that that goes up there

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.460 
let's pretend that that goes up there
sure<00:04:26.970> it<00:04:27.090> does<00:04:28.310> right<00:04:29.310> not<00:04:29.940> really<00:04:30.260> sure<00:04:31.260> what

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
sure it does right not really sure what

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.780 
sure it does right not really sure what
that<00:04:31.500> was<00:04:31.650> but<00:04:31.830> I'm<00:04:32.130> just<00:04:32.250> going<00:04:32.430> for<00:04:32.640> it<00:04:32.990> um

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
that was but I'm just going for it um

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.160 
that was but I'm just going for it um
light<00:04:35.790> meant<00:04:35.970> to<00:04:36.060> vertex<00:04:36.330> color<00:04:36.630> on<00:04:36.870> each<00:04:36.900> of

light meant to vertex color on each of

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.420 
light meant to vertex color on each of
you<00:04:37.290> actually<00:04:37.530> you<00:04:37.950> know<00:04:38.070> one<00:04:38.220> thing<00:04:38.400> about

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
you actually you know one thing about

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.620 
you actually you know one thing about
this<00:04:38.760> script<00:04:38.910> that's<00:04:39.090> kind<00:04:39.330> of<00:04:39.360> convenient

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
this script that's kind of convenient

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.790 
this script that's kind of convenient
unlike<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:40.110> deep<00:04:40.260> cough<00:04:40.410> but<00:04:40.560> you<00:04:40.650> can<00:04:40.770> just

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
unlike the deep cough but you can just

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.200 
unlike the deep cough but you can just
do<00:04:40.980> a<00:04:41.010> whole<00:04:41.220> bunch<00:04:41.400> of<00:04:41.520> one<00:04:41.700> so<00:04:41.850> I'm<00:04:41.940> at<00:04:42.090> the

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
do a whole bunch of one so I'm at the

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.270 
do a whole bunch of one so I'm at the
vertex<00:04:42.480> color<00:04:42.750> and<00:04:43.020> now<00:04:43.770> if<00:04:43.920> we<00:04:44.040> put<00:04:44.190> this

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
vertex color and now if we put this

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.650 
vertex color and now if we put this
debug<00:04:44.610> vertex<00:04:45.030> color<00:04:45.330> on<00:04:45.510> them<00:04:45.660> individually

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
debug vertex color on them individually

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.780 
debug vertex color on them individually
this<00:04:48.660> is<00:04:48.990> what<00:04:49.530> the<00:04:49.680> vertex<00:04:50.100> data<00:04:50.340> for<00:04:50.700> that

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
this is what the vertex data for that

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.850 
this is what the vertex data for that
whole<00:04:50.970> scene<00:04:51.300> actually<00:04:51.960> looks<00:04:52.380> like<00:04:52.530> this<00:04:52.710> is

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
whole scene actually looks like this is

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.860 
whole scene actually looks like this is
what<00:04:53.010> that<00:04:53.130> gee<00:04:53.310> I<00:04:53.340> was<00:04:53.790> sort<00:04:54.420> of<00:04:54.450> stored<00:04:54.720> as

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
what that gee I was sort of stored as

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.350 
what that gee I was sort of stored as
and<00:04:55.080> these<00:04:55.200> again<00:04:55.470> of<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:55.770> prepared<00:04:56.730> shaders

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
and these again of the prepared shaders

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.830 
and these again of the prepared shaders
that<00:04:57.630> include<00:04:58.610> support<00:04:59.610> for<00:05:00.950> per<00:05:01.950> vertex

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
that include support for per vertex

that include support for per vertex
lightmap<00:05:03.840> transfer<00:05:04.380> data<00:05:05.300> so<00:05:06.300> here's<00:05:06.570> your

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
lightmap transfer data so here's your

lightmap transfer data so here's your
scene<00:05:07.140> has<00:05:07.680> rendered<00:05:08.750> rather<00:05:09.750> my<00:05:09.990> right<00:05:10.169> eye

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
scene has rendered rather my right eye

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.690 
scene has rendered rather my right eye
looks<00:05:10.800> like<00:05:11.100> that's<00:05:11.250> maybe<00:05:13.610> could<00:05:14.610> that

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
looks like that's maybe could that

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.030 
looks like that's maybe could that
possibly<00:05:14.820> be<00:05:15.120> the<00:05:15.300> mission<00:05:15.630> oh<00:05:16.820> yeah<00:05:17.820> sorry<00:05:18.419> I

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
possibly be the mission oh yeah sorry I

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.790 
possibly be the mission oh yeah sorry I
don't<00:05:20.040> look<00:05:20.160> about<00:05:20.550> that<00:05:20.700> bad<00:05:21.680> sorry<00:05:22.680> I'm<00:05:22.770> just

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
don't look about that bad sorry I'm just

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.560 
don't look about that bad sorry I'm just
kind<00:05:23.040> of<00:05:23.070> surprised<00:05:23.340> it<00:05:23.520> came<00:05:23.550> out<00:05:23.820> so<00:05:24.030> well<00:05:24.300> um

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
kind of surprised it came out so well um

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:25.970 
kind of surprised it came out so well um
but<00:05:25.169> of<00:05:25.260> course<00:05:25.410> it's<00:05:25.530> really<00:05:25.710> not<00:05:25.800> all<00:05:25.860> that

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
but of course it's really not all that

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.440 
but of course it's really not all that
good<00:05:26.220> and<00:05:26.340> you<00:05:26.400> can<00:05:26.520> see<00:05:26.610> there's<00:05:26.790> lots<00:05:27.300> of

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
good and you can see there's lots of

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.570 
good and you can see there's lots of
problems<00:05:27.660> and<00:05:27.960> stuff<00:05:28.140> in<00:05:28.320> here<00:05:28.430> really<00:05:29.430> just

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
problems and stuff in here really just

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.400 
problems and stuff in here really just
the<00:05:29.669> resolution<00:05:30.090> isn't<00:05:30.210> very<00:05:30.450> high<00:05:30.570> but<00:05:31.350> that

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
the resolution isn't very high but that

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.830 
the resolution isn't very high but that
would<00:05:31.530> probably<00:05:31.560> be<00:05:31.890> true<00:05:32.160> of<00:05:32.430> the<00:05:32.910> vertex<00:05:33.419> the

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
would probably be true of the vertex the

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.270 
would probably be true of the vertex the

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
other example you just you need you know

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:39.409

I<00:05:39.510> didn't<00:05:39.810> really<00:05:40.080> come<00:05:40.290> out<00:05:40.350> that<00:05:40.590> badly<00:05:40.770> at

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
I didn't really come out that badly at

I didn't really come out that badly at
all<00:05:41.070> honestly<00:05:41.340> pacu<00:05:41.850> I'm<00:05:41.970> surprised<00:05:42.860> this<00:05:43.860> is

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
all honestly pacu I'm surprised this is

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:45.890 
all honestly pacu I'm surprised this is

test led to this little bit to

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.510 
test led to this little bit to

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
illustrate this but there you go this is

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.100

with these a little slider that you

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.740 
with these a little slider that you

change that constant and obviously it's

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.420 
change that constant and obviously it's

not want to use a slider for this you

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.650 
not want to use a slider for this you
would<00:06:38.040> probably<00:06:38.400> want<00:06:38.430> somewhere<00:06:39.060> to<00:06:39.120> define

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:49.310 
a PC and then you publish to iPhone

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.830 
a PC and then you publish to iPhone
apparently<00:06:50.310> that<00:06:50.340> value<00:06:50.820> will<00:06:51.000> change<00:06:51.030> and<00:06:51.630> it

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 
apparently that value will change and it

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.750 
apparently that value will change and it
really<00:06:52.350> should<00:06:52.620> be<00:06:52.650> specified<00:06:53.250> globally<00:06:53.640> for

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:53.760 
really should be specified globally for

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.460 
really should be specified globally for
the<00:06:53.850> entire<00:06:54.120> project<00:06:54.390> so<00:06:54.720> the<00:06:54.810> shader<00:06:55.050> slider

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:55.470 
the entire project so the shader slider

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.410 
the entire project so the shader slider
that<00:06:56.310> this<00:06:56.490> that<00:06:56.670> comes<00:06:56.820> with<00:06:56.940> this<00:06:57.000> project

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:57.420 
that this that comes with this project

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.120 
that this that comes with this project
that's<00:06:57.900> great<00:06:58.140> for<00:06:58.290> testing<00:06:58.650> but<00:06:58.800> it's<00:06:58.920> not

00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.130 
that's great for testing but it's not

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:00.920 
that's great for testing but it's not
very<00:06:59.370> good<00:06:59.490> for<00:06:59.670> actual<00:07:00.210> work<00:07:00.390> you<00:07:00.600> would<00:07:00.720> even

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:00.930 
very good for actual work you would even

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.750 
very good for actual work you would even
for<00:07:01.170> actual<00:07:01.440> production<00:07:01.860> purposes<00:07:02.250> want<00:07:02.670> to

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:02.760 
for actual production purposes want to

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.770 
for actual production purposes want to
store<00:07:02.940> that<00:07:03.090> as<00:07:03.240> a<00:07:03.270> global<00:07:03.630> variable

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:03.780 
store that as a global variable

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.460 
store that as a global variable
somewhere<00:07:04.350> in<00:07:04.410> the<00:07:04.500> project<00:07:05.690> but<00:07:06.690> uh<00:07:06.750> yeah

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:07.470 
somewhere in the project but uh yeah

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.180 
somewhere in the project but uh yeah
there<00:07:07.800> you<00:07:07.860> go<00:07:07.890> that's<00:07:09.500> very<00:07:10.500> very<00:07:10.710> very<00:07:11.010> very

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:11.190 
there you go that's very very very very

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:14.810 
there you go that's very very very very
fast<00:07:12.650> you<00:07:13.650> know<00:07:13.770> vertex<00:07:14.190> fragment<00:07:14.640> shader

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:14.820 
fast you know vertex fragment shader

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.170 
fast you know vertex fragment shader
that<00:07:15.590> did<00:07:16.590> a<00:07:16.680> pretty<00:07:16.920> decent<00:07:17.100> job<00:07:17.310> of<00:07:17.490> copying

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.180 
that did a pretty decent job of copying

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.900 
that did a pretty decent job of copying
beasts<00:07:18.690> you<00:07:19.380> know<00:07:19.500> global<00:07:20.220> illumination<00:07:20.340> and

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:20.910 
beasts you know global illumination and

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.850 
beasts you know global illumination and
ambient<00:07:21.210> occlusion<00:07:21.330> data<00:07:21.720> over<00:07:22.440> to<00:07:22.560> vertex

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:22.860 
ambient occlusion data over to vertex

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.030 
ambient occlusion data over to vertex
colors<00:07:23.250> hope<00:07:24.180> it's<00:07:24.330> useful<00:07:24.420> and<00:07:24.810> I<00:07:25.230> need<00:07:25.410> to<00:07:25.560> do

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:26.040 
colors hope it's useful and I need to do

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.530 
colors hope it's useful and I need to do
the<00:07:26.190> last<00:07:26.340> video<00:07:26.550> to<00:07:26.820> have<00:07:27.030> a<00:07:27.060> bunch<00:07:27.150> of<00:07:27.270> audio

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:27.540 
the last video to have a bunch of audio

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.080 
the last video to have a bunch of audio
cut<00:07:27.720> out<00:07:27.840> so<00:07:28.020> I'm<00:07:28.110> gonna<00:07:28.280> be<00:07:29.280> real<00:07:29.490> quiet<00:07:29.820> and

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:30.090 
cut out so I'm gonna be real quiet and

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:34.010 
cut out so I'm gonna be real quiet and
then<00:07:30.720> this<00:07:31.020> very<00:07:31.650> slowly
