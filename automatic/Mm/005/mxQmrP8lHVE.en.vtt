00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
in our bucky class so right now we have

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.370 
in our bucky class so right now we have
an<00:00:08.490> animation<00:00:08.790> class<00:00:09.210> it's<00:00:09.630> all<00:00:09.900> done<00:00:10.139> I

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
an animation class it's all done I

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.499 
an animation class it's all done I
promise<00:00:10.559> not<00:00:10.920> touching<00:00:11.309> it<00:00:11.400> again<00:00:11.730> we<00:00:12.420> have

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
promise not touching it again we have

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.360 
promise not touching it again we have
our<00:00:12.660> screen<00:00:12.900> manager<00:00:13.349> class<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.860> manage<00:00:14.190> our

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
our screen manager class to manage our

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.580 
our screen manager class to manage our
screen<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:14.940> now<00:00:15.509> we<00:00:15.570> have<00:00:15.870> our<00:00:15.990> Bucky<00:00:16.320> class

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
screen and now we have our Bucky class

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.590 
screen and now we have our Bucky class
with<00:00:16.859> our<00:00:16.980> main<00:00:17.220> method<00:00:17.789> in<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.060> there<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.510> this

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
with our main method in it there is this

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.700 
with our main method in it there is this
properly<00:00:18.930> named<00:00:19.080> something<00:00:19.320> differ<00:00:19.560> because

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
properly named something differ because

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.900 
properly named something differ because
your<00:00:20.039> name<00:00:20.220> isn't<00:00:20.369> monkey

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
your name isn't monkey

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.630 
your name isn't monkey
now<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.449> already<00:00:21.890> filled<00:00:22.890> in<00:00:23.039> some<00:00:23.250> stuff<00:00:23.490> for

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
now I already filled in some stuff for

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.490 
now I already filled in some stuff for
you<00:00:23.760> not<00:00:24.689> waste<00:00:24.930> any<00:00:25.199> time

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
it's pretty much just our main method I

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.689 
it's pretty much just our main method I
created<00:00:28.140> an<00:00:28.260> object<00:00:28.439> for<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.099> class<00:00:29.400> and

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
created an object for this class and

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.730 
created an object for this class and
called<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.029> run<00:00:30.210> method<00:00:30.420> which<00:00:31.080> we<00:00:31.260> are<00:00:31.590> going

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
called the run method which we are going

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.069 
called the run method which we are going
to<00:00:31.859> be<00:00:31.949> building<00:00:32.160> later<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:33.329> now<00:00:33.360> let's<00:00:33.930> go

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
to be building later so now let's go

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.110 
to be building later so now let's go
ahead<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.530> outside<00:00:35.040> your<00:00:35.219> main<00:00:35.460> method<00:00:35.820> again

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
ahead and outside your main method again

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.510 
ahead and outside your main method again
don't<00:00:36.809> forget<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.380> need<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.680> be<00:00:37.829> outside<00:00:38.370> your

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
don't forget you need to be outside your

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.130 
don't forget you need to be outside your
main<00:00:38.700> method<00:00:38.879> but<00:00:39.210> inside<00:00:39.540> your<00:00:39.660> bucket<00:00:39.960> class

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
main method but inside your bucket class

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.790 
main method but inside your bucket class
though<00:00:40.379> let's<00:00:40.770> go<00:00:40.920> ahead<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.309> do<00:00:41.430> some<00:00:41.640> things

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
though let's go ahead and do some things

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.770 
though let's go ahead and do some things
okay<00:00:43.800> take<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.430> breath<00:00:44.670> first<00:00:45.390> we're<00:00:45.600> going<00:00:45.690> to

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
okay take a breath first we're going to

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.510 
okay take a breath first we're going to
create<00:00:46.170> three<00:00:47.360> objects<00:00:48.710> animation<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.860> because

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
create three objects animation a because

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.060 
create three objects animation a because
remember<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:51.210> had<00:00:51.510> an<00:00:51.660> animation<00:00:52.050> class<00:00:52.410> so

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
remember I had an animation class so

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.729 
remember I had an animation class so
we're<00:00:53.309> going<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.550> create<00:00:53.910> an<00:00:54.030> object<00:00:54.500> after<00:00:55.500> we

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
we're going to create an object after we

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.599 
we're going to create an object after we
changes<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.430> private<00:00:57.829> to<00:00:58.829> access<00:00:59.489> our

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
changes the private to access our

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.719 
changes the private to access our
animation<00:01:00.149> class<00:01:00.359> done<00:01:01.879> private<00:01:04.729> screen

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
animation class done private screen

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.880 
animation class done private screen
manager<00:01:06.180> s<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.930> now<00:01:07.080> we<00:01:07.140> can<00:01:07.350> access<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
manager s so now we can access the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.130 
manager s so now we can access the
methods<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.340> our<00:01:08.490> screen<00:01:08.820> manager<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:09.930> a

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
methods in our screen manager this is a

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.420 
methods in our screen manager this is a
little<00:01:10.439> too<00:01:10.619> easy

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.300 

private<00:01:14.430> image<00:01:15.420> BG<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.320> what<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.159> going

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
private image BG and what this is going

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.550 
private image BG and what this is going
to<00:01:17.369> do<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.759> going<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.750> be<00:01:18.900> our<00:01:19.020> background

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560

to do is going to be our background
image<00:01:19.710> or<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.880> gradient<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.630> had<00:01:21.900> from

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
image or that gradient that I had from

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.570 
image or that gradient that I had from
less<00:01:22.350> stores<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.860> didn't<00:01:23.070> change<00:01:23.310> it

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
less stores I didn't change it

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.420 
less stores I didn't change it
I<00:01:23.610> kept<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.150> since<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.450> was<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:24.720> awesome<00:01:25.400> so<00:01:26.400> now

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.270 
I kept it since it was so awesome so now
after<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.840> only<00:01:28.080> thing<00:01:28.259> we<00:01:28.619> really<00:01:28.650> need

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
after this the only thing we really need

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.749 
after this the only thing we really need
is<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:30.240> list<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.930> display<00:01:31.619> modes<00:01:31.920> now<00:01:32.430> I'm<00:01:32.549> going

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
is a list of display modes now I'm going

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.539 
is a list of display modes now I'm going
to<00:01:32.820> give<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.119> six<00:01:33.450> default<00:01:34.320> display<00:01:34.979> modes<00:01:35.250> and

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
to give it six default display modes and

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.609 
to give it six default display modes and
what<00:01:36.090> it's<00:01:36.299> going<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.509> do<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:37.049> take<00:01:37.350> those

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
what it's going to do is take those

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.980 
what it's going to do is take those
modes<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.490> match<00:01:38.970> them<00:01:39.210> up<00:01:39.329> against<00:01:39.750> the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
modes and match them up against the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.679 
modes and match them up against the
graphic<00:01:40.590> card<00:01:40.829> modes<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.759> when<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.270> finds<00:01:42.479> one

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
graphic card modes and when it finds one

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.660 
graphic card modes and when it finds one
that<00:01:42.840> matches<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.470> going<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.829> take<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.280> out<00:01:44.430> and

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
that matches is going to take it out and

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.090 
that matches is going to take it out and
it's<00:01:45.479> going<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.720> use<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:46.110> one<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.770> let's<00:01:46.950> go

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
it's going to use that one so let's go

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.560 
it's going to use that one so let's go
ahead<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.430> put<00:01:47.610> private<00:01:48.570> static<00:01:49.470> final

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
ahead and put private static final

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.649 
ahead and put private static final
display<00:01:51.570> mode<00:01:52.369> will<00:01:53.369> name<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.549> modes<00:01:53.909> one<00:01:54.420> or

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
display mode will name it modes one or

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.389 
display mode will name it modes one or
something<00:01:54.990> like<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.770> it's<00:01:56.040> going<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.280> be

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
something like that and it's going to be

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.520 
something like that and it's going to be
an<00:01:56.520> array<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:57.119> told<00:01:57.600> listen<00:01:57.990> array<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.350> same

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
an array I told listen array the same

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.690 
an array I told listen array the same
thing<00:01:59.060> just<00:02:00.060> get<00:02:00.180> used<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.540> new<00:02:01.290> or<00:02:01.700> excuse

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
thing just get used to it new or excuse

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.840 
thing just get used to it new or excuse
me

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
me

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.969 
me
the<00:02:03.149> first<00:02:03.420> element<00:02:03.899> in<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.049> array<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:04.649> going

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
the first element in the array is going

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.120 
the first element in the array is going
to<00:02:05.159> be<00:02:05.280> our<00:02:05.369> first<00:02:05.579> display<00:02:06.000> mode

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
to be our first display mode

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.880 
to be our first display mode
new<00:02:08.130> display<00:02:08.789> mode<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:10.380> settings<00:02:10.709> for

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
new display mode and the settings for

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.800 
new display mode and the settings for
this<00:02:11.039> one<00:02:11.250> are<00:02:11.430> going<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.700> be<00:02:12.170> 800<00:02:13.170> by<00:02:13.950> 600<00:02:14.810> 32

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
this one are going to be 800 by 600 32

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.400 
this one are going to be 800 by 600 32
bits<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:17.060> zero<00:02:18.830> so<00:02:19.830> let's<00:02:19.860> go<00:02:20.220> ahead<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:21.410> copy

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
bits and zero so let's go ahead and copy

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.890 
bits and zero so let's go ahead and copy
this<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.980> let's<00:02:23.520> go<00:02:23.700> ahead<00:02:23.819> and<00:02:24.150> duplicate<00:02:24.720> it

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
this and let's go ahead and duplicate it

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.330 
this and let's go ahead and duplicate it
two<00:02:25.319> more<00:02:25.440> times

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
two more times

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.370 
two more times
same<00:02:26.850> resolution<00:02:27.510> but<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.720> bit<00:02:27.989> depth<00:02:28.230> is

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
same resolution but the bit depth is

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:36.170 
same resolution but the bit depth is
going<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.770> be<00:02:28.890> 24<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:30.860> 16<00:02:33.050> now<00:02:34.050> 26<00:02:34.620> 16<00:02:35.220> so<00:02:35.940> now

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
going to be 24 and 16 now 26 16 so now

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.960 
going to be 24 and 16 now 26 16 so now
we<00:02:37.110> need<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.350> put<00:02:37.500> commas<00:02:37.950> in<00:02:38.100> there<00:02:38.340> instead

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
we need to put commas in there instead

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.340 
we need to put commas in there instead
of<00:02:39.120> colons<00:02:39.959> because<00:02:40.830> that<00:02:41.160> is<00:02:41.310> just<00:02:41.489> silly<00:02:42.350> and

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
of colons because that is just silly and

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.920 
of colons because that is just silly and
actually<00:02:43.680> we<00:02:43.769> can<00:02:43.890> put<00:02:44.480> semicolon<00:02:45.480> down<00:02:45.630> here

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
actually we can put semicolon down here

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.150 
actually we can put semicolon down here
and<00:02:46.110> now<00:02:47.100> let's<00:02:47.459> do<00:02:47.610> this<00:02:47.790> for<00:02:48.300> 3<00:02:48.989> more<00:02:49.230> display

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
and now let's do this for 3 more display

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.190 
and now let's do this for 3 more display
modes<00:02:50.430> so<00:02:51.239> these<00:02:51.930> are<00:02:52.110> all<00:02:52.230> going<00:02:52.319> to<00:02:52.410> be<00:02:54.200> 640

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
modes so these are all going to be 640

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.430 
modes so these are all going to be 640
by<00:02:55.860> 480<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.880> I'm<00:02:57.300> doing<00:02:57.630> these<00:02:57.810> because<00:02:58.080> these

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
by 480 and I'm doing these because these

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.250 
by 480 and I'm doing these because these
are<00:02:58.590> common<00:02:59.100> display<00:02:59.819> modes<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.330> just<00:03:01.110> copy

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
are common display modes and just copy

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:08.240 
are common display modes and just copy
this<00:03:02.060> two<00:03:03.060> more<00:03:03.209> times<00:03:03.269> and<00:03:06.830> you<00:03:07.830> just<00:03:07.890> can't

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
this two more times and you just can't

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.160 
this two more times and you just can't
like<00:03:08.459> make<00:03:08.700> your<00:03:08.880> own<00:03:09.060> custom<00:03:09.540> display<00:03:09.690> modes

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
like make your own custom display modes

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.870 
like make your own custom display modes
since<00:03:10.769> it's<00:03:10.950> going<00:03:11.070> to<00:03:11.130> be<00:03:11.250> comparing<00:03:11.760> it

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
since it's going to be comparing it

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.610 
since it's going to be comparing it
against<00:03:12.239> a<00:03:12.269> graphics<00:03:12.660> card<00:03:12.750> you<00:03:13.049> usually<00:03:13.230> want

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
against a graphics card you usually want

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.699 
against a graphics card you usually want
to<00:03:13.650> put<00:03:13.860> in<00:03:14.010> ones<00:03:14.579> that<00:03:14.790> are<00:03:15.000> rather<00:03:15.480> common<00:03:16.079> so

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
to put in ones that are rather common so

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.580 
to put in ones that are rather common so
now<00:03:16.890> we<00:03:16.950> have<00:03:17.310> this<00:03:17.459> array<00:03:17.780> called<00:03:18.780> modes<00:03:19.200> and

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
now we have this array called modes and

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.690 
now we have this array called modes and
it<00:03:20.010> stores<00:03:20.310> 6<00:03:21.000> very<00:03:21.660> common<00:03:22.230> display<00:03:22.799> modes<00:03:23.040> so

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
it stores 6 very common display modes so

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.690 
it stores 6 very common display modes so
at<00:03:24.540> least<00:03:24.989> one<00:03:25.590> of<00:03:25.739> these<00:03:25.890> should<00:03:26.489> match<00:03:26.670> up

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
at least one of these should match up

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.000 
at least one of these should match up
against<00:03:27.180> your<00:03:27.329> graphics<00:03:27.690> card<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.170> when<00:03:28.739> this

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
against your graphics card and when this

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.130 
against your graphics card and when this
mode<00:03:29.250> matches<00:03:30.060> up<00:03:30.209> against<00:03:30.540> your<00:03:30.690> graphics

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
mode matches up against your graphics

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.110 
mode matches up against your graphics
card<00:03:31.380> that's<00:03:31.890> going<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.310> be<00:03:32.400> a<00:03:32.430> display<00:03:32.910> mode

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
card that's going to be a display mode

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.580 
card that's going to be a display mode
that's<00:03:33.450> going<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:33.690> be<00:03:33.780> used<00:03:34.110> when<00:03:34.440> they're

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
that's going to be used when they're

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.140 
that's going to be used when they're
playing<00:03:34.829> the<00:03:34.950> game<00:03:35.070> and<00:03:35.430> you're<00:03:35.970> saying

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
playing the game and you're saying

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.240 
playing the game and you're saying
alright<00:03:36.480> what<00:03:36.989> if<00:03:37.109> all<00:03:37.380> of<00:03:37.590> these<00:03:37.769> match<00:03:38.220> up

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
alright what if all of these match up

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.979 
alright what if all of these match up
well<00:03:38.880> then<00:03:39.180> it's<00:03:39.329> just<00:03:39.390> going<00:03:39.630> to<00:03:39.690> take<00:03:39.870> the

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
well then it's just going to take the

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.830 
well then it's just going to take the
first<00:03:40.170> one<00:03:40.320> that<00:03:40.560> matches<00:03:40.920> up<00:03:41.040> so<00:03:41.480> now<00:03:42.480> that<00:03:42.570> we

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
first one that matches up so now that we

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.680 
first one that matches up so now that we
have<00:03:43.079> pretty<00:03:43.920> much<00:03:44.070> three<00:03:44.519> variables<00:03:45.030> in<00:03:45.209> an

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
have pretty much three variables in an

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.590 
have pretty much three variables in an
array<00:03:46.019> of<00:03:46.049> display<00:03:46.650> modes<00:03:47.180> stain<00:03:48.180> that<00:03:48.359> up<00:03:48.510> a

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
array of display modes stain that up a

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.479 
array of display modes stain that up a
little<00:03:48.780> bit<00:03:48.959> we<00:03:49.440> can<00:03:49.560> move<00:03:49.769> on<00:03:49.920> to<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:50.220> next

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
little bit we can move on to the next

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.330 
little bit we can move on to the next
part<00:03:50.940> of<00:03:51.120> our<00:03:51.299> tutorial<00:03:51.840> and<00:03:52.019> the<00:03:52.890> first<00:03:53.160> thing

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
part of our tutorial and the first thing

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.539 
part of our tutorial and the first thing
we<00:03:53.489> want<00:03:53.670> to<00:03:53.730> do<00:03:53.910> is<00:03:54.650> go<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:55.680> method<00:03:56.130> that<00:03:56.280> loads

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
we want to do is go to method that loads

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.580 
we want to do is go to method that loads
images<00:03:57.180> and<00:03:57.390> adds<00:03:57.870> scenes<00:03:58.470> to<00:03:58.980> our<00:03:59.070> movie<00:03:59.430> so

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
images and adds scenes to our movie so

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.530 
images and adds scenes to our movie so
load<00:04:01.590> images<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:02.670> add<00:04:03.260> scenes<00:04:04.260> and<00:04:05.390> why<00:04:06.390> only

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
load images and add scenes and why only

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.539 
load images and add scenes and why only
spell<00:04:06.780> two<00:04:06.900> things<00:04:07.109> are<00:04:07.290> on<00:04:07.380> method<00:04:07.739> load<00:04:08.459> and

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
spell two things are on method load and

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.930 
spell two things are on method load and
see<00:04:11.549> it's<00:04:11.730> just<00:04:12.000> like<00:04:12.060> that<00:04:12.470> so<00:04:13.470> we'll<00:04:13.590> go

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
see it's just like that so we'll go

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.219 
see it's just like that so we'll go
public<00:04:15.049> void<00:04:16.220> load<00:04:17.419> images<00:04:18.419> I<00:04:18.690> can<00:04:18.930> take<00:04:19.080> any

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
public void load images I can take any

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.090 
public void load images I can take any
parameters

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
parameters

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.520 
parameters
and<00:04:20.700> once<00:04:21.300> I<00:04:21.390> scroll<00:04:21.720> down<00:04:21.750> we're<00:04:22.320> going<00:04:22.440> to

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
and once I scroll down we're going to

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.510 
and once I scroll down we're going to
set<00:04:22.680> that<00:04:22.710> background<00:04:23.600> equal<00:04:24.600> to<00:04:24.810> new<00:04:25.520> image

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
set that background equal to new image

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.590 
set that background equal to new image
icon<00:04:27.420> and<00:04:27.750> then<00:04:28.410> again<00:04:28.770> we<00:04:28.980> put<00:04:29.220> the<00:04:29.600> always

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
icon and then again we put the always

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.110 
icon and then again we put the always
called<00:04:30.840> directory<00:04:31.470> or<00:04:31.650> file<00:04:31.920> path<00:04:32.220> and<00:04:32.520> mine

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
called directory or file path and mine

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.840 
called directory or file path and mine
was<00:04:33.300> in<00:04:33.480> C<00:04:33.780> and<00:04:34.080> it<00:04:35.010> was<00:04:35.160> in<00:04:35.280> a<00:04:35.310> folder<00:04:35.610> called

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
was in C and it was in a folder called

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.610 
was in C and it was in a folder called
test<00:04:35.910> and<00:04:36.420> it<00:04:36.690> was<00:04:36.810> called<00:04:37.080> I<00:04:37.200> think<00:04:37.440> it<00:04:37.500> was

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
test and it was called I think it was

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.980 
test and it was called I think it was
called<00:04:37.800> back<00:04:38.010> dot<00:04:38.460> JPEG<00:04:39.390> I'm<00:04:39.570> pretty<00:04:39.810> sure

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
called back dot JPEG I'm pretty sure

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.700 
called back dot JPEG I'm pretty sure
that's<00:04:40.110> what<00:04:40.320> it's<00:04:40.470> called

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
that's what it's called

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.340 
that's what it's called
and<00:04:40.830> now<00:04:41.310> we<00:04:41.370> just<00:04:41.580> have<00:04:41.790> to<00:04:41.820> get<00:04:43.850> the<00:04:44.850> image

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
and now we just have to get the image

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.040 
and now we just have to get the image
from<00:04:46.350> that<00:04:46.410> file<00:04:47.070> and<00:04:47.400> now<00:04:48.000> we<00:04:48.180> need<00:04:48.540> the<00:04:49.020> two

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
from that file and now we need the two

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.990 
from that file and now we need the two
other<00:04:49.500> ones<00:04:49.800> which<00:04:49.980> are<00:04:50.190> my<00:04:50.400> face<00:04:50.640> with<00:04:50.880> my

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
other ones which are my face with my

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.180 
other ones which are my face with my
eyes<00:04:51.300> open<00:04:51.570> in<00:04:51.900> my<00:04:52.020> face<00:04:52.230> with<00:04:52.590> my<00:04:52.710> eyes<00:04:52.860> closed

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
eyes open in my face with my eyes closed

00:04:53.190 --> 00:05:01.340 
eyes open in my face with my eyes closed
so<00:04:53.430> image<00:04:54.590> face<00:04:55.590> one<00:04:57.110> equals<00:04:58.110> new<00:05:00.110> FF<00:05:01.110> let's

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
so image face one equals new FF let's

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.930 
so image face one equals new FF let's
just<00:05:01.500> copy<00:05:01.680> this<00:05:01.890> crib<00:05:03.590> BAM<00:05:04.590> and<00:05:04.920> just<00:05:05.460> changes

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
just copy this crib BAM and just changes

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.030 
just copy this crib BAM and just changes
the<00:05:06.410> face<00:05:07.410> 1<00:05:07.860> dot<00:05:08.280> ping<00:05:09.290> let's<00:05:10.290> go<00:05:10.410> to<00:05:10.470> me<00:05:10.680> let's

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
the face 1 dot ping let's go to me let's

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.770 
the face 1 dot ping let's go to me let's
go<00:05:11.190> to<00:05:11.220> you<00:05:11.400> good<00:05:11.850> and<00:05:12.110> then<00:05:13.110> copy<00:05:13.440> this<00:05:13.740> and

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
go to you good and then copy this and

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.970 
go to you good and then copy this and
face<00:05:15.780> 2<00:05:17.180> equals<00:05:18.180> face<00:05:18.420> 2<00:05:18.720> dot<00:05:18.900> ping<00:05:19.140> I'm<00:05:19.740> pretty

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
face 2 equals face 2 dot ping I'm pretty

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.030 
face 2 equals face 2 dot ping I'm pretty
cool<00:05:20.280> how<00:05:20.430> I<00:05:20.460> did<00:05:20.760> that<00:05:20.910> on<00:05:21.180> so<00:05:21.930> now<00:05:22.140> we<00:05:22.560> loaded

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
cool how I did that on so now we loaded

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.000 
cool how I did that on so now we loaded
all<00:05:23.220> these<00:05:23.520> images<00:05:24.060> in<00:05:24.360> two<00:05:24.780> variables<00:05:25.320> so<00:05:25.530> now

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
all these images in two variables so now

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.770 
all these images in two variables so now
we<00:05:26.070> can<00:05:26.280> go<00:05:26.430> ahead<00:05:26.550> and<00:05:26.940> add<00:05:27.270> them<00:05:27.420> in<00:05:27.630> our

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
we can go ahead and add them in our

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.600 
we can go ahead and add them in our
animation<00:05:28.140> so<00:05:28.860> let's<00:05:29.010> go<00:05:29.160> ahead<00:05:29.250> and<00:05:29.370> create

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
animation so let's go ahead and create

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.800 
animation so let's go ahead and create
an<00:05:29.850> animation<00:05:30.210> object<00:05:30.450> new<00:05:32.270> animation<00:05:33.270> so<00:05:33.630> now

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
an animation object new animation so now

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.780 
an animation object new animation so now
we<00:05:33.870> can<00:05:34.110> use<00:05:34.140> our<00:05:34.590> methods<00:05:35.550> from<00:05:35.640> the

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
we can use our methods from the

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.970 
we can use our methods from the
animation<00:05:36.360> class<00:05:36.570> and<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:37.350> two<00:05:37.530> things<00:05:37.680> we

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
animation class and the two things we

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.870 
animation class and the two things we
want<00:05:38.190> to<00:05:38.250> do<00:05:38.460> is<00:05:38.670> add<00:05:39.890> scene<00:05:40.890> and<00:05:41.100> this<00:05:41.730> is

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
want to do is add scene and this is

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.490 
want to do is add scene and this is
going<00:05:42.030> to<00:05:42.090> be<00:05:42.210> the<00:05:42.570> first<00:05:42.780> thing<00:05:43.020> we<00:05:43.200> want<00:05:43.380> to

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
going to be the first thing we want to

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.520 
going to be the first thing we want to
add<00:05:43.590> is<00:05:43.770> face<00:05:44.010> 1<00:05:44.310> for<00:05:44.880> 250<00:05:45.750> milliseconds<00:05:46.350> and

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
add is face 1 for 250 milliseconds and

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.340 
add is face 1 for 250 milliseconds and
then<00:05:47.460> after<00:05:47.910> that<00:05:48.090> we<00:05:48.330> want<00:05:48.540> to<00:05:48.630> add<00:05:48.750> one<00:05:49.110> more

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
then after that we want to add one more

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.020 
then after that we want to add one more
scene<00:05:49.650> copy<00:05:50.780> phase<00:05:51.780> 2<00:05:52.170> for<00:05:52.680> 250<00:05:53.430> milliseconds

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
scene copy phase 2 for 250 milliseconds

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.060 
scene copy phase 2 for 250 milliseconds
and<00:05:54.210> we<00:05:54.780> don't<00:05:55.050> need<00:05:55.170> to<00:05:55.230> add<00:05:55.440> our<00:05:55.620> background

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
and we don't need to add our background

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.650 
and we don't need to add our background
because<00:05:56.400> our<00:05:56.610> background<00:05:56.790> is<00:05:57.210> going<00:05:57.390> to<00:05:57.450> stay

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
because our background is going to stay

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.870 
because our background is going to stay
static<00:05:58.020> these<00:05:58.740> scenes<00:05:59.130> are<00:05:59.430> going<00:05:59.610> to<00:05:59.670> be<00:05:59.760> the

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
static these scenes are going to be the

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.850 
static these scenes are going to be the
only<00:06:00.120> thing<00:06:00.330> that's<00:06:00.540> changing<00:06:01.050> on<00:06:01.230> it<00:06:01.410> so

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
only thing that's changing on it so

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.410 
only thing that's changing on it so
that's<00:06:02.130> why<00:06:02.280> we<00:06:02.460> needed<00:06:02.670> to<00:06:02.910> add<00:06:03.060> a<00:06:03.090> new

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:03.420 
that's why we needed to add a new

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.140 
that's why we needed to add a new
animation<00:06:03.690> again<00:06:04.560> we<00:06:05.310> could<00:06:05.640> add<00:06:05.880> the

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
animation again we could add the

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.180 
animation again we could add the
background<00:06:06.600> in<00:06:06.750> our<00:06:06.840> animation<00:06:07.260> but<00:06:07.740> I<00:06:07.950> mean

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
background in our animation but I mean

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.920 
background in our animation but I mean
it<00:06:08.700> would<00:06:08.850> just<00:06:08.880> take<00:06:09.120> up<00:06:09.270> too<00:06:09.450> much<00:06:09.480> space<00:06:09.780> and

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
it would just take up too much space and

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.450 
it would just take up too much space and
we're<00:06:10.350> just<00:06:10.500> going<00:06:10.650> to<00:06:10.740> have<00:06:10.860> a<00:06:10.890> stay<00:06:11.160> still

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
we're just going to have a stay still

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.580 
we're just going to have a stay still
and<00:06:11.670> add<00:06:12.420> these<00:06:12.690> scenes<00:06:13.050> because<00:06:13.380> that's

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
and add these scenes because that's

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.010 
and add these scenes because that's
what's<00:06:13.800> going<00:06:13.920> to<00:06:13.980> be<00:06:14.070> changing<00:06:14.690> so<00:06:15.690> for<00:06:15.900> now

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
what's going to be changing so for now
