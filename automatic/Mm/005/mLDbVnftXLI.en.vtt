00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.930
 Miss, I showed him the buckle of my 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:20.550
 doctor mistletoe belt calm 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.039
 Almansa is worth it because we are in 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.079
 December excuse the burned unit 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.150
 yes here is what is your name tomás 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.559
 yarrrington juju and but if it is nothing more and 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.110
 nothing less than the former governor of 

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:32.219
 Tamaulipas who brings him here does not 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.050
 tell me do not tell me the fact that the 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.820
 the US government accused him of having 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.760
 served the narco throughout his six-year term 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.460
 and later years I truly deny 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.750
 categorically sin against them 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.850
 which include crime 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.579
 organized drug money laundering 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.109
 and bank fraud not any is more 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.390
 I even think it's kind of 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.519
 record because if ex - governors are 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.230
 not even the former governor of 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:57.030
 quintana roo mario villanueva 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.309
 gringos prepared a file so 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.199
 Chonchón is obviously a 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.629
 online chase if there is yes a 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.640
 political persecution in the persecution 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.470
 what will there be now and why with the 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.690
 gringas authorities on whether with the 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.190
 sleepy Mexican authorities disque 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.350
 willing to cooperate in their detention 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.170
 Now he's going to have to jump from 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.360
 kills do not think that yes if you believe that 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.060
 because that's not the worst of the matter 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.920
 no no or the worst of the matter for you is 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.900
 that in making this accusation the 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.640
 federal prosecutors gringos gave 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.320
 know that when I accepted money for 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.870
 part of the narco to smuggle 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.370
 drugs and laundering money in the usa was not 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.250
 able to play clean even with the 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.500
 cartels that operated in Tamaulipas not 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.390
 Well, not because, according to this, you are a cupbearer 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.950
 Gulf - cartel with the cartel 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.050
 of the zetas and with the cartel of 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.229
 beltran leyva to organizations that do not 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.180
 they are very good with each other, no, no, and 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.010
 now that these groups confirm that 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.440
 while doing business with you 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.880
 he did business with his enemies 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.130
 they will surely start tracking it for 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.500
 clarify some things by making this 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.940
 story gets more interesting yes 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.590
 because now he owes him more 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.750
 worry is not when they're going to grab 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.600
 but who of all who walk it 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.399
 looking for they will do it without and to which one 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.410
 because if you find it justice is going 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.450
 to throw 30 years in prison for fraud 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.640
 bank 20 per wash and 10 per 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.680
 drug trafficking instead if they find it 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.150
 first the narcos because today and what 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.450
 punishment do you think those buddies 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.090
 apply to light 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.420
 to barbarian disappears as batman the very 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.670
 canijo nicasio which is going to put today in the 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.160
 cineclub that of Captain Phillips the 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.680
 doctor or oral is a seller of 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.940
 appliances not the doctor is a 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.190
 story that tells like a boat 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.260
 American freighter is approached by 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.230
 some Somali pirates who submit to the 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.780
 crew to pirates like jack sparrow 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.090
 so being fun, not the doctor 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.980
 pirates of adeveras of those that carrying 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.650
 automatic weapons only obey the 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.090
 orders of their frightening bosses and 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.239
 who leave then doing it of the 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.250
 captain phillips the tomás to whom 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.780
 always looks like doing it from person 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.329
 normal immersed in a situation 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.370
 extraordinary and making it from the pirate to 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.829
 evil because they have no other out 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.510
 a certain boat to pirate whoever is 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:11.090
 believe is because you believe it is because it is 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.799
 today condemned and no more salt in it does not go 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.810
 the doctor but with those enough to 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.090
 hold all the skin and then if it's worth 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.739
 worth it if the doctor is well chida 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.079
 because even though we already know how it goes 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.450
 to finish the matter the director paul 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:26.120
 greengrass who did his in 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.350
 the one of the bourne supremacy manages to count 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.630
 a story that keeps 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.300
 science at the edge of the chair no longer 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.940
 is there to eat anything the doctor already knows 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.850
 Somali typical food but what a mood 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.070
 cited so sick then miss 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.110
 going back to the subject I knew that the tradition 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:48.340
 points out that you should kiss whoever stands 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.340
 under mistletoe miss lady ok 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.250
