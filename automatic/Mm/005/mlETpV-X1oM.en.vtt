can see except doesn't want to blow it
up<00:01:14.610> there<00:01:14.880> we<00:01:15.000> go<00:01:15.150> wait<00:01:16.340> now<00:01:17.340> you're<00:01:17.640> just

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
up there we go wait now you're just

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.660 
up there we go wait now you're just
going<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.060> paint<00:01:18.950> everything<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.340> don't

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
going to paint everything that you don't

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.310 
going to paint everything that you don't
want<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.270> be<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.509> color<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.670> so<00:01:24.140> like<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.259> said

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
want to be in color and so like I said

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.440 
want to be in color and so like I said
this<00:01:25.680> image<00:01:26.070> particularly<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:26.909> easier

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
this image particularly is easier

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.630 
this image particularly is easier
because<00:01:27.720> there's<00:01:28.409> white<00:01:28.619> right<00:01:29.189> next<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.549> the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
because there's white right next to the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.310 
because there's white right next to the
red<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:31.799> makes<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.250> way<00:01:33.119> way<00:01:33.689> way<00:01:33.900> way<00:01:34.079> way

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
red so that makes it way way way way way

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.670 
red so that makes it way way way way way
easier<00:01:34.790> but<00:01:35.790> if<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.689> wanted<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.229> be<00:01:37.350> able<00:01:37.409> to

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
easier but if you wanted to be able to

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.969 
easier but if you wanted to be able to
do<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.780> on<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.810> regular<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.500> know<00:01:40.590> an<00:01:40.710> image

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
do it on a regular you know an image

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.440 
do it on a regular you know an image
with<00:01:41.130> some<00:01:41.310> smaller<00:01:41.640> detail<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.180> just<00:01:42.360> hit

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
with some smaller detail you just hit

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.600 
with some smaller detail you just hit
your<00:01:42.540> Z<00:01:42.840> button<00:01:43.079> they're<00:01:44.009> going<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.250> zoom<00:01:44.430> in

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
your Z button they're going to zoom in

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.580 
your Z button they're going to zoom in
nice<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.030> close<00:01:45.450> let's<00:01:45.899> see<00:01:46.049> if<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.290> wasn't

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
nice and close let's see if this wasn't

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.719 
nice and close let's see if this wasn't
why<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:46.979> would<00:01:47.460> not<00:01:47.759> be<00:01:47.820> an<00:01:48.090> ideal<00:01:49.220> image<00:01:50.220> to

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
why this would not be an ideal image to

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.270 
why this would not be an ideal image to

go to these arrows over here right next

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.440 
go to these arrows over here right next
to<00:03:33.340> that<00:03:33.430> apply<00:03:33.760> you<00:03:33.819> have<00:03:34.090> to<00:03:34.180> go<00:03:34.299> two<00:03:34.359> that

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
to that apply you have to go two that

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.110 
to that apply you have to go two that
and<00:03:34.840> you<00:03:35.019> have<00:03:35.260> to<00:03:35.500> flatten<00:03:35.829> it<00:03:36.099> but<00:03:36.639> this
