 come back to your come alone video two 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.680
 new trailers the first one we go with a 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.660
 plane game jordan many you will know 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.090
 basically killer is from some game that 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.590
 it really is not yet presented 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.090
 for europe it is not known if it will come out in 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.429
 but it will be in Japan 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.080
 probably yes that they arrived in 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:17.800
 europe this year or next year but 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.900
 something play 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.490
 something later than something later than in 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.050
 japan we will surely see again 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.250
 we will closely follow this game because 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.180
 It has pretty good good painting 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.680
 term you have the description for 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.519
 explain a little bit of what is going 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:33.190
 basically you want to buy a game of 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.829
 51 you will know him by many title the 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.989
 only consensus the new book is that 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.730
 mercedes benz in many right 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.950
 has enough this that is of these two 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.559
 last thing he has named is a hack and 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.450
 slash quite promising so 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.219
 she so it looks like she has enough 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.379
 pretty good looks the protagonist is 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.149
 will call Mondo paza of 35 years and such is 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.560
 well your mission will be to kill certain 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.380
 restrictions and such 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.290
 with it basically has a kind 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.030
 of possessing a sword a sword that has 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.340
 left quite pretty well and has a 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.900
 Arm arm that will be an organic process 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.580
 that can really be used to make 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.350
 certain certain functions we can not 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.360
 see with stress shoot as if it was 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.100
 a machine gun with that arm 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.320
 we have both pretty good looking to the 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.320
 truly the game really good we will see 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.000
 to see if it is as promising as it seems or 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.280
 they have taken the best parts of the 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.320
 game that but good for now 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.840
 It looks good I hope woman or a 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.280
 we drive unity and we will follow closely 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.500
 as I say everything the same we go with the 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.780
 next link the one that basically metal 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.540
 and racing revenge and good in this 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.780
 train took several heads of the 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.950
 metal title day where we do not see 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.200
 that everyone is going to have a skill 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.720
 special and it will not be at all easy 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.640
 to beat these peculiar bosses not 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.290
 for me one of the most 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.729
 important saga metal gear though 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.830
 come back that does not have much to do with 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.150
 the great metal and so it is true that he has 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.130
 picked up several touches and one of those 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.020
 touches are the bosses that have something of 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.929
 some charisma not within them that 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.070
 they are strange by nature I have not here 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:03.620
 Well, we can see it perfect 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.380
 those weird bosses do not 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.060
 really because with a little tip and 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.250
 you know that everything that has played to the 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.959
 saga metal gear all heads or almost 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.640
 they all have something pretty enough 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.290
 special especially show about the 4 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.070
 that some that go pretty enough 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.850
 fear because some way of these in 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.850
 the video
