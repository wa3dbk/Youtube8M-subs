00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.069
 hello guys welcome this mini 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:10.920
 tourist episode number 203 3 I assume 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.650
 you are here ready to see ours 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.619
 mega reactor ready no sector ready 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.210
 guys and it's full of kloten in here 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.980
 a bang of kloten 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.109
 I did something else very much 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:28.619
 simple near here to make you wait wow 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.769
 we turn ok I did a test that 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.600
 carries from two parts with two cables the 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.969
 our noise is enough for him 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.280
 one likes to make two of them for and against 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.829
 faster minimum is two circles 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.969
 what happens now my boys I did 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.050
 yes, this stuff will take me home 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.550
 necessary brings us to the case brought the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.789
 place where I want or near to 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.050
 the necessary stuff is reactor however first 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.620
 going ahead I will need another 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.480
 What my tester guys do not act 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.100
 we can do it on paper but yes 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.960
 I assume yes yes yes as long as the card 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.609
 that the junta if for that fast 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.390
 also because I have to do a lot of testing 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:11.130
 the quartz seems simple to me 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.300
 class 94 let's do 44 let's do a 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.590
 tesla then involved in a deer hunter 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.270
 pearls and 34 and perfect erpen 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.720
 ok that has not made the molten 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.330
 previous 23 perfect we do the last 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.220
 and it will be ok place we have our face 1 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.610
 cup we go to fill it on earth 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.369
 going this way and where you have it 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.170
 watched yesterday's episode whatever 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.060
 we picked up finally been cra 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.100
 we have created our little man 12 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.690
 billions yes I know it's a bit ugly 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.820
 what precisely detail is not beautiful 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.440
 however at 0 miss it is another thing 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.660
 rather two must be said 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:50.580
 of these four ok two cases I need 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.229
 and I was telling you the thing anyway 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.030
 interesting is the fact that I have here 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.009
 still kloten type still 200,000 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.940
 then I have to take the underworld here 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.610
 pearls 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.070
 but apart from that discovered that mine 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.979
 small me no to an output and an input of 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:10.500
 12 million who is a lot crying that 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:12.090
 type it is time of 10 to the third minor 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.680
 compared to what is maximum 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.239
 so if it contains but about 12 billion 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.190
 obviously the input out will be 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.680
 those ok ice cream motels 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.910
 another frame another frame other famer 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.829
 perfect talks ok now we have it at 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.590
 fill and then complete them then 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:32.070
 let's put one behind our dear nino e 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.930
 instead we put him at home at home 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.570
 of a slogan at least for the moment i 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.120
 tester act here they are 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.910
 ok let's do those updated to 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.200
 maximum 12 perfect and then we go to 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.860
 place 1 here 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.630
 ok so we put it all right 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.310
 part guys to start right 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.709
 probably better to put it back here 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.600
 ok let's take a new course 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.180
 of the nineteenth century one hundred knox paintings 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.540
 we do both ok and have to do with queries 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:04.320
 sorry for how many boxes then 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:08.489
 accent let's do it at 300 which has 300 that 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:11.700
 it is not one but it will be 300 energy 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:14.070
 ok the yellow giambusso is fine like it for 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.160
 elia musso we reach ok giannuzzo 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.370
 we activate and say rendered with soft 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.420
 energy others 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.940
 we can also arrive safely 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.610
 perfect then rendered lonely energy will be 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.739
 active here now back to ours 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.440
 location on the moon seriously that i 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.599
 audio problems as happened a lot 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.650
 often with well of cannes when he passed by 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.769
 one world to another, however, there is no desire 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.390
 to stop ok and now in ours 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.530
 reactor who road this given guys 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.110
 I remember very well what part of the 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.750
 reactor and tom we are going to position ourselves there 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:48.430
 stuff now I have a pico problem I don't have 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:50.470
 put the exit or shit as you wait 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.849
 I put this thing in here but I don't have it 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.650
 put out 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:04:02.650
 now I will need to get off for a moment 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:04.359
 ok i'll need an energy from nothing 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.430
 card do not expect to send to take us 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:08.260
 a little energy and so I do from 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.599
 react how much heck and produces i 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.810
 our actor from first thing to 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:15.700
 my boys then migrator instead 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.889
 we kind of got it we did n't 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:22.539
 we created ok I need the power of the 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:24.970
 poverty trap ok and let's do this 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:27.460
 so simple so maybe even so 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.169
 I would do so well from so on 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.760
 this way the trap 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.160
 I hope that ancient people wo n't destroy me yours 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.780
 all I have buzzed immediately inside 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.760
 because inside to fill it thrown 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.630
 30,000 mingots in his network room 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:43.180
 these on the pacs in more or less or that here 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.889
 perfect ok effect I ca n't have me 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.460
 threw us something and announces it 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.380
 yet 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.599
 here it is, my energy, my kids 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.090
 we activate now and show you 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:54.220
 as much as it produces now it will take 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.580
 a bit for the most though given a little 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.530
 time 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.510
 ok to vary type maximum level 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.870
 than 2,500 degrees 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:04.150
 ok how the beauty of a is producing 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.770
 billion and 2 the maximum increased to 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.720
 reach are bales or with one 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.880
 temperature of 3 thousand more or less who 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:14.860
 in fact, it is not all of a very high nature 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:17.830
 and reality like having only 35 ingots 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:21.340
 it is 6 minibasket for tic che tipo 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:23.979
 a bang and is using it right now 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:27.370
 is producing a billion and looking for a 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:29.199
 best 4 rf so now yes 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.240
 motivate at the time we are gentlemen 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:34.259
 giammusso and we say that I want that 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:38.050
 send energy here 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:39.909
 ok it should now 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.150
 I sent energy into our little man 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:44.770
 and within two minutes fill it 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.960
 completely quiet guys don't 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.529
 fortunately the beer explodes of 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.879
 treasury 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:50.770
 obviously they will never put a 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:53.439
 problem because otherwise I have to lower them on 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.830
 choir to force the heat and then been 

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:58.509
 sending 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:06:00.250
 look at this is increasing by a bang 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:02.319
 look look the is coming 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.919
 maximum that it can support from within 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:05.409
 this year 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:07.210
 I also have maximum maximum that can 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:09.759
 reach a billion and a framework a 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.610
 million 4 centering 31 million and 4 rf 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:14.590
 atic my husband john billion eo mine 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.370
 god boys my energy will no longer be 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.689
 therefore a problem in the next ones 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.009
 bets we did a lot of things 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:19.690
 very beautiful and very nice so I do 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:23.469
 I recommend detention here I don't know 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:25.029
 because there was this thing ok is you are 

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:28.180
 slowly in a pretty nice way 

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:31.029
 and opi really falck share and beautiful 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:35.560
 something look here look at that cute 

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:37.479
 that kind of gabello litter like what is us 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.430
 see you in the next episode that 

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:41.529
 surely there are not 20 I don't know if there is 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.659
 I'll have the events loaded for a while 

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:44.889
 if we do both we see some guys there 

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:46.990
 let's feed video as always a nice one 

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:48.669
 like you support the series because we are

 doing some fantastic good things 

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:54.370
 ready the first Italians who make a 

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:57.939
 reactor that produces so much the former 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:59.529
 to have a 12 billion battery a 

00:06:57.939 --> 00:07:01.659
 man form of course because more 

00:06:59.529 --> 00:07:03.009
 nice then something is too good

 guys my temper see you in the 

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:06.550
 next episode of holistic rounds

 below you will also find the links to 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.159
 fragger facebook and instagram
