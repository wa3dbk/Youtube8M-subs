to<00:01:02.309> look<00:01:02.489> at<00:01:02.670> these<00:01:02.820> principles<00:01:03.449> through<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
to look at these principles through the

just about kind of maximizing utility

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.030 
just about kind of maximizing utility
and<00:01:09.180> benefit<00:01:09.659> or<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.320> there<00:01:10.500> something<00:01:10.710> bigger

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
and benefit or is there something bigger

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.179 
and benefit or is there something bigger
bigger<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.700> regard<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.210> values<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.229> household

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
bigger in regard to values and household

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.850 
bigger in regard to values and household
aspirations<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.450> people's<00:01:15.840> desires<00:01:16.439> and

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
what they think essentially the good

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.260 
what they think essentially the good
life<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:20.040> we<00:01:20.189> unpack<00:01:20.549> all<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:21.119> in

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
life is and so we unpack all of that in

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.630 
life is and so we unpack all of that in
most<00:01:21.600> all<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.810> our<00:01:22.049> classes<00:01:22.310> we're<00:01:23.310> not<00:01:23.460> just

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
most all of our classes we're not just

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.249 
most all of our classes we're not just
out<00:01:23.790> there<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.119> make<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.299> profit<00:01:24.570> although

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
out there to make a profit although

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.380 
out there to make a profit although
profits<00:01:25.710> necessary<00:01:26.250> but<00:01:26.610> we<00:01:26.759> also<00:01:26.909> want<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.330> be

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
profits necessary but we also want to be

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.260 
profits necessary but we also want to be
concerned<00:01:27.689> about<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.020> planet

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
concerned about the planet

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.410 
concerned about the planet
so<00:01:30.899> that<00:01:31.109> we<00:01:31.259> equip<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.100> student<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:33.149> leave

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
so that we equip the student to leave

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.779 
so that we equip the student to leave
here<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.020> be<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.289> productive<00:01:34.679> contributor<00:01:35.579> to
