00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.290
 very good i am the shit i have a 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.350
 store that was called sing that I 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:27.160
 dedicated to body piercing 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:31.150
 I have more or less living from that as 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:34.510
 17 18 years and I have been part of my 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.250
 life is also we have a magazine this 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.020
 where we can obviously also 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.320
 talk about tattoos topics 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.840
 perforations and we have taken out a book and 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.360
 I am a member of the pf this is a 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.840
 Association of professional drillers 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.150
 from the USA that the pure subject also 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.580
 body piercings because I think 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.930
 that for many years this has always 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.970
 been part of my life not the 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.800
 piercings the tattoos I usually see 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.610
 that has lived a little bit because 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.979
 to groupon and this there I drilled the 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.829
 goal to see rather to show 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.110
 a little bit my disagreement and then there 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:15.910
 it is faulty 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:18.640
 almost 25 years and was also a little 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:23.080
 chance because I had a bar before 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.880
 a dive and this was drilled this post 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.240
 suddenly behind the bar he had a friend 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.950
 that I was hiding in a corner and that's how it was 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.010
 also little by little until that time it arrived 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.229
 the point that being masters of the bar and then of 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.260
 suddenly then all america a little more to 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:41.430
 the music that you're bursting but 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.259
 I already looked for there was a little more safer 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.380
 then as I was already drilling as well as 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.560
 very sporadically then suddenly 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.780
 I'm still asking for people 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.580
 perforations and all that then there is 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.700
 when I started a little more professional 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:02.020
 I started buying the equipment and went on 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.899
 a 94 had chance and us twice and now 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.450
 they had years of tradition by fractions 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.690
 contemporaries I bought equipment pliers 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.940
 jewelry magazines books videos for 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.730
 report a little better and there more or 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.390
 less we started a finished handling this one 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.180
 person association seminars 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.400
 and I do see it a little different 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.500
 if he is very close where there is 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.019
 tattoo piercings and vice versa no 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:33.400
 but complement a little more the pop is 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:34.989
 different I do not think so much zeal and 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.569
 I think that what is ours maybe is not 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.269
 Therefore art is rather technical because 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.910
 wait we talk more about hygiene if 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.769
 we look for ways to make different 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.349
 type of black punching that the tattoo 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.030
 it's a little more art is more artistic by 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.280
 the same thing I think that there is a 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.510
 little more of suspicion not to see but 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.390
 obviously in all the media there are 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.549
 envies and things the perforations 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.410
 our something in this I think it's very 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.540
 important not because any power 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.400
 drilling is the easiest thing to grab 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.440
 a piece of skin proposes to that or 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.019
 anyone can do it but to be 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.690
 a professional if it influences many other 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.150
 things like customer treatment explain 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.390
 why does it go to a certain uncertain piece 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.720
 place how you have to take care of it not before 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.609
 this one after what must be done there 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.569
 to be open to listen to the 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.030
 client 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.760
 and know how everything is going to be 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.379
 written then I think there's a lot 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.879
 a lot of information that needs to be given to 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.609
 client so that you too at ease 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:36.340
 not that he does not believe that nothing else is to place 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:38.349
 a piece we are no longer causing a 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.200
 hurt then you have to treat it like 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:43.889
 such not by milestones especially as there is a 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.959
 decree that came into force for 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:50.590
 August a new regulation that is going to 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.030
 be very complete this and us 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.499
 we work with a notice on 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.650
 operation that is on behalf of the 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:58.510
 cofepris is health risks is what 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.239
 we have now and today I had to take 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:05.379
 some credentials by tattoo artist and post 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:08.230
 drilled in terms of safety and all 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:10.989
 and they will take us into account but the 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.440
 problem is that first of all with a 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.930
 share 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.959
 so we have to make a fee 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.269
 to receive the card the card of the 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.190
 credential that we're going to have not then 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.410
 is the problem many times not that 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.960
 first in what I do not and then what 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.930
 that even if it's working for the 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.690
 week we went the various studies we went 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.850
 to listen to see the news we support 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.970
 with some things as responsive 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.470
 questionnaires and all that and this seems 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.020
 that they will be calling us to 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.760
 can help them a little more, not because if 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.520
 they are on the desk and 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.640
 suddenly he does not know where two are going 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.500
 at least they called us to take 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.360
 in our opinion is because it is 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.970
 rather the practice that we have many 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.660
 more and therefore good that we are happy and not 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:02.150
 finally there will be a regularization 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:05.690
 also and this one is going to help us a lot 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.820
 good we hope as for the donation 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.289
 of blood is rather in these criteria 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.689
 of doctor many times 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.580
 because equal but officially one year 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:16.319
 you can donate blood 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.020
 but I always say a woman with 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:21.270
 his eyebrows tattooed by donating blood and 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.669
 a man with an artistic tattoo does not 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.740
 a woman considers that she is covered up 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:29.099
 a blood a man with tattooed ears 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.770
 no what is the difference not losing 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:34.349
 officially if you can we are 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:37.770
 talking about 10 to 15 people who can 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:41.909
 take the course and it will be practical and 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:45.180
 theory are going to be 20 hours and this 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:47.699
 we started on July 11 and 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.339
 We finished from August 10, 4 all 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:52.229
 Wednesdays and Saturdays but for that much 

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:55.349
 people come to the workshop is going to be very 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:57.139
 interesting and there are 300 holes 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:06:01.009
 Well, here is going to be a better space 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.009
 all July and August
