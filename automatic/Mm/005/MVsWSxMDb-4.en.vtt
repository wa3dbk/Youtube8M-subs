00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:33.029 
season for Christmas that's a good

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:34.459 
season for Christmas that's a good
character<00:05:33.270> to<00:05:33.599> ask<00:05:33.749> to<00:05:33.930> actually<00:05:34.169> come<00:05:34.379> out

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:34.469 
character to ask to actually come out

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:36.769 
character to ask to actually come out
and<00:05:34.680> give<00:05:35.009> him<00:05:35.099> a<00:05:35.159> decent<00:05:35.340> game<00:05:35.639> today<00:05:35.939> I<00:05:36.150> think

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:36.779 
and give him a decent game today I think

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:39.200 
and give him a decent game today I think
first<00:05:37.080> half<00:05:37.349> we<00:05:37.590> just<00:05:37.830> overpowered<00:05:38.460> and<00:05:38.669> I

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
first half we just overpowered and I

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.670 
first half we just overpowered and I
neither<00:05:39.479> had<00:05:39.689> the<00:05:39.749> possession<00:05:40.199> but<00:05:40.469> never

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
neither had the possession but never

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.230 
neither had the possession but never
never<00:05:41.069> really<00:05:41.310> looked<00:05:41.430> threatening<00:05:41.729> at<00:05:42.090> any

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
never really looked threatening at any

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.239 
never really looked threatening at any
point<00:05:42.449> and<00:05:42.689> then<00:05:42.779> I<00:05:42.870> answers<00:05:43.289> Randy<00:05:43.830> midfield

00:05:44.239 --> 00:05:44.249 
point and then I answers Randy midfield

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:46.640 
point and then I answers Randy midfield
and<00:05:44.849> rugged<00:05:45.360> out<00:05:45.479> front<00:05:45.749> it's<00:05:46.229> always<00:05:46.499> tough

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
and rugged out front it's always tough

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.800 
and rugged out front it's always tough
against<00:05:47.039> all<00:05:47.159> late<00:05:47.370> but<00:05:47.819> I<00:05:48.240> think<00:05:48.599> the<00:05:48.659> key

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
against all late but I think the key

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.149 
against all late but I think the key
thing<00:05:48.840> for<00:05:49.020> us<00:05:49.259> was<00:05:49.289> we<00:05:49.469> knew<00:05:49.710> the<00:05:49.830> first<00:05:50.009> half

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:50.159 
thing for us was we knew the first half

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:53.059 
thing for us was we knew the first half
was<00:05:50.189> newer<00:05:50.879> bluer<00:05:51.419> standards<00:05:52.050> and<00:05:52.259> they'd

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:53.069 
was newer bluer standards and they'd

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:54.709 
was newer bluer standards and they'd
made<00:05:53.250> a<00:05:53.279> hard<00:05:53.639> game<00:05:53.819> for<00:05:54.090> us<00:05:54.240> they<00:05:54.389> takin<00:05:54.539> a

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:54.719 
made a hard game for us they takin a

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:56.959 
made a hard game for us they takin a
couple<00:05:54.960> of<00:05:55.020> chances<00:05:55.199> perhaps<00:05:56.039> little<00:05:56.669> scrappy

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:56.969 
couple of chances perhaps little scrappy

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:58.700 
couple of chances perhaps little scrappy
goals<00:05:57.270> but<00:05:57.779> in<00:05:58.020> the<00:05:58.289> back<00:05:58.409> of<00:05:58.439> the<00:05:58.590> net<00:05:58.680> the

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
goals but in the back of the net the

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.830 
goals but in the back of the net the
main<00:05:59.009> thing<00:05:59.219> key<00:05:59.849> thing<00:06:00.090> was<00:06:00.120> that<00:06:00.419> we<00:06:00.539> rise<00:06:00.689> to

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
main thing key thing was that we rise to

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.209 
main thing key thing was that we rise to
turn<00:06:01.020> it<00:06:01.139> around<00:06:01.199> a<00:06:01.379> second<00:06:01.680> half<00:06:01.860> as<00:06:02.099> I've

00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:02.219 
turn it around a second half as I've

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:04.369 
turn it around a second half as I've
said<00:06:02.250> with<00:06:02.699> a<00:06:02.729> frank<00:06:03.180> chat<00:06:03.479> at<00:06:03.689> halftime<00:06:03.930> but

00:06:04.369 --> 00:06:04.379 
said with a frank chat at halftime but

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:06.080 
said with a frank chat at halftime but
the<00:06:04.889> performance<00:06:05.129> that<00:06:05.340> gets<00:06:05.639> put<00:06:05.879> in<00:06:06.000> the

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
the performance that gets put in the

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.730 
the performance that gets put in the
second<00:06:06.389> half<00:06:06.509> absolutely<00:06:07.110> be<00:06:07.229> really<00:06:07.560> proud

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
second half absolutely be really proud

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.409 
second half absolutely be really proud
of<00:06:07.800> the<00:06:07.949> work<00:06:08.099> they<00:06:08.279> put<00:06:08.400> in<00:06:08.550> an<00:06:09.060> unfortunate

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 
of the work they put in an unfortunate

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.600 
of the work they put in an unfortunate
not<00:06:10.020> to<00:06:10.080> perhaps<00:06:10.710> sneak<00:06:10.949> at<00:06:11.069> the<00:06:11.189> very<00:06:11.339> death

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
not to perhaps sneak at the very death

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.939 
not to perhaps sneak at the very death
but<00:06:11.909> that's<00:06:12.629> silly<00:06:13.020> this<00:06:13.560> is<00:06:13.650> my<00:06:13.740> fourth
