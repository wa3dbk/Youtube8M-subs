00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.170

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.759
 idle with nothing to do that person 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.890
 that you are video last week we have 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.540
 lying on the bed watching TV and watching 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.900
 the TV this week I realized that there 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.090
 a kind of programs that are totally 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.700
 worthy of analysis I do not know if any 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.920
 Once you have seen are programs 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:48.370
 analysis of paranormal videos 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:55.090
 you know alien ghosts or problems 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:56.740
 where to analyze strange videos if not 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.840
 account that all these programs are of 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.180
 any kind or paying for things that the 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.770
 bad is not even believed but has to 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.770
 be a serious program 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.890
 You are nights and welcome to you. 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.320

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.920
 very interesting videos where you 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.840
 You can clearly see spectra 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.690
 and all the guys analyze it from the 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:30.030
 same way right now we are passing them 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:36.310
 a video of a paranormal manifestation 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:38.320
 we believe that it can be a spirit and 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.899
 they always tell you things of the style without 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.830
 where is the brand so they can 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.830
 appreciate better 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.800
 about taking this mix method of 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.229
 bundled you do not even understand what 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.020
 is seeing clearly when they are things of 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.320

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.540
 spy 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.210
 right at the center of the injury 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.870
 do not remove your eyes from the center of the 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.870
 room 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.709
 there you see how the spirit appears 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.709
 and wanders around the room 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.099
 in search of your card 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.310
 for those who do not see it clearly there 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.440
 the red circle is appearing 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.010
 where is the spirit so that what 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.380

 those videos of everything too dark and 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.750
 that you hear a voice in the background 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.270
