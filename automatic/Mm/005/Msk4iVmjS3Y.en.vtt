00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
close you can see you sort of put it

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.130 
close you can see you sort of put it
down<00:00:50.570> and<00:00:50.920> stick<00:00:51.920> it<00:00:52.070> in<00:00:52.510> and<00:00:53.510> you<00:00:53.870> get<00:00:54.050> the

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
down and stick it in and you get the

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.759 
down and stick it in and you get the
font<00:00:54.350> that<00:00:54.699> up<00:00:55.699> like<00:00:56.089> that<00:00:56.269> and<00:00:56.510> then<00:00:57.500> we<00:00:57.620> need

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
font that up like that and then we need

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.479 
font that up like that and then we need
to<00:00:58.059> just<00:00:59.059> screw<00:00:59.269> the<00:00:59.390> board<00:00:59.600> on<00:00:59.720> I<00:01:00.370> find<00:01:01.370> it

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
to just screw the board on I find it

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.990 
to just screw the board on I find it
easier<00:01:01.850> to<00:01:02.059> talk<00:01:02.570> about<00:01:02.900> it<00:01:06.340> easier<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:07.790> hold

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
easier to talk about it easier so hold

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.310 
easier to talk about it easier so hold
from<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.300> back<00:01:08.450> and<00:01:08.659> twist<00:01:08.870> the<00:01:08.960> ball<00:01:09.110> on<00:01:09.229> the

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
just a case with Gemma just unscrewing

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.059 
just a case with Gemma just unscrewing
the<00:02:04.420> ball<00:02:04.569> from<00:02:04.659> the<00:02:04.750> front<00:02:05.020> so<00:02:05.770> I'm<00:02:05.890> going<00:02:06.009> to

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
the ball from the front so I'm going to

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.600 
the ball from the front so I'm going to
give<00:02:06.159> it<00:02:06.250> a<00:02:06.310> go

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
give it a go

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.029 
give it a go
and<00:02:07.239> I<00:02:07.899> know<00:02:08.019> you<00:02:08.079> need<00:02:08.349> your<00:02:08.380> teeth<00:02:08.649> but<00:02:08.860> I<00:02:08.920> do

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
and I know you need your teeth but I do

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:19.110 
and I know you need your teeth but I do
think<00:02:09.729> if<00:02:10.269> I<00:02:10.420> won<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:18.400> all<00:02:18.519> just<00:02:18.819> going<00:02:18.940> to<00:02:19.000> cut

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
think if I won and all just going to cut

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.729 
think if I won and all just going to cut
my<00:02:19.239> hand<00:02:19.450> underneath<00:02:19.750> so<00:02:20.079> in<00:02:20.200> case<00:02:20.349> I<00:02:20.470> dropped

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
my hand underneath so in case I dropped

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.640 
my hand underneath so in case I dropped
the<00:02:20.829> ball<00:02:20.980> a<00:02:21.760> good<00:02:22.180> tip<00:02:22.660> if<00:02:23.170> you're<00:02:23.380> doing<00:02:23.500> this

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
the ball a good tip if you're doing this

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.830 
the ball a good tip if you're doing this
in<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.860> bathroom<00:02:24.069> make<00:02:24.700> sure<00:02:24.849> the<00:02:25.060> plug<00:02:25.660> hole

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
in the bathroom make sure the plug hole

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.270 
in the bathroom make sure the plug hole
is<00:02:25.959> covered<00:02:26.140> so<00:02:26.560> that<00:02:26.590> you<00:02:26.799> don't<00:02:26.950> drop<00:02:27.129> the

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
is covered so that you don't drop the

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.680 
is covered so that you don't drop the
ball<00:02:27.400> down<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.790> sink<00:02:28.000> I've<00:02:28.180> done<00:02:28.390> that<00:02:28.540> quite

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
ball down the sink I've done that quite

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.259 
ball down the sink I've done that quite
a<00:02:28.750> few<00:02:28.959> I<00:02:29.260> have<00:02:29.440> as<00:02:29.620> well<00:02:29.850> put<00:02:30.850> in<00:02:31.000> so<00:02:31.180> that's

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
a few I have as well put in so that's

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.220 
a few I have as well put in so that's
all<00:02:31.480> out<00:02:31.859> so<00:02:33.660> actually<00:02:34.660> screen<00:02:34.900> up<00:02:34.989> on<00:02:35.109> so

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
all out so actually screen up on so

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.080 
all out so actually screen up on so
don't<00:02:35.350> lose<00:02:35.530> it<00:02:35.880> now<00:02:36.880> I'm<00:02:37.060> miss<00:02:37.420> bits<00:02:39.090> he's

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
don't lose it now I'm miss bits he's

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.970 
don't lose it now I'm miss bits he's
going<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.780> be<00:02:40.840> tricky<00:02:41.230> but<00:02:41.680> I'll<00:02:41.769> give<00:02:41.920> out

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
going to be tricky but I'll give out

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.830 
going to be tricky but I'll give out
ground<00:02:42.250> so<00:02:42.940> faithful

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
ground so faithful

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.360 
ground so faithful
I'm<00:02:43.900> just<00:02:44.590> inserting<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:47.190> photograph<00:02:48.190> with

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
I'm just inserting the photograph with

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.650 
I'm just inserting the photograph with
the<00:02:48.489> actual<00:02:48.730> diamond<00:02:49.030> down<00:02:49.180> there<00:02:49.450> so

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
the actual diamond down there so

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.699 
the actual diamond down there so
inserting<00:02:49.959> it<00:02:50.260> through<00:02:50.799> the<00:02:50.889> front<00:02:52.709> there's

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
inserting it through the front there's

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.069 
inserting it through the front there's
always<00:02:53.829> backwards<00:02:54.400> compared<00:02:54.850> to<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.959> way

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
always backwards compared to the way

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.640 
always backwards compared to the way
that<00:02:56.230> I<00:02:56.260> did<00:02:56.380> it<00:02:56.650> here<00:02:56.920> and<00:02:57.750> now<00:02:58.750> it's<00:02:59.170> case<00:02:59.440> of

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
that I did it here and now it's case of

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.330 
that I did it here and now it's case of
finding<00:03:00.099> a<00:03:00.340> hole<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:01.500> threading<00:03:02.500> it<00:03:02.590> properly

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
finding a hole and threading it properly

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.400 
finding a hole and threading it properly
I'm<00:03:03.639> screwing<00:03:04.030> in<00:03:04.150> place<00:03:04.329> so<00:03:05.019> you<00:03:05.079> screw<00:03:05.349> the

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
I'm screwing in place so you screw the

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.140 
I'm screwing in place so you screw the
base<00:03:05.620> on<00:03:05.889> from<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.340> inside<00:03:06.459> rather<00:03:06.910> than<00:03:07.060> the

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
base on from the inside rather than the

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.610 
base on from the inside rather than the
ball<00:03:07.389> from<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.810> outside<00:03:08.230> view<00:03:10.349> you<00:03:11.349> know<00:03:11.440> like

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
ball from the outside view you know like

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.930 
ball from the outside view you know like
we<00:03:11.709> said<00:03:11.739> earlier<00:03:12.160> it's<00:03:12.280> a<00:03:12.310> little<00:03:12.519> bit<00:03:12.639> tricky

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
we said earlier it's a little bit tricky

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.339 
we said earlier it's a little bit tricky
but<00:03:13.120> once<00:03:13.239> you<00:03:13.450> get<00:03:13.569> the<00:03:13.750> hang<00:03:13.780> of<00:03:13.959> it<00:03:14.139> it's

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
but once you get the hang of it it's

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:16.050 
but once you get the hang of it it's
really<00:03:14.590> easy<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:15.459> more<00:03:15.609> you<00:03:15.760> do<00:03:15.910> it<00:03:15.940> the

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
really easy the more you do it the

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.069 
really easy the more you do it the
easier<00:03:16.630> it<00:03:16.660> gets

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
easier it gets

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:21.930 
easier it gets
since<00:03:17.560> what<00:03:17.709> pounds<00:03:20.430> you<00:03:21.430> might<00:03:21.579> find<00:03:21.730> it's

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
since what pounds you might find it's

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.490 
since what pounds you might find it's
easier<00:03:22.209> to<00:03:22.359> use<00:03:22.419> a<00:03:22.599> mirror<00:03:22.780> to<00:03:22.900> do<00:03:23.109> this<00:03:23.319> as

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
easier to use a mirror to do this as

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.159 
easier to use a mirror to do this as
well<00:03:23.620> cuz<00:03:23.829> you<00:03:23.919> can<00:03:24.130> look<00:03:24.730> Kevin<00:03:25.019> see<00:03:26.019> what

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:26.169 
well cuz you can look Kevin see what

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:28.650 
well cuz you can look Kevin see what
you're<00:03:26.319> doing<00:03:26.620> Harry<00:03:27.010> going<00:03:27.489> twist<00:03:28.389> it<00:03:28.540> all

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
you're doing Harry going twist it all

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.289 
you're doing Harry going twist it all
the<00:03:28.780> way<00:03:28.870> up<00:03:28.900> quite<00:03:29.739> a<00:03:29.769> lot<00:03:29.919> twisting<00:03:30.489> you<00:03:31.180> know

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
the way up quite a lot twisting you know

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:36.500 
the way up quite a lot twisting you know
won't<00:03:31.780> get<00:03:32.079> more<00:03:32.260> secure<00:03:32.590> there

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.610 

oh<00:03:36.920> yeah<00:03:37.920> beautiful
