00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
hmm hello this is q EV and I just want

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.670 
hmm hello this is q EV and I just want
to<00:00:04.589> know<00:00:04.710> that<00:00:05.450> it's<00:00:06.450> still<00:00:07.049> possible<00:00:07.379> to

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
to know that it's still possible to

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.049 
to know that it's still possible to
quickscope<00:00:08.429> on<00:00:08.790> black<00:00:09.599> ops<00:00:09.840> but<00:00:10.349> it's<00:00:11.070> just

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
quickscope on black ops but it's just

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.509 
quickscope on black ops but it's just
really<00:00:12.480> difficult<00:00:12.809> to<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.410> end<00:00:13.650> it's<00:00:14.009> need<00:00:14.309> a

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
really difficult to the end it's need a

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.480 
really difficult to the end it's need a
lot<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.759> practice<00:00:16.010> practicing<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:18.410> think<00:00:19.490> it

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
lot of practice practicing I think it

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.189 
lot of practice practicing I think it
doesn't<00:00:21.060> really<00:00:21.769> doesn't<00:00:22.769> really<00:00:22.980> worth<00:00:23.369> to

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:24.199 
doesn't really doesn't really worth to

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.250 
doesn't really doesn't really worth to
practice<00:00:25.199> that<00:00:25.230> much<00:00:25.710> because<00:00:26.930> it's<00:00:27.930> really

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
practice that much because it's really

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.800 
practice that much because it's really
difficult<00:00:28.560> even<00:00:29.070> playing<00:00:29.429> against<00:00:30.000> boss<00:00:30.210> are

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
difficult even playing against boss are

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.220 
difficult even playing against boss are
involved<00:00:31.289> sorry<00:00:31.910> and<00:00:32.910> all<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.030> think<00:00:33.360> this<00:00:33.570> when

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
involved sorry and all I think this when

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.310 
involved sorry and all I think this when
you<00:00:34.469> do<00:00:35.070> realize<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.730> easier<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.329> not<00:00:36.690> go<00:00:36.989> about

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
you do realize is easier to not go about

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.880 
you do realize is easier to not go about
any<00:00:37.860> other<00:00:38.129> game<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.629> stupid<00:00:40.020> but<00:00:40.379> because

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
any other game it is stupid but because

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.150 
any other game it is stupid but because
they<00:00:41.280> said<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.700> with<00:00:42.510> crisco<00:00:43.320> face<00:00:43.559> chip

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
they said that with crisco face chip

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.250 
they said that with crisco face chip
bars<00:00:44.750> in<00:00:45.750> Moscow<00:00:46.289> it's<00:00:46.700> cheaper<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.260> they

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
bars in Moscow it's cheaper and they

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.569 
bars in Moscow it's cheaper and they
made<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:50.300> no<00:00:51.300> scope<00:00:51.629> easier<00:00:52.230> than<00:00:52.469> Crisco<00:00:53.039> quick

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
made a no scope easier than Crisco quick

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.299 
made a no scope easier than Crisco quick
scope<00:00:54.000> which<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.840> stupid<00:00:55.289> in<00:00:56.010> my<00:00:56.070> opinion

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
scope which is stupid in my opinion

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.400 
scope which is stupid in my opinion
cause<00:00:57.680> you<00:00:58.680> have<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.239> you<00:01:00.239> need<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.420> skill<00:01:00.989> to

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
cause you have to you need a skill to

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.320 
cause you have to you need a skill to
quickscope<00:01:02.010> but<00:01:02.420> it's<00:01:03.890> just<00:01:04.890> random<00:01:05.159> mass<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
quickscope but it's just random mass the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.320 
quickscope but it's just random mass the
the<00:01:07.020> no<00:01:07.229> scope<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.770> thing<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.760> just<00:01:09.180> smart<00:01:11.330> as

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
the no scope I thing is just smart as

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.260 
the no scope I thing is just smart as
you<00:01:12.479> can<00:01:12.630> see<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.200> possible<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.250> quickscope<00:01:14.850> as

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
you can see is possible to quickscope as

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:22.670 
you can see is possible to quickscope as
I<00:01:15.659> as<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.110> said<00:01:16.409> nobody<00:01:17.220> but<00:01:20.960> it's<00:01:21.960> really<00:01:22.409> hard

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
I as I said nobody but it's really hard

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.219 
I as I said nobody but it's really hard
it's<00:01:23.100> just<00:01:23.640> really<00:01:23.909> hard<00:01:24.210> i'm<00:01:24.450> using<00:01:25.020> the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
it's just really hard i'm using the

community<00:01:35.000> well<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.810> if<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.320> did<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.040> see

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
community well you if you did you see

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.600 
community well you if you did you see
the<00:01:38.700> video<00:01:38.820> from<00:01:39.210> him<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.810> just<00:01:40.049> have<00:01:40.350> to

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.320 

scope<00:01:43.610> and<00:01:43.909> then<00:01:44.180> zoom<00:01:44.630> in<00:01:45.850> with<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:47.090> room

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
scope and then zoom in with the room

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.840 
scope and then zoom in with the room
first<00:01:47.720> or<00:01:48.080> the<00:01:48.110> second<00:01:48.680> soon<00:01:48.979> doesn't<00:01:49.670> matter

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
first or the second soon doesn't matter

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.480 
first or the second soon doesn't matter
but<00:01:50.750> you<00:01:51.020> have<00:01:51.200> to<00:01:51.439> assume<00:01:51.710> and<00:01:51.950> because<00:01:52.310> if

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
but you have to assume and because if

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.130 
but you have to assume and because if
you<00:01:52.640> do<00:01:52.820> this<00:01:53.649> the<00:01:54.649> delay<00:01:55.460> of<00:01:55.729> the<00:01:56.140> randomness

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
you do this the delay of the randomness

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.580 
you do this the delay of the randomness
shot<00:01:57.649> it<00:01:58.549> just<00:01:58.970> doesn't<00:01:59.960> sit<00:02:00.530> exist<00:02:01.490> so<00:02:02.149> I

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
shot it just doesn't sit exist so I

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.480 
shot it just doesn't sit exist so I
think<00:02:03.590> you<00:02:03.770> should<00:02:04.039> try<00:02:04.700> to<00:02:04.759> do<00:02:05.119> it<00:02:06.490> it's

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
think you should try to do it it's

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.280 
think you should try to do it it's
really<00:02:08.030> worth<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:08.840> learn<00:02:09.380> how<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:10.550> do<00:02:10.819> this

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
really worth to learn how to do this

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.550 
really worth to learn how to do this
this<00:02:12.290> is<00:02:12.470> stupid<00:02:13.420> I<00:02:14.420> just<00:02:14.900> prefer<00:02:15.080> playing

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
this is stupid I just prefer playing

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.699 
this is stupid I just prefer playing
call<00:02:15.739> of<00:02:15.769> duty<00:02:15.890> 4<00:02:16.130> if<00:02:16.430> I'm<00:02:16.610> honest<00:02:17.030> but<00:02:17.810> I<00:02:18.110> seen

call of duty 4 if I'm honest but I seen

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.650 
call of duty 4 if I'm honest but I seen
that<00:02:18.739> game<00:02:19.190> is<00:02:19.400> not<00:02:19.580> that<00:02:19.790> bad<00:02:20.030> they<00:02:20.299> just

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
that game is not that bad they just

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.030 
that game is not that bad they just
fucking<00:02:21.319> it<00:02:21.590> up<00:02:21.769> when<00:02:22.220> they<00:02:22.930> they<00:02:23.930> put<00:02:24.739> that

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
fucking it up when they they put that

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.100 
fucking it up when they they put that

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
patch and they know that because a guy

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.259 
patch and they know that because a guy
from<00:02:30.440> treyarch<00:02:31.130> said<00:02:31.640> that<00:02:34.239> they're<00:02:35.239> not

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
from treyarch said that they're not

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
gonna ruin a year or two years of workin

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.509 
gonna ruin a year or two years of workin
at<00:02:39.019> work<00:02:40.030> in<00:02:41.030> just<00:02:41.420> one<00:02:41.630> day<00:02:41.660> is<00:02:41.980> cheaper<00:02:43.420> I

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
at work in just one day is cheaper I

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.340 
at work in just one day is cheaper I
think<00:02:46.519> there<00:02:46.850> is<00:02:47.060> there<00:02:47.630> are<00:02:47.660> still<00:02:47.810> people

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
think there is there are still people

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.760 
think there is there are still people
with<00:02:48.560> some<00:02:48.980> common<00:02:49.400> sense

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
with some common sense

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.880 
with some common sense
in<00:02:51.250> try<00:02:51.580> out<00:02:51.820> but<00:02:52.060> they're<00:02:52.930> really<00:02:53.140> difficult

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
in try out but they're really difficult

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.380 
in try out but they're really difficult
myself<00:02:54.870> what<00:02:56.370> actually<00:02:57.370> I<00:02:57.550> got<00:02:57.760> a<00:02:57.790> mask<00:02:58.150> of

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
myself what actually I got a mask of
