energy<00:02:52.090> field<00:02:52.269> will<00:02:52.390> they<00:02:52.450> use<00:02:52.480> it<00:02:52.690> though<00:02:52.750> the

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
energy field will they use it though the

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.210 
energy field will they use it though the
question<00:02:53.079> oh<00:02:53.200> I<00:02:53.290> guess<00:02:53.590> top<00:02:53.769> of<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:53.920> twitpic

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
question oh I guess top of the twitpic

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.860 
question oh I guess top of the twitpic
so<00:02:54.370> just<00:02:54.579> before<00:02:54.730> can<00:02:55.299> t<00:02:55.420> get<00:02:55.540> off<00:02:55.660> yes

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
so just before can t get off yes
