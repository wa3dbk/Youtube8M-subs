Hello I'm John Wiese and this is What's In My Bag.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.420
First

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.400
Three Legged Race LP.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.400
Sort of like free form electronic music. I've heard this before and it was very good.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.880
It's Robert Beatty, who is becoming quite popular making a lot of LP covers

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.760
and this is his solo project.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.400
Awesome. What do you have next in your bag?

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.240
Next I found this, which I've never heard of.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.760
It's called 'Erewhon Calling: Experimental Sound in New Zealand'

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:11.320
and it seems to be just a lot of writing by and about different artists from New Zealand

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.880
who are making sound art, experimental music.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.440
Y'know a lot of stuff like Dead Sea, Bruce Russell, people like that.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.740
It's kind of a struggle to hear about the New Zealand artists

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.100
but there's a lot of them that are doing really incredible stuff.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.160
So I'm hoping that this will tell me more.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.580
Next I have this, by Brakhage, blu-ray.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.200
When I was in high school, I managed to get a copy of 'Dog Star Man' on VHS

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.760
from like a sort of, y'know like an arty video store in St. Louis.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.260
But seeing it on DVD was fantastic.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.740
but I can't, I really can't, y'know, there's no words to describe

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.980
how much better it is seeing it in high-definition. It's really, really great.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.940
I don't even know in a blu-ray player but I'm gonna buy this

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.520
and just carry it around with me in case I ever

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.280
come across one so that I can watch this.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.740
This is a MSBR 7-inch and sculpture.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.200
MSBR is a Japanese experimental artist.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.820
He made music, he had a label, he had a magazine.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.240
He brought bands to Japan to tour.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.420
I went over to Japan on three tours that he either organized or helped organize.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:07.360
The last one was in 2004 and shortly after that he died very suddenly.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.380
I've only gone to back to Japan once after that and it seemed like there was

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.220
quite a big hole where he left off.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.440
So I see that that's a record and a sculpture.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.900
Yeah it says '7-inch plus wood-base artwork and transparency.'

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.280
I think I used to have this, but I don't totally remember. I believe I don't have it now.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.940
So I'm really excited to get this.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.700
To my recollection, it's sort of like a...

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.480
some thing with like a spring or something

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.200
and you put the record on it and it becomes sort of like a sculptural object.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.920
This is the new No Age record.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.760
I met Dean when I was going to CalArts, when I very first moved here.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.100
After my first year of going to CalArts

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.800
my friend and I were hanging out recording in the graphic design studios.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.260
We were actually recording the very first Sissy Spacek demo.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.760
And we were going to the car to listen to the mix over and over again

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:32.200
and Dean was at CalArts for this program called CSSSA, which was sort of like a high school program.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.520
And I believe he was wearing a Locust t-shirt.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.700
And so we were just like, hey how's it going ?

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.240
and then he came into the car with us and was listening to it.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:53.760
And then I would always see him at shows, at like PCH Club and the Smell and stuff like that.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.960
I feel like y'know, this crew of people has sort of been

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.340
part of my whole experience of living here since 1998.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.840
Well thanks John for coming in and showing us what's in your bag.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.080
Thank you very much.
