you pictures on the internet of it this

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.469 
you pictures on the internet of it this
is<00:01:23.170> more<00:01:23.380> typical<00:01:23.890> of<00:01:23.920> my<00:01:24.159> style<00:01:24.549> with<00:01:24.970> exposed

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
different colors of oil paint that I've

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.309 
different colors of oil paint that I've
thinned<00:03:55.049> with<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.799> mediums<00:03:56.310> that<00:03:56.760> I<00:03:56.819> use<00:03:57.319> to
