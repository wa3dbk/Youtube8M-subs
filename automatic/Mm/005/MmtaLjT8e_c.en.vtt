00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
know where any inextricably bound

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.870 
know where any inextricably bound
together<00:01:51.660> for<00:01:52.500> something<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.980> is<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.730> is

still<00:01:54.060> one<00:01:54.240> was<00:01:54.360> frightening<00:01:54.630> sometimes<00:01:55.200> to

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
still one was frightening sometimes to

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.860 
still one was frightening sometimes to
us<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.580> we<00:01:56.670> don't<00:01:56.820> always<00:01:57.000> have<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.270> full<00:01:57.510> grasp

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
us and we don't always have a full grasp

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.660 
us and we don't always have a full grasp
on<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.380> because<00:01:58.740> it's<00:01:59.010> just<00:01:59.190> something<00:01:59.400> that

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
on it because it's just something that

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.170 
on it because it's just something that
exists<00:02:00.180> in<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.630> itself<00:02:00.900> I<00:02:01.490> I<00:02:02.490> think<00:02:02.760> that

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
exists in and of itself I I think that

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.330 
exists in and of itself I I think that
our<00:02:03.390> love<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.660> an<00:02:03.990> amazingly<00:02:04.440> powerful<00:02:04.530> thing

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340

our love is an amazingly powerful thing
and<00:02:05.750> I'm<00:02:06.750> alive<00:02:07.200> today<00:02:07.560> because<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:10.130> it

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
and I'm alive today because of it it

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.940 
and I'm alive today because of it it
took<00:02:11.430> me<00:02:11.490> until<00:02:12.000> my<00:02:12.390> late<00:02:12.570> twenties<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.710> know

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
took me until my late twenties to know

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.730 
took me until my late twenties to know
what<00:02:14.370> unconditional<00:02:15.210> love<00:02:15.450> was<00:02:15.780> what<00:02:16.530> that

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
what unconditional love was what that

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.610 
what unconditional love was what that
meant<00:02:17.070> and<00:02:17.460> it<00:02:18.120> became<00:02:18.570> real<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:18.960> me<00:02:19.290> because

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
meant and it became real to me because

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.120 
meant and it became real to me because
of<00:02:19.740> this<00:02:19.890> man

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
each other and it was just like the Lord

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.480 
each other and it was just like the Lord
said<00:03:04.660> to<00:03:04.840> me<00:03:05.020> and<00:03:05.260> what<00:03:05.560> about<00:03:05.770> that<00:03:05.830> log<00:03:06.280> in

your own eye and I thought do you mean
and<00:03:09.880> I<00:03:10.720> started<00:03:11.110> thinking<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:11.740> then<00:03:11.860> it<00:03:11.980> just

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
and I started thinking and then it just

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.630 
and I started thinking and then it just
came<00:03:12.400> to<00:03:12.670> me<00:03:12.790> I<00:03:13.060> hated<00:03:13.540> that<00:03:13.840> kid<00:03:14.110> I<00:03:14.640> absolutely

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
came to me I hated that kid I absolutely

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:26.250 
came to me I hated that kid I absolutely
hated<00:03:16.180> him<00:03:16.450> for<00:03:16.480> what<00:03:16.840> he<00:03:17.020> done<00:03:17.290> to<00:03:17.320> us

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.140 

then<00:03:27.260> I<00:03:27.290> had<00:03:27.560> to<00:03:27.590> go<00:03:27.799> back<00:03:27.980> to<00:03:28.040> my<00:03:28.730> Lord<00:03:29.030> and

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
then I had to go back to my Lord and

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.050 
then I had to go back to my Lord and
talked<00:03:29.540> him<00:03:29.930> some<00:03:30.260> more<00:03:30.499> about<00:03:30.799> being<00:03:31.760> able<00:03:31.849> to

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
talked him some more about being able to

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.059 
talked him some more about being able to
forgive<00:03:32.450> my<00:03:32.659> son

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.270 

I<00:03:37.209> was<00:03:38.209> even<00:03:38.450> hoping<00:03:38.689> to<00:03:38.870> even<00:03:39.319> recreate<00:03:40.069> some

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
I was even hoping to even recreate some
