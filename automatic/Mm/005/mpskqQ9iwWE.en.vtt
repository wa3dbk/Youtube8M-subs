00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:08.280
 ok there is going to be a man in a room 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:10.050
 who will come to import hockey 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.960
 the idea is that I will choose the 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:17.630
 sir a train to laugh the wii 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.830

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.230
 giant step they're not dying I'm talking 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.630
 a lot but do not bite a fight 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.630
 very much applauded to this gentleman 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:59.460
 a big french kiss eric welcome to 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:01:02.190
 eric marester cap to put them there 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.619
 it's not complicated it's more role 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.729
 complicated okay do you see what it is 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:13.220
 that a vinci must find a 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:20.820
 contrabass is a pretty massive thing 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:22.950
 no need for that so we can say that 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.799
 this is the ass and the double bass and 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.159
 we will imagine that the canvas up to that point 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:35.070
 okay knowing that the handle 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:36.659
 these pictures and my legs and Corsican is 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.189
 really not complicated for now 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.680
 you can not control but you knew 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.680
 do not worry about that it was not easy 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.520
 so what will happen is kitsch 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.079
 and eric, do not be afraid, do you want to say 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.659
 like that I left in a club of 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:02:01.679
 so jazz really and on supports 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:03.359
 very common gaulle hit the target and 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:05.340
 well that's well paid 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:10.679
 if ever I have this move you normally 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:13.830
 you do not want cool resistance yes that 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.200
 collapsed arm stick so where one 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.390
 knows well that to understand neighbor pushes a 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.160
 little is not running out too much but in fact 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.810
 we roll to I'm going to do a kind of 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.410
 bound fists and my legs are going to do 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.410
 strong 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:33.750
 So it's going to be super simple 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:42.260
 true but the shorty who see me a 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:42.260
 pair of buttocks and make it a project 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.459
 my legs on arms 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.580
 soon arrive at the idea if you tell me 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.580
 scratch 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:36.140
 gicl and you come back the project as quoted 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.140
 auzas concert 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.710
 it works 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.920
 and most importantly do you only those breakdowns and 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:22.670
 that's what you want to see 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:25.730
 of former maximize the final facing 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:28.510

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.510
 Viennese waltz
