00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
around stick around some sort of an

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.730 
around stick around some sort of an
unsatisfying<00:01:33.000> world<00:01:33.270> it's<00:01:33.479> up<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.229> see

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
unsatisfying world it's up to you to see

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.010 
unsatisfying world it's up to you to see
that<00:01:34.920> video<00:01:35.130> game<00:01:35.579> problem<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.659> see<00:01:36.840> that

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
that video game problem to see that

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.929 
that video game problem to see that
issue<00:01:37.229> as<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.619> comes<00:01:37.829> up<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.250> map<00:01:38.430> known<00:01:38.820> i

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
issue as it comes up on the map known i

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.060 
issue as it comes up on the map known i
think<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.390> right<00:01:39.689> turn<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.470> see<00:01:40.710> all

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
think this is a right turn to see all

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.550 
think this is a right turn to see all
the<00:01:41.340> problems<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:41.970> could<00:01:42.360> potentially<00:01:42.990> lay

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
the problems that could potentially lay

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.590 
the problems that could potentially lay
in<00:01:43.680> front<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.189> calculate<00:01:44.939> your<00:01:45.149> your

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
in front of you and calculate your your

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.630 
in front of you and calculate your your
future<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.170> then<00:01:46.530> also<00:01:46.799> look<00:01:47.159> around<00:01:47.430> all<00:01:47.549> the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
future and then also look around all the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.980 
future and then also look around all the
people<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.880> didn't<00:01:48.210> do<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.689> look<00:01:48.810> at<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
people that didn't do it and look at the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.480 
people that didn't do it and look at the
misery<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.380> they're<00:01:49.680> in<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.040> learn<00:01:50.220> that

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
misery that they're in and learn that

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.069 
misery that they're in and learn that
you<00:01:50.579> don't<00:01:50.729> want<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.909> be<00:01:51.000> like<00:01:51.210> them<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.630> then

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
you don't want to be like them and then

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.569 
you don't want to be like them and then
look<00:01:52.229> at<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.350> people<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.740> have<00:01:53.250> kind<00:01:53.460> of

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
look at the people that have kind of

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.460 
look at the people that have kind of
taken<00:01:54.210> chances<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.930> navigated<00:01:55.320> their<00:01:55.409> way

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
taken chances and navigated their way

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.230 
taken chances and navigated their way
what<00:01:56.189> do<00:01:56.250> they<00:01:56.310> do<00:01:56.430> differently<00:01:56.939> than<00:01:57.119> you

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
what would objectivity do they have that

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.249 
what would objectivity do they have that
maybe<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.759> lack<00:02:00.030> what<00:02:00.360> insight<00:02:00.840> into<00:02:01.140> their

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
maybe you lack what insight into their

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.800 
maybe you lack what insight into their
