00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:11.360
 Come on, guys, I'm going to do revision S-4 today. I premise that the 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.219
 functions from ios 4 onwards then multitasking folders and there is between there are still 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.219
 only new features have been implemented 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.399
 in short, there are not 4 main new features 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.210
 it is the first and the javascript control second airplay in the second floor 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.260
 family visions and personal pop spot leads 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.360
 then javascript nitro what it is 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.990
 it's simply 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.120
 safari implementation 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.360
 as for java content they will be displayed twice more 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.480
 quickly but not just the pages 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.650
 with joma content all because it's like a relationship is charging enough 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.920
 sweetly despite having so many images to download 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.400
 wirles and I wouldn't cry so much on 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.120
 yessa why 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.260
 beautiful in the end 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.820

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.310

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.310
 that you shared Greek detail sera with the same network 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.930
 here another 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.920
 inside the shared podium you can access your library 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.920

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.580
 I can't do it to see why not apple tv 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.080

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.390
 allows to display 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.410

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.380
 mind support TV 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.649
 And not only do I envy the pages or the applications too 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.490
 compatible 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.040

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.090
 more importantly or more useful years here is personal ad we can find it 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.699

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:36.970

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.499
 enabling the personal ad 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:42.779

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:34.379
 using mint 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:35.930

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.460
 lasts so much scream enough in the sky there is a bit of music a little bit of 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.810
