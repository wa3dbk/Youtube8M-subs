00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 I give the floor to jacques foccart 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.970
 good evening hello for want to be 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.460
 with you what do you tell me where I put you to 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.330
 my eyes 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.109
 well, we're going to try to treat the 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.220
 shoot the shot 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.220
 gold shooting 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.119
 it's vast we'll start with you 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.650
 give some small exercises to 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.439
 level of the entrances to the basket behind in 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.309
 vain giving you benchmarks of 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.410
 time behind we will quickly see the 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.420
 sports calls the power the supports 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.030
 simultaneous to return on them or 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.719
 floats the tony shooter parker the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.770
 shoot like that who are cabbages that we 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.800
 can not neglect 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.510
 we can not neglect why because 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.190
 in modern basketball now there are 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.730
 a lot of input a lot of play 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.579
 quick 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.899
 so everything is ugly and a meter 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.090
 Fifty m 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.280
 three meters from the circle are shoots 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.220
 interesting especially are the fast play 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.990
 so of course there is a work of 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.260
 speed and bodybuilding work 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.570
 for all that but it will not be addressed 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.509
 we'll show you just but the 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.540
 movements and and some time we can 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.119
 give like that reference times 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:24.479
 behind we will go to support work 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.280
 that generates the shoot the work of 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.770
 receipt shoots what the Americans 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.509
 call catch and shoot and then 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.450
 behind all the shoots that are created at 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.189
 from the dribble and we'll finish it's up to 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.759
 say from a situation almost 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:42.079
 2 1 against 1 the expression to create his 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.240
 shoot and finish and I see a specimen 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:47.909
 on the falls of tall who are 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.530
 very particular shoots too even though 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.810
 in globality so all that 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.570
 I'm trying to do now 17 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.670
 years old all the players I train 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.189
 happening on all the spot brothers are 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.380
 all the posts and that a little finger is 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.630
 revenge your circles that a great bath 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.030
 it can send 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.469
 a little further than snowshoeing again 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.599
 at three points it's not worse 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:11.810
 I'm talking about the posts there because the 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.700
 coffee stations need everything shot and 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.310
 here we have as non guinea pigs 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.650
 remarkable case of hope finally mix 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.090
 what's left of it during the holidays 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:25.010
 and in what we do when I say 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.480
 we knew that jeff because against himself 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.440
 with crazy people with the other assistants 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.540
 I had we always worked 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.430
 like that there are things that are said 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.310
 often lowered the supports that means 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.620
 what does it mean the position of the skier 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.060
 which is fundamental ie 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.560
 before receiving the ball 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.260
 it is better that the player is already 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.390
 placed instead of receiving it and 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:49.069
 lower he'll win a time have to 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:51.049
 remember words like going in 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:55.370
 in the ball not wait for the ball 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:57.950
 come in to play but go well in 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.410
 my words like that but me or like 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.069
 do we close the bend that means firm 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.299
 your elbow 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:08.870
 that means it will take its place 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:10.970
 ask for less times but it goes up there 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.010
 an example if you have cassettes or 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.900
 what a great of all this is 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.790
 antoine rigaudeau took over the 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.780
 cassettes of antoine rigaudeau and you 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.920
 will see that this rather slow boy was coming 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.670
 always to pass 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.380
 was there speed? 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:31.489
 mounted on the opponent and whipping 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:34.549
 behind ends up one shoot whips all these 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:37.540
 little words that do the work of the type 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:41.180
 shooting because shooting work 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:44.959
 it's usually a work in general 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:48.190
 that they love both in teams and 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:51.769
 individual and when we take a player 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:54.859
 in individual on a session of 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:58.030
 shoot fix it's like trained 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:04:00.120
 athletics is like these 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.690
 comments 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.630
 in repeat increase modulation 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.330
 intensity it can be drop fragrance 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:13.840
 and corrections and the correction not 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:16.360
 spanking but correction towards the 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.590
 understanding make them pigeon their 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:23.110
 body to be aligned to be sheathed with 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:26.320
 close to go under the ball all these 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.230
 words there are messages that one has to 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.890
 to pass them then sometimes do that 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:34.510
 zapped but after a while you tell them 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.630
 say and you see the guys who are 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:42.910
 placed the satisfactions are there but 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:48.340
 it is a mourning work of diligence and 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:51.940
 consistency of agreement knowing that at the 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.980
 end of the end with all the humility that 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.240
 that implies 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:05:00.010
 when we see a guy arrive at a 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:03.700
 anarchic gesture another to see that 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:06.180
 does not make him run a shoot 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:09.940
 in classic academic quotation marks 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:12.940
 but to make the most of his 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.550
 physiological possibilities and that's to 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.310
 to say of his mechanical abilities his 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:21.100
 leg abilities of his strength ago 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.320
 kids there who have not got their arms 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.919
 to send far enough from others it's 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.440
 legs 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:28.120
 a cap has understood the support all that 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.370
 a lot of modesty a lot of humility 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.850
 and I will finish with that and at the end of 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:36.600
 there is only one true rule 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:38.710
 it is to send up more thirsty 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.830
 even players who are not very 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.360
 adroit naturally happens to put some 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.860
 baskets 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.570
 because we do not see what we do not 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.330
 do not see what we do not see what we 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:52.419
 sends by increasing the pace 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.430
 remaining concentrated by increasing the 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:58.540
 speed by increasing a whole bunch of 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:01.650
 players so let's start with a 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.650
 small framing c
