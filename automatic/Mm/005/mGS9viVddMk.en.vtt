in<00:00:03.130> this<00:00:04.130> tutorial<00:00:04.340> we'll<00:00:04.790> have<00:00:05.000> a<00:00:05.029> look<00:00:05.210> at

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:05.330 
in this tutorial we'll have a look at

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.350 
in this tutorial we'll have a look at
how<00:00:05.510> to<00:00:05.569> create<00:00:05.810> a<00:00:05.960> gizmo<00:00:06.200> inside<00:00:06.650> of<00:00:06.770> nuke

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:07.360 
how to create a gizmo inside of nuke

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.629 
how to create a gizmo inside of nuke
gizmo<00:00:08.360> is<00:00:08.660> simply<00:00:09.290> nukes<00:00:09.620> word<00:00:09.799> for<00:00:10.160> a<00:00:10.190> macro

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:10.639 
gizmo is simply nukes word for a macro

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:12.790 
gizmo is simply nukes word for a macro
so<00:00:10.880> it's<00:00:11.059> a<00:00:11.150> set<00:00:11.780> of<00:00:11.900> nodes<00:00:12.139> that<00:00:12.469> are<00:00:12.530> wrapped

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:12.800 
so it's a set of nodes that are wrapped

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.770 
so it's a set of nodes that are wrapped
into<00:00:12.980> a<00:00:13.070> single<00:00:13.460> node<00:00:13.610> and<00:00:13.910> provided<00:00:14.360> with<00:00:14.540> a

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
into a single node and provided with a

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.690 
into a single node and provided with a
custom<00:00:15.349> user<00:00:15.500> interface<00:00:15.980> to<00:00:16.160> control<00:00:16.340> the

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:16.700 
custom user interface to control the

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.929 
custom user interface to control the
internal<00:00:16.970> nodes<00:00:17.180> and<00:00:17.450> then<00:00:18.110> save<00:00:18.739> to<00:00:18.770> disk<00:00:19.160> to

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
internal nodes and then save to disk to

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:21.760 
internal nodes and then save to disk to
be<00:00:20.090> distributed<00:00:20.689> over<00:00:20.779> a<00:00:20.899> network<00:00:21.110> or<00:00:21.470> simply

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
be distributed over a network or simply

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.780 
be distributed over a network or simply
reused<00:00:22.509> at<00:00:23.509> any<00:00:23.720> time<00:00:24.020> as<00:00:24.950> you<00:00:25.189> will<00:00:25.340> see<00:00:25.520> it<00:00:25.669> is

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:25.790 
reused at any time as you will see it is

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.790 
reused at any time as you will see it is
very<00:00:26.119> similar<00:00:26.450> to<00:00:26.720> a<00:00:26.750> group<00:00:26.989> now<00:00:27.140> the<00:00:27.590> main

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
very similar to a group now the main

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.740 
very similar to a group now the main
difference<00:00:28.189> is<00:00:28.369> that<00:00:28.399> the<00:00:28.669> gizmo<00:00:29.119> file<00:00:29.450> lives

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
difference is that the gizmo file lives

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.389 
difference is that the gizmo file lives
on<00:00:29.899> disk<00:00:30.110> and<00:00:30.380> is<00:00:30.500> referenced<00:00:31.040> by<00:00:31.189> nuke

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:31.399 
on disk and is referenced by nuke

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:32.740 
on disk and is referenced by nuke
scripts<00:00:31.790> while<00:00:31.910> the<00:00:32.149> group<00:00:32.360> node<00:00:32.540> actually

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
scripts while the group node actually

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.750 
scripts while the group node actually
lives<00:00:33.170> inside<00:00:33.530> the<00:00:33.710> nuke<00:00:33.860> scripts<00:00:34.190> themselves

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
lives inside the nuke scripts themselves

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.490 
lives inside the nuke scripts themselves
so<00:00:35.390> let's<00:00:35.570> have<00:00:35.690> a<00:00:35.750> look<00:00:35.900> at<00:00:35.990> how<00:00:36.170> this<00:00:36.320> works

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
so let's have a look at how this works

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.460 
so let's have a look at how this works
as<00:00:36.830> an<00:00:37.340> example<00:00:37.670> I<00:00:37.970> have<00:00:38.180> a<00:00:38.210> luminance<00:00:38.960> key<00:00:39.200> set

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
as an example I have a luminance key set

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.790 
as an example I have a luminance key set
up<00:00:39.590> here<00:00:39.910> which<00:00:40.910> is<00:00:40.940> quite<00:00:41.270> simple<00:00:41.570> I<00:00:41.800> simply

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
up here which is quite simple I simply

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.430 
up here which is quite simple I simply
attached<00:00:43.070> a<00:00:43.250> color<00:00:43.610> lookup<00:00:43.790> curve<00:00:44.330> to<00:00:45.260> give

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
attached a color lookup curve to give

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.500 
attached a color lookup curve to give
ourselves<00:00:45.560> some<00:00:46.040> some<00:00:46.760> nice<00:00:46.940> curve<00:00:47.180> control

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
ourselves some some nice curve control

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.800 
ourselves some some nice curve control
over<00:00:47.960> both<00:00:48.140> the<00:00:48.520> the<00:00:49.520> master<00:00:50.060> whoops<00:00:50.570> that's

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:50.810 
over both the the master whoops that's

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.400 
over both the the master whoops that's
not<00:00:50.960> the<00:00:51.170> master<00:00:52.090> the<00:00:53.090> master<00:00:53.200> luminance<00:00:54.200> here

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
not the master the master luminance here

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.400 
not the master the master luminance here
as<00:00:55.010> well<00:00:55.790> as<00:00:56.090> a<00:00:56.570> per<00:00:57.200> channel<00:00:57.560> tweak<00:00:58.250> so<00:00:59.410> that's

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
as well as a per channel tweak so that's

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.960 
as well as a per channel tweak so that's
much<00:01:00.649> more<00:01:00.680> control<00:01:01.220> than<00:01:01.370> we<00:01:01.460> get<00:01:01.640> out<00:01:01.790> of<00:01:01.880> the

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
much more control than we get out of the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.600 
much more control than we get out of the
standard<00:01:02.420> luminance<00:01:02.870> kiya<00:01:03.079> and<00:01:03.800> I<00:01:04.309> simply

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
standard luminance kiya and I simply

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.420 
standard luminance kiya and I simply
convert<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.360> result<00:01:05.960> of<00:01:06.350> this<00:01:06.500> into<00:01:06.950> HSV

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
convert the result of this into HSV

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.850 
convert the result of this into HSV
color<00:01:07.670> space<00:01:07.970> and<00:01:08.240> then<00:01:08.659> copy<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.200> V<00:01:09.560> the

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
color space and then copy the V the

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.219 
color space and then copy the V the
value<00:01:10.010> which<00:01:10.909> represents<00:01:11.510> the<00:01:11.600> luminance<00:01:12.020> as

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
value which represents the luminance as

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.910 
value which represents the luminance as
per<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:12.950> HSV<00:01:13.400> color<00:01:13.640> space<00:01:13.909> model<00:01:14.440> I'm<00:01:15.440> taking

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
per the HSV color space model I'm taking

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.430 
per the HSV color space model I'm taking
that<00:01:16.070> and<00:01:16.280> copying<00:01:16.760> that<00:01:16.909> back<00:01:17.180> into<00:01:17.540> the

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
that and copying that back into the

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.090 
that and copying that back into the
alpha<00:01:18.740> channel<00:01:18.770> of<00:01:19.190> our<00:01:19.280> main<00:01:19.490> stream<00:01:19.880> so

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
alpha channel of our main stream so

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.130 
alpha channel of our main stream so
that's<00:01:22.100> quite<00:01:22.310> simple<00:01:22.549> and<00:01:22.880> let's<00:01:23.840> turn<00:01:24.020> that

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
that's quite simple and let's turn that

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.050 
that's quite simple and let's turn that
into<00:01:24.290> a<00:01:24.380> gizmo<00:01:24.620> and<00:01:24.920> then<00:01:25.010> see<00:01:25.310> what<00:01:25.729> we<00:01:25.820> get

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
into a gizmo and then see what we get

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.020 
into a gizmo and then see what we get
first<00:01:26.960> step<00:01:27.260> to<00:01:27.530> create<00:01:27.890> a<00:01:28.070> gizmo<00:01:28.400> is<00:01:28.729> to

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
first step to create a gizmo is to

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.789 
first step to create a gizmo is to
select<00:01:29.600> all<00:01:29.780> the<00:01:29.870> nodes<00:01:30.110> that<00:01:30.380> are<00:01:30.560> supposed

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
select all the nodes that are supposed

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.890 
select all the nodes that are supposed
to<00:01:30.830> be<00:01:30.950> part<00:01:31.220> of<00:01:31.310> it<00:01:31.490> and<00:01:31.640> then<00:01:32.119> group<00:01:32.390> them<00:01:32.570> so

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
to be part of it and then group them so

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.410 
to be part of it and then group them so
you<00:01:32.960> select<00:01:33.170> them<00:01:33.500> and<00:01:33.710> hit<00:01:34.430> ctrl<00:01:34.880> G<00:01:35.119> or

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
you select them and hit ctrl G or

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.050 
you select them and hit ctrl G or
command<00:01:35.810> G<00:01:36.049> when<00:01:36.229> you're<00:01:36.380> on<00:01:36.740> a<00:01:36.770> mac<00:01:37.010> or<00:01:37.580> go<00:01:38.000> to

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
command G when you're on a mac or go to

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.350 
command G when you're on a mac or go to
the<00:01:38.360> other<00:01:38.659> menu<00:01:38.900> and<00:01:39.260> hit<00:01:39.920> group<00:01:40.360> this

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
the other menu and hit group this

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.810 
the other menu and hit group this
creates<00:01:41.720> a<00:01:41.869> group<00:01:42.020> node<00:01:42.260> and<00:01:42.530> pastes<00:01:43.369> all<00:01:43.580> the

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
creates a group node and pastes all the

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.390 
creates a group node and pastes all the
selected<00:01:44.119> nodes<00:01:44.540> inside<00:01:45.200> of<00:01:45.380> it<00:01:45.530> and<00:01:45.740> it<00:01:46.280> will

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
selected nodes inside of it and it will

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.190 
selected nodes inside of it and it will
also<00:01:46.610> open<00:01:47.000> an<00:01:47.420> extra<00:01:47.869> node<00:01:48.140> graph<00:01:48.790> here<00:01:49.790> that

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
also open an extra node graph here that

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.109 
also open an extra node graph here that
shows<00:01:51.200> you<00:01:51.380> all<00:01:51.439> the<00:01:52.189> nodes<00:01:52.400> that<00:01:52.549> live<00:01:52.820> inside

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
shows you all the nodes that live inside

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.270 
shows you all the nodes that live inside
of<00:01:53.270> this<00:01:53.390> group<00:01:53.570> node<00:01:53.780> then<00:01:54.710> we<00:01:54.830> just<00:01:55.010> split

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
of this group node then we just split

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.190 
of this group node then we just split
this<00:01:55.549> interface<00:01:56.060> for<00:01:56.360> a<00:01:56.420> second<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:56.960> we<00:01:56.990> can

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
this interface for a second so we can

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.499 
this interface for a second so we can
see<00:01:57.380> both<00:01:57.619> at<00:01:57.770> once<00:01:57.950> drag<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:59.000> group<00:01:59.180> stuff

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
see both at once drag the group stuff

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.469 
see both at once drag the group stuff
over<00:01:59.810> here<00:02:00.340> so<00:02:01.340> on<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:01.490> Left<00:02:01.729> we<00:02:01.939> see<00:02:02.119> our<00:02:02.240> main

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
over here so on the Left we see our main

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.390 
over here so on the Left we see our main
graph<00:02:02.750> on<00:02:03.049> the<00:02:03.290> right<00:02:03.320> we<00:02:03.650> see<00:02:03.830> the<00:02:03.979> internals

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
graph on the right we see the internals

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.039 
graph on the right we see the internals
of<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:04.640> of<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:05.659> group

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
of the of the group

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.929 
of the of the group
let<00:02:06.170> me<00:02:06.229> just<00:02:06.409> disconnect<00:02:06.950> those<00:02:07.100> two<00:02:07.369> here<00:02:07.670> so

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
let me just disconnect those two here so

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.820 
let me just disconnect those two here so
you<00:02:08.000> see<00:02:08.239> we've<00:02:08.420> got<00:02:08.569> two<00:02:08.840> input<00:02:09.200> pipes<00:02:09.470> that's

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
you see we've got two input pipes that's

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.820 
you see we've got two input pipes that's
because<00:02:10.250> when<00:02:11.150> we<00:02:11.299> created<00:02:11.629> the<00:02:11.810> group<00:02:11.989> we<00:02:12.319> had

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
because when we created the group we had

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.920 
because when we created the group we had
unconnected<00:02:13.640> input<00:02:14.090> pipes<00:02:14.300> in<00:02:14.570> in<00:02:14.840> the

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
unconnected input pipes in in the

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.230 
unconnected input pipes in in the
selection<00:02:15.260> both<00:02:16.040> of<00:02:16.220> which<00:02:16.340> received<00:02:16.910> an

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
selection both of which received an

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.510 
selection both of which received an
input<00:02:17.570> node<00:02:17.600> inside<00:02:18.350> of<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.650> inside<00:02:19.340> of<00:02:19.460> the

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
input node inside of the inside of the

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.640 
input node inside of the inside of the
group<00:02:19.670> node<00:02:19.880> and<00:02:20.210> those<00:02:21.020> input<00:02:21.410> nodes

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
group node and those input nodes

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.890 
group node and those input nodes
represent<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.490> input<00:02:22.610> arrows<00:02:23.120> or<00:02:23.630> input

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
represent the input arrows or input

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.170 
represent the input arrows or input
types<00:02:24.200> of<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:25.100> group<00:02:25.280> node<00:02:25.490> so<00:02:25.760> in<00:02:25.850> this<00:02:25.940> case

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
types of the group node so in this case

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.090 
types of the group node so in this case
here<00:02:26.390> we<00:02:26.420> just<00:02:26.720> need<00:02:26.990> one<00:02:27.200> input<00:02:27.530> so<00:02:27.800> I'm<00:02:27.890> going

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
here we just need one input so I'm going

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.520 
here we just need one input so I'm going
to<00:02:28.160> drag<00:02:28.310> it<00:02:28.520> over<00:02:28.580> here<00:02:28.810> use<00:02:29.810> input<00:02:30.170> one<00:02:30.320> only

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
to drag it over here use input one only

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.740 
to drag it over here use input one only
and<00:02:30.890> get<00:02:31.280> rid<00:02:31.430> of<00:02:31.460> input<00:02:31.790> two<00:02:31.970> and<00:02:32.240> you<00:02:32.420> can<00:02:32.450> see

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
and get rid of input two and you can see

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.050 
and get rid of input two and you can see
the<00:02:32.930> respective<00:02:33.620> input<00:02:33.920> pipe<00:02:34.130> disappeared

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
the respective input pipe disappeared

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.480 
the respective input pipe disappeared
from<00:02:35.210> the<00:02:35.390> group<00:02:35.540> node<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:36.020> I'm<00:02:36.860> also<00:02:37.100> gonna

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
from the group node and I'm also gonna

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.300 
from the group node and I'm also gonna
hit<00:02:37.790> n<00:02:38.060> to<00:02:38.630> rename<00:02:38.990> the<00:02:39.230> input<00:02:39.530> node<00:02:39.800> and<00:02:40.100> I'll

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
hit n to rename the input node and I'll

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.790 
hit n to rename the input node and I'll
call<00:02:40.550> it<00:02:40.700> IMG<00:02:41.210> so<00:02:41.930> it's<00:02:42.110> a<00:02:42.230> bit<00:02:42.380> more<00:02:42.530> obvious

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
call it IMG so it's a bit more obvious

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.270 
call it IMG so it's a bit more obvious
that<00:02:43.520> we're<00:02:43.730> dealing<00:02:44.000> with<00:02:44.030> an<00:02:44.240> image<00:02:44.450> input

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
that we're dealing with an image input

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.970 
that we're dealing with an image input
so<00:02:46.280> you<00:02:46.670> can<00:02:47.060> see<00:02:47.240> the<00:02:47.360> label<00:02:47.750> made<00:02:48.530> it<00:02:48.680> across

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
so you can see the label made it across

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.680 
so you can see the label made it across
to<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.400> respective<00:02:49.850> input<00:02:50.150> type<00:02:50.390> and<00:02:50.660> that

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
to the respective input type and that

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.780 
to the respective input type and that
will<00:02:51.260> make<00:02:51.440> our<00:02:51.470> gizmo<00:02:52.040> a<00:02:52.100> little<00:02:52.459> bit<00:02:52.580> more

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
will make our gizmo a little bit more

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.160 
will make our gizmo a little bit more
intuitive<00:02:54.190> right<00:02:55.300> let's<00:02:56.300> hook<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:56.720> up<00:02:56.870> here

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
intuitive right let's hook that up here

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.760 
intuitive right let's hook that up here
and<00:02:57.470> connect<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.490> viewer<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:59.390> go<00:03:00.140> to<00:03:00.200> the

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
and connect the viewer and go to the

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.830 
and connect the viewer and go to the
alpha<00:03:01.070> channel<00:03:01.100> there<00:03:01.880> you<00:03:02.000> go<00:03:02.150> we've<00:03:02.600> got<00:03:02.810> a

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
alpha channel there you go we've got a

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.110 
alpha channel there you go we've got a
luminance<00:03:03.200> based<00:03:03.470> alpha<00:03:03.860> but<00:03:04.459> we<00:03:04.880> obviously

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
luminance based alpha but we obviously

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.870 
luminance based alpha but we obviously
don't<00:03:05.540> have<00:03:05.690> any<00:03:05.990> controls<00:03:06.440> yet<00:03:06.650> so<00:03:07.010> let's<00:03:07.700> go

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
don't have any controls yet so let's go

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:08.860 
don't have any controls yet so let's go
ahead<00:03:07.970> and<00:03:08.180> fix<00:03:08.420> that

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
ahead and fix that

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.720 
ahead and fix that
so<00:03:09.080> what<00:03:09.230> we<00:03:09.350> want<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:09.590> do<00:03:09.740> is<00:03:10.070> we<00:03:10.370> want<00:03:10.700> to

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
so what we want to do is we want to

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.360 
so what we want to do is we want to
expose<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.480> color<00:03:11.780> lookup<00:03:12.170> nodes<00:03:12.500> Lucknow

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
expose the color lookup nodes Lucknow

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.300 
expose the color lookup nodes Lucknow
which<00:03:13.760> is<00:03:13.970> this<00:03:14.390> guy<00:03:14.510> here<00:03:15.050> so<00:03:15.830> I'll<00:03:15.980> close

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
which is this guy here so I'll close

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.720 
which is this guy here so I'll close
that<00:03:16.610> and<00:03:16.850> then<00:03:17.180> to<00:03:17.870> expose<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.530> knob<00:03:18.800> we'll

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
that and then to expose the knob we'll

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.580 
that and then to expose the knob we'll
just<00:03:20.120> right<00:03:20.360> click<00:03:20.600> anywhere<00:03:20.930> in<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.230> group's

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
just right click anywhere in the group's

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.800 
just right click anywhere in the group's

created<00:03:30.500> in<00:03:30.890> this<00:03:31.040> node<00:03:31.250> you<00:03:31.430> can<00:03:31.640> add<00:03:31.910> user

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
created in this node you can add user

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.750 
created in this node you can add user
knobs<00:03:32.570> to<00:03:32.750> any<00:03:32.900> node<00:03:33.170> in<00:03:33.440> Nuuk<00:03:33.860> so<00:03:34.370> I<00:03:34.400> will<00:03:34.610> play

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
knobs to any node in Nuuk so I will play

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.729 
knobs to any node in Nuuk so I will play
with<00:03:34.910> that<00:03:34.940> that's<00:03:35.300> quite<00:03:35.480> fun<00:03:35.720> obviously<00:03:36.650> we

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
with that that's quite fun obviously we

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.650 
with that that's quite fun obviously we
don't<00:03:36.860> have<00:03:37.130> any<00:03:37.370> user<00:03:37.610> knobs<00:03:37.880> here<00:03:38.209> yet<00:03:38.480> so

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
don't have any user knobs here yet so

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.500 
don't have any user knobs here yet so
we've<00:03:38.959> got<00:03:39.110> an<00:03:39.200> empty<00:03:39.350> list<00:03:39.590> and<00:03:40.510> there's

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
we've got an empty list and there's

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.479 
we've got an empty list and there's
there's<00:03:41.780> a<00:03:41.840> couple<00:03:42.080> of<00:03:42.200> ways<00:03:42.320> of<00:03:42.489> creating

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
there's a couple of ways of creating

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.380 
there's a couple of ways of creating
your<00:03:43.610> own<00:03:43.670> interface<00:03:44.209> one<00:03:44.600> is<00:03:44.780> by<00:03:45.140> adding

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
your own interface one is by adding

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.780 
your own interface one is by adding
interface<00:03:47.390> widgets<00:03:47.690> and<00:03:48.280> you<00:03:49.280> can<00:03:49.430> just<00:03:49.610> pick

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
interface widgets and you can just pick

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.080 
interface widgets and you can just pick
any<00:03:50.060> user<00:03:50.660> knob<00:03:51.290> from<00:03:51.680> the<00:03:51.800> add<00:03:51.920> list<00:03:52.310> and<00:03:52.760> you

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
any user knob from the add list and you

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.360 
any user knob from the add list and you
can<00:03:53.239> do<00:03:53.360> this<00:03:53.510> in<00:03:53.720> any<00:03:53.840> node<00:03:54.140> in<00:03:54.320> Nuuk<00:03:54.620> this

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
can do this in any node in Nuuk this

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.220 
can do this in any node in Nuuk this
will<00:03:55.519> create<00:03:55.790> a<00:03:56.030> widget<00:03:56.330> but<00:03:56.750> it<00:03:56.930> won't<00:03:57.140> really

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
will create a widget but it won't really

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.680 
will create a widget but it won't really
connect<00:03:57.739> anything<00:03:58.040> so<00:03:58.760> you'd<00:03:58.880> have<00:03:59.090> to<00:03:59.209> go<00:03:59.390> and

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
connect anything so you'd have to go and

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.690 
connect anything so you'd have to go and
write<00:04:00.350> expressions<00:04:00.890> to<00:04:01.070> then<00:04:01.250> reference

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
write expressions to then reference

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.060 
write expressions to then reference
those<00:04:01.880> new<00:04:02.090> interface<00:04:02.480> items<00:04:02.870> in<00:04:03.170> this<00:04:03.830> case

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
those new interface items in this case

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.500 
those new interface items in this case
we're<00:04:04.340> dealing<00:04:04.459> with<00:04:04.610> a<00:04:04.730> group<00:04:05.000> so<00:04:05.390> we<00:04:05.480> can

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
we're dealing with a group so we can

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.690 
we're dealing with a group so we can
actually<00:04:05.780> pick<00:04:07.450> pick<00:04:08.480> knobs<00:04:09.470> from<00:04:10.070> nodes<00:04:10.430> that

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
actually pick pick knobs from nodes that

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.580 
actually pick pick knobs from nodes that
live<00:04:10.910> inside<00:04:11.060> of<00:04:11.360> this<00:04:11.450> group<00:04:11.750> so<00:04:12.230> we're

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
live inside of this group so we're

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.580 
live inside of this group so we're
interested<00:04:12.860> in<00:04:13.160> the<00:04:13.970> color<00:04:14.330> lookup<00:04:14.630> node<00:04:15.260> here

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
interested in the color lookup node here

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.699 
interested in the color lookup node here
so<00:04:15.799> we'll<00:04:15.920> expand<00:04:16.370> this<00:04:16.580> and<00:04:17.140> the<00:04:18.140> next<00:04:18.560> level

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
so we'll expand this and the next level

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.560 
so we'll expand this and the next level
represents<00:04:19.280> all<00:04:19.430> the<00:04:19.549> tabs<00:04:19.880> inside<00:04:20.330> of<00:04:20.479> this

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
represents all the tabs inside of this

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.070 
represents all the tabs inside of this
node<00:04:20.950> so<00:04:22.240> we're<00:04:23.240> looking<00:04:23.539> into<00:04:23.690> the<00:04:23.840> color

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
node so we're looking into the color

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.810 
node so we're looking into the color
lookup<00:04:24.410> node<00:04:24.740> tab

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
lookup node tab

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.260 
lookup node tab
and<00:04:26.500> we'll<00:04:27.500> pick<00:04:27.890> the<00:04:28.220> lots<00:04:28.460> of<00:04:28.580> knob<00:04:28.850> that's

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
and we'll pick the lots of knob that's

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.660 
and we'll pick the lots of knob that's
what<00:04:29.630> holds<00:04:29.930> the<00:04:30.050> curves<00:04:30.320> and<00:04:31.010> you<00:04:31.220> can<00:04:31.400> see<00:04:31.580> it

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
what holds the curves and you can see it

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.690 
what holds the curves and you can see it
shows<00:04:31.910> up<00:04:32.090> shows<00:04:32.540> up<00:04:32.750> here<00:04:32.930> in<00:04:32.960> our<00:04:33.140> list<00:04:33.380> and

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
shows up shows up here in our list and

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.280 
shows up shows up here in our list and
we<00:04:34.700> can<00:04:34.730> also<00:04:35.030> immediately<00:04:35.690> see<00:04:35.960> it<00:04:36.050> in<00:04:36.200> the

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
we can also immediately see it in the

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.360 
we can also immediately see it in the
interface<00:04:36.620> of<00:04:36.680> the<00:04:36.860> group

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
interface of the group

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.120 
interface of the group
the<00:04:38.090> first<00:04:38.360> time<00:04:38.600> you<00:04:38.750> create<00:04:39.020> a<00:04:39.110> gizmo<00:04:39.380> knob

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
the first time you create a gizmo knob

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.080 
the first time you create a gizmo knob
or<00:04:40.400> a<00:04:40.460> a<00:04:40.730> user<00:04:41.210> knob<00:04:41.450> you<00:04:42.080> get<00:04:42.290> a<00:04:42.470> tab<00:04:43.280> for<00:04:43.580> free

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
or a a user knob you get a tab for free

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.580 
or a a user knob you get a tab for free
that's<00:04:44.360> this<00:04:44.540> guy<00:04:44.750> here<00:04:45.020> and<00:04:45.050> it's<00:04:45.410> going<00:04:45.530> to

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
that's this guy here and it's going to

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.390 
that's this guy here and it's going to
be<00:04:45.710> called<00:04:45.950> user<00:04:46.220> you<00:04:46.490> can<00:04:46.700> go<00:04:47.360> and<00:04:47.540> edit<00:04:47.780> it

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
be called user you can go and edit it

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.880 
be called user you can go and edit it
doesn't<00:04:49.400> really<00:04:49.490> matter<00:04:49.700> in<00:04:49.820> this<00:04:49.910> case<00:04:50.890> so

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
doesn't really matter in this case so

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.040 
doesn't really matter in this case so
right<00:04:52.070> now<00:04:52.430> that<00:04:52.610> we've<00:04:52.730> got<00:04:53.060> this<00:04:53.240> control

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
right now that we've got this control

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.320 
right now that we've got this control
exposed<00:04:54.530> we<00:04:54.830> can<00:04:55.070> have<00:04:55.520> a<00:04:55.550> play<00:04:55.820> and<00:04:56.000> see<00:04:56.150> if<00:04:56.210> it

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
exposed we can have a play and see if it

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.190 
exposed we can have a play and see if it
works<00:04:56.570> select<00:04:57.080> that<00:04:57.230> lot<00:04:57.440> and<00:04:59.050> here's<00:05:00.050> our

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
works select that lot and here's our

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.470 
works select that lot and here's our
luminance<00:05:00.620> alpha<00:05:00.980> new<00:05:01.880> orleans-based

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480

luminance alpha new orleans-based
alpha<00:05:02.780> channel<00:05:03.080> and<00:05:04.210> let's<00:05:05.210> say<00:05:05.450> that's<00:05:05.720> all

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
alpha channel and let's say that's all

we<00:05:06.290> want<00:05:06.440> to<00:05:06.530> do<00:05:06.980> for<00:05:07.220> now<00:05:07.400> so<00:05:08.060> the<00:05:08.180> next<00:05:08.360> step

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
we want to do for now so the next step

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.770 
we want to do for now so the next step
is<00:05:08.810> saving<00:05:09.140> this<00:05:09.440> thing<00:05:09.650> to<00:05:09.830> a<00:05:10.190> disk<00:05:10.640> you<00:05:11.630> do

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
is saving this thing to a disk you do

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.960 
is saving this thing to a disk you do
this<00:05:11.930> by<00:05:12.140> going<00:05:12.290> to<00:05:12.470> the<00:05:12.620> group<00:05:13.100> notes<00:05:13.340> node

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
this by going to the group notes node

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.960 
this by going to the group notes node
tab<00:05:14.360> and<00:05:14.870> you'll<00:05:15.470> find<00:05:15.710> the<00:05:15.800> export<00:05:16.250> as<00:05:16.460> gizmo

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
tab and you'll find the export as gizmo

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.210 
tab and you'll find the export as gizmo
button<00:05:17.510> which<00:05:17.720> is<00:05:18.670> exactly<00:05:19.670> what<00:05:19.850> it<00:05:19.970> does<00:05:20.000> and

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
button which is exactly what it does and

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.950 
button which is exactly what it does and
you<00:05:22.220> want<00:05:22.400> to<00:05:22.460> save<00:05:22.700> this<00:05:22.940> into<00:05:23.210> your<00:05:23.540> new<00:05:23.690> path

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
you want to save this into your new path

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.510 
you want to save this into your new path
I'm<00:05:24.260> just<00:05:24.470> going<00:05:24.620> to<00:05:24.650> drop<00:05:24.800> it<00:05:24.950> into<00:05:25.070> my<00:05:25.250> home

I'm just going to drop it into my home

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.640 
I'm just going to drop it into my home
directory<00:05:26.090> which<00:05:26.660> is<00:05:26.780> probably<00:05:27.140> a<00:05:27.230> good<00:05:27.290> place

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
directory which is probably a good place

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.950 
directory which is probably a good place
to<00:05:28.130> prototype<00:05:28.970> your<00:05:29.090> gizmos<00:05:29.450> before<00:05:29.870> you

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
to prototype your gizmos before you

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.400 
to prototype your gizmos before you
release<00:05:30.230> them<00:05:30.440> to<00:05:30.970> be<00:05:31.970> used<00:05:32.180> by<00:05:33.020> other<00:05:33.230> people

release them to be used by other people

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.780 
release them to be used by other people
and<00:05:34.280> I'm<00:05:34.610> just<00:05:34.850> gonna<00:05:35.000> call<00:05:35.300> it<00:05:35.330> luma<00:05:35.900> keyer

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
and I'm just gonna call it luma keyer

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.100 
and I'm just gonna call it luma keyer
you<00:05:37.790> don't<00:05:37.970> have<00:05:38.150> to<00:05:38.270> pen<00:05:38.540> the<00:05:38.570> doc<00:05:38.810> is<00:05:38.990> no

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
you don't have to pen the doc is no

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.350 
you don't have to pen the doc is no
extension<00:05:39.440> it'll<00:05:39.950> do<00:05:40.490> that<00:05:40.700> automatically

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
extension it'll do that automatically
