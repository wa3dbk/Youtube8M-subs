came up with this idea of taking tight
and<00:00:47.570> using<00:00:48.050> that<00:00:48.079> as<00:00:48.230> designed<00:00:48.829> in<00:00:49.100> a<00:00:49.160> way<00:00:49.190> that

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
and using that as designed in a way that

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.420 
and using that as designed in a way that
was<00:00:49.789> far<00:00:50.570> different<00:00:50.899> than<00:00:51.680> anybody<00:00:51.950> else<00:00:52.280> had

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
was far different than anybody else had

was far different than anybody else had
ever<00:00:52.520> done<00:00:52.640> and<00:00:53.149> that<00:00:53.500> became<00:00:54.500> hot<00:00:55.250> and<00:00:55.579> became

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
ever done and that became hot and became

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:57.729 
ever done and that became hot and became
something<00:00:56.329> that<00:00:56.449> everybody<00:00:56.809> enjoyed<00:00:57.170> and<00:00:57.559> and

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
people inventing and creating new things

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.850 
people inventing and creating new things
I<00:01:31.659> don't<00:01:32.659> think<00:01:32.810> it's<00:01:32.960> a<00:01:33.049> necessity<00:01:33.229> but<00:01:33.799> I

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
I don't think it's a necessity but I

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.100 
I don't think it's a necessity but I
think<00:01:34.130> it's<00:01:34.280> a<00:01:34.549> I<00:01:34.939> think<00:01:35.570> it's<00:01:35.689> definitely<00:01:35.840> an

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
think it's a I think it's definitely an

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.749 
think it's a I think it's definitely an
enhancement<00:01:38.979> the<00:01:39.979> way<00:01:40.130> that<00:01:40.340> that's<00:01:40.460> relevant

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
enhancement the way that that's relevant

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.569 
enhancement the way that that's relevant
I<00:01:41.150> guess<00:01:41.360> is<00:01:41.600> that<00:01:41.630> if<00:01:42.009> you<00:01:43.009> know<00:01:43.100> someone<00:01:43.460> who

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
I guess is that if you know someone who

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.719 
I guess is that if you know someone who
has<00:01:43.610> fine<00:01:44.450> our<00:01:44.659> experience<00:01:45.500> probably<00:01:46.220> just

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
has fine our experience probably just

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.609 
has fine our experience probably just
through<00:01:46.970> exercise<00:01:47.570> has<00:01:47.930> a<00:01:48.350> better

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
through exercise has a better

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.460 
through exercise has a better
appreciation<00:01:49.280> of<00:01:49.820> composition<00:01:50.540> and<00:01:50.750> maybe

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
appreciation of composition and maybe

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.240 
appreciation of composition and maybe
color<00:01:51.829> or<00:01:52.579> texture<00:01:53.119> or<00:01:53.799> you<00:01:54.799> know<00:01:54.920> some<00:01:55.220> of

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
color or texture or you know some of

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.710 
color or texture or you know some of
some<00:01:55.549> of<00:01:55.579> the<00:01:55.759> other<00:01:55.909> things<00:01:56.000> that<00:01:56.329> are<00:01:56.479> meant

some of the other things that are meant

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.080 
some of the other things that are meant
to<00:01:56.810> you<00:01:57.320> know<00:01:57.470> tools<00:01:58.009> of<00:01:58.340> design<00:01:58.670> that<00:01:58.969> are

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
to you know tools of design that are

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.800 
to you know tools of design that are
that<00:01:59.450> are<00:01:59.509> intended<00:01:59.869> to<00:02:01.360> to<00:02:02.360> create<00:02:02.659> an

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
but it is a

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.440 
but it is a
as<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:11.250> designer<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:12.330> think<00:02:13.050> you're<00:02:14.270> you<00:02:15.270> have

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
as a designer I think you're you have

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.240 
as a designer I think you're you have
you<00:02:15.720> have<00:02:15.750> more<00:02:15.900> tools<00:02:16.350> you<00:02:16.650> have<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.950> kind<00:02:17.100> of

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
you have more tools you have to kind of

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.270 
you have more tools you have to kind of
merge<00:02:17.610> into<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.090> specific<00:02:18.630> communication

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.949 

personally<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.310> feel<00:02:23.550> it's<00:02:23.730> important<00:02:24.150> you

know I like to see you know students or

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.630 
know I like to see you know students or
you<00:02:28.170> know<00:02:28.290> anyone<00:02:28.680> anyone<00:02:28.980> my<00:02:29.160> artist<00:02:29.400> be<00:02:29.489> able

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
you know anyone anyone my artist be able

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.479 
you know anyone anyone my artist be able
to<00:02:29.730> draw<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.600> know<00:02:30.800> to<00:02:31.800> some<00:02:31.950> extent<00:02:32.340> or

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
illustrate you know I think that there's

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.670 
illustrate you know I think that there's
a<00:02:34.319> balance<00:02:34.739> between<00:02:35.040> fine<00:02:35.489> art<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:35.940> design

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
a balance between fine art and design

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.100 
a balance between fine art and design
that<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:38.220> know<00:02:38.310> some<00:02:38.550> really<00:02:38.840> you<00:02:39.840> know<00:02:39.930> some

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
that you know some really you know some

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.630 
that you know some really you know some
great<00:02:40.200> designs<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.739> come<00:02:40.920> out<00:02:41.069> of<00:02:41.130> some<00:02:41.430> fine

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
great designs that come out of some fine

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.750 
great designs that come out of some fine
or<00:02:41.790> so<00:02:41.910> I<00:02:41.970> think<00:02:42.120> it's<00:02:42.239> really<00:02:42.390> inspirational

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
or so I think it's really inspirational

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.910 
or so I think it's really inspirational
you<00:02:44.760> know<00:02:44.880> as<00:02:45.810> far<00:02:46.019> as<00:02:46.140> applying<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.739> i

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
you know as far as applying that i

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.530 
you know as far as applying that i
really<00:02:47.220> like<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.610> student<00:02:48.030> or<00:02:48.150> someone<00:02:48.300> else

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
really like a student or someone else

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.390 
really like a student or someone else
that<00:02:48.720> can<00:02:48.900> draw<00:02:49.080> they<00:02:49.260> can<00:02:49.440> sketch<00:02:49.709> they<00:02:50.250> can

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
that can draw they can sketch they can

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.979 
that can draw they can sketch they can
start<00:02:50.610> with<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.790> pencil<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.390> then<00:02:51.810> into

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
start with a pencil and then into

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.030 
start with a pencil and then into
something<00:02:52.320> you<00:02:52.440> know<00:02:52.530> it's<00:02:52.709> going<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:52.980> be

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
something you know it's going to be

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.890 
something you know it's going to be
electronic<00:02:53.580> or<00:02:53.730> something<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:54.300> I<00:02:56.900> mean

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
electronic or something so I mean

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.150 
electronic or something so I mean
there's<00:02:58.050> a<00:02:58.110> come<00:02:58.290> back<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.980> first

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
there's a come back to the first

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.780 
there's a come back to the first
question<00:02:59.340> I<00:02:59.790> think<00:03:01.100> like<00:03:02.100> again<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.580> when<00:03:02.700> you

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
question I think like again and when you

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.070 
question I think like again and when you
got<00:03:02.850> to<00:03:02.970> be<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.060> finite<00:03:03.300> is<00:03:03.510> first<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:03.930> then

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
got to be a finite is first and then

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.720 
got to be a finite is first and then
give<00:03:04.380> it<00:03:04.440> up<00:03:04.560> a<00:03:04.650> graphic<00:03:04.800> designer<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:05.550> I'm

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.400 
the point where what people a lot of
people<00:04:13.200> consider<00:04:13.650> fine<00:04:14.010> art<00:04:14.280> and<00:04:14.489> so<00:04:15.420> you<00:04:16.229> have

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
people consider fine art and so you have

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.610 
people consider fine art and so you have
to<00:04:16.590> master<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:17.280> concepts<00:04:18.000> of<00:04:18.209> design<00:04:18.750> but

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
to master the concepts of design but

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.890 
to master the concepts of design but
your<00:04:19.859> execution<00:04:20.580> doesn't<00:04:20.970> always<00:04:21.299> have<00:04:21.570> to

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
your execution doesn't always have to

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.780 
your execution doesn't always have to
be<00:04:23.960> perfect<00:04:24.960> and<00:04:25.290> sometimes<00:04:25.680> it's<00:04:26.370> actually

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
be perfect and sometimes it's actually

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:35.540 
be perfect and sometimes it's actually
better<00:04:26.970> if<00:04:27.090> it's<00:04:27.389> not<00:04:27.600> perfect<00:04:30.889> I<00:04:34.490> think<00:04:35.490> I

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
better if it's not perfect I think I

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.499 
better if it's not perfect I think I
understood<00:04:35.880> as<00:04:36.000> far<00:04:36.210> as<00:04:36.330> um<00:04:37.910> Gary<00:04:38.910> basin<00:04:39.270> be

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:39.509 
understood as far as um Gary basin be

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:43.100 
understood as far as um Gary basin be
more<00:04:39.780> of<00:04:39.870> an<00:04:39.990> artist<00:04:40.919> yet<00:04:41.759> he's<00:04:42.120> work<00:04:42.479> sort<00:04:43.020> of

more of an artist yet he's work sort of

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.290 
more of an artist yet he's work sort of

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
portrayed yourself also a lot of design

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.810 
portrayed yourself also a lot of design
work<00:04:45.330> you<00:04:46.229> know<00:04:46.350> it<00:04:46.560> kind<00:04:46.710> of<00:04:46.770> trans<00:04:47.039> pass<00:04:47.669> this

back to to the principal's you know so I

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:26.390 
back to to the principal's you know so I
think<00:05:24.419> for<00:05:24.750> graphic<00:05:25.380> designers<00:05:25.710> I<00:05:26.039> think<00:05:26.250> it's

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
think for graphic designers I think it's

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.460 
think for graphic designers I think it's
really<00:05:26.940> important<00:05:27.449> that<00:05:27.660> they<00:05:27.900> have<00:05:28.080> design

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
really important that they have design

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.270 
really important that they have design
skills<00:05:28.970> because<00:05:30.199> around<00:05:31.199> fine<00:05:31.770> art<00:05:31.979> skills

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
skills because around fine art skills

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.189 
skills because around fine art skills

graphic design

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.930 
graphic design
interactivity<00:05:39.140> in<00:05:39.440> multimedia<00:05:39.860> it<00:05:40.640> always

interactivity in multimedia it always

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.480 
interactivity in multimedia it always
comes<00:05:41.210> back<00:05:41.330> down<00:05:41.750> to<00:05:42.050> getting<00:05:42.620> your<00:05:42.830> concept

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
comes back down to getting your concept

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.150 
comes back down to getting your concept
to<00:05:43.760> somebody<00:05:44.120> before<00:05:44.330> you<00:05:44.690> even<00:05:44.870> go<00:05:45.770> full

paper to explain that ID and that

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.290 
paper to explain that ID and that
concept<00:05:55.220> to<00:05:55.310> somebody<00:05:55.640> before<00:05:55.790> you<00:05:56.000> can<00:05:56.240> even

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
concept to somebody before you can even

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.750 
concept to somebody before you can even
go<00:05:56.630> out<00:05:56.780> an<00:05:57.020> attempt<00:05:57.800> to<00:05:57.890> start<00:05:58.280> sitting<00:05:58.550> down

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
go out an attempt to start sitting down

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.510 
go out an attempt to start sitting down
at<00:05:58.910> the<00:05:58.940> computer<00:05:59.030> and<00:05:59.720> just<00:06:00.710> selling

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
at the computer and just selling

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.670 
at the computer and just selling
somebody<00:06:01.730> on<00:06:02.000> the<00:06:02.120> idea<00:06:02.510> so<00:06:03.170> I<00:06:03.200> think<00:06:03.440> it's

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
somebody on the idea so I think it's

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.950 
somebody on the idea so I think it's
really<00:06:03.950> important<00:06:04.610> that<00:06:04.820> somebody<00:06:05.480> has<00:06:05.720> fine

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
really important that somebody has fine

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.170 
really important that somebody has fine
art<00:06:06.200> skills<00:06:06.610> personally<00:06:07.610> I<00:06:07.640> think<00:06:07.760> it's<00:06:08.120> very

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
art skills personally I think it's very

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.200 
art skills personally I think it's very
important<00:06:08.990> and<00:06:09.830> maybe<00:06:10.460> I'm<00:06:10.610> biased<00:06:10.790> because

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
important and maybe I'm biased because

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.360 
important and maybe I'm biased because
that's<00:06:11.990> the<00:06:12.230> background<00:06:12.410> that<00:06:12.740> I<00:06:12.800> came<00:06:13.100> from

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
that's the background that I came from

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.900 
that's the background that I came from
but<00:06:13.940> from<00:06:14.390> what<00:06:14.570> I've<00:06:14.750> found<00:06:14.780> is<00:06:15.680> you<00:06:16.670> can

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:16.910 
but from what I've found is you can

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.020
