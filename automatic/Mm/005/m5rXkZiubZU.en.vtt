rib<00:02:51.620> meat<00:02:51.859> some<00:02:52.159> people<00:02:52.459> kind<00:02:52.700> of<00:02:52.819> miss<00:02:53.000> that

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
rib meat some people kind of miss that

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.710 
rib meat some people kind of miss that
that's<00:02:54.349> why<00:02:54.500> it's<00:02:54.650> really<00:02:54.799> important<00:02:55.430> to<00:02:56.299> ride

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
that's why it's really important to ride

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.420 
that's why it's really important to ride
the<00:02:56.959> ribs<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.560> take<00:02:57.739> your<00:02:57.859> time<00:02:58.099> as<00:02:58.310> you're

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
the ribs and take your time as you're

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.339 
the ribs and take your time as you're
coming<00:02:58.640> down<00:02:58.760> when<00:02:59.239> you're<00:02:59.390> scaling<00:02:59.989> that

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
coming down when you're scaling that

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:02.289 
coming down when you're scaling that
because<00:03:00.769> now<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.069> only<00:03:01.430> bones<00:03:01.819> that<00:03:02.060> are<00:03:02.150> in

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
because now the only bones that are in

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.740 
because now the only bones that are in
this<00:03:02.450> filet<00:03:02.900> there's<00:03:03.769> just<00:03:04.040> a<00:03:04.159> tiny<00:03:04.489> Roe<00:03:05.000> right

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
this filet there's just a tiny Roe right

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.020 
this filet there's just a tiny Roe right
in<00:03:05.959> here<00:03:06.409> and<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:07.069> lot<00:03:07.280> of<00:03:07.430> people<00:03:07.700> think<00:03:07.909> that

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
in here and a lot of people think that

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.660 
in here and a lot of people think that
those<00:03:08.180> cook<00:03:08.480> up<00:03:08.980> sometimes<00:03:09.980> I<00:03:10.159> cook<00:03:10.370> them<00:03:10.489> out

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
those cook up sometimes I cook them out

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.259 
those cook up sometimes I cook them out
when<00:03:10.819> I'm<00:03:11.109> cooking<00:03:12.109> them<00:03:12.409> myself<00:03:12.819> but<00:03:13.819> anyway

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
when I'm cooking them myself but anyway

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.449 
when I'm cooking them myself but anyway
there's<00:03:14.569> one<00:03:15.139> side<00:03:15.379> of<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.590> filet<00:03:15.889> now<00:03:16.340> I'll

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
there's one side of the filet now I'll

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:24.420 
there's one side of the filet now I'll
do<00:03:16.579> the<00:03:16.609> other<00:03:20.889> again<00:03:22.209> right<00:03:23.209> behind<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.659> ear

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
do the other again right behind the ear

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.970 
do the other again right behind the ear
makes<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.549> first<00:03:25.760> cut<00:03:26.139> don't<00:03:27.139> go<00:03:27.379> through<00:03:27.799> the

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
makes the first cut don't go through the

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.559 
makes the first cut don't go through the
spine<00:03:28.310> though<00:03:29.290> come<00:03:30.290> up<00:03:30.409> here<00:03:31.209> up<00:03:32.209> to<00:03:32.480> the

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
spine though come up here up to the

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.089 
spine though come up here up to the
belly<00:03:32.780> but<00:03:33.019> leave<00:03:33.200> just<00:03:33.470> a<00:03:33.530> little<00:03:33.709> bit<00:03:33.859> there

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
belly but leave just a little bit there

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:36.250 
belly but leave just a little bit there
because<00:03:34.340> it's<00:03:34.519> easier<00:03:34.909> to<00:03:34.970> stick<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.109> knife

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
because it's easier to stick the knife

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.890 
because it's easier to stick the knife
in<00:03:36.319> when<00:03:36.769> you're<00:03:36.889> doing<00:03:37.129> this<00:03:37.250> bottom<00:03:37.609> cut<00:03:37.900> and

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.140 
in when you're doing this bottom cut and
cut<00:03:39.290> through<00:03:39.500> the<00:03:39.530> belly<00:03:39.799> using<00:03:40.579> mostly<00:03:40.909> just

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
cut through the belly using mostly just

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.780 
cut through the belly using mostly just
the<00:03:41.239> tip<00:03:41.449> of<00:03:41.479> the<00:03:41.659> knife<00:03:42.159> once<00:03:43.159> you<00:03:43.280> comes<00:03:43.519> into

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
the tip of the knife once you comes into

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.539 
the tip of the knife once you comes into
the<00:03:43.879> ribs<00:03:44.150> you<00:03:44.299> can<00:03:44.389> push<00:03:44.810> through<00:03:45.199> all<00:03:46.040> the

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
got here get to the bottom of the rib

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.069 
got here get to the bottom of the rib
section<00:04:10.280> and<00:04:10.459> then<00:04:11.359> just<00:04:11.389> the<00:04:11.720> tip<00:04:11.900> of<00:04:11.930> the

section and then just the tip of the

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:13.809 
section and then just the tip of the
knife<00:04:12.290> I'm<00:04:12.650> not<00:04:12.799> sure<00:04:12.979> if<00:04:13.040> camera<00:04:13.760> is

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
knife I'm not sure if camera is

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.399 
knife I'm not sure if camera is
recording<00:04:13.909> that<00:04:14.419> well<00:04:14.599> but<00:04:14.900> just<00:04:15.109> ride<00:04:15.379> that

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:15.409 
recording that well but just ride that

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:18.789 
recording that well but just ride that
the<00:04:16.159> curve<00:04:16.549> of<00:04:16.729> those<00:04:16.849> ribs<00:04:17.239> and<00:04:17.799> then

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
the curve of those ribs and then

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.460 
the curve of those ribs and then
downward<00:04:19.370> then<00:04:19.760> it<00:04:20.000> exposes<00:04:20.479> the<00:04:20.840> first<00:04:21.079> bone

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
downward then it exposes the first bone

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.770 
downward then it exposes the first bone
we<00:04:22.460> want<00:04:22.699> it<00:04:22.820> to<00:04:22.880> just<00:04:23.030> use<00:04:23.210> the<00:04:23.360> tip<00:04:23.570> of<00:04:23.720> the

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
we want it to just use the tip of the

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.969 
we want it to just use the tip of the
knife<00:04:23.960> and<00:04:24.380> then<00:04:25.310> cut<00:04:25.639> through<00:04:25.940> those<00:04:26.500> all<00:04:27.500> the

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
knife and then cut through those all the

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:29.980 
knife and then cut through those all the
way<00:04:28.099> to<00:04:28.159> the<00:04:28.370> head<00:04:28.550> so<00:04:29.150> that<00:04:29.180> filet<00:04:29.690> then

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
way to the head so that filet then

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.540 
way to the head so that filet then
should<00:04:30.349> roll<00:04:30.680> over<00:04:31.159> like<00:04:31.370> that<00:04:32.080> now<00:04:33.190> ride<00:04:34.190> the

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
should roll over like that now ride the

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:42.210 
should roll over like that now ride the
ribs<00:04:34.789> down<00:04:35.060> very<00:04:35.509> slowly<00:04:35.900> in<00:04:36.169> a<00:04:36.259> sawing<00:04:36.530> motion

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.160 

okay<00:04:43.220> so<00:04:43.280> there's<00:04:43.760> what<00:04:44.030> looks<00:04:44.240> like<00:04:44.360> now

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
okay so there's what looks like now

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.620 
okay so there's what looks like now
there's<00:04:45.410> our<00:04:45.560> skinned<00:04:45.890> fish<00:04:46.220> and<00:04:46.700> you

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
there's our skinned fish and you

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.960 
there's our skinned fish and you
shouldn't<00:04:47.960> have<00:04:48.260> any<00:04:48.770> meat<00:04:49.370> left<00:04:49.400> on<00:04:49.820> those

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
shouldn't have any meat left on those

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.940 
shouldn't have any meat left on those
bones<00:04:50.240> those<00:04:50.600> bones<00:04:50.810> should<00:04:51.110> be<00:04:51.260> exposed<00:04:51.650> like

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
bones those bones should be exposed like

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:58.990 
bones those bones should be exposed like
that<00:04:52.630> so<00:04:55.390> then<00:04:56.390> for<00:04:57.020> skinning<00:04:57.640> once<00:04:58.640> again

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
that so then for skinning once again

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.110 
that so then for skinning once again
just<00:04:59.300> make<00:05:00.070> just<00:05:01.070> leave<00:05:01.280> a<00:05:01.310> little<00:05:01.430> bit<00:05:01.790> there

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
just make just leave a little bit there

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:11.540 
just make just leave a little bit there
so<00:05:02.150> you<00:05:02.480> got<00:05:02.630> something<00:05:02.900> to<00:05:03.110> hold<00:05:03.290> on<00:05:03.500> to

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.230 

okay<00:05:12.949> where's<00:05:13.949> the<00:05:14.009> Flay<00:05:14.370> there's<00:05:14.699> the<00:05:14.910> skin

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
okay where's the Flay there's the skin

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.089 
okay where's the Flay there's the skin
not<00:05:15.509> much<00:05:15.810> left<00:05:16.080> on<00:05:16.259> there<00:05:18.349> then<00:05:19.349> I<00:05:19.650> find<00:05:19.919> it's
