the<00:01:22.710> mirror<00:01:22.950> welding<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.549> very<00:01:23.759> different

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
the mirror welding is very different

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.399 
the mirror welding is very different
difficult<00:01:24.869> cuz<00:01:25.140> you're<00:01:25.320> always<00:01:26.299> operating

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
difficult cuz you're always operating

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.380 
difficult cuz you're always operating
opposite<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.500> what<00:01:28.680> you're<00:01:28.829> actually<00:01:29.070> doing

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
opposite of what you're actually doing

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.560 
opposite of what you're actually doing
where<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:31.250> you're<00:01:32.250> operating<00:01:32.729> with<00:01:33.270> what

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
where is this you're operating with what

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.600 
where is this you're operating with what
you're<00:01:33.780> doing<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.740> know<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.159> don't<00:01:35.369> have<00:01:35.490> to

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
you're doing you know you don't have to

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.749 
you're doing you know you don't have to
adjust<00:01:37.640> this<00:01:39.740> very<00:01:40.740> user-friendly<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.549> easy

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
adjust this very user-friendly is easy

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.499 
adjust this very user-friendly is easy
to<00:01:41.880> use<00:01:42.020> just<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.229> minute<00:01:43.860> or<00:01:43.950> two<00:01:44.360> to<00:01:45.360> get<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
to use just a minute or two to get the

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.230 
to use just a minute or two to get the
system<00:01:45.750> going<00:01:46.049> if<00:01:46.679> your<00:01:46.829> mirror<00:01:47.100> welding<00:01:47.520> over

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
system going if your mirror welding over

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.179 
system going if your mirror welding over
being<00:01:48.450> able<00:01:48.539> to<00:01:48.630> see<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:48.990> you're<00:01:49.799> you're<00:01:50.130> not

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
being able to see it you're you're not

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.200 
being able to see it you're you're not
gonna<00:01:50.340> be<00:01:50.460> able<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.610> tell<00:01:50.729> you're<00:01:50.939> gonna<00:01:51.000> make

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
gonna be able to tell you're gonna make

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.940 
gonna be able to tell you're gonna make
mistakes<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.869> you're<00:01:52.020> just<00:01:52.229> you're<00:01:52.770> just

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
mistakes and you're just you're just

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.620 
mistakes and you're just you're just
gonna<00:01:53.069> kind<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.369> guess<00:01:53.549> where<00:01:53.970> as<00:01:54.090> this<00:01:54.420> takes

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
gonna kind of guess where as this takes

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.960 
gonna kind of guess where as this takes
the<00:01:54.720> guesswork<00:01:54.780> out<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.319> it<00:01:55.530> it's<00:01:56.099> 50%<00:01:56.490> less

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
the guesswork out of it it's 50% less

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.749 
the guesswork out of it it's 50% less
time<00:01:57.299> practicing<00:01:58.229> with<00:01:59.099> this<00:01:59.250> system<00:01:59.490> then

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
time practicing with this system then

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.880 
time practicing with this system then
you<00:01:59.849> look<00:01:59.970> through<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.209> mirror<00:02:00.420> it's<00:02:01.319> easily

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
you look through the mirror it's easily

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.300 
you look through the mirror it's easily
twice<00:02:02.369> as<00:02:02.549> fast<00:02:02.959> and<00:02:03.959> it's<00:02:04.319> it's<00:02:04.679> a<00:02:04.770> lot<00:02:04.920> easier

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
twice as fast and it's it's a lot easier

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.859 
twice as fast and it's it's a lot easier
just<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.700> get<00:02:06.000> up<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.209> get<00:02:06.270> going<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:06.689> she's

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
just to get up you get going so she's

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.199 
just to get up you get going so she's
actually<00:02:07.049> better<00:02:07.409> than<00:02:07.590> what<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.890> get

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
actually better than what you get

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.430 
actually better than what you get
unobstructed<00:02:09.209> through<00:02:09.810> well<00:02:10.019> comet<00:02:10.349> because

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
unobstructed through well comet because

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.240 
unobstructed through well comet because
it<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.489> so<00:02:11.670> much<00:02:11.819> darker<00:02:12.330> but<00:02:12.900> with<00:02:13.049> the<00:02:13.799> system

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
it is so much darker but with the system

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.920 
it is so much darker but with the system
you<00:02:14.610> know<00:02:14.730> you're<00:02:15.060> getting<00:02:15.299> a<00:02:15.390> full<00:02:15.630> view

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
you know you're getting a full view

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.400 
you know you're getting a full view
color<00:02:16.709> picture<00:02:17.160> of<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.940> weld<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.540> it's<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.260> lot

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
color picture of the weld and it's a lot

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.550 
color picture of the weld and it's a lot
easier<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.739> see<00:02:19.920> for<00:02:20.730> one<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.930> can<00:02:22.079> change<00:02:22.260> the

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
easier to see for one you can change the

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.039 
easier to see for one you can change the
position<00:02:22.769> of<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.790> camera<00:02:23.970> around<00:02:24.329> while

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
position of the camera around while

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.380 
position of the camera around while
you're<00:02:25.230> welding<00:02:25.850> to<00:02:26.850> get<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.030> different<00:02:27.299> view

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
you're welding to get a different view

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.030 
you're welding to get a different view
to<00:02:28.140> be<00:02:28.260> more<00:02:28.410> comfortable<00:02:29.989> you<00:02:30.989> can<00:02:31.350> inspect

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
to be more comfortable you can inspect

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.340 
to be more comfortable you can inspect
the<00:02:32.220> weld<00:02:32.400> afterward<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.750> can<00:02:33.780> zoom<00:02:34.049> in<00:02:34.230> on

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
the weld afterward you can zoom in on

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.140 
the weld afterward you can zoom in on
the<00:02:34.440> check<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.769> fill<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.130> you<00:02:35.340> can<00:02:35.549> check<00:02:35.790> to

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
the check to fill it you can check to

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.759 
the check to fill it you can check to
make<00:02:36.299> sure<00:02:36.359> it's<00:02:36.840> even<00:02:36.989> if<00:02:37.319> it<00:02:37.440> was<00:02:37.530> something

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
make sure it's even if it was something

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.890 
make sure it's even if it was something
that<00:02:37.799> was<00:02:37.980> ever<00:02:38.220> it<00:02:39.000> was<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.299> be<00:02:39.389> inspected<00:02:39.810> by

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
that was ever it was to be inspected by

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.680 
that was ever it was to be inspected by
somebody<00:02:40.260> else<00:02:40.819> you<00:02:41.819> can<00:02:41.970> see<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.209> heat<00:02:42.389> marks

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
somebody else you can see the heat marks

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.870 
somebody else you can see the heat marks
on<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.900> steel<00:02:43.190> you<00:02:44.190> can<00:02:44.310> see<00:02:44.519> all<00:02:44.639> this<00:02:44.760> stuff

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
on the steel you can see all this stuff
