00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
grows downwards to degrees so it should

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.550 
grows downwards to degrees so it should
be<00:03:52.840> heated<00:03:53.319> up<00:03:53.440> now<00:03:54.840> then<00:03:55.840> right<00:03:55.989> here<00:03:56.230> it

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
be heated up now then right here it

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.610 
be heated up now then right here it
comes<00:03:56.889> apart<00:03:57.370> and<00:03:57.910> I<00:03:58.630> what<00:03:58.780> you<00:03:58.810> do<00:03:58.989> is<00:03:59.139> you<00:03:59.290> of
