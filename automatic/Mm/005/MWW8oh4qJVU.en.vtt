 we work until we get a grainy mixture weighing red 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.280
 this is an operation that, to speed things up, you want to do even with 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.280

 trust this operation must be brief as the butter heats up 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:43.329
 would burn the pasta in technical terms 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.160
 the moment we go to lay it down we could have problems 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.380
 rip off 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.710
