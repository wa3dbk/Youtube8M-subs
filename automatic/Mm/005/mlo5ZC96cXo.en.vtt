flat Reed to begin my basket they've

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.560 
flat Reed to begin my basket they've
been<00:00:57.950> soaking<00:00:58.250> in<00:00:58.489> water<00:00:58.730> so<00:00:59.239> they're<00:00:59.390> very

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
been soaking in water so they're very

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.560 
been soaking in water so they're very
flexible<00:01:00.340> after<00:01:01.340> marking<00:01:01.730> the<00:01:01.850> center<00:01:02.329> I

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
flexible after marking the center I

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.020 
flexible after marking the center I
secured<00:01:03.470> them<00:01:03.739> it<00:01:03.890> just<00:01:04.040> pushed<00:01:04.399> a<00:01:04.549> grip<00:01:04.759> pin

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
secured them it just pushed a grip pin

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.170 
secured them it just pushed a grip pin
right<00:01:05.479> through<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:05.899> middle<00:01:06.729> one<00:01:07.729> of<00:01:07.759> the

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
right through the middle one of the

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.469 
right through the middle one of the
spokes<00:01:08.540> needs<00:01:09.200> to<00:01:09.440> be<00:01:09.560> split<00:01:09.920> in<00:01:10.310> half<00:01:10.850> so<00:01:11.450> that

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
spokes needs to be split in half so that

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.410 
spokes needs to be split in half so that
we<00:01:11.690> have<00:01:11.870> an<00:01:11.960> odd<00:01:12.200> number<00:01:12.770> of<00:01:12.950> spokes<00:01:13.850> for<00:01:14.390> a

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
we have an odd number of spokes for a

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.090 
we have an odd number of spokes for a
basket<00:01:15.520> scissors<00:01:16.990> will<00:01:17.990> split<00:01:18.380> that<00:01:18.560> spoke

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
basket scissors will split that spoke

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.830 
basket scissors will split that spoke
very<00:01:19.400> easily<00:01:19.640> because<00:01:20.090> it's<00:01:20.270> very<00:01:20.420> flexible

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
very easily because it's very flexible

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.690 
very easily because it's very flexible
so<00:01:23.840> at<00:01:24.170> this<00:01:24.290> point<00:01:24.470> I'm<00:01:24.620> going<00:01:24.710> to<00:01:24.770> pull<00:01:25.490> these

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
so at this point I'm going to pull these

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.640 
so at this point I'm going to pull these
out<00:01:25.880> so<00:01:25.940> that<00:01:26.299> they<00:01:26.420> look<00:01:26.630> like<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:27.049> spokes<00:01:27.409> on

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
out so that they look like the spokes on

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.910 
out so that they look like the spokes on
a<00:01:27.680> wagon<00:01:28.070> wheel<00:01:28.270> and<00:01:29.270> I'm<00:01:29.960> going<00:01:30.200> to<00:01:30.229> begin<00:01:30.409> my

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
a wagon wheel and I'm going to begin my

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.160 
a wagon wheel and I'm going to begin my
weaving<00:01:31.549> by<00:01:31.880> twining<00:01:32.830> this<00:01:33.830> is<00:01:33.979> hemp<00:01:34.310> cord<00:01:35.170> I'm

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
weaving by twining this is hemp cord I'm

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.920 
weaving by twining this is hemp cord I'm
gonna<00:01:36.350> start<00:01:36.770> by<00:01:36.979> just<00:01:37.250> tying<00:01:38.150> it<00:01:38.479> onto<00:01:38.900> a

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
gonna start by just tying it onto a

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:45.840 
gonna start by just tying it onto a
spoke

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.270 

and<00:01:48.190> we'll<00:01:49.190> start<00:01:49.520> by<00:01:49.730> weaving<00:01:50.830> just<00:01:51.830> under

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
and we'll start by weaving just under

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.020 
and we'll start by weaving just under
and<00:01:52.430> over<00:01:52.870> alternating<00:01:53.870> each<00:01:54.140> spoke<00:01:54.800> the<00:01:55.760> term

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
and over alternating each spoke the term

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.020 
and over alternating each spoke the term
twining<00:01:56.690> comes<00:01:57.170> from<00:01:57.440> the<00:01:57.530> practice<00:01:58.010> of<00:01:58.040> using

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
twining comes from the practice of using

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.020 
twining comes from the practice of using
twine<00:01:59.440> to<00:02:00.440> filled<00:02:00.710> these<00:02:00.860> small<00:02:01.340> openings<00:02:01.880> at

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
twine to filled these small openings at

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.540

the center of the basket base and this

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.520 
the center of the basket base and this
just<00:02:04.790> helps<00:02:04.880> to<00:02:05.060> make<00:02:05.150> it<00:02:05.360> extra<00:02:05.930> sturdy<00:02:08.530> I'm

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
just helps to make it extra sturdy I'm

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
to read that are just long enough to

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.910 
to read that are just long enough to
overlap<00:04:18.270> the<00:04:18.450> circumference<00:04:18.930> of<00:04:19.200> the<00:04:19.410> basket

by about an inch you want to use two to
three<00:04:24.120> of<00:04:24.150> these<00:04:24.500> just<00:04:25.500> so<00:04:25.650> that<00:04:25.800> you<00:04:25.890> get<00:04:26.100> a

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
three of these just so that you get a

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.610 
three of these just so that you get a
nice<00:04:26.460> sturdy<00:04:26.970> rim<00:04:27.360> you<00:04:27.660> could<00:04:27.840> use<00:04:28.020> a<00:04:28.050> bundle

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
of round reads also for this so I've

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.190 
of round reads also for this so I've
placed<00:04:31.920> one<00:04:32.490> in<00:04:32.700> front<00:04:33.000> of<00:04:33.210> and<00:04:33.450> one<00:04:33.600> behind<00:04:33.960> of

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
placed one in front of and one behind of

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.770 
placed one in front of and one behind of
each<00:04:34.380> spoke<00:04:34.830> and<00:04:35.360> secured<00:04:36.360> them<00:04:36.540> with<00:04:36.750> a

each spoke and secured them with a
binder<00:04:37.410> clip<00:04:37.440> you<00:04:38.040> could<00:04:38.160> also<00:04:38.310> use<00:04:38.580> a

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
binder clip you could also use a

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.450 
binder clip you could also use a
clothespin<00:04:39.060> to<00:04:39.630> keep<00:04:39.900> them<00:04:40.140> in<00:04:40.380> place<00:04:40.440> so<00:04:41.310> then

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
clothespin to keep them in place so then
