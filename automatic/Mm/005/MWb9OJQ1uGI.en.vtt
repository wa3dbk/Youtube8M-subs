watching

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.090 

now<00:00:21.689> hopefully<00:00:22.199> when<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:22.470> retrieve<00:00:22.859> your

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
now hopefully when you retrieve your

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.679 
now hopefully when you retrieve your
spat<00:00:23.400> bags<00:00:23.699> they'll<00:00:24.060> look<00:00:24.210> nice<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.600> clean

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
spat bags they'll look nice and clean

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.630 
spat bags they'll look nice and clean
like<00:00:25.019> this<00:00:25.260> with<00:00:25.529> some<00:00:25.740> sea<00:00:25.920> scallops<00:00:25.980> in<00:00:26.490> them

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
like this with some sea scallops in them

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.419 
like this with some sea scallops in them
when<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.630> open<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.019> bags<00:00:28.230> up<00:00:28.529> you're<00:00:29.220> likely

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
when you open the bags up you're likely

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.700 
when you open the bags up you're likely
going<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.880> get<00:00:30.150> scallops<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:31.050> varying<00:00:31.410> sizes

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
going to get scallops of varying sizes

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.610 
going to get scallops of varying sizes
and<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.640> variety<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.149> other<00:00:33.510> bivalve<00:00:34.079> or<00:00:34.350> other

settling<00:00:35.130> organisms<00:00:35.790> in<00:00:35.940> there<00:00:36.710> beware<00:00:37.710> if

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
settling organisms in there beware if

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.030 
settling organisms in there beware if
you<00:00:38.340> leave<00:00:38.640> your<00:00:38.820> bags<00:00:39.030> out<00:00:39.239> too<00:00:39.480> long<00:00:39.690> though

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
you leave your bags out too long though

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.650 
you leave your bags out too long though
you<00:00:41.040> stand<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.460> chance<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.879> suffering<00:00:42.329> damage

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
you stand the chance of suffering damage

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.260 
you stand the chance of suffering damage
like<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:46.309> bag<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.579> could<00:00:48.059> have<00:00:48.149> been

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
like this bag so that could have been

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.090 
like this bag so that could have been
deployed<00:00:48.629> too<00:00:48.899> long<00:00:49.110> or<00:00:49.320> likely<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:49.890> some

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
deployed too long or likely to have some

deployed too long or likely to have some
big<00:00:50.219> sculpts<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:50.820> them<00:00:50.969> but<00:00:51.570> they're<00:00:51.719> also

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
big sculpts in them but they're also

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.600 
big sculpts in them but they're also
likely<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.469> have<00:00:52.680> some<00:00:52.829> predators<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.460> there

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
likely to have some predators in there

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.270 
likely to have some predators in there
like<00:00:53.820> lobsters<00:00:54.360> or<00:00:55.199> starfish<00:00:55.710> which<00:00:55.980> may<00:00:56.190> in

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
like lobsters or starfish which may in

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.650 
like lobsters or starfish which may in
fact<00:00:56.340> be<00:00:56.699> bigger<00:00:56.910> than<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.210> scallops<00:00:57.600> that

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
fact be bigger than the scallops that

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.290 
fact be bigger than the scallops that
are<00:00:57.870> inside<00:00:58.140> them<00:00:58.379> or<00:00:58.640> even<00:00:59.640> fish<00:00:59.879> like<00:01:00.120> this

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300
