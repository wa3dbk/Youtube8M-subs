00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.720
 difficult but if you propose and with the 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.540
 daily effort that with your videos with 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.000

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.140
 let's say it's my biggest dream my dream 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:14.890
 what do I want to achieve but what I know is 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.530
 one thing that you try to get but 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.069
 it's complicated and what is yours 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.019
 partner 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.139
 to see, my biggest dream is to continue 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:26.239
 having people as fantastic as my 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:28.489
 subscribers in my channel like all 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.829
 you since sometimes I see many 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.659
 nice comments on our videos and 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:34.879
 I really like reading them 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:37.609
 and answer them as you know, I answer 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.530
 all and well not many people put us 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.239
 your comments and good another dream 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.920
 It is also to continue growing as 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.879
 we are doing now as good as 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.919
 You know 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.510
 thanks to this xxxiii I will see that we 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:49.819
 they have there in the knew that thank you very much 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.760
 we are growing at a good pace and 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:56.209
 good that this continues and good as we 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.609
 There's plenty of gp time and all that asks if 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.109
 it seems to you that you upload on your channel like this 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:02.870
 encourage a little bit of people to be 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:05.030
 go through it because my channel is a channel 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.519
 very similar like the one we are now 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.730
 same and it is a channel dedicated to the call of 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.290
 duty and starting flash now if you try 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.629
 a little bit in 'the vanguard' which is a 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.489
 more complicated game with more than 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:19.609
 it requires more skill that is more 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.889
 complicated is a channel very similar to 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:24.800
 this and that if you like this channel stem and 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:26.900
 mine may you like less 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.420
 or even more than I doubt because this 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.100
 channel for me is like when I upload a 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.350
 video that the first one is the first one 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.220
 gets in is like a hook is a vice 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:39.680
 bad and it's are games of blacos 2 of 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:44.660
 advanced warfare to the series try 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:49.520
 angry blogs some random and are things 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:51.620
 very similar channel and that my 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.230
 best targets games of white 2 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.200
 They are 100 casualties that are on the channel 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.910
 almost 100 casualties I have a lot of 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.130
 Good matches of black or two for 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.190
 upload but you expect me to upload them for 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.230
 have more people and more support in let's say 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.120
 for which there were more people than 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.030
 I prefer that more people see my videos 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.860
 that he does not see it that much and is dedicated to 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.750
 call of duty I can also upload another 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.820
 game that maybe you can upload it 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.640
 but that depends on you that I 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.700
 say ideas or my subscribers 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.470
 let's say I'm prompted to say this 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.590
 game you may like that you do not like 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:30.230
 and give me that idea to upload it but 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:34.610
 basically it's call of duty 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:35.780
 of series and things like that run those yeah good 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.090
 the truth that I'm pretty 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.070
 hooked to your channel as well 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.900

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.700
 channel in the description and good nothing else 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.200

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.630

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.820

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.550
 a screenshot with a video video that 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.380

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.390
