with<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.549> HP<00:00:05.940> laserjet<00:00:06.420> 11<00:00:06.779> 60<00:00:07.309> LaserJet<00:00:08.309> 1320

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
with the HP laserjet 11 60 LaserJet 1320

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.100 
with the HP laserjet 11 60 LaserJet 1320
in<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.870> p20<00:00:10.710> one<00:00:10.980> five<00:00:11.280> series<00:00:11.790> on<00:00:11.940> all<00:00:12.599> three

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
in the p20 one five series on all three

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.799 
in the p20 one five series on all three
of<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.259> machines<00:00:13.969> the<00:00:14.969> components<00:00:15.570> are<00:00:15.660> the

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
of the machines the components are the

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.630 
of the machines the components are the
same<00:00:16.020> so<00:00:16.230> this<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.529> great<00:00:16.830> time<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.220> do<00:00:17.340> three

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
same so this is a great time to do three

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.150 
same so this is a great time to do three
machines<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.300> actually<00:00:19.289> show<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:19.770> how<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:19.980> do

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
to use a number two Phillips and just

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.920 
to use a number two Phillips and just
work<00:00:38.760> in<00:00:38.910> some<00:00:39.059> good<00:00:39.239> light<00:00:39.420> that's<00:00:39.690> really

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
work in some good light that's really

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.860 
work in some good light that's really
all<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.200> need<00:00:40.489> these<00:00:41.489> machines<00:00:41.940> over<00:00:42.629> time

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
all you need these machines over time

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.580 
all you need these machines over time
have<00:00:43.190> been<00:00:44.190> known<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.840> wear<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.050> feed<00:00:46.320> roller

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
have been known to wear the feed roller

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.959 
have been known to wear the feed roller
real<00:00:46.980> fast

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
real fast

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.790 
real fast
they<00:00:48.210> don't<00:00:48.390> really<00:00:48.600> get<00:00:48.870> big<00:00:49.260> life<00:00:49.530> out<00:00:49.770> of

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
they don't really get big life out of

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.290 
they don't really get big life out of
them<00:00:50.010> like<00:00:50.039> some<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.610> other<00:00:50.760> HP<00:00:51.149> machines

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
them like some of the other HP machines

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.779 
them like some of the other HP machines
HP<00:00:51.960> chose<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.410> use<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> Halfmoon<00:00:53.160> pickup

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
HP chose to use like a Halfmoon pickup

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.200 
HP chose to use like a Halfmoon pickup
roller<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.300> they<00:00:55.020> don't<00:00:55.170> really<00:00:55.320> last<00:00:55.649> as<00:00:55.890> long

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
roller so they don't really last as long

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.360 
roller so they don't really last as long
the<00:00:57.210> first<00:00:57.449> thing<00:00:57.629> I'd<00:00:57.719> like<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:58.020> do<00:00:58.280> pull<00:00:59.280> the

but<00:01:15.570> HP<00:01:16.259> just<00:01:16.650> sold<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.189> many<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.490> these

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
but HP just sold so many of these

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.030 
but HP just sold so many of these
machines<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.630> course<00:01:18.900> they<00:01:19.080> have<00:01:19.229> other

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
machines and of course they have other

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.859 
machines and of course they have other
little<00:01:20.400> quirks<00:01:20.670> with<00:01:20.909> them<00:01:21.060> besides<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.659> but

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
little quirks with them besides this but

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.700 
little quirks with them besides this but
this<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.560> great<00:01:22.770> look<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.720> cura<00:01:24.720> printer

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
this is just a great look a cura printer

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.100 
this is just a great look a cura printer
that<00:01:25.860> might<00:01:26.100> have<00:01:26.310> 50<00:01:26.909> 60<00:01:27.090> thousand<00:01:27.630> pages<00:01:27.990> on

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
that might have 50 60 thousand pages on

that might have 50 60 thousand pages on
it<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.409> suffers<00:01:28.829> from<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.850> know<00:01:29.939> paper

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
it that suffers from you know paper

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.399 
it that suffers from you know paper
jamming<00:01:30.540> you're<00:01:30.659> always<00:01:30.780> pulling<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.200> paper

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
jamming you're always pulling that paper

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.010 
jamming you're always pulling that paper
tray<00:01:31.710> out<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.070> I'm<00:01:32.820> using<00:01:33.030> paper<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:33.810> not

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
tray out and I'm using paper just not

quite making it too far

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.920 
quite making it too far
maybe<00:01:35.790> it's<00:01:35.909> pulling<00:01:36.180> more<00:01:36.329> than<00:01:36.390> one<00:01:36.659> three

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
maybe it's pulling more than one three

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.280 
maybe it's pulling more than one three
and<00:01:37.170> there<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.420> this<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.720> separation

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
varieties of HP machines then just

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.589

side and then I like to just turn the

side and then I like to just turn the
roller<00:04:09.959> until<00:04:10.410> it<00:04:10.650> finds<00:04:10.919> its<00:04:11.130> spot
