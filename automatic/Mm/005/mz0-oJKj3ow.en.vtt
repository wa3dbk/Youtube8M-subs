00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.490
 but if they want to leave it there I 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.159
 how I do not want it 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.090
 it does not take away 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.159
 in the framework of this 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.990
 what is called a direct access in 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.990
 the desk 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.990
 container 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.119

 let's go to registration 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.849
 I'm sure that amount 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.700
 and we will have the urge to fort and only 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.239
 we have to give double our 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.239
 administrator permission 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.450
 We thank you 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.040
 but let's apply 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:21.130
 and we have here the statistics of 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:24.230
 our hard drive we have health 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:29.000
 in my case it has a 29% 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.590
 100% of the temperature of 26 degrees 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.040
 after here they have many options 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.840
 for example to make the hard disk 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.700
 answer 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.030
 here for that the mint 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.340
 precisely the different units 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.420
 will clean the unit 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.819
 and throw away the internet registry of 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.390
 data recovery analysis and for 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.490
 erase data that can not be deleted 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.490
