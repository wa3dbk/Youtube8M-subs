 hello friends that welcome is 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.110
 recipe from the university cook today 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.570
 we are going to eat stuffed eggs 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.160
 tuna and soy sauce and for that you need 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.809
 a quarter of chopped onion three 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.850
 heaping tablespoons ketchup three 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.070
 mayonnaise also filled with mayonnaise 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.440
 two cans of tuna soy sauce 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.390
 now you see the link of how to cook 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:30.560
 the eggs as always space the table 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.560
 a bowl and let's take 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:41.930
 the onion and a good drizzle of sauce 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.790
 of soya and what we do is mix it 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.010
 once we have been booking 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.500
 we have the peels we take the filling 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.350
 we have an egg we split it by the 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.760
 half we need the yolk we leave here 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.649
 the clear the filling takes it that way with 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.360
 all the eggs do it already we have it 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.340
 all separated and now we take from the 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.500
 uglier clear that we see 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.580
 We apply by filling the past for what 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.800
 we mix everything go well mixed already 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.229
 we'll have the filling ready now let's go 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.490
 when we assemble them we make a hole 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.900
 the things that gives me the most in the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.220
 kitchen of having to make eggs 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.830
 stuffed every time I had to do 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.510
 ice eggs pissed me an egg and 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.420
 I did not like it very much because it was located 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:28.380
 one way I said what I do is the 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.600
 filling and I have done it at the bottom of the 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.920
 source of the dish where you are going to put 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.350
 the eggs are also worth filling and 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.290
 Now let 's taking clear and the 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.060
 we are putting on high now with the 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.430
 You are going to get a little bit of 7 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.259
 down and clear how it is caught with a 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.000
 spoon when picking it up with a spoon 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.800
 we directly take it out where it is 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.540
 so that we will put the do 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.119
 the following we add a bit of 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.910
 mayonnaise so high so not much that 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.760
 see which are eggs that are mos bay 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.070
 a little bit of egg 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.380
 we would throw a little parsley 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.250
 chopped for lame good to spoon for 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.180
 that you see it and this would be the result 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.040
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.790
