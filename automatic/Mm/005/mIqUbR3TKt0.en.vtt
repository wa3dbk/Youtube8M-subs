00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.540
 in this video we will see how we can configure the screen resolution 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.779
 the screen resolution 

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:10.539
 I can say 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:13.539
 what 

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:17.409
 that sang horizontally as in vertical 

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:20.779
 what is it that represents percent on the screen 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.119
 a greater number of pixels 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.630
 The smaller objects were the objects that we see but they will have 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.519
 higher quality 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.099
 well to reconfigure the resolution 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.220
 Per hundred I take fast again spurs the right button 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:36.280
 a desk 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.810
 and we see that we have 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.520
 a motion in minutes 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.900
 that screen is solved 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.950
 we went 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.920
 and we are going to open the configuration window of the assumption of saints 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.160
 well that window we see the following 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.630
 first we see as kind of gap in a monitor with a desk 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.090
 hong kong numbering 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.090
 some buttons that allow to detect if there 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.510
 more connected monitors played 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.620
 will check if there is i + d of a monitor 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.360
 respondents in this case does not happen 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.050
 and a vote that by identifying destiny to say that the monitor that is 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.910
 using the kent abyss 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.710
 cooper number indicators where you have in this case we see that it is in a 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.850
 that street style and setting 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.030
 well the lower one I see the screens collected and as I only have one 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.410
 I can is the one that appears 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.500
 it might look like the graphics card 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.920
 the resolution 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.170
 age keem shows in 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.640
 pixels in both horizontal 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.640
 that is issued 66 as in the verticals 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.900
 if I spike that the people can set 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.910
 other resolutions 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.910
 Valerian take into account 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.770
 what percent 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.370
 in the case of tft monitors 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.010
 percent there is an optimal solution 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.220
 ok that's the one that was agreed to shreds 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.220
 to have the best quality 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.950
 they struggle to change the orientation wells see the work very frontal 

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:13.179
 the Mexican 

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:17.559
 in horizontal flipped end backwards i vertical ortega 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:23.420
 for example to change the resolution we are going to oppose a smaller 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:26.509
 800 position 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:30.209
 and we will appreciate how in this step it is less 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.120
 eladia that I have for the soloist the jets I will see it bigger and I will have mere 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.849
 space on the desk 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.869
 in fact I saved myself warning 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:43.629
 that tells me that if it brings its function in the case of the amount that I have 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:47.489
 is less than 1024 768 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.489
 it is possible that for a moment they do not fit on the screen 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:52.939
 well let's apply them 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:57.209
 your notice we already see how the window of copulation occupies me practically 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.209
 all the desk thing that did not happen before 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.329
 we are going to revert so that the changes are not conserved and we go back to 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.329
 our science resolution 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:16.059
 well if you changed for example guidance because it's not the truth something that is 

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:19.349
 useful but we have an option 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.329
 for example in withdrawal 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.379
 We have like 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.379
 change the display 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.319
 let's go back to principle 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:34.639
 i good 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.719
 this is the option we have 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:39.649
 change the screen resolution
