and<00:01:06.350> this<00:01:06.410> meteor<00:01:06.830> attack<00:01:07.130> isn't<00:01:07.369> that<00:01:07.580> hard

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
and this meteor attack isn't that hard

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.490 
and this meteor attack isn't that hard
to<00:01:07.880> avoid<00:01:08.119> his<00:01:08.270> range<00:01:08.540> or<00:01:08.840> sidestep<00:01:09.350> the

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
to avoid his range or sidestep the

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:18.279 
to avoid his range or sidestep the
meteors<00:01:15.910> and<00:01:16.910> now<00:01:17.240> that<00:01:17.420> he<00:01:17.509> has<00:01:17.570> serpent<00:01:18.110> mobs

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289

meteors and now that he has serpent mobs
out<00:01:18.590> I<00:01:19.750> recommend<00:01:20.750> having<00:01:20.869> some<00:01:21.110> kind<00:01:21.259> of

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
out I recommend having some kind of

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.870 
out I recommend having some kind of
attack<00:01:21.710> that's<00:01:21.950> going<00:01:22.130> to<00:01:22.190> allow<00:01:22.280> you<00:01:22.430> to<00:01:22.670> hit

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
attack that's going to allow you to hit

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.670 
attack that's going to allow you to hit
while<00:01:23.270> as<00:01:23.570> well<00:01:23.750> as<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:23.930> mobs<00:01:24.170> at<00:01:24.410> the<00:01:24.500> same

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
while as well as the mobs at the same

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.400 
while as well as the mobs at the same
time<00:01:26.229> for<00:01:27.229> me<00:01:27.350> that<00:01:27.590> skill<00:01:27.830> is<00:01:27.979> frost<00:01:28.310> arrow

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
time for me that skill is frost arrow

00:01:29.410 --> 00:02:26.070 
time for me that skill is frost arrow
ouch<00:01:30.410> I<00:01:31.720> was<00:01:32.720> almost<00:01:32.869> my<00:01:33.170> death

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.000 

alright<00:02:27.080> a<00:02:27.110> little<00:02:27.200> more<00:02:27.470> comfortable<00:02:27.770> now

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
alright a little more comfortable now

00:02:28.010 --> 00:03:28.060 
alright a little more comfortable now
that<00:02:28.040> he's<00:02:28.280> prep<00:02:31.480> not<00:02:32.480> too<00:02:32.660> comfortable

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.680 

so<00:03:29.070> in<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.250> third<00:03:29.460> phase<00:03:29.700> I<00:03:29.760> can't<00:03:30.360> afford<00:03:30.630> it

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
so in the third phase I can't afford it

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.130 
so in the third phase I can't afford it
hit<00:03:30.930> by<00:03:31.050> anything<00:03:31.710> or<00:03:32.340> I'm<00:03:32.430> going<00:03:32.580> to<00:03:32.730> die

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
especially with this michelle inside get

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:44.590 
especially with this michelle inside get
a<00:03:36.660> lucky<00:03:36.930> dodge<00:03:37.340> but<00:03:38.340> i<00:03:38.370> can't<00:03:38.640> rely<00:03:38.880> on<00:03:38.910> that

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.900 

there's<00:03:45.560> one<00:03:45.620> of<00:03:45.860> his<00:03:45.950> attacks<00:03:46.220> the<00:03:46.550> triple

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:03.400 
attack single attack another triple
attack<00:04:00.130> breath<00:04:01.130> and<00:04:01.490> for<00:04:02.420> me<00:04:02.570> I<00:04:02.600> avoid<00:04:03.080> that<00:04:03.230> by

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
attack breath and for me I avoid that by

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.350 
attack breath and for me I avoid that by
smoke<00:04:03.710> screen<00:04:05.680> and<00:04:06.700> now<00:04:07.700> he's<00:04:07.880> in<00:04:08.120> his

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
smoke screen and now he's in his

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.840

explosion<00:04:09.230> fists<00:04:09.530> were<00:04:09.920> six<00:04:10.190> darman's<00:04:10.670> and

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
explosion fists were six darman's and

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.730 
explosion fists were six darman's and
ground<00:04:11.120> I<00:04:11.480> can't<00:04:11.720> afford<00:04:11.870> to<00:04:12.140> get<00:04:12.290> by<00:04:12.410> any<00:04:12.620> of

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
ground I can't afford to get by any of

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:19.950 
ground I can't afford to get by any of
this<00:04:12.890> at<00:04:13.160> all<00:04:13.310> this<00:04:13.820> will<00:04:14.000> one<00:04:14.180> shot<00:04:14.450> man<00:04:14.690> I

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:19.960 

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:27.280 

need<00:04:20.960> to<00:04:21.020> maintain<00:04:21.200> DPS<00:04:22.330> otherwise<00:04:26.170> you<00:04:27.170> will

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
need to maintain DPS otherwise you will

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:38.969 
need to maintain DPS otherwise you will
enrage<00:04:27.650> and<00:04:27.710> then<00:04:28.100> I'm<00:04:28.190> really<00:04:28.520> screwed

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.020 

it<00:04:39.979> doesn't<00:04:40.190> have<00:04:40.280> a<00:04:40.310> whole<00:04:40.490> lot<00:04:40.520> of<00:04:40.639> attacks

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
it doesn't have a whole lot of attacks

00:04:41.030 --> 00:05:22.550 
it doesn't have a whole lot of attacks
so<00:04:41.360> he's<00:04:41.479> kind<00:04:41.630> of<00:04:41.750> predictable

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:29.340 

it's<00:05:23.560> a<00:05:23.650> breath

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:37.239 

single<00:05:30.100> attack<00:05:32.760> their<00:05:33.760> single<00:05:34.060> attack

00:05:37.239 --> 00:05:37.249 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:49.740 

triple<00:05:38.059> attack<00:05:42.609> breath

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:06:00.450 

triple<00:05:50.530> attack

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:07.820 

triple<00:06:01.460> attack

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:29.770 

breath<00:06:13.350> explosion<00:06:14.350> fizz

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.790 

breath

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:48.469 

triple<00:06:35.580> attack<00:06:35.849> I<00:06:38.060> got<00:06:47.180> all<00:06:48.180> right<00:06:48.300> so<00:06:48.360> that's

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 
triple attack I got all right so that's

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:49.550 
triple attack I got all right so that's
going<00:06:48.659> to<00:06:48.720> do<00:06:48.780> it<00:06:48.840> for<00:06:48.900> this<00:06:48.990> video<00:06:49.139> everyone

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560
