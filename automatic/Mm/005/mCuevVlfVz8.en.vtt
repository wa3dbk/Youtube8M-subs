00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
column he's tricky to know if to play

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.209 
column he's tricky to know if to play
your<00:00:12.150> feeling<00:00:12.509> in<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.660> wheel<00:00:13.009> it's<00:00:14.009> just<00:00:14.070> a

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
your feeling in the wheel it's just a

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.890 
your feeling in the wheel it's just a
wheel<00:00:14.370> itself<00:00:14.759> or<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.299> steering<00:00:15.540> wheel<00:00:15.750> is

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
wheel itself or the steering wheel is

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.410 
wheel itself or the steering wheel is
wobbling<00:00:16.139> so<00:00:16.560> what<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:16.740> did<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:17.220> looked<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.940> belt

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
wobbling so what I did I looked the belt

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.820 
wobbling so what I did I looked the belt
through<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:18.779> so<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.140> wheeler<00:00:19.410> can<00:00:19.529> only<00:00:19.650> move

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
through it so the wheeler can only move

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.340 
through it so the wheeler can only move
that<00:00:19.890> much<00:00:20.330> and<00:00:21.330> now<00:00:21.480> when<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.689> shake<00:00:21.960> my<00:00:22.140> wheel

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
that much and now when I shake my wheel

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:38.800 
that much and now when I shake my wheel
is<00:00:22.380> pretty<00:00:22.650> evident<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.250> have<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.430> problem<00:00:29.390> yeah

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.970 

let's<00:00:39.810> fill<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.140> one<00:00:40.320> hand<00:00:40.940> come<00:00:41.940> on<00:00:42.980> both

millimeter<00:00:56.640> nut<00:00:56.850> right<00:00:57.030> over<00:00:57.240> here<00:00:57.420> and

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
millimeter nut right over here and

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.410 
millimeter nut right over here and
that's<00:00:58.260> actually<00:00:58.500> 36<00:00:59.160> millimeters<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.210> big

this end this is a real pain we use the

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:04.040 
this end this is a real pain we use the
monster<00:02:02.820> registers<00:02:03.360> right<00:02:03.539> there

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
monster registers right there

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.800 
monster registers right there
you<00:02:05.039> monster<00:02:05.700> wrench<00:02:06.350> both<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.530> these<00:02:08.569> tie<00:02:09.569> rod

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
you monster wrench both of these tie rod

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.559 
you monster wrench both of these tie rod
ends<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.110> got<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.380> pull<00:02:10.590> towards<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.420> pull<00:02:12.420> to

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
ends you got to pull towards you pull to

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.940 
ends you got to pull towards you pull to
the<00:02:12.690> front<00:02:12.720> of<00:02:12.990> the<00:02:13.050> truck<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:13.650> just<00:02:13.770> give

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
the front of the truck and you just give

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.160 
the front of the truck and you just give
it<00:02:13.980> one<00:02:14.069> good<00:02:14.220> yank<00:02:14.610> boom<00:02:15.540> thing<00:02:15.870> starts

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
it one good yank boom thing starts

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.460 
it one good yank boom thing starts
turning

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
turning

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.370 
turning
so<00:02:18.480> it's<00:02:19.480> pretty<00:02:19.630> easy<00:02:19.750> when<00:02:20.140> you<00:02:20.230> get<00:02:20.320> a

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
so it's pretty easy when you get a

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.520 
so it's pretty easy when you get a
gigantic<00:02:20.860> wrench<00:02:21.220> put<00:02:21.490> by<00:02:21.670> one<00:02:22.020> it's<00:02:23.020> not<00:02:23.170> even

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
gigantic wrench put by one it's not even

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.010 
gigantic wrench put by one it's not even
