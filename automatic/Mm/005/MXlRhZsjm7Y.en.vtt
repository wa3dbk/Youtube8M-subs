00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
so that we can get to the seedbed we

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.070 
so that we can get to the seedbed we
want<00:01:02.620> to<00:01:02.710> scrape<00:01:02.949> out<00:01:03.219> these<00:01:04.000> bitter<00:01:04.330> seeds<00:01:04.750> in

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
the center of our cucumber we just use a

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:15.440 
the center of our cucumber we just use a
spoon<00:01:06.909> for<00:01:07.149> that<00:01:08.729> just<00:01:09.729> like<00:01:10.030> that

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.039 

then<00:01:16.259> using<00:01:16.469> my<00:01:16.649> knuckles<00:01:17.189> as<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.340> guide<00:01:17.460> I

cut<00:01:36.400> it<00:01:36.520> in<00:01:36.640> half<00:01:36.670> lengthways<00:01:37.329> and<00:01:37.770> again<00:01:38.770> in

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
cut it in half lengthways and again in

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:46.109 
cut it in half lengthways and again in
half<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.610> we<00:01:42.700> use<00:01:42.909> spoon<00:01:43.509> to<00:01:44.049> remove<00:01:44.790> seed<00:01:45.790> pod

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
half and we use spoon to remove seed pod

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.380 
half and we use spoon to remove seed pod
from<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.570> middle<00:01:46.810> of<00:01:46.869> the<00:01:46.930> cucumber<00:01:48.390> like

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
from the middle of the cucumber like

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.800 
from the middle of the cucumber like
that<00:01:51.869> then<00:01:52.869> we<00:01:52.960> simply<00:01:53.320> cut<00:01:53.560> it<00:01:53.649> into<00:01:53.920> about

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
that then we simply cut it into about

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.020 
that then we simply cut it into about
half<00:01:55.810> inch<00:01:56.369> chunks<00:01:58.170> lengthwise<00:01:59.170> pieces<00:02:00.030> lay

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
half inch chunks lengthwise pieces lay

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:08.039 
half inch chunks lengthwise pieces lay
them<00:02:01.149> crossways<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:02.640> we<00:02:03.640> cut<00:02:03.880> them<00:02:06.840> into<00:02:07.840> a

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.049 
them crossways and we cut them into a

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:18.800 
them crossways and we cut them into a
dice<00:02:08.289> and<00:02:08.729> that's<00:02:09.729> how<00:02:09.940> you<00:02:10.000> dice<00:02:10.330> a<00:02:10.360> cucumber

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810
