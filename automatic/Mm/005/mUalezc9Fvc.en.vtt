00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 keeping the ball away from the fuck 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.879
 found a great last minute basket 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.330
 maybe we play the series on these 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.889
 last hackett possessions eg 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.059
 but i green goes on bobby brown 10 for 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.139
 close the action by stone trials 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.940
 resist now it's up to him 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.460
 defend still remains for up to number six 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.960
 crazy goat steps back attack 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.410
 dario I'm apologizing this time 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.410
 brown 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:27.480
 mutu and siena but it is only one possession 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:31.270
 no master of the other beautiful pattese 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.010
 context that disturbed them 0 27 in the 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:39.699
 his race on the evening venue is 29 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:43.480
 of race 1 er to attack kangur foul 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:46.150
 however the pitfall of all gyms artist 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.090
 obviously no two pitches were heard 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.340
 free for ages 20 was above all a 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:55.600
 pole foul of daniel hackett is gone 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:59.010
 intervene trying to steal the ball and 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.010
 are two free throws opinion 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:08.560
 to sign the first remain 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.330
 Write down 27 seconds 93 three cents 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.119
 93 seconds difference between two 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:19.810
 clock and yesterday is 2 of 2 again 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:22.149
 score equal game very beautiful 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:26.080
 very nice very good half passes 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:29.649
 field there is never green on him 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:33.070
 attention also to possible faults 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.869
 tacticians 8 to close action 7 again 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.820
 now on bobby brown you take it 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.520
 space from two points same pitch 8 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.750
 hackett to rebound 4 seconds three seconds 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.320
 the very difficult shot that the hand 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.140
 left 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.509
 I speak spent says the arbitration triad 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.600
 from the defense of varese and daniel hackett 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.429
 in the lunette also 17 at the end varese not 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.380
 they wanted to spend it, they can 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.659
 have intentionally or absolutely 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.880
 if varese had wanted to spend a 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.920
 he would have spent it much earlier 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.659
 to try to have then seconds for 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.119
 going to the basket there is the other fifth 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.069
 by mike varese varese has chosen ha 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.970
 He chose to defend it and he did it 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.130
 very well done 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.069
 surely even this does not do it 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.860
 but he wanted to do it on the pitch 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.690
 they go to the greens the moment they are too 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.140
 went to pull past the courage 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.959
 very reminiscent of the foul of the match of 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:27.060
 varese when but the greens took the last 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:31.599
 shot and bobby brown went to his arm 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:34.390
 market is wrong the first was 7 of 7 fin 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:37.150
 here the pressure is felt at 117 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.330
 by the end their 17 minutes a second e 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.330
 17 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.859
 we see second check and varese that 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.460
 still from the mazda to be able to call 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:52.250
 rightly if he calls it 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.170
 of course 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.030
 actually entering the rest of the 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.580
 game counts what then in the moment 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.110
 does not seem 17 an outgoing player for 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.930
 a throw though 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.720
 marked very difficult comes out wins the 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:09.600
 montepaschi siena on 3 1 after having 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.710
 chased throughout the race for everyone 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.360
 no 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.430
 and it is perhaps the decisive point of this 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.380
 series under our post from a 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.710
 lager to jump on all fans and 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.800
 entered the field here is that final 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.770
 This is definitely this victory 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.480
 more difficult than it was due 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.670
 achieve these play offs 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.210
 dear fans in the field as if you were 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.250

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.100
 emotions that gave this party this 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.810
 match to the public are equal to one 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.810
 decisive final game
