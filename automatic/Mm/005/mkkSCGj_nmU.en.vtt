00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
look at the the vu meter on this iPhone

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.530 
look at the the vu meter on this iPhone
here<00:00:32.660> notice<00:00:33.660> how<00:00:33.840> its<00:00:34.969> average<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.300> about

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
here notice how its average is about

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.450 
here notice how its average is about
seven<00:00:37.940> you'll<00:00:38.940> see<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.270> peak<00:00:40.460> there's

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
seven you'll see it peak there's

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.010 
seven you'll see it peak there's
obviously<00:00:41.820> something<00:00:42.120> happen<00:00:42.540> happening

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
obviously something happen happening

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
suppose

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.560 
suppose
anyway<00:01:01.379> reason<00:01:02.379> why<00:01:02.470> I'm<00:01:02.559> testing<00:01:02.980> this<00:01:03.129> is<00:01:03.309> I

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
anyway reason why I'm testing this is I

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.420 
anyway reason why I'm testing this is I
wonder<00:01:04.570> if<00:01:04.690> this<00:01:04.930> is<00:01:04.960> a<00:01:05.140> you<00:01:05.950> know<00:01:05.979> what<00:01:06.220> if<00:01:06.310> the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
wonder if this is a you know what if the

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.830 
wonder if this is a you know what if the
cats<00:01:06.670> and<00:01:06.909> dogs<00:01:07.090> can<00:01:07.330> hear<00:01:07.420> this<00:01:07.630> type<00:01:07.810> of

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
cats and dogs can hear this type of

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.520 
cats and dogs can hear this type of
stuff<00:01:08.310> what<00:01:09.310> human<00:01:09.700> hearing<00:01:10.030> is<00:01:10.150> about<00:01:10.900> twenty

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
stuff what human hearing is about twenty

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.650 
stuff what human hearing is about twenty
to<00:01:11.680> twenty<00:01:12.070> thousand<00:01:12.580> at<00:01:13.360> best

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
to twenty thousand at best

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.859 
to twenty thousand at best
probably<00:01:16.660> more<00:01:17.050> like<00:01:17.650> I<00:01:18.040> don't<00:01:18.610> know<00:01:18.850> 80<00:01:19.660> to

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
probably more like I don't know 80 to

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:30.510 
probably more like I don't know 80 to
15k<00:01:21.240> just<00:01:22.240> guessing<00:01:25.770> but<00:01:27.509> but<00:01:28.509> anyways<00:01:28.869> so<00:01:29.520> so

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
15k just guessing but but anyways so so

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.810 
15k just guessing but but anyways so so
this<00:01:30.729> let's<00:01:31.450> say<00:01:31.660> this<00:01:31.840> is<00:01:31.899> you<00:01:32.350> know<00:01:32.820> 15,000

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
this let's say this is you know 15,000

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.580 
this let's say this is you know 15,000
plus<00:01:34.000> hear<00:01:34.509> the<00:01:35.380> mic<00:01:35.560> on<00:01:35.890> this<00:01:36.280> iPhone<00:01:36.520> here<00:01:37.119> I

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
plus hear the mic on this iPhone here I

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.620 
plus hear the mic on this iPhone here I
think<00:01:38.590> it<00:01:38.680> picks<00:01:38.890> up<00:01:39.070> about<00:01:39.220> 20<00:01:39.700> to<00:01:39.820> 20,000<00:01:40.539> I<00:01:40.600> I

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
think it picks up about 20 to 20,000 I I

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.630 
think it picks up about 20 to 20,000 I I
don't<00:01:41.200> really<00:01:41.440> know<00:01:41.680> but<00:01:41.920> that's<00:01:42.009> what<00:01:42.250> I<00:01:42.340> I

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
don't really know but that's what I I

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.260 
don't really know but that's what I I
kind<00:01:43.179> of<00:01:43.240> guess<00:01:45.060> what<00:01:46.060> tapping<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:46.869> wrong<00:01:47.020> one

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
kind of guess what tapping the wrong one

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.770 
kind of guess what tapping the wrong one
there<00:01:49.270> you<00:01:49.420> go<00:01:50.610> okay<00:01:51.610> now<00:01:51.940> watch<00:01:52.240> what<00:01:52.420> happens

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
there you go okay now watch what happens

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:01.309 
there you go okay now watch what happens
when<00:01:52.990> I<00:01:53.520> unplug<00:01:54.520> it<00:01:55.709> set<00:01:56.709> that<00:01:56.890> down

does work the iPhone that is plug it
back<00:02:29.200> in

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.020 

and<00:02:40.440> definitely<00:02:40.650> some<00:02:40.890> there<00:02:41.250> let's<00:02:41.730> record

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
and definitely some there let's record

00:02:42.030 --> 00:03:07.440 
and definitely some there let's record
it

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:22.349 

this<00:03:08.450> is<00:03:08.629> what<00:03:08.780> it<00:03:08.870> reported<00:03:14.290> interesting
