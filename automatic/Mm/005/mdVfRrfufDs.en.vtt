 or crab meat for those who can 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.290
 to do it, I really love it, I love it 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.090
 I like the taste of more delicious and I'm going 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.080
 to combine it with green pepper 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.080
 Red pepper 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.660
 green chilito so that if without the heart 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:29.039
 cilantro and raw island for ok if 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:33.030
 we mix perfectly heart 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.510
 let's put in another vinegar bowl of 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.190
 rice or the one you have at home 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.829
 let's find the super sauce of 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.839
 fish are called ampla that is in the 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.040
 aisle of oriental products 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:49.129
 nautla that exactly and sugar play 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:54.540
 let's see what it is because it is medium 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:56.280
 a water progressing water there is no water to use 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.350
 a balloon whisk 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.289
 it's a bit big but it does not matter 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.280
 balloon beater at the end exactly 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:07.760
 it's good to slice a half papaya 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.190
 will dissipate the presentation 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.930
 and the water I must say so that if the 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.970
 mix depending on the quality of the 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.950
 anchor that can be better very very fine 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.930
