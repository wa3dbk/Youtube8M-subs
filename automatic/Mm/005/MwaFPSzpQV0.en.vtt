party this weekend so let's give it a
shot<00:00:24.720> all<00:00:25.710> right<00:00:25.920> so<00:00:26.130> here's<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.460> machine

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
shot all right so here's the machine

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.450 
shot all right so here's the machine
basically<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:28.410> put<00:00:28.590> some<00:00:28.740> ice<00:00:28.920> in<00:00:28.950> the<00:00:29.250> top

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
basically you put some ice in the top

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.749 
basically you put some ice in the top
here<00:00:29.790> and<00:00:30.710> important<00:00:31.710> thing<00:00:32.189> about<00:00:32.369> this

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
here and important thing about this

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.069 
here and important thing about this
machine<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.270> makes<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.570> different<00:00:33.780> than

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
machine that makes it different than

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.080 
machine that makes it different than
using<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.410> blender<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.280> shaves<00:00:35.670> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
using a blender is that it shaves the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.209 
using a blender is that it shaves the
ice<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:37.020> just<00:00:37.320> makes<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:38.100> know<00:00:38.129> a

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
ice and that just makes it you know a

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.520 
ice and that just makes it you know a
lot<00:00:38.640> better<00:00:38.670> than<00:00:39.149> putting<00:00:39.660> ice<00:00:39.899> in<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.140> blender

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
lot better than putting ice in a blender

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.790 
lot better than putting ice in a blender
so<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:41.550> shaves<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.870> drops<00:00:43.199> it<00:00:43.379> down<00:00:43.530> into

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
so it shaves it it drops it down into

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.739 
so it shaves it it drops it down into
this<00:00:44.010> little<00:00:44.339> blender<00:00:44.969> pitcher<00:00:45.420> which<00:00:45.600> we

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:45.749 
this little blender pitcher which we

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:49.479 
this little blender pitcher which we
already<00:00:45.899> have<00:00:46.019> our<00:00:46.730> margarita<00:00:47.730> mix<00:00:48.030> and

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
already have our margarita mix and

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.279 
already have our margarita mix and
tequila<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.969> there's<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.659> blender<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.170> there

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
tequila and there's a blender in there

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.579 
tequila and there's a blender in there
you<00:00:52.409> can<00:00:52.559> kind<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.829> see<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.100> blades<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:54.589> yeah

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:55.589 
you can kind of see the blades so yeah

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:01.250 
you can kind of see the blades so yeah
let's<00:00:55.879> see<00:00:56.879> how<00:00:56.909> this<00:00:57.120> thing<00:00:57.329> works<00:00:59.989> good<00:01:00.989> back

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
let's see how this thing works good back

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.810 
let's see how this thing works good back
on<00:01:02.569> we<00:01:03.569> locked<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.170> there<00:01:04.350> tight<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:05.550> I<00:01:05.610> guess
