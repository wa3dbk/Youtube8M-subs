 Bauer and numerous media representatives 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.510
 The new pizza factory was now the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.510
 taken operation 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.260
 additional 70 million pizzas 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.899
 here annually from the band with it becomes 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.519
 The production capacity at 350 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.740
 million frozen foods a year 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.750
 rise in the frozen pizza market 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.340
 We also have clear potential 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.950
 We talk about the last months and years 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.290
 actually at the capacity limit 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.759
 produced and and therefore should say 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.320
 I make these investments around 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.540
 to rebuild the capacity as well 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.070
 the new production plant was replaced 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.470
 the most recent standards for 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.570
 technology noise and environmental protection built 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.430
 and allows against older plants 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.560
 a lower water and 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.290
 Energy consumption at the same time becomes like that 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.869
 We launched less co2 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.280
 the best intended in the first place 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.680
 technology 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.960
 So seen ecologically ie 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.479
 Low water consumption 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.250
 heat energy recovery of heat 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.310
 All this is included here 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.330
 tradition and modern technology both 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.730
 will be in with the factory opening 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.470
 Nonnweiler unites and creates with 50 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.050
 new jobs economic 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.970
 impulses for the region as well as one 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.990
 future-oriented approach to 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.990
