had I had another meal and I believe

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.840 
had I had another meal and I believe
that<00:04:24.900> uh<00:04:24.930> Ariela<00:04:25.889> did<00:04:26.100> too<00:04:26.310> I<00:04:26.340> think<00:04:26.699> Boston

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
that uh Ariela did too I think Boston

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.370 
that uh Ariela did too I think Boston
had<00:04:27.270> his<00:04:27.509> uh<00:04:28.280> shake<00:04:29.280> and<00:04:29.910> I<00:04:30.000> think<00:04:30.270> it<00:04:30.389> carbs

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
had his uh shake and I think it carbs

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.430 
had his uh shake and I think it carbs
and<00:04:31.530> I<00:04:31.590> think<00:04:31.800> he<00:04:31.889> says<00:04:32.490> he<00:04:32.669> chooses<00:04:33.000> uh<00:04:33.440> it's

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
and I think he says he chooses uh it's

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.350 
and I think he says he chooses uh it's
not<00:04:34.680> other<00:04:34.949> carbs<00:04:35.370> from<00:04:35.550> Gaspar<00:04:36.060> I<00:04:36.090> was
