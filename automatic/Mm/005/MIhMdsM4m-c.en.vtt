00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
remember going into it and playing like

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.629 
remember going into it and playing like
an<00:05:53.110> emulation<00:05:53.500> of<00:05:53.770> it<00:05:53.889> because<00:05:54.370> there's<00:05:54.550> been

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 
an emulation of it because there's been

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:56.339 
an emulation of it because there's been
no<00:05:54.699> release<00:05:55.270> of<00:05:55.449> it<00:05:55.539> other<00:05:55.690> than<00:05:55.900> the<00:05:56.020> arcade
