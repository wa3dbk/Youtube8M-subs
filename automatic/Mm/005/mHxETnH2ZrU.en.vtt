00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
we've got the front service line here

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.560 
we've got the front service line here
and<00:00:39.270> here<00:00:40.760> we've<00:00:41.760> taken<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.180> rest<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.480> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
and here we've taken the rest of the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.360 
and here we've taken the rest of the
court<00:00:42.840> out<00:00:43.079> because<00:00:43.469> that's<00:00:43.739> no<00:00:43.950> longer<00:00:44.160> in

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
court out because that's no longer in

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.330 
court out because that's no longer in
play<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.289> this<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.739> line<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.190> runs

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
play and this is the line that runs

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.240 
play and this is the line that runs
underneath<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.149> net<00:00:48.770> once<00:00:49.770> we<00:00:49.980> get<00:00:50.100> the

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
underneath the net once we get the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.430 
underneath the net once we get the
graphics<00:00:50.640> software<00:00:50.850> working<00:00:51.539> properly<00:00:51.809> then

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
graphics software working properly then

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.660 
graphics software working properly then
this<00:00:52.890> will<00:00:53.039> be<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.160> completely<00:00:53.550> different

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
this will be a completely different

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.340 
this will be a completely different
format<00:00:54.360> but<00:00:54.390> for<00:00:54.690> now<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:54.840> want<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.140> make<00:00:55.320> sure

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
format but for now I want to make sure

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.990 
format but for now I want to make sure
you<00:00:55.710> get<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.039> information<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.760> that's<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
you get the information and that's the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.650 
you get the information and that's the
important<00:00:57.420> thing

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
important thing

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.849 
important thing
so<00:00:58.440> if<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.649> net<00:00:58.829> doubles<00:00:59.420> the<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.690> areas<00:01:01.530> are

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
so if the net doubles the in areas are

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.369 
so if the net doubles the in areas are
between<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.399> Nets<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.329> front<00:01:03.690> service

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
between the Nets and this front service

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.240 
between the Nets and this front service
line<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.700> pocket<00:01:05.970> here<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.830> here<00:01:07.830> and

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
line in this pocket here and here and

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.770 
line in this pocket here and here and
obviously<00:01:08.369> on<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.880> other<00:01:08.970> side<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.510> court

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
obviously on the other side of the court

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.440 
so for beginners what I'm looking to do
here<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.630> focus<00:01:34.290> more<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.850> accuracy<00:01:36.180> of

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
here is focus more on the accuracy of

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.260 
here is focus more on the accuracy of
the<00:01:36.630> shots<00:01:36.960> rather<00:01:37.590> than<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.979> movement<00:01:38.460> so

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
the shots rather than the movement so

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.789 
the shots rather than the movement so
the<00:01:39.420> players<00:01:39.690> are<00:01:39.869> always<00:01:40.049> stood<00:01:40.440> where<00:01:40.650> we

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
the players are always stood where we

are<00:01:40.920> now<00:01:41.190> and<00:01:41.580> their<00:01:42.509> area<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:44.009> cover<00:01:44.220> just

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
are now and their area is to cover just

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.960 
are now and their area is to cover just
here<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.440> don't<00:01:46.440> want<00:01:46.649> them<00:01:46.770> how<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:46.979> move<00:01:47.369> too

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
far in any direction let's focus on

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.200 
far in any direction let's focus on
getting<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:51.210> shots<00:01:51.539> right<00:01:52.440> and<00:01:53.090> improve<00:01:54.090> the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
getting the shots right and improve the

the<00:01:56.340> movement<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:58.320> way<00:01:58.470> the<00:01:58.649> game<00:01:58.830> works<00:01:59.039> is

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
the movement the way the game works is

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.350

very<00:01:59.369> simple<00:02:00.140> we<00:02:01.140> serve<00:02:01.440> from<00:02:01.740> here<00:02:02.069> I'm<00:02:03.030> going

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
very simple we serve from here I'm going

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.960 
very simple we serve from here I'm going
to<00:02:03.450> serve<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:04.050> into<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.500> area<00:02:04.979> or<00:02:05.550> serve<00:02:05.819> it

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
to serve it into this area or serve it

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.759

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:12.559 
cross-court into this area after that we
only<00:02:10.979> score<00:02:11.400> points<00:02:12.000> when<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.239> shuttle<00:02:12.450> comes

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
only score points when the shuttle comes

only score points when the shuttle comes
over<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.140> net<00:02:13.319> lands<00:02:14.100> in<00:02:14.600> these<00:02:15.600> particular

areas if it shuttle goes beyond this

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.650 
areas if it shuttle goes beyond this
line<00:02:19.440> then<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.370> is<00:02:20.519> out<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.150> points<00:02:21.540> is

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
line then it is out and the points is

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.100 
line then it is out and the points is
one<00:02:21.900> for<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.170> other<00:02:22.500> side<00:02:23.690> scoring<00:02:24.690> is<00:02:24.989> the

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
one for the other side scoring is the

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.750 
one for the other side scoring is the
same<00:02:25.380> as<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.650> have<00:02:25.830> in<00:02:25.980> badminton<00:02:26.190> today<00:02:26.700> so

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
same as you have in badminton today so

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.289 
same as you have in badminton today so
it's<00:02:27.090> 1<00:02:27.299> point<00:02:27.600> per<00:02:27.930> rally<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:30.120> can

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
it's 1 point per rally and you can

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.729 
it's 1 point per rally and you can
decide<00:02:30.630> whether<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:30.989> want<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.200> play<00:02:31.350> to<00:02:31.410> 5

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
decide whether you want to play to 5

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.009 
decide whether you want to play to 5
points<00:02:32.370> or<00:02:32.519> with<00:02:32.670> you're<00:02:32.790> on<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:32.940> play<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.239> 11<00:02:33.720> or

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
15 or 20 one that's up to you so once we

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.210 
15 or 20 one that's up to you so once we
have<00:02:38.220> served<00:02:38.579> we<00:02:39.540> have<00:02:39.690> a<00:02:39.720> played<00:02:40.220> straight

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
have served we have a played straight

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.990 
have served we have a played straight
net<00:02:41.459> shots<00:02:41.790> or<00:02:42.090> cross-court<00:02:42.930> net<00:02:43.110> shots<00:02:43.440> and

net shots or cross-court net shots and

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.300 
net shots or cross-court net shots and
the<00:02:45.000> important<00:02:45.570> aspect<00:02:46.140> that<00:02:46.410> we<00:02:47.070> talked

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
the important aspect that we talked

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.330 
the important aspect that we talked
about<00:02:47.340> in<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.850> coaching<00:02:48.329> tips<00:02:48.570> is<00:02:49.440> making

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
about in the coaching tips is making

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.000 
about in the coaching tips is making
sure<00:02:50.640> that<00:02:51.030> we<00:02:51.690> are<00:02:51.870> crossing<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.590> nets<00:02:52.799> at

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
sure that we are crossing the nets at

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.870 
sure that we are crossing the nets at
certain<00:02:53.489> points<00:02:54.150> those<00:02:55.079> focal<00:02:55.680> points<00:02:56.160> in

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
certain points those focal points in

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.000 
certain points those focal points in
order<00:02:57.269> to<00:02:57.420> ensure<00:02:57.810> that<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:58.230> shuttle<00:02:58.500> remains

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
order to ensure that the shuttle remains

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.479 
order to ensure that the shuttle remains
in<00:02:59.840> so<00:03:00.840> if<00:03:01.739> a<00:03:01.890> player<00:03:02.160> is<00:03:02.340> at<00:03:02.489> this<00:03:02.670> point<00:03:03.060> here

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
in so if a player is at this point here

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.150 
in so if a player is at this point here
there<00:03:05.489> will<00:03:05.700> be<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:06.000> focal<00:03:06.420> point<00:03:06.890> if<00:03:07.890> they

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
there will be the focal point if they

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.770 
there will be the focal point if they
aim<00:03:08.370> for<00:03:08.400> here<00:03:09.530> by<00:03:10.530> definition<00:03:11.299> the<00:03:12.299> shuttle

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
aim for here by definition the shuttle

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.099 
aim for here by definition the shuttle
will<00:03:13.320> fall<00:03:13.590> out<00:03:13.769> of<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.220> court<00:03:14.870> so<00:03:15.870> it's<00:03:16.049> a

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
will fall out of the court so it's a

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.430 
will fall out of the court so it's a
base<00:03:16.380> level<00:03:16.769> all<00:03:17.700> I'm<00:03:18.030> looking<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.720> achieve<00:03:18.810> as

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
base level all I'm looking to achieve as

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.160 
base level all I'm looking to achieve as
I<00:03:19.500> say<00:03:19.769> is<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.760> shuffle<00:03:21.000> staying<00:03:21.630> in<00:03:21.930> the

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
I say is the shuffle staying in the

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.650 
I say is the shuffle staying in the
courts<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.709> we<00:03:22.950> improve<00:03:23.310> on<00:03:23.609> the<00:03:24.090> quality<00:03:24.120> of

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
courts and we improve on the quality of

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.530 
courts and we improve on the quality of
the<00:03:24.750> shots<00:03:25.609> as<00:03:26.609> the<00:03:27.000> players<00:03:27.239> get<00:03:27.510> better

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
the shots as the players get better

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.009 
the shots as the players get better
sulfa<00:03:28.940> intermediate-advanced<00:03:29.940> then<00:03:30.600> we<00:03:30.780> move

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
sulfa intermediate-advanced then we move

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.420 
sulfa intermediate-advanced then we move
the<00:03:31.410> base<00:03:31.880> further<00:03:32.880> across

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
the base further across

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.849 
the base further across
so<00:03:35.430> our<00:03:35.579> starts<00:03:35.970> our<00:03:36.120> starting<00:03:36.720> positions<00:03:37.290> and

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
so our starts our starting positions and

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:41.569 
so our starts our starting positions and
our<00:03:38.609> recovery<00:03:39.060> positions<00:03:40.130> need<00:03:41.130> to<00:03:41.160> reflect

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
our recovery positions need to reflect

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:42.550 
our recovery positions need to reflect
what<00:03:42.000> happens<00:03:42.389> in

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
what happens in

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.309 
what happens in
again<00:03:43.300> we'll<00:03:44.300> leave<00:03:44.450> these<00:03:44.630> plays<00:03:44.900> here<00:03:45.200> we'll

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
again we'll leave these plays here we'll

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.500 
again we'll leave these plays here we'll
just<00:03:45.349> focus<00:03:45.830> on<00:03:45.980> these<00:03:46.190> two<00:03:46.459> so<00:03:47.330> for

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
just focus on these two so for

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.740 
just focus on these two so for
intermediate<00:03:48.050> and<00:03:48.140> advanced<00:03:49.360> if<00:03:50.360> a<00:03:50.450> sugar

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
intermediate and advanced if a sugar

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.110 
intermediate and advanced if a sugar
comes<00:03:50.989> onto<00:03:51.200> your<00:03:51.349> side<00:03:51.680> of<00:03:51.709> the<00:03:51.860> court<00:03:52.120> the

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
comes onto your side of the court the

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.979 
comes onto your side of the court the
plane<00:03:53.360> will<00:03:53.720> move<00:03:54.170> in<00:03:54.410> play<00:03:54.860> the<00:03:55.040> shot<00:03:55.989> move

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
plane will move in play the shot move

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.490 
plane will move in play the shot move
out<00:03:57.260> and<00:03:57.470> threaten<00:03:58.400> the<00:03:58.760> return<00:03:59.209> if<00:04:00.170> it's<00:04:00.380> a

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
out and threaten the return if it's a

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.470 
out and threaten the return if it's a
straight<00:04:00.860> return<00:04:01.370> then<00:04:02.060> they're<00:04:02.269> in<00:04:02.390> a

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
straight return then they're in a

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.670 
straight return then they're in a
position<00:04:02.780> to<00:04:03.640> threaten<00:04:04.640> that<00:04:05.000> return<00:04:05.360> if<00:04:06.080> they

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
position to threaten that return if they

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.580 
position to threaten that return if they
play<00:04:07.099> across<00:04:07.880> court<00:04:08.269> then<00:04:09.260> what<00:04:09.470> I'm

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
play across court then what I'm

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.610 
play across court then what I'm
expecting<00:04:10.340> the<00:04:10.640> player<00:04:10.910> to<00:04:11.150> do<00:04:11.330> is<00:04:11.930> move<00:04:12.349> the

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
expecting the player to do is move the

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.930 
expecting the player to do is move the
bass<00:04:12.860> across<00:04:13.430> and<00:04:14.230> face<00:04:15.230> the<00:04:16.010> direction<00:04:16.280> from

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
bass across and face the direction from

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.060 
bass across and face the direction from
which<00:04:17.120> the<00:04:17.180> shuttle<00:04:17.690> could<00:04:17.870> come<00:04:18.229> so<00:04:18.829> they're

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
which the shuttle could come so they're

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.580 
which the shuttle could come so they're
starting<00:04:19.489> to<00:04:19.639> move<00:04:19.790> across<00:04:20.090> the<00:04:20.389> net<00:04:20.630> to<00:04:21.260> cover

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
starting to move across the net to cover

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.800 
starting to move across the net to cover
what<00:04:22.310> would<00:04:22.520> have<00:04:22.639> been<00:04:22.910> a<00:04:23.180> potential

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
what would have been a potential

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.770 
what would have been a potential
straight<00:04:24.410> return<00:04:25.330> obviously<00:04:26.330> in<00:04:26.389> this<00:04:26.540> case

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
straight return obviously in this case

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.500 
straight return obviously in this case
we<00:04:27.020> have<00:04:27.229> a<00:04:27.260> doubles<00:04:27.710> pair<00:04:28.010> but<00:04:28.820> I<00:04:28.880> still<00:04:29.180> want

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
we have a doubles pair but I still want

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.930 
we have a doubles pair but I still want
to<00:04:29.600> work<00:04:29.840> the<00:04:29.990> formation<00:04:30.740> so<00:04:31.520> that<00:04:31.820> the

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
to work the formation so that the

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.080 
to work the formation so that the
players<00:04:32.270> are<00:04:32.570> moving<00:04:33.110> some<00:04:33.889> distance<00:04:34.490> at<00:04:34.820> any

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
players are moving some distance at any

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.360 
players are moving some distance at any
time<00:04:35.450> in<00:04:36.200> order<00:04:36.440> to<00:04:36.500> cover<00:04:36.680> these<00:04:36.830> shots<00:04:37.190> and

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
time in order to cover these shots and

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.670 
time in order to cover these shots and
also<00:04:38.180> remember<00:04:38.720> that<00:04:38.750> this<00:04:39.050> could<00:04:39.290> be<00:04:39.380> a<00:04:39.410> very

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
also remember that this could be a very

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.230 
also remember that this could be a very
very<00:04:39.979> fast<00:04:40.250> game<00:04:40.580> because<00:04:40.880> we're<00:04:41.030> only

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
very fast game because we're only

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.920 
very fast game because we're only
working<00:04:41.660> in<00:04:42.290> a<00:04:42.440> very<00:04:42.590> confined<00:04:42.919> area<00:04:43.669> so<00:04:44.660> it<00:04:44.780> is

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
working in a very confined area so it is

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.340 
working in a very confined area so it is
very<00:04:45.139> much<00:04:45.380> hit<00:04:46.010> and<00:04:46.250> move<00:04:46.490> hit<00:04:46.910> and<00:04:47.120> move<00:04:47.350> so

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
very much hit and move hit and move so

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.800 
very much hit and move hit and move so
this<00:04:48.500> plane<00:04:48.770> is<00:04:48.890> going<00:04:48.919> to<00:04:49.100> work<00:04:49.250> quite<00:04:49.520> hard

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
this plane is going to work quite hard

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.380 
this plane is going to work quite hard
just<00:04:50.810> by<00:04:51.020> moving<00:04:51.289> into<00:04:52.280> the<00:04:52.550> net<00:04:52.760> playing<00:04:53.210> a

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
just by moving into the net playing a

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.690 
just by moving into the net playing a
shot<00:04:53.690> and<00:04:54.020> the<00:04:54.620> quality<00:04:55.070> shoves<00:04:55.340> of<00:04:55.520> that

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
shot and the quality shoves of that

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.390 
shot and the quality shoves of that
straight<00:04:56.479> or<00:04:56.960> cross<00:04:57.350> court<00:04:57.710> and<00:04:57.919> then

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
straight or cross court and then

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.360 
straight or cross court and then
stepping<00:04:58.700> out<00:04:59.060> to<00:04:59.240> recover<00:04:59.600> and<00:05:00.010> that's<00:05:01.010> it

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
stepping out to recover and that's it

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.510 
stepping out to recover and that's it
same<00:05:01.669> on<00:05:01.850> this<00:05:02.030> side<00:05:02.300> if<00:05:02.660> they<00:05:03.050> played<00:05:03.320> a<00:05:03.590> 400

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520

show before hand cross-court I expect

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.640 
show before hand cross-court I expect
the<00:05:07.250> player<00:05:07.520> to<00:05:07.789> move<00:05:08.000> they<00:05:08.660> played<00:05:09.020> the

the player to move they played the

the player to move they played the
shuttle<00:05:10.070> they<00:05:10.580> move<00:05:10.820> back<00:05:11.090> to<00:05:11.300> a<00:05:11.660> good<00:05:12.500> base

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:12.889 
shuttle they move back to a good base

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:15.850 
shuttle they move back to a good base
position<00:05:13.220> it's<00:05:13.729> threatening<00:05:14.210> that<00:05:14.450> return<00:05:14.930> if

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
position it's threatening that return if

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.010 
position it's threatening that return if
they've<00:05:16.220> played<00:05:16.550> the<00:05:16.760> cross-court<00:05:17.389> then

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
they've played the cross-court then

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.440 
they've played the cross-court then
expect<00:05:18.650> them<00:05:18.800> to<00:05:18.979> move<00:05:19.160> the<00:05:19.340> base<00:05:19.520> across<00:05:19.940> and

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
expect them to move the base across and

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.670 
expect them to move the base across and
be<00:05:21.370> focusing<00:05:22.370> on<00:05:22.610> that<00:05:22.940> area<00:05:23.000> and<00:05:23.750> where<00:05:24.500> the

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
be focusing on that area and where the

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.670 
be focusing on that area and where the
shuttle<00:05:24.889> may<00:05:25.190> cross<00:05:25.610> the<00:05:26.030> net<00:05:26.289> in<00:05:27.289> order<00:05:27.620> to

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
shuttle may cross the net in order to

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.610 
shuttle may cross the net in order to
try<00:05:27.889> and<00:05:27.919> intercept<00:05:28.460> it<00:05:28.900> as<00:05:29.900> it's<00:05:30.200> all<00:05:30.380> done

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
try and intercept it as it's all done

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.580 
try and intercept it as it's all done
before<00:05:30.740> so<00:05:31.729> the<00:05:31.910> move<00:05:32.120> the<00:05:32.330> base<00:05:32.479> across<00:05:32.990> they

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
before so the move the base across they

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.450 
before so the move the base across they
will<00:05:33.800> be<00:05:33.950> facing<00:05:34.820> that<00:05:35.660> direction<00:05:36.460> waiting

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
will be facing that direction waiting

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.490 
will be facing that direction waiting
for<00:05:37.700> its<00:05:37.820> own<00:05:38.030> if<00:05:38.539> a<00:05:38.660> straight<00:05:38.960> return<00:05:39.320> is

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
for its own if a straight return is

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.550 
for its own if a straight return is
played<00:05:40.360> we'll<00:05:41.360> just<00:05:41.570> take<00:05:41.780> that<00:05:42.020> person<00:05:42.470> out

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
played we'll just take that person out

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.900 
played we'll just take that person out
equation<00:05:44.080> play<00:05:45.080> would<00:05:45.680> be<00:05:46.039> in<00:05:46.100> a<00:05:46.220> position<00:05:46.370> to

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
equation play would be in a position to

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.670 
equation play would be in a position to
move<00:05:47.180> across<00:05:47.450> and<00:05:47.810> take<00:05:48.440> that<00:05:48.919> return<00:05:50.500> it's<00:05:51.500> a

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
move across and take that return it's a

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.740 
move across and take that return it's a
very<00:05:51.950> fast<00:05:52.250> game<00:05:52.550> when<00:05:52.789> when<00:05:53.150> played<00:05:53.450> well

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
very fast game when when played well

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.720

it's very enjoyable

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.000 
it's very enjoyable
and<00:05:56.180> it<00:05:56.300> really<00:05:56.660> does<00:05:56.960> work<00:05:56.990> your<00:05:57.500> shots<00:05:57.740> very

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010
