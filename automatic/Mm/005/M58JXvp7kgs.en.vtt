00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.530
 Hello dear viewers today 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.740
 you and I will land 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.450
 winter garlic is usually done for 5-6 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.520
 weeks before the onset of sustainable 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.590
 frost 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.400
 middle lane is about the last 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.920
 September decade first decade of October 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.990
 if you put garlic before cloves 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.680
 will give sprouts that in the winter can 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.170
 freeze out 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.750
 if you land later 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.550
 due date there is a risk that 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.250
 garlic will not have time to take root before 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.469
 frost 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.930
 best garlic will grow on loose 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.020
 neutral soils fit 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.530
 loam and sandy is important to choose for 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.899
 planting garlic is such a plot where in spring 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.590
 will not stagnate water and also 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.120
 it is desirable that it be well lit and 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.030
 plant garlic where this year 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.920
 made fresh manure because garlic in 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.890
 this case will give the tops and lush and 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.990
 heads will be loose besides such 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.510
 garlic is less resistant to fungal 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.060
 the disease why I first dug 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.180
 and forks to a depth of about 20 30 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.340
 centimeters and chose weed roots 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:22.280
 now i'm putting compost into it 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.280
 15 20 liters per 1 square meter 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.520
 then some superphosphate 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.540
 and potassium chloride 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:07.080
 too little if these fertilizers you 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.910
 no, you can add wood ash to the soil 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.600
 about one glass per 1 square 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.240
 meter 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.250
 fertilizer can not be made if before 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.480
 on the garden grew such cultures as 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.050
 cabbage radish beans and cucumbers at home from or 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.720
 the peppers 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.480
 and here on the garden where there used to be 1 bow and 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.760
 other root vegetables garlic is better not 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.630
 disembark because they drain 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.970
 stocks if in the ground and also after the bow 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.010
 pathogens may remain in the soil 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:41.430
 diseases that can strike 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.430
 garlic now I'm digging a bed 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.400
 for autumn planting should choose 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.530
 only spring winter garlic will not work 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.260
 before planting garlic on 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:34.710
 the bed of his head should be disassembled on 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:38.520
 teeth need to select and more 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:43.880
 large healthy teeth without signs 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.880
 damage from the grill 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:04:00.910
 These cloves are suitable for landing in 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.710
 this bowl I have planting material 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:07.440
 which I prepared in advance 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:10.290
 I make out a head of garlic on the teeth and 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.830
 held for 30 minutes in a fungicide solution 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.150
 Now we are going to plant the garlic 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.470
 plant garlic I will be in the grooves depth 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.470
 45 centimeters 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:33.569
 cloves are planted at a distance of 6 8 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.569
 centimeters apart 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:51.290
 I make the next groove at a distance 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.290
 about 20 centimeters from the previous one 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.200
 also upsetting garlic 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:20.280
 and plant garlic can be grandchildren like this 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.280
 make a riot 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:31.300
 also at a distance of 6 8 centimeters each 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:33.940
 away from each other and drop there teeth too 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:40.950
 they need not be pressed into soil 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:48.360
 make sure they touch the bottom of everything and 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:48.360
 just digging in our grooves and holes 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.330
 all garlic is planted after the first 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.280
 frost 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.280
 planting with garlic follows 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:00.030
 grumble with humus or compost 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:02.710
 a layer of about four centimeters in winter 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.370
 it is advisable to put on a bigger bed 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.640
 of snow 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:09.480
 That's actually all good landing you 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.480
 and a good harvest
