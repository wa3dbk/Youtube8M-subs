because<00:01:09.290> first<00:01:09.770> it<00:01:09.920> was<00:01:10.040> a<00:01:10.070> school<00:01:10.460> project

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
because first it was a school project

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.420 
because first it was a school project
but<00:01:11.690> also<00:01:11.720> because<00:01:12.320> I've<00:01:12.890> never<00:01:12.950> done

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
but also because I've never done

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.310 
but also because I've never done
lingerie<00:01:14.210> before<00:01:14.660> so<00:01:14.780> I<00:01:14.840> thought<00:01:14.990> it<00:01:15.110> would<00:01:15.200> be

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
lingerie before so I thought it would be

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.930
