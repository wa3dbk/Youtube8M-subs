Florida okay in this clip we're going to
talk<00:00:08.250> about<00:00:08.460> how<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.730> check<00:00:09.090> clutch<00:00:09.660> fluid

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
talk about how to check clutch fluid

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.530 
talk about how to check clutch fluid
level<00:00:10.440> this<00:00:11.130> would<00:00:11.340> be<00:00:11.580> on<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:11.910> car<00:00:12.269> with<00:00:12.509> a

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
level this would be on a car with a

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.839 
level this would be on a car with a
standard<00:00:12.990> transmission<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:14.099> uses<00:00:14.610> clutch

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
standard transmission that uses clutch

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.359 
standard transmission that uses clutch
fluid<00:00:15.299> instead<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.410> cable<00:00:16.800> system<00:00:16.980> which

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
fluid instead of a cable system which

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.420 
fluid instead of a cable system which
most<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.029> cars<00:00:18.270> nowadays<00:00:18.720> use<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:18.990> clutch

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
most of the cars nowadays use a clutch

most of the cars nowadays use a clutch
fluid<00:00:20.430> system<00:00:20.970> what<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:21.840> involves<00:00:22.380> is

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
fluid system what that involves is

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.529 
fluid system what that involves is
there's<00:00:22.949> be<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> reservoir<00:00:23.730> for<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.090> fluid

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
there's be a reservoir for the fluid

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.410 
there's be a reservoir for the fluid
level<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:25.619> keep<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:25.980> full<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:27.119> put<00:00:27.300> the

level you keep it full and you put the

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.450 
level you keep it full and you put the
same<00:00:27.570> fluid<00:00:27.869> in<00:00:28.109> there<00:00:28.289> as<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.439> put<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:28.949> brakes

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
same fluid in there as you put in brakes

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
at all and mostly on import cars you'll

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.549 
at all and mostly on import cars you'll
see<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.850> lot<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.149> this<00:01:00.359> type<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.930> problem<00:01:01.320> just

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
see a lot of this type of problem just

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.420 
see a lot of this type of problem just
this<00:01:01.770> car<00:01:01.980> right<00:01:02.160> here<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> Honda<00:01:02.940> Accord

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
this car right here is a Honda Accord

this car right here is a Honda Accord
does<00:01:05.430> not<00:01:05.670> have<00:01:05.880> clutch<00:01:06.180> fluid<00:01:06.390> because<00:01:06.869> this

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
does not have clutch fluid because this

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.500 
does not have clutch fluid because this
one<00:01:07.200> has<00:01:07.229> an<00:01:07.500> automatic<00:01:07.830> transmission<00:01:08.610> but<00:01:08.760> if

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
one has an automatic transmission but if

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.149 
one has an automatic transmission but if
you<00:01:09.659> did<00:01:09.900> have<00:01:10.110> clutch<00:01:10.350> fluid<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.890> would<00:01:11.040> be

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
you did have clutch fluid it would be

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.910 
you did have clutch fluid it would be
right<00:01:11.400> here<00:01:11.430> in<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.150> area<00:01:12.390> here's<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.170> brake

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
right here in this area here's the brake

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.249 
right here in this area here's the brake
master<00:01:14.189> cylinder<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:15.330> would<00:01:15.479> be<00:01:15.630> right<00:01:15.900> next

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
master cylinder it would be right next

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.560 
master cylinder it would be right next
to<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.439> same<00:01:17.340> type<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.610> fluid<00:01:17.970> goes<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.420> each

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
to it same type of fluid goes in each

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.140 
to it same type of fluid goes in each
one<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:19.100> lot<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.130> times<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.670> brake<00:01:20.909> master

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
one a lot of times the brake master

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.510 
one a lot of times the brake master
cylinder<00:01:21.689> will<00:01:21.869> feed<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.350> clutch<00:01:22.590> you'll<00:01:23.310> see

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
cylinder will feed the clutch you'll see

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.580 
cylinder will feed the clutch you'll see
a<00:01:23.549> separate<00:01:24.030> line<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.080> clutch<00:01:25.320> master

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
a separate line to the clutch master

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.429 
a separate line to the clutch master
cylinder<00:01:26.220> but<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.299> brake<00:01:27.509> fluid<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.020> what<00:01:28.259> you

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
cylinder but the brake fluid is what you

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.060 
cylinder but the brake fluid is what you
what<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.070> would<00:01:29.189> check<00:01:29.450> so<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.750> know<00:01:31.140> all<00:01:31.890> the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
what you would check so you know all the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.440 
what you would check so you know all the
cars<00:01:32.280> are<00:01:32.430> different<00:01:32.520> but<00:01:32.790> typically<00:01:33.299> they're

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
cars are different but typically they're

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.480 
cars are different but typically they're
right<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.990> same<00:01:34.170> area<00:01:34.229> you'll<00:01:35.040> find<00:01:35.100> the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
right in the same area you'll find the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.480 
right in the same area you'll find the
reservoir<00:01:35.970> for<00:01:36.240> clutch<00:01:36.479> fluid<00:01:36.979> always<00:01:37.979> right

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
reservoir for clutch fluid always right

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.420 
reservoir for clutch fluid always right
in<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.729> same<00:01:38.909> area<00:01:39.210> as<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.390> brake<00:01:39.570> fluid<00:01:39.600> and

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
in the same area as the brake fluid and

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.100 
in the same area as the brake fluid and
then<00:01:41.430> again<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> fairly<00:01:42.509> common<00:01:42.810> problem

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
then again it is a fairly common problem

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.950 
then again it is a fairly common problem
to<00:01:43.799> have<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.009> leak<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.270> system<00:01:45.630> and

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
to have a leak in that system and

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.200 
to have a leak in that system and
usually<00:01:46.680> it's<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.220> master<00:01:47.670> cylinder<00:01:47.880> or

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
usually it's you the master cylinder or

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.410 
usually it's you the master cylinder or
the<00:01:48.270> slave<00:01:48.869> cylinder<00:01:49.280> cost<00:01:50.280> on<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.579> repair<00:01:51.180> like

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
the slave cylinder cost on a repair like

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.870 
the slave cylinder cost on a repair like
that<00:01:51.740> somewhere<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.040> four<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.610> six
