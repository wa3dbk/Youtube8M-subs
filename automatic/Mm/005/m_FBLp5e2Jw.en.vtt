00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
about the testing methods that is 820

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.660 
about the testing methods that is 820
lumens<00:00:57.480> out<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.809> front<00:00:58.079> Wow<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.250> light<00:00:59.489> was

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
lumens out the front Wow this light was

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.789 
lumens out the front Wow this light was
built<00:01:01.550> for<00:01:02.780> high<00:01:03.780> output<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.619> for<00:01:05.309> long<00:01:05.489> throw

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
built for high output and for long throw

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.429 
built for high output and for long throw
it<00:01:07.799> has<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.010> max<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:09.290> 333<00:01:10.290> meters<00:01:11.180> throwing<00:01:12.180> beam

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
it has a max of 333 meters throwing beam

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.870 
it has a max of 333 meters throwing beam
so<00:01:13.439> that's<00:01:13.590> almost<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.979> thousand<00:01:14.580> feet<00:01:16.880> Phoenix

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
so that's almost a thousand feet Phoenix

flashlight puts out in such a small

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.940 
flashlight puts out in such a small
package<00:01:33.780> without<00:01:34.110> actually<00:01:34.500> seeing<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.860> in

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
package without actually seeing it in

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.469 
package without actually seeing it in
person<00:01:35.100> all<00:01:35.670> right<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:36.060> mean<00:01:36.329> it's<00:01:36.450> just

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
person all right I mean it's just

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.039 
person all right I mean it's just
amazing<00:01:36.979> if<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.040> look<00:01:38.220> at<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.400> light<00:01:39.049> the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
amazing if you look at the light the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.219 
amazing if you look at the light the
design<00:01:40.409> looks<00:01:40.650> kind<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:40.920> odd<00:01:41.040> at<00:01:41.250> first<00:01:42.229> it

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
design looks kind of odd at first it

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.850 
design looks kind of odd at first it
kinda<00:01:43.470> has<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.680> rectangular<00:01:44.159> body<00:01:45.740> because<00:01:46.740> it

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
kinda has a rectangular body because it

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.289 
kinda has a rectangular body because it
has<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.009> battery<00:01:47.280> carrier<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.450> stacks<00:01:50.299> the

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
has a battery carrier that stacks the

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.499 
has a battery carrier that stacks the
cr123<00:01:51.990> batteries<00:01:52.579> I<00:01:53.579> think<00:01:54.210> this<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.479> a

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
cr123 batteries I think this is a

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.580 
cr123 batteries I think this is a
fantastic<00:01:54.899> design<00:01:55.500> in<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.270> have<00:01:57.590> some

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
fantastic design in that I have some

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.789 
fantastic design in that I have some
similar<00:01:58.979> flashlights<00:01:59.549> with<00:01:59.820> similar<00:02:00.799> outputs

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
similar flashlights with similar outputs

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.530 
similar flashlights with similar outputs
from<00:02:02.159> some<00:02:02.520> manufacturers<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.329> don't

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
from some manufacturers that I don't

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.359 
from some manufacturers that I don't
carry<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:04.680> I've<00:02:05.460> evaluated<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:07.220> they<00:02:08.220> are

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
carry that I've evaluated and they are

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.339 
carry that I've evaluated and they are
significant<00:02:08.849> longer<00:02:09.209> lights<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.899> they're

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
significant longer lights and they're

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.130 
significant longer lights and they're
just<00:02:10.500> unwieldy<00:02:11.069> but<00:02:11.819> this<00:02:11.970> light<00:02:12.180> if<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:13.020> look

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
just unwieldy but this light if you look

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.730 
just unwieldy but this light if you look
at<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.260> design

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
at the design

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.890 
at the design
it<00:02:14.550> fits<00:02:15.380> perfectly<00:02:16.380> in<00:02:16.590> my<00:02:16.650> hand<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.790> if<00:02:18.780> you

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
it fits perfectly in my hand and if you

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.480 
it fits perfectly in my hand and if you
want<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.140> go<00:02:19.230> with<00:02:19.380> an<00:02:19.500> overhand<00:02:19.890> grip<00:02:20.040> to

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
want to go with an overhand grip to

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.570 
want to go with an overhand grip to
access<00:02:22.100> of<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.250> user<00:02:23.280> interface<00:02:25.400> it's<00:02:26.400> right

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
access of the user interface it's right

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:33.880 
access of the user interface it's right
there<00:02:26.820> on<00:02:26.850> your<00:02:26.970> thumb<00:02:27.210> so<00:02:30.770> you<00:02:31.770> can't<00:02:32.010> really

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
there on your thumb so you can't really

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.770 
there on your thumb so you can't really
mock<00:02:34.890> their<00:02:35.190> design<00:02:35.520> at<00:02:35.820> all<00:02:35.940> I<00:02:36.150> mean<00:02:36.330> it's<00:02:36.660> a

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
mock their design at all I mean it's a

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.680 
mock their design at all I mean it's a
pretty<00:02:36.930> slick<00:02:37.230> little<00:02:37.410> design<00:02:38.930> it<00:02:39.930> has

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
pretty slick little design it has

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.650 
pretty slick little design it has
grooves<00:02:42.690> here<00:02:43.170> on<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:44.460> top<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:44.820> bottom<00:02:44.970> to

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
grooves here on the top and bottom to

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.750 
grooves here on the top and bottom to
provide<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:45.930> grip<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.500> then<00:02:47.010> larger<00:02:47.490> grooves

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
provide a grip and then larger grooves

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.630 
provide a grip and then larger grooves
up<00:02:48.030> around<00:02:49.610> closer<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.880> bezel<00:02:52.490> but<00:02:53.490> the
