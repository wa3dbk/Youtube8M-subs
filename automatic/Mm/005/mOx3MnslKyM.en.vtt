is<00:00:16.470> going<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.520> be<00:00:19.460> the<00:00:20.460> variable<00:00:21.449> voltage<00:00:22.519> ego

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
is going to be the variable voltage ego

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:31.040 
is going to be the variable voltage ego
PT<00:00:25.730> it<00:00:26.869> is<00:00:28.310> variable<00:00:29.310> voltage<00:00:29.490> from<00:00:30.119> three<00:00:30.599> to

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
PT it is variable voltage from three to

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.200 
PT it is variable voltage from three to
six<00:00:31.320> volts<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.130> we'll<00:00:32.520> get<00:00:32.700> into<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.030> in

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
six volts and we'll get into that in

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.030 
six volts and we'll get into that in
just<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.690> minute<00:00:33.899> let<00:00:34.320> me<00:00:34.440> give<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.800> quick

just a minute let me give you a quick

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.170 
just a minute let me give you a quick
look<00:00:37.520> this<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.969> your<00:00:39.570> pass<00:00:40.559> through<00:00:41.190> option

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
look this is your pass through option

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:50.420 
look this is your pass through option
and<00:00:43.219> it<00:00:44.219> also<00:00:44.579> comes<00:00:45.239> with<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:46.160> cord<00:00:49.219> here<00:00:50.219> is

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
and it also comes with a cord here is

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.380 
and it also comes with a cord here is
the<00:00:50.700> cord<00:00:52.489> the<00:00:53.489> one<00:00:53.670> thing<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.059> thought

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
the cord the one thing that I thought

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.299 
the cord the one thing that I thought
was<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.600> little<00:00:54.780> bit<00:00:55.050> strange<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.010> cord

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
was a little bit strange is the cord

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:04.630 
was a little bit strange is the cord
that<00:00:56.520> came<00:00:56.730> with<00:00:56.969> mine<00:01:01.219> not<00:01:02.219> quite<00:01:02.969> like<00:01:03.270> any

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
that came with mine not quite like any

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.570 
that came with mine not quite like any
USB<00:01:05.640> cord<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.360> I've<00:01:06.510> seen<00:01:06.869> before<00:01:07.460> but<00:01:08.460> it

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
USB cord that I've seen before but it

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.330 
USB cord that I've seen before but it
does<00:01:08.820> work<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.450> snaps<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.130> can

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
does work it snaps in and you can

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.730 
does work it snaps in and you can
actually<00:01:11.580> hear<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.030> snap<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.900> when<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.500> plug

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
actually hear it snap in when you plug

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.609 
actually hear it snap in when you plug
it<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:15.710> have<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:17.640> Stardust<00:01:18.570> clearomizer<00:01:19.259> on

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
it in I have a Stardust clearomizer on

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.340 
it in I have a Stardust clearomizer on
it<00:01:19.799> right<00:01:19.979> now<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.189> I'm<00:01:20.580> said<00:01:21.000> at<00:01:21.390> four<00:01:22.020> volts

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
it right now and I'm said at four volts

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.859 
it right now and I'm said at four volts
you<00:01:23.310> can<00:01:23.520> adjust<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.030> voltage<00:01:24.210> there's<00:01:24.810> a

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
you can adjust the voltage there's a

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.899 
you can adjust the voltage there's a
plus<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.500> minus<00:01:25.740> button<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.610> can<00:01:26.759> adjust

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.640 
let's go up to 4.2 4.25 let's go up to 5
volts<00:03:21.010> 5.2<00:03:22.269> let's<00:03:23.269> take<00:03:23.660> her<00:03:23.870> all<00:03:24.079> the<00:03:24.110> way<00:03:24.350> up

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
volts 5.2 let's take her all the way up

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.940 
volts 5.2 let's take her all the way up
to<00:03:24.680> 6<00:03:25.280> volts

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.390 

6.2<00:03:30.950> volts<00:03:31.760> all<00:03:32.629> right<00:03:32.870> let's<00:03:33.409> back<00:03:33.890> her<00:03:34.099> down

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
6.2 volts all right let's back her down

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:44.080 
6.2 volts all right let's back her down
to<00:03:35.000> about<00:03:36.730> 3.7<00:03:39.459> 3.8<00:03:41.200> this<00:03:42.250> 3.85<00:03:43.250> and<00:03:43.640> let's<00:03:43.819> see

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
to about 3.7 3.8 this 3.85 and let's see

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.710 
to about 3.7 3.8 this 3.85 and let's see
what<00:03:44.269> she<00:03:44.450> fires<00:03:44.780> that<00:03:45.230> under<00:03:45.950> load<00:03:49.720> under

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
what she fires that under load under

00:03:50.720 --> 00:04:05.970 
what she fires that under load under
load<00:03:50.959> fires<00:03:51.890> at<00:03:52.159> 3.55<00:04:00.819> so<00:04:01.819> at<00:04:03.519> 3.78<00:04:04.519> fires<00:04:05.150> at

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
load fires at 3.55 so at 3.78 fires at

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:16.160 
load fires at 3.55 so at 3.78 fires at
3.4<00:04:07.450> 3.8<00:04:08.450> it<00:04:08.599> fires<00:04:08.810> at<00:04:09.049> 3.55<00:04:09.739> under<00:04:10.400> load

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:26.980 

I've<00:04:16.740> been<00:04:17.160> using<00:04:17.490> this<00:04:17.850> for<00:04:17.910> about<00:04:18.300> two<00:04:18.840> weeks

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.809 

and<00:04:27.110> I<00:04:28.099> like<00:04:28.729> it<00:04:29.000> it<00:04:29.270> it<00:04:30.080> performs<00:04:31.039> pretty<00:04:31.430> darn

00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:31.819 
and I like it it it performs pretty darn

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:36.249 
and I like it it it performs pretty darn
well<00:04:31.940> it<00:04:32.539> does<00:04:33.319> have<00:04:33.590> a<00:04:34.120> 650<00:04:35.120> mah<00:04:35.330> internal

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:36.259 
well it does have a 650 mah internal

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:40.390 
well it does have a 650 mah internal
battery<00:04:36.800> and<00:04:38.110> it'll<00:04:39.110> last<00:04:39.319> a<00:04:39.680> good<00:04:39.860> four<00:04:40.370> or

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
battery and it'll last a good four or

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.580 
battery and it'll last a good four or
five<00:04:40.880> hours<00:04:41.680> with<00:04:42.910> without<00:04:43.910> charging<00:04:44.569> but<00:04:45.500> the

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
five hours with without charging but the

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.490 
five hours with without charging but the
good<00:04:45.710> thing<00:04:45.770> about<00:04:45.979> that<00:04:46.430> is<00:04:46.490> is<00:04:47.319> you<00:04:48.319> know<00:04:48.440> you

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
good thing about that is is you know you

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.379 
good thing about that is is you know you
plug<00:04:48.949> it<00:04:49.099> in<00:04:49.250> you<00:04:49.550> can<00:04:49.729> use<00:04:49.880> it<00:04:50.060> well<00:04:50.210> at

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
plug it in you can use it well at

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.210 
plug it in you can use it well at
charges<00:04:50.870> that's<00:04:51.110> the<00:04:51.259> best<00:04:51.500> thing<00:04:51.710> about<00:04:51.860> it

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
charges that's the best thing about it

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
charges that's the best thing about it
and<00:04:52.750> when<00:04:53.770> when<00:04:54.770> I<00:04:54.800> was<00:04:55.069> using<00:04:55.460> it<00:04:55.610> I<00:04:55.789> was<00:04:56.000> using

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
and when when I was using it I was using

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.589 
and when when I was using it I was using
it<00:04:56.449> at<00:04:56.569> about<00:04:56.690> 4.2<00:04:57.620> 4.5<00:04:58.580> volts<00:04:58.610> and<00:04:59.180> of<00:04:59.300> course

00:04:59.589 --> 00:04:59.599 
it at about 4.2 4.5 volts and of course

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:02.800 
it at about 4.2 4.5 volts and of course
the<00:05:00.380> higher<00:05:00.650> you<00:05:00.949> set<00:05:01.250> your<00:05:01.460> voltage<00:05:01.970> the

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
the higher you set your voltage the

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.439 
the higher you set your voltage the
shorter<00:05:03.409> the<00:05:03.680> battery<00:05:04.159> life<00:05:04.430> is<00:05:04.490> going<00:05:05.030> to<00:05:05.240> be

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
shorter the battery life is going to be

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.140 
shorter the battery life is going to be
when<00:05:05.840> you're<00:05:05.990> not<00:05:06.229> tethered<00:05:06.729> to<00:05:07.729> a<00:05:07.759> power

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
when you're not tethered to a power

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:18.500 
when you're not tethered to a power
supply

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510

throughs<00:05:55.650> I<00:05:55.890> think<00:05:56.190> they're<00:05:56.370> great<00:05:56.640> and<00:05:57.560> when

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
throughs I think they're great and when

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.890 
throughs I think they're great and when
the<00:05:58.740> twist<00:05:59.100> came<00:05:59.460> out<00:05:59.730> I<00:06:00.030> said<00:06:00.450> you<00:06:00.600> know<00:06:00.720> what

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
the twist came out I said you know what

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.210 
the twist came out I said you know what
the<00:06:01.200> only<00:06:01.260> thing<00:06:01.680> that<00:06:01.830> would<00:06:01.950> make<00:06:02.010> this

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
the only thing that would make this

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.700 
the only thing that would make this
thing<00:06:02.490> better<00:06:03.000> is<00:06:03.300> if<00:06:04.050> it<00:06:04.200> were<00:06:04.350> a<00:06:04.380> pass

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
thing better is if it were a pass

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.650 
thing better is if it were a pass
through<00:06:05.600> here<00:06:06.600> we<00:06:06.960> go<00:06:07.170> we've<00:06:07.620> got<00:06:08.070> a<00:06:08.660> variable
