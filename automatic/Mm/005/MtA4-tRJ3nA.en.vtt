two<00:02:58.760> three<00:02:59.870> four<00:03:00.870> okay<00:03:01.440> now<00:03:01.680> let's<00:03:01.890> take<00:03:02.100> it<00:03:02.340> a

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
two three four okay now let's take it a

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:13.550 
two three four okay now let's take it a
measure<00:03:02.820> each<00:03:04.700> two<00:03:05.989> three<00:03:07.070> four<00:03:12.560> forefinger

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
measure each two three four forefinger

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
measure each two three four forefinger
independence<00:03:14.489> here<00:03:15.410> just<00:03:16.410> think<00:03:16.709> figure<00:03:17.160> by

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
independence here just think figure by

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.020 
independence here just think figure by
finger<00:03:19.820> okay<00:03:20.820> that<00:03:21.450> gives<00:03:21.810> you<00:03:22.019> an<00:03:22.170> idea<00:03:22.350> of

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
finger okay that gives you an idea of

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.310 
finger okay that gives you an idea of
how<00:03:24.030> you're<00:03:24.330> going<00:03:24.420> to<00:03:24.480> approach<00:03:24.840> learning

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
how you're going to approach learning

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.410 
how you're going to approach learning
these<00:03:25.680> chords<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.430> learning<00:03:26.880> these<00:03:27.060> tough

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
these chords and learning these tough

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.500 
these chords and learning these tough
transitions<00:03:28.350> don't<00:03:29.130> try<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.459> go<00:03:29.670> as<00:03:29.850> fast<00:03:29.880> as

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
transitions don't try to go as fast as

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.210 
transitions don't try to go as fast as
the<00:03:30.780> song<00:03:31.049> that<00:03:31.320> you're<00:03:31.440> trying<00:03:31.769> to<00:03:31.860> learn

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
the song that you're trying to learn

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.460 
the song that you're trying to learn
you're<00:03:32.970> gonna<00:03:33.180> self-destruct<00:03:33.600> and<00:03:34.320> then

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
you're gonna self-destruct and then

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.900 
you're gonna self-destruct and then
you're<00:03:34.590> going<00:03:34.709> to<00:03:34.769> think<00:03:35.100> that<00:03:35.340> there's

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
you're going to think that there's

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.550 
you're going to think that there's
something<00:03:36.150> wrong<00:03:36.480> with<00:03:36.660> you<00:03:36.900> or<00:03:37.170> wrong<00:03:37.380> with

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
something wrong with you or wrong with

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.050 
something wrong with you or wrong with
your<00:03:37.709> hands<00:03:37.980> or<00:03:38.190> wrong<00:03:38.340> with<00:03:38.489> your<00:03:38.640> ability

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
your hands or wrong with your ability

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.180 
your hands or wrong with your ability
and<00:03:39.299> it's<00:03:39.420> not<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.930> case<00:03:40.170> I<00:03:40.350> guarantee<00:03:40.650> it

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
and it's not the case I guarantee it

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.400 
and it's not the case I guarantee it
it's<00:03:41.340> just<00:03:42.090> that<00:03:42.239> it<00:03:42.390> might<00:03:42.630> be<00:03:42.810> a<00:03:42.840> little<00:03:43.079> too

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
it's just that it might be a little too

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.289 
it's just that it might be a little too
fast<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:44.040> a<00:03:44.070> little<00:03:44.280> too<00:03:44.400> complicated<00:03:44.760> so<00:03:45.120> if

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
fast and a little too complicated so if

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.270 
fast and a little too complicated so if
that's<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.600> case<00:03:45.810> slow<00:03:46.650> it<00:03:46.799> down<00:03:46.829> and

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
that's the case slow it down and

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.360 
that's the case slow it down and
simplify<00:03:48.209> and<00:03:48.750> that'll<00:03:49.050> be<00:03:49.140> a<00:03:49.170> lot<00:03:49.709> easier<00:03:50.340> and

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
simplify and that'll be a lot easier and

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.440 
simplify and that'll be a lot easier and
then<00:03:50.670> slowly<00:03:51.150> work<00:03:51.840> your<00:03:52.110> way<00:03:52.319> up<00:03:53.090> that's<00:03:54.090> it

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
then slowly work your way up that's it

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.449 
then slowly work your way up that's it
that's<00:03:54.720> all<00:03:54.870> I<00:03:54.900> got<00:03:55.349> good<00:03:55.650> luck<00:03:55.860> let<00:03:56.250> me<00:03:56.340> know

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
that's all I got good luck let me know

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.670 
that's all I got good luck let me know
how<00:03:56.580> it<00:03:56.640> goes
