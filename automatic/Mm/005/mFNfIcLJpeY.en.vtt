course a lot of that excitement was due

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.149 
course a lot of that excitement was due

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
to how much fun punch-out is but even

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.739 
to how much fun punch-out is but even
more<00:01:26.399> so<00:01:26.639> I<00:01:26.670> think<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:26.999> was<00:01:27.090> about<00:01:27.329> nostalgia

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:27.749 
more so I think it was about nostalgia

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:29.989 
more so I think it was about nostalgia
and<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:28.560> discussing<00:01:28.889> punch-out<00:01:29.549> for<00:01:29.819> we

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:29.999 
and in discussing punch-out for we

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:32.330 
and in discussing punch-out for we
especially<00:01:30.959> among<00:01:31.409> younger<00:01:31.679> players<00:01:32.069> for

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
whom the names and faces in this game

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.929 
whom the names and faces in this game
may<00:01:34.200> not<00:01:34.229> resonate<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:35.130> think<00:01:35.549> it's<00:01:35.700> very

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
may not resonate I think it's very

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.350 
may not resonate I think it's very
important<00:01:36.569> to<00:01:36.810> discuss<00:01:37.409> nostalgia

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.730 

because<00:01:41.360> games<00:01:41.690> like<00:01:41.960> this<00:01:42.140> aren't<00:01:42.380> simply
