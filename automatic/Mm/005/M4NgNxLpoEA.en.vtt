00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.709 
and get that goal in about 10 12 minute
mark<00:01:42.130> we<00:01:43.130> kind<00:01:43.369> of<00:01:43.459> figured<00:01:43.909> it<00:01:44.090> was<00:01:44.149> over<00:01:44.450> and

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719 
mark we kind of figured it was over and

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:46.419 
mark we kind of figured it was over and
I<00:01:45.049> think<00:01:45.409> the<00:01:45.560> rest<00:01:45.709> of<00:01:45.859> the<00:01:45.920> way<00:01:46.039> we<00:01:46.189> kind<00:01:46.340> of

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
I think the rest of the way we kind of

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.399 
I think the rest of the way we kind of
just<00:01:46.579> SAT<00:01:46.759> back<00:01:46.789> and<00:01:46.969> had<00:01:47.959> difficulty

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
just SAT back and had difficulty

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:49.690 
just SAT back and had difficulty
generating<00:01:48.829> that<00:01:48.920> same<00:01:49.099> kind<00:01:49.310> of<00:01:49.340> emotion

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
generating that same kind of emotion

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.519 
generating that same kind of emotion
