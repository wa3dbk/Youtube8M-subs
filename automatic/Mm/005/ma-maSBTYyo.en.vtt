00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:06.529
 hello how about friends youtube seeds 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:11.240
 x friend fernando bringing you this review 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:13.759
 more video tutorial of how that was 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.070
 nothing like that is that they are both things in 1 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.260
 because they think about a review 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.359
 and the sometimes the future of how 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.090
 use it according to these two 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:26.779
 merged clubs that make a 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.359
 wonder that is called multiverse and for 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.039
 I do not agree but I already know if you can 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.950
 be watching this video and maybe not from 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:38.260
 I agree what this plugin does 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:41.230
 it creates you stop generating 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.739
 is created and a world of 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:48.699
 Pure plots with the help of the plugin 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:51.339
 multiverse agree how is this ok 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:54.640
 create with the multiple plugin that is 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:57.820
 a generator of random worlds or with 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.649
 default seeds that can 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.719
 generate a world is no longer pure plots 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.899
 already created and without you to have it 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:08.830
 create and already protected by combining this 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:11.159
 plugin cloudme and the and the multiverse of 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.159
 agreement 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.310
 and good also for example if you have 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.729
 or if you do not have 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.100
 this if I do not want is to change the plug-in 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.990
 of protection of plots and you do not want 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.630
 but multiple plot or use it 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.860
 forward I live and if nothing else he wants 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.020
 be the world 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.330
 well then go ahead but I'll 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.670
 I recommend a lot upload me is very good 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.670
 the truth here in the description will be 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:43.390
 the two links of the two files to the 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:47.770
 official forums agree the multiverse 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.229
 to go to the page and seeing the 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.170
 where are the data from 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.450
 update to see what version is 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.659
 they would appear as if they were 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.909
 1.4 point 5 of agreement but as the 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.729
 changes were made the 1.4 points 601 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:07.000
 point 4.7 there were not many differences 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.069
 that affected this plugin was not had 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.970
 to update and they have not changed it 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.780
 that the name 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.730
 and something that would be this plugin according 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.720
 so anyway it works for them already 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.530
 that they achieve here I am in the 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.010
 here is not 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.620
 new i can see good i am the at 1.4 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.530
 points 7 agree well let's see 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.220
 let's generate the world outside general 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.120
 world we put mv with multiple plugin 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.550
 we put crate 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.880
 what is to create 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:46.860
 we put the name of the world that will be 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.860
 plot work 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.040
 I do not know if they can change their names 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.870
 just try with this if you guys 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.350
 they want to put world plots or as 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.090
 want 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:01.620
 let's put him in normal 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.620
 bar g 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:09.900
 and we put 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:12.350
 flot as they see it written in agreement 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.650
 ok let's hit enter 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.120
 starting weinstein of words is creating 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.000
 the world and it's already complete in agreement 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.970
 well for this the world let's go to emv 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.870
 pp 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.870
 name 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.160
 the world ok 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.200
 and well how do you see this is a full world 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.450
 from pure pure people let me 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.510
 Charge a bit more 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.800
 this is from pure plots already 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.350
 generated do not have to do 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:51.080
 absolutely nothing to protect or to 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:55.430
 and well they have to be nothing to protect 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:59.030
 let alone create one by one 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:03.130
 or to go copy-paste with world world war 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.130
 the world where the world 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:10.690
 and well, this can be combined with 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:13.030
 fluids like any of trim them 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.620
 that you want or have clear 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.640
 because nothing else would take them from a world 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.180
 to another 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.820
 ok how to use this this plugin nothing 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.550
 more we cloud my car and 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.880
 automatically give us or give us 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.970
 a 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.770
 a flower a plot of agreement as you see 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.660
 here is the name on the corner with 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.650
 a sign the name and the id of the 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.720
 person that the air is the person is the 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.639
 first plot or the first plot 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.580
 given etc ok 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.379
 and the name of the owner according to the 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.650
 these are protected 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:51.779
 automatically owners and owners 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.629
 administrators create the only ones that 

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:56.770
 can do as modified within 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:58.720
 these plots of agreement 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:03.569
 you as administrator can modify 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.569
 et cetera etcetera and you can 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.700
 put and remove things to your liking of 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.740
 agreement and you as a user and owner of 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.690
 you can only do it inside 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.210
 your partials instead if you go to the 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.370
 from the neighbor will automatically be removed 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.900
 and it will not allow you to put a key and 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.889
 will say that you do not have permits within 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.379
 is 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:24.380
 ok I think we 've gone fast monologue 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:27.650
 good 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.900
 and for nothing this would be very easy other 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:33.290
 thing for example if you some event 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.210
 gift giving parcels or any 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:38.960
 give him to spend what they do not have and not 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.310
 to buy it you will give good bar 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.610
 is that position to the first that nothing 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:46.240
 on the envelope of the silver on the plot 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.220
 agree let's put the hotel and 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:52.120
 clive and the name of the person in this 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.820
 Case Juan Perez 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.050
 ok with a game with Juan Perez for real 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.990
 but good to see 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.770
 that is 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:08.870
 saved for the owner here let's see 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:12.200
 in the poster a nerd or owner Juan Perez 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:14.230
 ok as you see in the idea and change to -1 already 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.150
 fall 0 0 agree 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:21.289
 I believe that for her it would be one and for 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:24.279
 what to do or be or less one and so good 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:24.279
 and as we see 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:30.210
 well that would be a great this plugin is 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.620
 a great help for a server and more 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.930
 they were the big servers to whom 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.920
 a lot of people come in and a lot of people 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:39.460
 start making houses 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:41.560
 agree and you save a lot of battle 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:47.190
 how do I protect my house from how I protect 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:47.190
 this like x things with my plot 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:52.800
 ok and of course you're always going to have problems 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.860
 with people who do not have that much money 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.979
 like to buy a person or people 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:01.650
 that does not understand these nest commands 

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:03.919
 get here so it also brings you 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:07.650
 a review later on the next 

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:09.760
 plugin that is called 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:13.060
 protection ' block 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:15.250
 ok good this 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.710
 Well, I think that was all for the 

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:20.230
 review already know that in the description 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:22.470
 there are the download links of the forums 

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.470
 official 

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:29.650
 It costs to give the same friends until the 

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.650
 next
