perspective a buddy of mine always says

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.520 
perspective a buddy of mine always says
it's<00:02:33.450> always<00:02:33.750> really<00:02:33.930> interesting<00:02:34.320> to<00:02:34.410> look

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
it's always really interesting to look

to<00:02:37.590> gain<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:38.460> let's<00:02:38.640> start<00:02:38.820> with<00:02:38.910> Manny

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
to gain so let's start with Manny

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.540

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
should be retiring the reason why I'm

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.530 
should be retiring the reason why I'm
saying<00:02:43.890> it<00:02:44.070> isn't<00:02:44.220> because<00:02:44.490> he's<00:02:44.880> so<00:02:45.120> old<00:02:45.420> that

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
saying it isn't because he's so old that

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.540 
saying it isn't because he's so old that
he<00:02:45.780> can't<00:02:45.990> put<00:02:46.200> together<00:02:46.470> great<00:02:46.650> fights<00:02:46.950> it's

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
he can't put together great fights it's

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.120 
he can't put together great fights it's
because<00:02:47.910> it<00:02:48.090> doesn't<00:02:48.510> have<00:02:48.570> that's<00:02:49.530> the

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
because it doesn't have that's the

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.720 
because it doesn't have that's the
superior<00:02:51.530> aggressive<00:02:52.530> intensity<00:02:53.430> where<00:02:53.640> you
