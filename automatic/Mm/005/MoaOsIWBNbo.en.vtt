00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello to all and register 50 and 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.359
 today we find ourselves on a video 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.639
 on gta 5 so a little tutorial how 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.290
 easily have the a630 the plane from 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.950
 hunt and the helicopter all that in the 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.750
 military base 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.320
 so for now we will start 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.140
 with with the fighter plane so everything 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.580
 just already tell you where is 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.430
 the military base so the military base 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.199
 is ultimately just north 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.830
 of the city because you see here the city 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.720
 is right here you then have a big 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.040
 blur a big white between these two 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.520
 roads this is where the base is 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.610
 military 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.350
 so where I mark so if not as 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.020
 little benchmark that you I can you 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.090
 give it here is the cable car base and 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.390
 had created this great road all to 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.149
 left 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.160
 or else the point of armory so that's it 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.520
 it's right here here already for 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.910
 where you can find 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.770
 stop these planes so we'll confess 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.570
 that I'm two days of people like 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.829
 anyway for life at the stage of 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.710
 weight for the fighter plane 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.090
 it does not change absolutely anything else 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.640
 try to find a car enough 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.740
 fast to avoid cars from 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.960
 military and to realize very quickly to 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.369
 your weight so there you see I 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.049
 went left because if you 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.490
 go right you have more luck 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.409
 to get shot by the guy who is at 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.320
 the entrance is to lose a little bit of 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.670
 he and I move I swear to you that a 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.100
 little bit becomes at least I managed to 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.790
 take a fighter plane and a bar is 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.140
 like that not me little anecdote 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.520
 so if you want my opinion take this 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.240
 do not take the planes 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.880
 hunting who are out 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.310
 they are too discovered and I 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.550
 rather offers you this one bronze 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.590
 that I'm taking because 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.620
 that already they hours in a look so 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.930
 already summer 9th military can only 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.700
 not see you and already you are a lot 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.960
 more safe from shooting and all that so 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.430
 the wanted it to be a problem I 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.440
 have lost no point of view I am 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.900
 went quietly to the my plane 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.060
 I cried and the missiles of the 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.670
 sÃ¤ntis bayonne up and there it is gone 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:05.310
 no problem so after what I 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.430
 saw my driving cabaret because 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.990
 guinea pig 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.759
 I rather tried to make figures 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.050
 artistic men like this one I 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.250
 realizes gap 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.360
 the brothel in the military abbey 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.750
 just after you see who 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:23.720
 So here we go now with a 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.180
 pretty 4 have tired 130 of which for the c 130 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.320
 especially I did not choose any car 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.570
 quick 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.730
 you can even take a bus if you 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.120
 want it will not change anything at all 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.580
 problem 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.830
 so you go to midnight I you 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.170
 say come at midnight no matter what day 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.050
 but in any case at midnight then you 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.090
 put here and this plane will still be there 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.080
 he will always be to if he is not there it is 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.520
 really you do not have any other 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.560
 because it's true that sometimes me there 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.090
 was not there because I have on me a 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.380
 reads around 22 23 pm but I you 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.310
 promise that at midnight he is still there 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.500
 ready to take off so that's why 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.050
 for ease but try not 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.489
 of entry to make kill by the cockpit I 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.530
 tried a lot of times like that and I 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.760
 told myself that's as good to do that 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.319
 she has the engines are ready you 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.680
 just take off to take 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.330
 your a c-130 then to move on to 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.819
 the helicopter take a car enough 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.440
 fast preferably because if you want 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.420
 the shuffle goes back but it's not easy 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.739
 everything but if you want you can 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.769
 take a bunch of vehicles 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.480
 it's not exactly how it goes 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.540
 walk exactly the same so there you 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.340
 do I want to take this helicopter the case there 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.790
 is between my car and the plane so 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.400
 already left ground shots are are 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.810
 much to the plagues to which 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.670
 those from the right to classes to have 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.380
 touched the left because I'm 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.269
 in the air and if not with this helicopter 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.340
 dairy are two rockets are very 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.840
 easy to avoid so much from 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.700
 the right where there are the tents where the 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.500
 tops can not touch you so 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.840
 if not a small end-of-video bonus 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.880
 it is with a small lamborghini I am 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.519
 am told why not in pros force to 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.110
 background to see what that gives and the 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.709
 blow you will see in a few 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.269
 moments 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.269
 country keith spicer 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.120
 and here I am in the base 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.879
 military on no one behind 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.470
 so I do not know if it's a bug or 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.760
 something like that in any case I 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.080
 twice this break 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.030
 I do not know about myself I did 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.709
 any case personally I took 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.199
 a car first time I took a 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.430
 hybrid car no noise and blow 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:20.769
 let's go if you take a plane you 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.430
 spotted so here I hope it 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.680
 will please you 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.449
 do not hesitate to subscribe to put a 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.770
 green thumb and on that I tell you to the 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:29.880
 next I hope I would have you 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.880
 help hi everyone
