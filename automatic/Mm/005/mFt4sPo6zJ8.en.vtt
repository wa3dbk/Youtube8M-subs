00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.480
 lying down is another basic order of 

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:11.340
 Obedience is also very simple 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.750
 teach a dog maybe a tad more 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.370
 complicated that lying down but let's go 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.070
 there really is not a huge difference 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.949
 it's an order that comes in handy because 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.060
 will give us a plus of calm of 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.740
 relaxation in the dog when 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.550
 we need it to be quiet in 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.739
 any situation we can think of 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.300
 to teach it there is also a series of 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:32.820
 phases that make the animal have to 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.980
 to learn to react with food and 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.719
 without food let's see it from the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.989
 order of the sitting so you can see how it 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.989
 make 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.539
 yes very well 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.460
 note that in lying down I do not say 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.539
 absolutely no order but between 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.239
 What I want is for you to keep the 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.280
 gesture very well and the moment when I already 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.559
 is in this relaxed position is when 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.480
 I give you the prize according to what 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.840
 we would repeat several times as the rest 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.400
 of orders that stops 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.250
 and once the animal knows it, it will arrive 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.540
 yes very well then we would introduce the 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.690
 verbal order takes 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.190
 before making the gesture of agreement 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.800
 we introduce the prize as to its 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.940
 chest 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.940
 we hold a little 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.730
 very well 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.440
 very well is a brand at the beginning we 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.710
 It costs a bit this bitch does not know how to do 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.930
 the lying 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.250
 but you will see that it really is not very 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.900
 complicated 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.650
 and we repeat again 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.950
 you more 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.020
 of agreement between your perfect chest very 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.450
 well and we give the prize when we have the 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.820
 position the last step is to get that 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.440
 make the order but without needing 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.800
 resort to the prize or that you do not see it 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.800
 beforehand 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.700
 yes 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.700
 and 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:15.209
 very well once you have done it 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.650
 we would take the prize and we would give it to him 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.299
 you have to worry if the order to 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.439
 principle is not a perfect order the 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.090
 lying on his grave or exposition 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.829
 because that we can correct it 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.719
 later if we get that the 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:29.030
 animal put all his body on the ground 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:29.030
 already with that we go very well in agreement 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.620
 do not 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.620
 to 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.599
