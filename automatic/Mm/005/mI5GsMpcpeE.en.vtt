00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.000 
now what we're going to create is a
musket<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:11.970> sort<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.600> gun<00:02:12.810> so<00:02:13.470> first<00:02:13.860> of

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
musket it is a sort of gun so first of

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.110 
musket it is a sort of gun so first of
all<00:02:14.070> what<00:02:14.250> we<00:02:14.280> have<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.520> do<00:02:14.580> is<00:02:14.610> play<00:02:14.940> some

all what we have to do is play some
planks<00:02:15.390> right<00:02:15.660> here

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
planks right here

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.220 
planks right here
some<00:02:17.340> sticks<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.970> we<00:02:18.180> get<00:02:18.330> our<00:02:18.450> muskets<00:02:18.930> stock

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230
