00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.320
 Hello to all 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.330
 today we meet again for the rest 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.309
 of the second episode how to buy a 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.170
 lonely house in the episode 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.619
 previous I had shown that it was necessary 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.430
 ask to buy the Manx 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.810
 today I'm going to show you the 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.580
 some citizens that you can help 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.580
 and how to decorate the mansion 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.330
 we will put ourselves in the daylight it will be 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.330
 better 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.739
 well we will go see that you can 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.739
 citizens you can 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.950
 a guard said 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.950
 I appear 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.110
 hop 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.110
 you are not letting yourself be dragged 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.470
 so you can talk to this gentleman 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.670
 Girard has therefore given you a mission 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.540
 I have still not done but it must 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.540
 content for a citizen 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.170
 very well 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.829
 good so after that there is read that you can 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.829
 maybe helped so I ask him is 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:00.899
 okay hissbach close you can from a 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:06.509
 poor I do not know if it matters but I 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:08.220
 think so so after there is the hostel 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.670
 so you wonder at the innkeeper 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.569
 normally no quests that's 5 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.569
 citizen in five 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.670
 and since you have five citizens 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.000
 normally you can buy the word 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.110
 black 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.470
 so now we'll go to how 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:33.450
 decorate the house 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.280
 finally the manor so you go back to see 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:41.849
 lucas bought the house so who you 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:45.290
 have purchased the home make 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.290
 quick trips it's free 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.250
 so he's here I'm begging to decorate my 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.250
 House 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.420
 yeah 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:35.110
 as you can see since it's 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.110
 a mansion the prices are downright abusing 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:43.569
 what am I taking I said no 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.880
 I take that 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.130
 and when a kitchen 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.480
 some time I'm so a trick 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.730
 what in po it's not a trick 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:11.250
 to bring prices down with the 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.610
 merchants I know that a stop like this 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.610
 I dunno 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.380
 So here we tested 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.810
 question 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.260
 but it's over 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.419
 so as soon as you buy something it's this 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:56.569
 montauban self actively at home so 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:00.259
 the second I buy it stops but 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:00.259
 well we go the scholarships then 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:16.150
 go hop hop hop hop hop hop 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.750
 jump 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.750
 turku 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.849
 so 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.920
 I do not think I 'm running there 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.090
 it's the wii 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:40.900
 so already that will change 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.900
 normal I can buy that 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:49.229
 there is already and then very last at 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.229
 marble 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.690
 Yes 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.690
 I am not bad 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.930
 I do not care if just the cupboards 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.930
 that I 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.500
 so we can put stuff like 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.580
 what we can put 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.770
 some salmon 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.820
 ok we can put salmon on the ground 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.040

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:35.760
 cobwebs beneath it's awesome 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:38.570
 shit we eat the last two for 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.570
 to say that I'm going to eat it 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:51.289
 with him very last all there and that's it 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:51.289
 they do not want to receive their mass 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:04.430
