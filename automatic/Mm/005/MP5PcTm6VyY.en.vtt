00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 because if the risk was zero as 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.950
 you said we have suffered a 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.460
 contagion or was not null and then we did not 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.160
 they said the whole truth 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.750
 they should have admitted that there was 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.100
 specific reasons led the government to 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.440
 carry out the transfer of patients 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.330
 infected shuffled the government like 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.300
 possible scenario the infection to 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.790
 Resident citizens otherwise 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.790
 because because he did not carry out that 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:31.430
 possibility what kind I repeat of costumes of 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.160
 individual protection used the 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.050
 professionals that of the 4 the 2 me 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.750
 You wish we had clarified he 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.520
 Information detailed information to 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.260
 health professionals who 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.329
 attended to the first infected by 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.370
 evo the about prevention measures for 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.679
 avoid infections were explained 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.309
 In detail how to get and how 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:54.140
 take off those costumes as you watch 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.789
 lady director general to a person 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.410
 that has been a week of vacation 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.840
 after being in close contact with 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.210
 patients who have 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.309
 as it is allowed and then how is it done 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.840
 a work of vigilance to which you 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.250
 yes it is true that they have carried out 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.880
 all international protocols 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.920
 were forced underwent the 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.380
 diagnostic test the chs to the auxiliary 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.420
 infected by their own request or were 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.700
 the a priori practitioners who 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.920
 they asked for those diagnostic tests the 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.080
 infected had a fever in the six days 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.940
 prior to diagnosis but less 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.700
 of the 38 with 3 that establishes the 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.790
 protocol to define a case thinks 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.830
 define again think revise the 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.350
 government the clinical criteria that 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.479
 establishes this protocol as signs and 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.600
 symptoms to really define where 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.979
 is the case of Ebola came this we 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.780
 It seems interesting because we've heard 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.930
 something and I would like to know if you have 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.060
 information came this woman those 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.220
 vacation for which they were attended during 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.140
 those vacations to a job offer 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.060
 public for nursing assistants 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.060
 held nine days ago in Madrid 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.520
 to a situation that also seems to us 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.380
 worrying how many people have had 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.360
 a close contact according to what 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.060
 specifies the protocol of action 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.530
 before Ebola with the infected person 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.450
 because if in the protocol of action 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.580
 against suspected cases of Ebola 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.350
 appears the recommendation to enter 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.360
 individual rooms with pressure 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.310
 negative in yesterday's appearance he 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.560
 he told reporters that only what 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.090
 they did with an isolation without pressure 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.260
 negative and that was also enough 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.510
 what happen 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.830
 thinks the government stipulate hospitals 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.750
 of reference in each autonomous community 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.579
 to welcome you isolate and treat 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.700
 potential people affected by evo 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:39.170
 which is like prevention us 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.780
 we have presented a few days ago a 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.700
 proposed a proposal not of law that 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.680
 we will discuss soon in which we asked 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.569
 that there was a protocol at the 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.340
 national in which it was established that 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.590
 hospitals should carry out this 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.329
 attention in several autonomous communities 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.060
 and that they will also be provided with a 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.140
 fixed budget finalist 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.629
 exclusively for this because it seems 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.340
 obvious that we could not give a 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:06.889
 enough attention and clear and correct 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.720
 sanitary to these patients and in last 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:10.879
 I would like to know if the government 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.770
 think about debugging some responsibility 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.240
 politics 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.910
 this is the one that matters least to me 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.620
 frankly but I would like to convey from 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.420
 again our concern about how 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.340
 are the appearances that 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.590
 you are carrying out and how 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.390
 the ministry's action is being 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.070
 of health in a case as serious as 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.610
 this one now yes thank you lady director 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.610
 general
