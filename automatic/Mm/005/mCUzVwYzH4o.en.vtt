the<00:00:08.069> neutral<00:00:08.340> buoyancy<00:00:08.370> laboratory<00:00:08.790> is<00:00:09.330> the

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
the neutral buoyancy laboratory is the

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.959 
the neutral buoyancy laboratory is the
massive<00:00:09.900> facility<00:00:10.340> here<00:00:11.340> in<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.670> United

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
massive facility here in the United

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.490 
massive facility here in the United
States<00:00:12.030> so<00:00:12.570> we<00:00:12.690> do<00:00:12.809> all<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.110> astronaut

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
States so we do all the astronaut

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.310 
States so we do all the astronaut
