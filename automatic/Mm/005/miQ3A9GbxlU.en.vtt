00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.870
 ana maria today let's make a salty 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.450
 I'll teach you to make a lasagna. 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.590
 super fast super-fast password 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.420
 frying pan 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.580
 so I 'm already with her until ready 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.670
 here I'll show you step by step to 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.090
 you see there then to start the 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:26.340
 ingredients are butter or margarine 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:29.849
 chopped garlic curd tomato sauce 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.210
 ready pouch can use your pulp mass 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.350
 for fresh ham lasagna and that then 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.780
 these are the ingredients for us 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.300
 start in a saucepan add a 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.320
 spoon of margarine or olive oil and 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.370
 add a spoonful of chopped garlic 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.829
 so we're going to reinforce well now 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.600
 these ingredients and I 'll add 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.489
 then come braised I'll add 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.140
 a packet of tomato sauce ready 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.789
 so you can use this too little 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.550
 You can not forget what you got for well with 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.460
 oregano salt and what you would ask of 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.650
 ingredients but I started it may be ready 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.600
 It gets easier so get it right now 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.020
 until the sauce is thickened and the 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.580
 I like it good now in a frying pan there. 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.930
 also depend on the size of the party 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.670
 that you have at home 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.009
 the best is those residences that do not 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.659
 Glute knows things but I only had 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.700
 this hand to start is important 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.909
 start with a layer of sauce to 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.600
 dough from sticking to yield stop by the 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.150
 layer of sauce underneath but the best 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.670
 It was even a pan of those that did not 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.740
 stick 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:42.210
 good then the layer of sauce we go 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.350
 start with a layer of fresh pasta 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.540
 of lasagna 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.390
 so I had to cut almost the size of the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.300
 pan on a whole truck 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.070
 Good, then we'll add a layer 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.570
 clear ham that does not have to be 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.010
 Hams you want can say of 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.830
 turkey breast or any ingredient 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.880
 you can change the ingredients you 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.250
 you prefer 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.230
 and I'm going to put a team layer 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.720
 joÃ£o to give a different taste you 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.550
 you can use it a lot you can use the 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.149
 twitter it is region that is the case that I 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.670
 I will make 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:16.080
 so I 'm going to add one now 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:18.530
 layer of well stuffed mozzarella cheese 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.870
 the amount is august 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.390
 and you can add the eye or not 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:30.240
 you can put one more layer straight 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:33.570
 of the lasagna add the 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.310
 ham again important to remember 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.930
 that you can not make too many stops 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.430
 What are you doing in the frying pan? 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:44.220
 not in the oven it can not be cooking 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.630
 everything so be careful to make up two in the 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.060
 maximum three calls 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.310
 then the ham I added the sauce and 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.100
 Finally I'll add the 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.350
 mozzarella cheese is important 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.660
 also remember that the sauce you can 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.640
 use red eye sauce any 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.560
 type of sauce you prefer 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.470
 I prefer red easier too. 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.890
 so this is what I 'm after the sauce 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.420
 last layer of mozzarella cheese well 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.020
 whimsical 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:16.670
 and I put some parsley 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.670
 just to give a color and the course 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.410
 so I come back I 'll leave it on fire 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.290
 low of great 20 minutes 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.209
 I 'm about to try to defeat the 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.600
 whole dough to cook to cook everything 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.790
 I was going to go down a little bit then 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.400
 if it sells minutes really passed 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.640
 even - the two daughters - will depend on the 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.440
 Radon fire and got ready now I'm going 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.920
 wait wait a little bit and I'll 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.920
 cut can already serve and is very good 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.720
 it's worth a try at home 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:56.010
 I'm going to tease, I'm going to eat the rest. 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:59.040
 already had some ada and then you cut and 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.470
 it stays that way a little bit changed 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.600
 then the best was that 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.600
 panela that in the group but it was very good 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.320
 have seen how easy it is to do and 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:22.979
 It was delicious, my lunch today is here. 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.330
 in lagoinha then this one I hope you 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.070

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:32.419
