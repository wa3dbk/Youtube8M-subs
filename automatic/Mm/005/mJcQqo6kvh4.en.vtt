00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.210
 ok then today on the pics fire shoot 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.520
 fire is not so difficult as it can 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.410
 seem really enough for you 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.180
 usually SLR or any other 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.279
 camera that has a manual 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.320
 mode to start let's see what is 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.150
 we want to get in the pictures do we want 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.340
 freeze the flames or vice versa 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.349
 show their movement as both 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.380
 option looks quite impressive I 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.390
 I'll show you how to shoot and 1 and 2 , unlike 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.309
 sub ziro i don't have super powers 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.719
 and freeze items in motion me 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.239
 short exposure will help 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.129
 to immobilize the sparks of flame I 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.530
 I put the excerpt within one three hundred 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.420
 20 seconds can be set and shorter and 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.039
 length and this is an amateur 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.840
 Well, in general, it all turns out 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.520
 experimental amount of light 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.219
 falling on the matrix is adjustable 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.440
 aperture but watch out for mushroom if frame 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.750
 underexposed we lift out about but again 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.010
 same watch out for noise as models 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.539
 I have the usual matches 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.460
 I will try to shoot their moment 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.170
 fire as matches enough 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.670
 small items i will use 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.710
 macro rings for more 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.189
 large detailed picture but now 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.189
 behind 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.930
 freeze is over and now you can 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.850
 go to shooting fire in motion here 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.950
 everything is exactly the opposite excerpt by 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.720
 length and diaphragm cover up by 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.370
 this from flying sparks we get such 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.490
 beautiful plumes and it will look 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.870
 truly fascinating pose not 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.370
 It will sparkler as during 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.200
 first very well suited for such 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.150
 sort of experiments and secondly after 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.110
 new year I have them until the fig and 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.110
 so steam burn 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.790
 and so we can say that today we gave 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.810
 the heat is burned to the fullest as well 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.780
 learned all this beautiful 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.890
 they've learned the truth 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.390
 now you can safely go to places 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.770
 welder clusters and offer them 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.260
 professional photo shoots 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.120
 but seriously fire at the expense of his 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.010
 gives unpredictability to a large field 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.600
 for creativity and creativity therefore 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.520
 Only during experiments 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.250
 experiments try not to burn the hut 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:55.660
 shorter okay subscribe to the channel set 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:57.400
 Like and my name is Artem Dalai and to 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:01.890
 The example was more visual I decided 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:05.250
 compare smartphone and canon 5d mark 2 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:07.900
 cho drove 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.940
 as you can see I have a table and a glass with 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.220
 whiskey but it's not at all because I decided 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.810
 drink for love because decided everything 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.400
 it's nice to take a picture and already 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.190
 only then drink for love 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.000
 well in our case to the photo and so 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.040
 we have around the world 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.830
 our color scheme is one light source 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.540
 he is constant with us he will shine on 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.570
 background and give a beautiful radial 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.570
 gradient
