you about three inches to come down and
about<00:01:56.680> three<00:01:56.979> inches<00:01:57.250> to<00:01:57.430> wrap<00:01:57.610> around<00:01:57.640> the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
about three inches to wrap around the

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.110 
about three inches to wrap around the
sides<00:01:58.240> and<00:01:58.979> this<00:01:59.979> is<00:02:00.190> a<00:02:00.220> little<00:02:00.550> easier<00:02:00.729> than

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
sides and this is a little easier than

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.940 
sides and this is a little easier than
trying<00:02:01.479> to<00:02:01.630> bend<00:02:01.870> the<00:02:01.990> wire<00:02:02.170> and<00:02:02.470> then<00:02:02.650> do<00:02:02.830> it

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
trying to bend the wire and then do it

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.640 
trying to bend the wire and then do it
so<00:02:03.700> when<00:02:03.880> I<00:02:03.970> get<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.150> Jade<00:02:04.479> clips<00:02:04.810> all<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.530> way

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
so when I get the Jade clips all the way

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.339 
so when I get the Jade clips all the way
around<00:02:06.010> I<00:02:06.280> just<00:02:06.790> have<00:02:06.909> the<00:02:07.030> frontier<00:02:07.510> to<00:02:07.780> clip

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349
