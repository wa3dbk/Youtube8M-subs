00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:04.869
 In the absence of a national research institute 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.970
 Jong Wook Park 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.970
 I met Kim Jung Min more 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.680
 I'm having fun. 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.340
 Shim, 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.619
 There are plenty of time to go to Cheonan 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.079
 At home 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.079
 It supports the Internet. 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.130
 It's not easy to say, but it's easy. 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:33.750
 Time at home 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.440
 If you work for 10 companies, Kim Dong-wan also works 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.590
 I would like to announce that 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.420
 To answer 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.700
 The Foundation 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.700
 I tried. 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.060
 Play Series 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.780
 There was no review. 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.930
 maximization 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.930
 What was not originally planned 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.890
 Jeonnam province is also 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.630
 I want to do more 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:11.890
 In the contract 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.400
 I'm ready. 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.330
 10 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.520

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.970
 ak. 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.390

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.390
 wr 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.680
 Scheduled. active 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.030
 I see a lot of Jeju University. That 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.010
 You have to pitch and have a very sorry heart for your professor. 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.850
 I did not go to school a lot. 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.460
 I only give a lecture for the exam 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.460
 If you do not have a lot of test scores, 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.370
 I decided to persuade him to make a joint film. 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.650
 In that respect, 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.990
 A lot of schools come. I did not upload much with my friends yesterday. 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.200
 I can not say that the 6th team, adt capes, 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.890
 1.6 million 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.340
 Said in a favorable tone. 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.480
 We are the first to be so 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.050
 Let's get together. 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.030
 Planning to enjoy nature, thanks to the director as well as travel 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.609
 For the first time 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:12.849
 I'm a slaughter peer to learn. 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.239
 I do not know anyone and I do it every year with my father. Everything 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:18.920
 Institutionalization 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.939
 I had a restoration. 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:23.939
 Peugeot Of course there were those who did not find out. 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.920
 There are many things that made you comfortable on the 6th, 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.489
 When I look at the effect, 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.290
 If it is not famous, then next year 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.879
 I did not say much. 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.029
 I can not change the changes I've seen. 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:41.779
 Team Power 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:44.779
 To us, the unified 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.049
 I have to teach you a lot of things, 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.810
 We have to meet a sick person who wants to go to our bussiness that plants did. 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:53.529
 Do not you 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:56.779
 I want to know this relationship again. 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:02:59.750
 Of course, 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.510
 From a man 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.979
 There are times when I have a light dream that led me to second place. 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:07.209
 When mobilized 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.049
 Of course, exposure 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.299
 A friend of mine 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.489
 Tomorrow, a friend who is not a girlfriend, gets worse. 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.579
 Of course I do. 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:20.619
 Moving plants 

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:21.999
 Rumors are the biggest reason 

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:25.099
 Let me tell you something. 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.099
 Free tour 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:29.369
 Livedoor 

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:31.659
 Time is also strong 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:32.669
 Call time 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:35.669
 Even if I met Tong 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:39.590
 In the case of rural people, a large part of the private industry 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:42.769
 This sensitive construction 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.769
 Which broadcasting union is present 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.239
 I'm suspicious. 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.239
 6. A long time ago, now 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.289
 I do not think I'd change it into a story. 

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:57.039
 Photo activity rested 

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:59.319
 More opportunities 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:00.469
 You can stand and watch 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:02.439
 Korean Air 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:04.279
 i See 

00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:07.179
 Recruitment soon 

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:08.339
 I wish I could stop it 

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:11.339
 Too sensitive to their children's sensitivities. 

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:16.479
 Because I have such an idea 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:17.699
 Because it is too early 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.029
 I do not think so. 

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.419
 I'm older 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.090
 Our fans 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.189
 May I bless you to plant Lee So-yeon 

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:27.479
 bbk ex-representative 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:30.479
 I can meet you. 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:40.139
 96 years 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:41.159
 961122 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:44.159
 2007 Preventing waste of 5 years already 

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:50.829
 The question of whether or not to think hard 

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:54.749
 On the brutal side, a large population of 110,000 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.449
 When you climb 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:04.819
 It's good in terms of having plenty of good stuff, but it's compatible. 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.800
 I saw you blowing. 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:11.199
 Cancer is soft 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:12.360
 Han Kyung Hee 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.659
 If it's bad 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:16.729
 I felt I could not be stronger than I wanted 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:21.069
 Something in scale 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:24.110
 And now, if you're a writer, 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.809
 At the end of the movie 

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:27.779
 United and 

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:30.680
 Hanssem's face is much more charming than the face 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.069
 Take charge of 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:33.580
 If you like stuffed 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.779
 It's really nasty. 

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:37.809
 Kwon Joon-mo Nexon 

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:40.809
 I opened my eyes and I was tears. 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.210
 I do not argue. 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.210
 Great case for the user through 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.229
 Busan Station and theft robber 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:52.229
 I would like to discuss the network expansion 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.810
 I can not see him, so I'm not letting some of that cut down. 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:00.499
 go to learn 

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:01.389
 Of course the railway union 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:04.850
 When I was talking about temperature recently 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.860
 Do not. 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.550
 Such a price, though, 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.550
 Because I'm dating. By the way 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.770
 Domain auction 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.400
 I went back to the racket when I saw it again. 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.990
 Chemical business implementation 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.409
 I want to curry 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:24.820
 Ask more of your ideal 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.270
 If you are 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.550
 I do not know. 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.490
 In any industry, 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.129
 Teachers think such actors 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:36.069
 That's how it looks. 

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:39.069
 I'm just looking at it. 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.080
 Bucheon O-Jeong The opposite of Park Jong-woon 

00:06:44.829 --> 00:06:47.119
 In the Attack Comprehensive Section 

00:06:47.119 --> 00:06:49.559
 Are you presenting 

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:51.059
 It is producing a turnaround. 

00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:54.059
 Next 035720 

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:14.330

 Would you like to
