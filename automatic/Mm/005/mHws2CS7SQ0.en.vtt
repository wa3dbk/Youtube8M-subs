house work back life to this area that

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:48.790 
house work back life to this area that
has<00:05:45.419> been<00:05:45.630> long<00:05:45.930> gone<00:05:47.060> the<00:05:48.060> last<00:05:48.090> time<00:05:48.539> that

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
has been long gone the last time that

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.529 
has been long gone the last time that
they<00:05:49.800> were<00:05:49.919> this<00:05:50.130> amount<00:05:50.460> of<00:05:50.669> juicy<00:05:51.120> herbicide

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
they were this amount of juicy herbicide

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:55.430 
they were this amount of juicy herbicide
last<00:05:51.900> year<00:05:53.000> which<00:05:54.000> i<00:05:54.539> guess<00:05:54.930> this<00:05:55.110> gives

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
last year which i guess this gives

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.529 
last year which i guess this gives
really<00:05:55.710> a<00:05:55.800> continuation<00:05:56.010> of<00:05:56.639> last<00:05:56.880> year<00:05:57.330> and

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 
really a continuation of last year and

00:05:57.539 --> 00:07:07.379 
really a continuation of last year and
hopefully<00:05:57.720> it<00:05:58.020> will<00:05:58.260> be<00:05:58.470> a<00:05:58.669> regular<00:05:59.669> event

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:07.389 

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:12.460
