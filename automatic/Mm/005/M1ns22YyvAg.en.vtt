00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello, do you want to make this video? 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.480
 what we do every week to 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.500
 try to summarize the main news of 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.429
 technology 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.429
 welcome to sync 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.850
 Apple officially introduced its 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.380
 new iphone or best iphones company 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.260
 introduced two new models this 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.570
 week iPhone 5 is its new top 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.820
 line that brings as a novelty a camera 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.740
 improved with 2 LED flash one 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.660
 more efficient balance sheet processing 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.270
 of color and a goal of greater aperture 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.340
 to improve image capture 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.469
 another novelty are the videos that now 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.780
 can be captured there are 120 frames per 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.250
 second in hd resolution something that will do 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.110
 the difference in scenes with a lot of 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.640
 movement and also for the creation of 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.129
 slow motion movies 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.320
 iphone 5 s hardware has been updated 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.780
 with the processor 7 that will come with the 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.850
 64-bit architecture an important 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.770
 innovation in the smartphone business 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.420
 the new processor is 40 times more 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.190
 powerful than the first iphone 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.210
 promises to be twice as fast as 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.250
 his predecessor 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.470
 instead of continuing to sell the iphone 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.960
 5 apple confirmed the rumors and 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.850
 introduced the iphone 5 c device with 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.040
 specifications but with a 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.220
 much more eye- catching visual and finish 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.020
 in materials of lower quality than 5s 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.009
 be bought with fidelity of two years 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.570
 with the operator 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.670
 iphone 5 6 comes by price 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.770
 interesting from 99 dollars 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.829
 however if purchased unlocked your 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.720
 course is $ 649 indicating that he 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.369
 is not an input device and its cost 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.320
 It's almost the same as I'm with you. 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.180
 android as soon as apple announced its 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.490
 new iphone handsets suffer a 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.829
 price reduction here in Brazil iphone 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.829
 5 is being sold 100 reais more 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.350
 cheap for 2,299 reais 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:50.399
 the iphone 4s suffered a greater reduction of 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.680
 300 reais to 1,399 other model 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.930
 sold in brazil or iphone 4 continues 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.310
 with the same price as before one thousand and ninety 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.079
 and nine reais 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.729
 summarizing, it can not be said that the 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.680
 iphones have become cheaper in brazil 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.920
 I think the most correct would be to say 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.689
 that they were less expensive 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.729
 other good news for brand fans 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.459
 apple 's launch date 7 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.750
 the system received the most modification 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.030
 appearance in its history and also has 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.860
 a new notification center 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.319
 the applets of the apple begins to receive the 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.480
 update on the 18th, the fifth and the ipad 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.849
 from its second generation the iphone to 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.310
 4 from the fifth touch ipad 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.049
 generation and ipad me but keep an eye on 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.420
 that not all of these devices will have 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.190
 all the features of s 7 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.670
 especially the older ones may have 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.810
 some of the functions disabled 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.000
 remembers that e-mail service that the 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.890
 couriers were preparing this week 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.500

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.840
 objective to face the north services 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.160
 Americans like gmail 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.530
 in response to a series of scandals 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.060
 about invasion of privacy by account 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.220
