use<00:00:52.500> any<00:00:52.649> hardware<00:00:52.980> buttons<00:00:53.539> so<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.600> should

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
use any hardware buttons so you should

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.090 
use any hardware buttons so you should
just<00:00:55.170> have<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> button<00:00:55.710> on<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.860> right<00:00:55.980> hand

types<00:03:05.530> of<00:03:05.650> people<00:03:06.130> really<00:03:06.280> care<00:03:06.549> about<00:03:06.810> now

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
types of people really care about now

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.180 
types of people really care about now
one<00:03:07.959> of<00:03:07.989> the<00:03:08.109> things<00:03:08.170> we've<00:03:08.440> also<00:03:08.620> focused<00:03:08.889> on

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
one of the things we've also focused on

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.940 
one of the things we've also focused on
is<00:03:09.340> blurring<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.180> line<00:03:10.420> between<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:11.500> web<00:03:11.739> and

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
is blurring the line between the web and

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.699 
is blurring the line between the web and
the<00:03:12.010> native<00:03:12.790> device<00:03:13.090> we<00:03:13.959> found<00:03:14.170> that<00:03:14.349> a<00:03:14.470> lot<00:03:14.680> of

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
the native device we found that a lot of

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.140 
the native device we found that a lot of
people<00:03:14.799> on<00:03:15.160> their<00:03:15.280> desktop<00:03:15.639> on<00:03:15.790> their<00:03:15.970> phone

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
people on their desktop on their phone

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.210 
people on their desktop on their phone
use<00:03:16.299> a<00:03:16.329> mixture<00:03:16.660> of<00:03:16.780> native<00:03:17.200> applications<00:03:17.799> as

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
use a mixture of native applications as

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.330 
use a mixture of native applications as
well<00:03:18.519> as<00:03:18.910> web<00:03:19.870> applications<00:03:20.440> but<00:03:21.069> these<00:03:21.160> web

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
well as web applications but these web

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.890 
well as web applications but these web
applications<00:03:21.880> are<00:03:22.000> trapped<00:03:22.269> inside<00:03:22.510> of<00:03:22.810> their

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
applications are trapped inside of their

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.170 
applications are trapped inside of their
taps<00:03:23.200> in<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.470> web<00:03:23.620> browser<00:03:23.919> but<00:03:24.819> we<00:03:24.910> want<00:03:25.090> to

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
taps in the web browser but we want to

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.520 
taps in the web browser but we want to
break<00:03:25.389> down<00:03:25.510> that<00:03:25.569> barrier<00:03:25.750> so<00:03:26.290> for<00:03:26.440> example

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
break down that barrier so for example

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.589 
break down that barrier so for example
with<00:03:26.859> google<00:03:27.160> calendar<00:03:27.669> I<00:03:27.819> don't<00:03:28.329> want<00:03:28.450> to<00:03:28.510> go

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
with google calendar I don't want to go

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.180 
with google calendar I don't want to go
to<00:03:28.720> google<00:03:28.989> calendar<00:03:29.139> to<00:03:29.500> see<00:03:29.650> my<00:03:29.769> calendar<00:03:30.130> I

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
to google calendar to see my calendar I

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.099 
to google calendar to see my calendar I
want<00:03:30.370> to<00:03:30.430> see<00:03:31.060> my<00:03:31.180> calendar<00:03:31.569> in<00:03:31.630> my<00:03:31.720> phone

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
want to see my calendar in my phone

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.640 
want to see my calendar in my phone

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
calendar or my desktop calendar so this

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.130 
calendar or my desktop calendar so this
is<00:03:35.799> a<00:03:35.829> good<00:03:35.980> example<00:03:36.099> of<00:03:36.430> this<00:03:36.599> this<00:03:37.599> is<00:03:37.720> almost

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
is a good example of this this is almost

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.750 
is a good example of this this is almost
like<00:03:38.230> the<00:03:38.500> address<00:03:38.769> book<00:03:38.920> on<00:03:39.069> most<00:03:39.250> phones<00:03:39.489> you

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
like the address book on most phones you

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.509 
like the address book on most phones you
can<00:03:39.790> see<00:03:40.030> a<00:03:40.060> list<00:03:40.209> of<00:03:40.329> contacts<00:03:40.890> and<00:03:41.890> then<00:03:41.920> has

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
can see a list of contacts and then has

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.110 
can see a list of contacts and then has
an<00:03:42.640> example<00:03:42.939> if<00:03:43.000> i<00:03:43.090> type<00:03:43.590> florian<00:03:44.590> as<00:03:45.489> a<00:03:45.549> tap

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
an example if i type florian as a tap

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.270 
an example if i type florian as a tap
Florian<00:03:46.599> we<00:03:47.200> can<00:03:47.349> see<00:03:47.500> we've<00:03:47.620> got<00:03:47.650> Florian's

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
right there so this provides really

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.280 
right there so this provides really
really<00:03:58.750> nice<00:03:58.930> integration<00:03:59.590> of<00:04:00.629> the<00:04:01.629> web<00:04:01.810> into

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
really nice integration of the web into

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.899 
really nice integration of the web into
different<00:04:02.739> parts<00:04:02.860> of<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:03.099> native<00:04:03.760> phone

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:03.909 
different parts of the native phone

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:05.850 
different parts of the native phone
operating<00:04:04.299> system

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
operating system

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
operating system
obviously<00:04:06.860> we<00:04:06.950> also<00:04:07.100> want<00:04:07.310> to<00:04:07.370> support<00:04:07.550> native

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
obviously we also want to support native

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.520 
obviously we also want to support native
apps<00:04:08.030> as<00:04:08.180> well<00:04:08.210> so<00:04:08.510> if<00:04:08.570> I<00:04:08.720> if<00:04:09.050> I<00:04:09.200> come<00:04:09.380> out<00:04:09.500> here

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
apps as well so if I if I come out here

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.850 
apps as well so if I if I come out here
and<00:04:09.830> I<00:04:09.920> tap<00:04:10.130> the<00:04:10.720> Gallery<00:04:11.720> I<00:04:12.140> can<00:04:12.410> see<00:04:12.590> this<00:04:12.710> is

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
and I tap the Gallery I can see this is

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.470 
and I tap the Gallery I can see this is
the<00:04:12.890> gallery<00:04:13.220> application<00:04:13.790> this<00:04:14.030> provides<00:04:14.330> a

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
the gallery application this provides a

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.180 
the gallery application this provides a
really<00:04:14.750> clean<00:04:15.080> view<00:04:15.320> of<00:04:15.440> all<00:04:15.560> my<00:04:15.680> pictures<00:04:15.920> and

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
really clean view of all my pictures and

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.400 
really clean view of all my pictures and
videos<00:04:16.489> s'ok<00:04:17.360> example<00:04:17.750> like<00:04:17.840> the<00:04:17.989> slide<00:04:18.170> over

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
videos s'ok example like the slide over

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.470 
videos s'ok example like the slide over
here<00:04:18.590> it's<00:04:18.800> a<00:04:18.830> really<00:04:19.040> simple<00:04:19.310> sleek<00:04:19.940> organic

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
here it's a really simple sleek organic

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.820 
here it's a really simple sleek organic
interface<00:04:20.720> is<00:04:21.020> very<00:04:21.050> much<00:04:21.290> focused<00:04:21.500> on

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
interface is very much focused on

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.540 
interface is very much focused on
content<00:04:23.800> so<00:04:24.800> for<00:04:24.890> example<00:04:24.950> if<00:04:25.160> I<00:04:25.250> load<00:04:25.400> this

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
content so for example if I load this

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.520 
content so for example if I load this
picture<00:04:25.940> I<00:04:26.120> talked<00:04:26.840> about<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.140> left<00:04:27.320> edges

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
picture I talked about the left edges

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.080 
picture I talked about the left edges
for<00:04:27.920> loading<00:04:28.430> your<00:04:28.490> frequently<00:04:28.910> used

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
for loading your frequently used

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.060 
for loading your frequently used
applications<00:04:29.480> the<00:04:29.750> bottom<00:04:30.050> edge<00:04:30.200> this<00:04:30.920> is

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
applications the bottom edge this is

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.650 
applications the bottom edge this is
where<00:04:31.310> you<00:04:31.670> can<00:04:31.820> access<00:04:31.970> functionality

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
where you can access functionality

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.650 
where you can access functionality
within<00:04:32.840> that<00:04:33.020> so<00:04:33.980> for<00:04:34.100> example<00:04:34.190> here<00:04:34.570> you<00:04:35.570> know

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
within that so for example here you know

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.270 
within that so for example here you know
I<00:04:35.690> can<00:04:35.960> share<00:04:36.170> it<00:04:36.320> i<00:04:36.410> can<00:04:36.560> delete<00:04:36.770> the<00:04:36.920> picture

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
I can share it i can delete the picture

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.940 
I can share it i can delete the picture
so<00:04:37.610> for<00:04:37.730> example<00:04:37.760> if<00:04:38.030> i<00:04:38.120> tap<00:04:38.450> share<00:04:39.170> and<00:04:39.860> I

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
so for example if i tap share and I

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.470 
so for example if i tap share and I
could<00:04:40.070> share<00:04:40.250> on<00:04:40.400> Facebook<00:04:40.940> or<00:04:41.120> Twitter<00:04:41.300> or

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
could share on Facebook or Twitter or

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.020 
could share on Facebook or Twitter or
anywhere<00:04:41.780> else<00:04:42.190> now<00:04:43.190> one<00:04:43.340> of<00:04:43.370> the<00:04:43.520> things<00:04:43.550> we

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
anywhere else now one of the things we
