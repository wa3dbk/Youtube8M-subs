ilysm you can see what the feathers move
in<00:02:52.390> heat<00:02:52.630> you<00:02:52.870> know<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.080> wind<00:02:53.290> just<00:02:53.500> turns

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
in heat you know the wind just turns

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.699 
in heat you know the wind just turns
them<00:02:54.069> with<00:02:54.580> that<00:02:54.610> fan<00:02:55.120> out<00:02:55.360> and<00:02:55.600> with<00:02:56.410> a<00:02:56.440> stuff

them with that fan out and with a stuff

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.340 
them with that fan out and with a stuff
for<00:02:56.860> decoy<00:02:57.190> that's<00:02:57.400> one<00:02:57.580> of<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:57.819> how<00:02:58.540> the

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
for decoy that's one of the how the

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.199 
for decoy that's one of the how the
realism<00:02:59.860> with<00:03:00.190> them<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.580> way<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.850> feathers

realism with them the way the feathers

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.210 
realism with them the way the feathers
catch<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.660> light<00:03:01.870> you<00:03:02.830> know<00:03:02.920> you<00:03:02.980> get<00:03:03.190> a

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
catch the light you know you get a

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.440 
catch the light you know you get a
little<00:03:03.400> bit<00:03:03.490> of<00:03:03.550> that<00:03:03.610> down<00:03:03.910> and<00:03:04.180> feather

little bit of that down and feather

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.840 
little bit of that down and feather
movement<00:03:04.930> just<00:03:05.740> make<00:03:05.950> some<00:03:06.130> really<00:03:06.400> realistic

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
movement just make some really realistic

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.150 
movement just make some really realistic
gear<00:03:07.270> set<00:03:07.600> up<00:03:07.720> yeah<00:03:08.230> so<00:03:08.440> typically<00:03:08.800> year<00:03:09.069> in

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
gear set up yeah so typically year in

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.710 
gear set up yeah so typically year in
and<00:03:09.310> year<00:03:09.340> out<00:03:09.489> when<00:03:09.760> I'm<00:03:09.850> turkey<00:03:10.239> hunting<00:03:10.569> I

and year out when I'm turkey hunting I

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.690 
and year out when I'm turkey hunting I
typically<00:03:11.380> want<00:03:11.620> to<00:03:11.680> have<00:03:11.770> four<00:03:12.069> decoys<00:03:12.520> at

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
typically want to have four decoys at

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.760 
typically want to have four decoys at
least<00:03:12.940> in<00:03:13.150> my<00:03:13.300> base<00:03:13.600> camp<00:03:13.959> whether<00:03:14.470> I<00:03:14.530> have

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
least in my base camp whether I have

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.199 
least in my base camp whether I have
them<00:03:14.890> out<00:03:14.980> in<00:03:15.069> the<00:03:15.130> field<00:03:15.370> is<00:03:15.580> kind<00:03:15.880> of<00:03:16.000> a

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
them out in the field is kind of a

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.570 
them out in the field is kind of a
decision<00:03:16.870> I'll<00:03:16.959> make<00:03:17.140> game<00:03:17.470> time<00:03:17.770> but<00:03:18.040> usually

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
decision I'll make game time but usually

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.910 
decision I'll make game time but usually
I<00:03:18.760> like<00:03:18.790> to<00:03:18.940> have<00:03:19.120> to<00:03:19.330> hem<00:03:19.569> decoys<00:03:20.020> a<00:03:20.380> Jake

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
I like to have to hem decoys a Jake

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.460 
I like to have to hem decoys a Jake
decoy<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:21.700> a<00:03:22.030> Strutter<00:03:22.300> Tom<00:03:22.570> and<00:03:23.080> I<00:03:23.260> think

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
decoy and a Strutter Tom and I think
