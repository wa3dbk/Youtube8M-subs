00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.950
 the manufacture of such a sober jewel 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.649
 either it's an incredibly process 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.090
 complex ar and gold is specialist of the 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.849
 chain and guarantees its customers a 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.230
 clean and artisanal work philippe a 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.730
 so chose to show us how 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.440
 manufactory is one of the bestsellers of the 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.580
 French jewelery in fact we will you 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.770
 to show simply that we will manufacture 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.240
 a curb like that there since 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.529
 made a Parisian order arrived 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.199
 there and so in fact we will start the 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.570
 produce here in front of you so in fact one 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.689
 will go in the gaudord ain we go 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.090
 rolling on rolling mills and we will bring 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.059
 so in fact gold bullion you see 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.270
 there a spinning of a diameter of 24 is 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:44.050
 actually 24 mm or 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.940
 2.4 cm with this son thereafter 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.620
 we will move to another table of 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.820
 production christian chefs 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.930
 of workshops which we blur the 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.340
 face for security issues 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.680
 is at the maneuver 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.870
 the order requires shaping 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.059
 bracelet in yellow gold he works so 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.260
 enough material for that its 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.030
 glove protects it from burning 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.040
 that would cause the contact of the gold wire 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.110
 with his skin because this operation 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.420
 jostles the matter after a few 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.160
 minutes the desired diameter is obtained 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.640
 the rolling mill now has allowed to do 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.260
 the thread 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.759
 this film is still say a meter 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.729
 square actually we're actually 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.750
 currently to create a primer for 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.880
 allow him now to get into 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.480
 a sector that will be able to return it to 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.040
 united states will donate diameter 24 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.980
 to do this in fact we will use a 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.420
 other type of machine tool we will say 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.070
 called a stretching bench 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.780
 electric simply because the 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.150
 man's hand failed to fire 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.950
 this width to bring him back to a 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.090
 diameter less than a very strong 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.650
 pressure of dishes you will see 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.600
 precisely now the site that is going to be 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.700
 stretched by the good to shoot through 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.140
 different channels to get off of 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.200
 diameter in the square queues that 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.260
 currently at 27 so at 2 7 mm for the 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.030
 to put on it of 24 mm of 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.500
 diameter to protect himself christian 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.240
 indisposed above the chain stretched 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.110
 metal hoops that blocks the 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.420
 projection of the film 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.280
 the pressure is very strong and broken 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.950
 when the sector serves as a goal and 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.680
 between each step the material goes through 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.970
 fire to regain its malleability 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.860
 regularly she is also cleaned 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.330
 in this mixture acidify which him 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.190
 give back its colors we pass now 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.960
 in fact to the can so that in 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.880
 do we turn around a shade 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.910
 if we go we will make one so that we 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.620
 will turn around a chuck forgiveness 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.180
 7th wire diameter for simply 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.710
 actually put up the males and 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.290
 to have this game of mike we were calling on 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.560
 to be able to cut in mesh is therefore in 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.020
 made 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.370
 for the little story we'll do that 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.770
 you will notice that we see that there is a 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.060
 little paper in fact that home and and 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.110
 we do nothing more and nothing less 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.430
 that a paper the directory is a 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.350
 internal technique because in fact there 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.390
 allows us to burn from the station by 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.250
 fact that seems most appropriate and 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.200
 in fact we will now shoot this film 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.720
 is afterwards you will see that in fact 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.390
 we will put this set called 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.400
 so a cane that just red light 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.660
 before melting the metal to remove in 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.209
 did this mike set that we have 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.250
 conceived christian believes at that moment the 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.320
 number of mesh required the curb 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.920
 will be prepared in horse knit as one 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.600
 the call is arranged in 1 + 3 which 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.940
 means a big stitch for 3 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.989
 small the jeweler calculates so that 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.510
 for both gourmette 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.330
 he will have to get 25 big stitches and 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.580
 60 small past to fire the paper 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.319
 burn and winter a micro spaces that 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.090
 facilitate the extraction of 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.340
 can without damaging them 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.959
 now we're done so we rolled this 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.879
 son around this chuck so did 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.799
 our canti we will now actually 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.420
 cut the links for actually cut 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.609
 our kantipur in detours for in 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.439
 get jerseys his jerseys got 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.739
 in valais jean mallet the ones in the 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:35.590
 other 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:38.799
 solder and shape them more 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.430
 later will come the lim step of the 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.769
 walkout 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.180
 of the clasp and the finished object this makes 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.609
 more than an hour the process has 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.109
 started the body is done at the 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:50.150
 hand and demonstrates once again the 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:52.730
 impressive dexterity required for 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.230
 that in the wake of christian soda 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.920
 mesh with a mixture of his 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.989
 composition 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.670
 at no time does the material get 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.469
 respite and it is now a test 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.329
 very physical who expects christian in 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:04.159
 done here we will put the curb in 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.030
 form is that we will give him the beginning 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.489
 of its final form 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.319
 so in fact we tend the curb as 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:13.250
 these make sure that the links 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:14.480
 are all well positioned by 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.310
 relationship to others and using two 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.389
 finches done and we turn on and embryos 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.959
 to the channel offered about will give him 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.280
 its shape 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.410
 that's what you'll see now 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.630
 so that sounds pretty trivial to do 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.539
 so does this require a 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:30.199
 technicality and a physical force that is 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:32.180
 still very consistent the 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:34.160
 gourmette to the cheekbone so and what 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.720
 horse internet + 3 to the right width 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.830
 now it has been properly 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.599
 form is so now we're going to do the 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.610
 line up 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:42.320
 after which we will move to another 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.849
 step that will actually be putting in eraser 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.199
 lacquer, which will also 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:46.909
 continue to limay but on the faces 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:48.979
 so here we go we will actually use 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:50.380
 what's called a limay bin for 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:54.289
 systematically recover all 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.030
 metal scraps of course always is 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:05:01.880
 really very simply and that's enough 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:03.919
 hot of power when the time of gom 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.180
 the cage has arrived that means that 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.250
 the manufacturing operation of the 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.380
 gourmette is about to end 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.300
 after the image the jeweler applies a 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.610
 magic substance shellac 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.590
 it's a substance that was heating up 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.780
 actually allow to take from 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.460
 taken is actually the curb on it 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.870
 first and then below equivalent 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.610
 with him but in fact so 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.940
 homogeneous to allow us to give 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.800
 the final appearance 2-2 of enamel and its turn 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.240
 actually achieve the desired weight so 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.099
 we calculated a little earlier in front 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.240
 of a computer as usual with the 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:34.430
 electronic scale makes it the 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.870
 percentage of metals found in 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.460
 did what were the goals of 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.870
 metal loss so we know we have to 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.130
 to get 18 gram of losses 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.120
 now on all of these two 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.500
 great masters since actually and 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.389
 if we have one but by calling in 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.949
 do two with that so now is going 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:48.560
 actually she splayed upside down 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:50.930
 to give the final look the proportion 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.510
 final stitch and final respect 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.789
 of weight be christian applied as 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.840
 joke on the dungeon burns our two 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:58.849
 hours of show the ccio is doing its 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.529
 appearance and then the last moves 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:02.599
 of line are given 80 g 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:05.389
 the goal is achieved at the fight 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:06.710
 and finally we'll say finished so now 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:08.750
 the extra production stage is going 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.520
 to be in fact there 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.060
 the finish that will go through first 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.130
 them 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.669
 the clasp design so it's going to be 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:19.080
 also handmade and adapted to measure 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:21.150
 exactly at the yard m and then we 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.669
 let's bend to know that we will have to 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:26.040
 makes the final appearance illustrated is very 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:27.720
 shining gold at the object we 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:30.180
 will punch as we saw everything to 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.160
 the time for the wedding rings and this 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.930
 item will be delivered to a wholesaler 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.300
 Parisian in its logistics center 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.919
 lyonnais elsewhere and then behind it will go 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.210
 at a jeweler who has some and 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:41.220
 already placed the order is certainly 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.419
 consumers who has already bought and 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.860
 when I say just now who the 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:45.780
 will be very hurried german during 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.490
 Next 30 or 40 years since we 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.350
 are on a sewing design in 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.120
 solid gold and this type of mesh actually 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.400
 live very well to say that it does not move 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.200
 it's not a jewel that's in my cheeks 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.950
 for asia the process will have lasted a 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.180
 little more than 2 

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:59.370
 we are far from the work at the chain 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.900
 and the result is impeccable to all 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.400
 the jeweler steps the risk that the 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.560
 misstep is therefore the obligation to 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.820
 start from scratch as much as you need 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.820
 master well to get there
