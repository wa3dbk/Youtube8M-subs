00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
alright so that was an easy recipe

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.150 
alright so that was an easy recipe
um<00:04:30.640> anything<00:04:31.640> else<00:04:31.790> I<00:04:31.970> can<00:04:32.090> say

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
um anything else I can say

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.650 
um anything else I can say
not<00:04:34.160> really<00:04:34.550> I'm<00:04:34.940> not<00:04:35.090> sure<00:04:35.210> how<00:04:35.330> long<00:04:35.390> it<00:04:35.600> will

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
not really I'm not sure how long it will

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.350 
not really I'm not sure how long it will
keep<00:04:35.870> at<00:04:36.200> least<00:04:36.410> a<00:04:36.560> week<00:04:36.740> probably<00:04:37.060> and<00:04:38.060> that

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
keep at least a week probably and that

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.760 
keep at least a week probably and that
seems<00:04:38.570> like<00:04:38.630> a<00:04:38.750> lot<00:04:38.990> of<00:04:39.020> salt<00:04:39.320> to<00:04:39.470> remember

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770
