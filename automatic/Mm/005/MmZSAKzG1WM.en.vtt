00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
flat thing it's actually more of like a

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.830 
flat thing it's actually more of like a
notebook<00:01:13.530> where<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.460> has<00:01:14.670> two<00:01:15.270> different

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
folds so really you actually walk around

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.000

solid<00:02:46.310> so<00:02:47.310> what<00:02:48.000> we<00:02:48.150> know<00:02:48.330> about<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.950> when<00:02:49.950> it

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
solid so what we know about it when it

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.460 
solid so what we know about it when it
first<00:02:50.250> that<00:02:50.549> was<00:02:50.790> leaked<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.930> was<00:02:52.080> going<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.380> be

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
first that was leaked it was going to be

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.400 
first that was leaked it was going to be
running<00:02:52.920> on<00:02:53.160> Windows<00:02:53.549> 7<00:02:53.910> but<00:02:54.780> since<00:02:55.140> then

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
running on Windows 7 but since then

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.949 
running on Windows 7 but since then
there<00:02:55.650> have<00:02:55.890> been<00:02:55.920> some<00:02:56.549> changes<00:02:57.120> apparently

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
there have been some changes apparently

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.650 
there have been some changes apparently
and<00:02:58.170> instead<00:02:58.950> they<00:02:59.190> decided<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.820> go<00:03:00.150> with<00:03:00.180> a

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
and instead they decided to go with a

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.009 
and instead they decided to go with a
Windows<00:03:01.560> Mobile<00:03:01.799> 7<00:03:02.540> it's<00:03:03.540> going<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.810> be<00:03:03.870> around

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
Windows Mobile 7 it's going to be around

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:04.780 
Windows Mobile 7 it's going to be around
it's<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.320> same

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
it's the same

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.839 
it's the same
one<00:03:04.909> is<00:03:05.090> that<00:03:05.659> as<00:03:05.900> well<00:03:06.319> as<00:03:06.500> off<00:03:06.769> of<00:03:07.069> the<00:03:07.640> Zune

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
one is that as well as off of the Zune

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.240 
one is that as well as off of the Zune
HD<00:03:08.000> so<00:03:08.959> it's<00:03:09.260> going<00:03:09.409> to<00:03:09.500> be<00:03:09.590> more<00:03:09.799> of<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:09.980> mobile

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
HD so it's going to be more of a mobile

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.250 
HD so it's going to be more of a mobile
focus<00:03:10.760> platform<00:03:11.239> but<00:03:11.420> that's<00:03:11.629> okay

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
focus platform but that's okay

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.530 
focus platform but that's okay
obviously<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.069> iPad<00:03:13.430> is<00:03:13.609> done<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:14.120> several

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
obviously the iPad is done and several

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.839 
obviously the iPad is done and several
others<00:03:14.780> are<00:03:15.140> doing<00:03:15.439> it<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:16.099> to<00:03:16.370> be<00:03:16.489> honest<00:03:16.760> I

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
others are doing it and to be honest I

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.539 
others are doing it and to be honest I
personally<00:03:17.299> think<00:03:17.450> that<00:03:17.569> even<00:03:18.230> though<00:03:18.560> you

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
personally think that even though you

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.089 
personally think that even though you
know<00:03:19.700> desktop<00:03:20.209> is<00:03:20.569> great<00:03:20.989> I<00:03:21.200> like<00:03:21.739> Windows<00:03:22.069> 7

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
know desktop is great I like Windows 7

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.390 
know desktop is great I like Windows 7
or<00:03:22.549> XP<00:03:22.939> or<00:03:23.299> whatever<00:03:24.010> tablets<00:03:25.010> really<00:03:25.250> need

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
or XP or whatever tablets really need

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.050 
or XP or whatever tablets really need
the<00:03:25.519> room<00:03:25.870> so<00:03:27.040> you<00:03:28.040> know<00:03:28.159> when<00:03:28.400> you<00:03:28.549> go<00:03:28.730> and<00:03:28.970> try

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
the room so you know when you go and try

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.119 
the room so you know when you go and try
to<00:03:29.180> put<00:03:29.359> Windows<00:03:29.629> 7<00:03:29.870> everything<00:03:30.260> on<00:03:30.439> it<00:03:30.590> I<00:03:30.739> can

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 
to put Windows 7 everything on it I can

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:32.589 
to put Windows 7 everything on it I can
see<00:03:31.280> how<00:03:31.459> you<00:03:31.519> know<00:03:31.849> it's<00:03:32.209> gonna<00:03:32.299> be<00:03:32.450> a<00:03:32.480> lot

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
see how you know it's gonna be a lot

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.690 
see how you know it's gonna be a lot
harder<00:03:32.629> to<00:03:32.959> get<00:03:33.079> an<00:03:33.319> interface<00:03:33.680> like<00:03:33.799> that<00:03:34.129> ok

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
harder to get an interface like that ok

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.520 
harder to get an interface like that ok
so<00:03:35.150> that's<00:03:35.359> about<00:03:35.510> all<00:03:35.840> we<00:03:35.959> know<00:03:35.989> about<00:03:36.290> the

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
so that's about all we know about the

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.610 
so that's about all we know about the
Microsoft<00:03:37.069> career<00:03:37.519> right<00:03:37.700> now<00:03:37.879> you<00:03:38.870> know<00:03:38.959> it

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
Microsoft career right now you know it

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.289 
Microsoft career right now you know it
just<00:03:39.980> looked<00:03:40.189> really<00:03:40.310> really<00:03:40.909> great<00:03:41.090> anything

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
just looked really really great anything

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.020 
just looked really really great anything
between<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.650> fact<00:03:42.859> that<00:03:42.950> it's<00:03:43.220> going<00:03:43.579> to<00:03:43.730> have

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
between the fact that it's going to have

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.110 
between the fact that it's going to have
that<00:03:44.389> very<00:03:44.780> unique<00:03:45.230> folding<00:03:45.739> design<00:03:46.120> which

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
that very unique folding design which

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.940 
that very unique folding design which
you<00:03:47.389> know<00:03:47.510> is<00:03:47.840> pretty<00:03:48.109> much<00:03:48.200> the<00:03:48.379> best<00:03:48.530> of<00:03:48.829> both

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
you know is pretty much the best of both

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.979 
you know is pretty much the best of both
worlds<00:03:49.459> so<00:03:49.790> far<00:03:49.819> we<00:03:50.299> don't<00:03:50.450> know<00:03:50.540> everything

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
worlds so far we don't know everything

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.800 
worlds so far we don't know everything
and<00:03:51.290> but<00:03:51.980> I<00:03:52.220> mean<00:03:52.669> to<00:03:53.090> me<00:03:53.209> that<00:03:53.239> sounded<00:03:53.659> like<00:03:53.750> a

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
and but I mean to me that sounded like a

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.309 
and but I mean to me that sounded like a
great<00:03:54.169> idea<00:03:54.549> the<00:03:55.549> interface<00:03:55.939> looks<00:03:56.239> amazing<00:03:56.930> I

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
great idea the interface looks amazing I

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.679 
great idea the interface looks amazing I
don't<00:03:58.189> know<00:03:58.310> so<00:03:58.459> much<00:03:58.489> about<00:03:58.669> really<00:03:59.299> being

00:03:59.679 --> 00:03:59.689 
don't know so much about really being

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:02.050 
don't know so much about really being
focused<00:03:59.900> on<00:04:00.169> the<00:04:00.379> pen<00:04:00.620> you<00:04:01.280> know<00:04:01.430> and<00:04:01.669> drawing

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
focused on the pen you know and drawing

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.720 
focused on the pen you know and drawing
stuff<00:04:02.470> but<00:04:03.470> still<00:04:03.709> I<00:04:03.769> think<00:04:04.040> that<00:04:04.280> has<00:04:04.579> a<00:04:04.609> lot

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
stuff but still I think that has a lot

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.550 
stuff but still I think that has a lot
of<00:04:04.909> potential<00:04:05.299> and<00:04:05.720> as<00:04:05.780> long<00:04:05.959> as<00:04:06.139> you<00:04:06.260> actually

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
of potential and as long as you actually

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.129 
of potential and as long as you actually
can<00:04:06.769> use<00:04:07.010> your<00:04:07.129> finger<00:04:07.579> and<00:04:07.810> you<00:04:08.810> know<00:04:08.930> just

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
can use your finger and you know just

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:10.210 
can use your finger and you know just
use<00:04:09.260> a<00:04:09.379> pen<00:04:09.590> for<00:04:09.709> meetings<00:04:09.979> like<00:04:10.099> the

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
use a pen for meetings like the

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.830 
use a pen for meetings like the
intricate<00:04:10.639> stuff<00:04:10.909> you<00:04:11.209> know<00:04:11.299> I<00:04:11.359> will<00:04:11.569> not<00:04:11.690> have

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
intricate stuff you know I will not have

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.189 
intricate stuff you know I will not have

ready<00:04:29.720> to<00:04:29.780> announce<00:04:30.080> it<00:04:30.320> but<00:04:31.220> what<00:04:31.400> we<00:04:31.550> do<00:04:31.760> know

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
ready to announce it but what we do know

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.890 
ready to announce it but what we do know
is<00:04:32.210> that<00:04:32.330> it<00:04:32.840> will<00:04:33.080> likely<00:04:33.470> probably<00:04:34.130> be

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
is that it will likely probably be

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.770 
is that it will likely probably be
released<00:04:35.900> and<00:04:36.639> you<00:04:37.639> know<00:04:37.729> the<00:04:37.909> fall<00:04:38.150> or<00:04:38.539> the
