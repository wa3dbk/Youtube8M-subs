00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:14.960
 today I want to show and tell my 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.960
 impressions about enhanced battery 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.440
 3100 milliamps 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.970
 but 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:30.360
 for xiaomi m2, such is the packaging 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.360
 battery came 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:37.420
 two colors they are gray and these are 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.460
 gray and dark blue if the blue 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.290
 how to say right here to me 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.680
 lucky this color 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.930
 battery you suit it immediately 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.300
 cover cap is the most standard 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.860
 the most ordinary matte plastic 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.150
 corporate very well done 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:05.140
 I can not say anything about it here 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:08.220
 such a set in thickness as far as 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:12.450
 the phone is getting thicker 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.620
 the manufacturer claims that 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.320
 phone thickness increases by 2 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.620
 millimeter 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.000
 from my observations I can say that 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.900
 Indeed it is two millimeters because 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.710
 what seems to some that more to them 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.640
 it seems somehow big but the situation 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:37.480
 what is this 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.930
 phone and cover phone here is phone 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.600
 lies 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.490
 standard with its factory cap and 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.860
 cap 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:50.200
 additionally for the battery they are on one 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:52.300
 level that is, if you put them on 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.870
 level nothing nowhere nothing 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.430
 above 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:02:02.710
 not lower that is, it turns out that 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:05.410
 phone with a standard cover from the start 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:10.119
 batteries in thickness such as only itself 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:12.840
 cover and increases the thickness of the phone 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.720
 exactly on this one 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.390
 edging that goes around the screen then 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.110
 there is an increase in speech goes exactly but 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.129
 These two millimeters here but somewhere 2 here 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.879
 that is, but this black edging 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:31.620
 when you close the battery it takes you into this 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:33.780
 edging rests lid rests and 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:39.030
 It turns out that exactly on this phone 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:41.610
 becomes mascara this is something from 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.540
 observation sheet thickness 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.540
 the battery is of course considerably thicker from 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.540
 native 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.200
 that's what we get 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.920
 two times thicker 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.430
 that's why the cover, respectively, and 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:18.760
 again who does not know the native cover where 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:25.090
 native cover can not native cover not 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:28.860
 close thanks for attention 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.860
 ask answer all questions
