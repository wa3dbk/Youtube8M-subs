the substitutions I prepare the team and

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.279 
the substitutions I prepare the team and
that<00:00:26.250> wasn't<00:00:26.519> good<00:00:26.730> enough<00:00:26.760> today<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.960> have

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
that wasn't good enough today and I have

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.900 
that wasn't good enough today and I have
to<00:00:28.410> take<00:00:28.590> responsibility<00:00:28.710> for<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.550> outcome

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
to take responsibility for the outcome

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.900 
to take responsibility for the outcome
of<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:30.060> today<00:00:31.430> it's<00:00:32.430> really<00:00:32.820> difficult<00:00:33.630> to

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
of that today it's really difficult to

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.760 
of that today it's really difficult to
comprehend<00:00:35.910> what<00:00:36.899> actually<00:00:37.260> happened<00:00:37.620> during

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
comprehend what actually happened during

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.430 
comprehend what actually happened during
that<00:00:38.059> 98<00:00:39.059> minutes<00:00:39.300> because<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.899> certainly<00:00:41.239> was

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
that 98 minutes because it certainly was

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.090 
that 98 minutes because it certainly was
unrecognizable<00:00:43.440> from<00:00:43.590> what<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.890> has<00:00:44.070> been<00:00:44.280> and

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
unrecognizable from what it has been and

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.600 
unrecognizable from what it has been and
but<00:00:47.149> as<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.300> said<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:49.340> have<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.460> throw

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
but as I said I have to throw

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.160 
but as I said I have to throw
responsibility<00:00:51.300> for<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.629> wasn't<00:00:52.050> good<00:00:52.140> enough

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
responsibility for it wasn't good enough

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.319 
responsibility for it wasn't good enough
and<00:00:53.449> it<00:00:54.449> can't<00:00:54.719> ever<00:00:54.960> happen<00:00:55.530> again<00:00:56.059> we<00:00:57.059> didn't

like us so far this season they scored

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.760 
like us so far this season they scored
uh<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.759> was<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.939> bit<00:01:24.390> fortuitous<00:01:25.110> they<00:01:25.259> got<00:01:25.740> a

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
uh it was a bit fortuitous they got a

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.350 
uh it was a bit fortuitous they got a
bit<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.100> deflection<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.700> anything<00:01:26.939> but<00:01:27.119> it

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
bit of a deflection on anything but it

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.640 
bit of a deflection on anything but it
flew<00:01:27.479> into<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.750> top<00:01:27.990> corner<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:28.500> weren't

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
flew into the top corner and we weren't

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.560 
flew into the top corner and we weren't
one-nil<00:01:29.040> down<00:01:29.070> but<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.700> was<00:01:29.820> very<00:01:29.880> earlier<00:01:30.360> in

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
one-nil down but it was very earlier in

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.719 
one-nil down but it was very earlier in
the<00:01:30.659> game<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.350> fully<00:01:32.040> expected<00:01:32.549> us<00:01:32.700> to

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
the game and I fully expected us to

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.960 
the game and I fully expected us to
bounce<00:01:33.000> back<00:01:33.210> from<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.860> I<00:01:34.860> don't<00:01:35.790> take

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
bounce back from that I don't take

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.660 
bounce back from that I don't take
anything<00:01:36.210> away<00:01:36.390> from<00:01:36.509> Rochdale<00:01:37.049> at<00:01:37.170> all<00:01:37.670> it

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
anything away from Rochdale at all it

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.410 
anything away from Rochdale at all it
was<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.909> very<00:01:39.299> good<00:01:39.659> team<00:01:39.869> performance<00:01:40.350> by<00:01:40.500> then

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
was a very good team performance by then

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.020 
was a very good team performance by then
but<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.479> think<00:01:42.750> they<00:01:42.899> had<00:01:43.340> five<00:01:44.340> chances<00:01:44.820> in<00:01:44.970> the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
but I think they had five chances in the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.420 
but I think they had five chances in the
second<00:01:45.329> half<00:01:45.450> five<00:01:45.689> efforts<00:01:46.020> ago<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.560> they've

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
second half five efforts ago and they've

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.370 
second half five efforts ago and they've
scored<00:01:47.640> with<00:01:47.820> three<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.030> them<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:49.140> that's

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
scored with three of them and that's

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.050 
scored with three of them and that's
worrying<00:01:49.710> from<00:01:49.950> my<00:01:50.070> point<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.399> view<00:01:50.460> very

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
worrying from my point of view very

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.190 
worrying from my point of view very
worried<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:53.329> I'm<00:01:54.329> going<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.570> have<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.750> sit<00:01:54.960> down

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
worried so I'm going to have to sit down

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.530 
worried so I'm going to have to sit down
and<00:01:55.470> have<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.460> good<00:01:56.640> think<00:01:56.880> over<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.180> next<00:01:57.210> few

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
and have a good think over the next few

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.120
