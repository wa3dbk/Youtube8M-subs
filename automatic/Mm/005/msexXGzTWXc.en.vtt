00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
system boats and what we did is we pair

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.119 
system boats and what we did is we pair
them<00:00:35.250> down<00:00:35.790> so<00:00:36.540> those<00:00:37.170> boats<00:00:37.410> were<00:00:37.590> both<00:00:37.739> 13

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
them down so those boats were both 13

bub you know the bigger boats they still
are<00:00:50.399> here<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.820> know<00:00:50.910> obviously<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:52.199> mirage

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
drive kind of front center on the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.660 
drive kind of front center on the
revolution<00:00:54.539> 11<00:00:55.039> fits<00:00:56.039> right<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.399> there<00:00:56.550> it

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
revolution 11 fits right in there it

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.790 
revolution 11 fits right in there it
comes<00:00:56.879> with<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.180> rudder<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.809> hatch<00:00:58.079> got<00:00:58.530> a

comes with the rudder the hatch got a
tiny<00:00:59.160> bit<00:00:59.460> smaller<00:00:59.789> but<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:01.020> know<00:01:01.109> it's<00:01:01.289> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
tiny bit smaller but you know it's the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.319 
tiny bit smaller but you know it's the
biggest<00:01:02.219> thing<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.609> biggest<00:01:02.879> surprising

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
biggest thing the biggest surprising

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.450 
biggest thing the biggest surprising
feature<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:04.379> know<00:01:04.500> we<00:01:04.769> comp<00:01:05.010> acted<00:01:05.339> these

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
feature is you know we comp acted these

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.890 
feature is you know we comp acted these
boats<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.880> unless<00:01:06.270> they're<00:01:06.510> right<00:01:06.659> next<00:01:06.780> to

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
boats and unless they're right next to

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.969 
boats and unless they're right next to
each<00:01:06.960> other<00:01:07.080> it's<00:01:07.350> hard<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.650> tell<00:01:07.799> them<00:01:07.890> apart

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
each other it's hard to tell them apart

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.859 
each other it's hard to tell them apart
sahaja<00:01:08.670> how'd<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.119> lose<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.420> volume<00:01:09.720> or<00:01:09.840> the

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
sahaja how'd you lose the volume or the

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.510 
sahaja how'd you lose the volume or the
length<00:01:10.110> where<00:01:10.590> did<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.799> come<00:01:10.979> from<00:01:11.010> there's<00:01:11.460> a

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
length where did it come from there's a

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.940 
length where did it come from there's a
little<00:01:11.850> bit<00:01:11.939> less<00:01:12.090> I'm<00:01:12.420> 6<00:01:12.689> foot<00:01:12.869> 2<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.380> losing<00:01:13.890> it

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
little bit less I'm 6 foot 2 I losing it

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.890 
little bit less I'm 6 foot 2 I losing it
and<00:01:14.040> legroom<00:01:14.220> no<00:01:14.760> no<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.299> legroom<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.689> pretty

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
and legroom no no the legroom is pretty

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.060 
and legroom no no the legroom is pretty
much<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.110> same<00:01:16.409> as<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.680> bigger<00:01:16.830> brother

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
much the same as the bigger brother

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.850 
much the same as the bigger brother
boats<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.549> mean<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.330> then<00:01:18.750> obviously<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.470> just

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
boats I mean and then obviously it just

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.590 
boats I mean and then obviously it just
depends<00:01:20.159> on<00:01:20.250> where<00:01:20.400> you're<00:01:20.490> at<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:21.150> water<00:01:21.360> and

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
depends on where you're at the water and

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.510 
depends on where you're at the water and
the<00:01:21.689> system<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.080> you're<00:01:22.170> going<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.320> use

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
the system that you're going to use

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
the system that you're going to use
obviously<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> bigger<00:01:23.820> boat<00:01:24.060> it's<00:01:24.360> going<00:01:24.479> to

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
obviously the bigger boat it's going to

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.730 
obviously the bigger boat it's going to
be<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.659> little<00:01:24.869> bit<00:01:25.020> faster<00:01:25.140> through<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.590> water

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
be a little bit faster through the water

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.320 
be a little bit faster through the water
and<00:01:25.950> it's<00:01:26.070> going<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.220> handle<00:01:26.580> rough<00:01:26.790> water<00:01:27.060> and

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
and it's going to handle rough water and

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.910 
and it's going to handle rough water and
open<00:01:27.570> seas<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.049> long<00:01:28.229> trips<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.650> little<00:01:28.829> bit

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
open seas and long trips a little bit

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.069 
open seas and long trips a little bit
better<00:01:29.009> but<00:01:29.670> surprise<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.210> know<00:01:30.329> most<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.900> us

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
better but surprise you know most of us

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.330 
better but surprise you know most of us
when<00:01:31.350> we<00:01:31.470> get<00:01:31.590> out<00:01:31.680> on<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.829> water<00:01:31.860> we're<00:01:32.250> out

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
when we get out on the water we're out

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.679 
when we get out on the water we're out
there<00:01:32.520> for<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.759> couple<00:01:32.909> days<00:01:33.119> after<00:01:33.420> work<00:01:33.570> you

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
there for a couple days after work you

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.810 
there for a couple days after work you
know<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> couple<00:01:34.020> hours<00:01:34.200> after<00:01:34.560> work<00:01:34.740> or<00:01:35.100> little

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
know a couple hours after work or little

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.160 
know a couple hours after work or little
trips<00:01:36.060> here<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.390> there<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.720> obviously<00:01:36.780> these

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
trips here and there and obviously these

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.480 
trips here and there and obviously these
boats<00:01:37.470> they<00:01:37.740> store<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.070> little<00:01:38.250> bit<00:01:38.430> better

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
boats they store a little bit better

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.010 
boats they store a little bit better
because<00:01:38.700> they're<00:01:38.909> shorter<00:01:39.240> putting<00:01:39.840> them<00:01:39.930> on

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
because they're shorter putting them on

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.330 
because they're shorter putting them on
the<00:01:40.110> roof<00:01:40.290> they're<00:01:40.500> obviously<00:01:40.829> lighter<00:01:41.070> and

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
the roof they're obviously lighter and

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.760 
the roof they're obviously lighter and
that<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.450> know<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.689> stability<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.680> know

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
that you know the stability is you know

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.440 
that you know the stability is you know
almost<00:01:44.070> identical<00:01:44.820> we<00:01:44.939> didn't<00:01:45.149> really<00:01:45.240> lose

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
almost identical we didn't really lose

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.480 
almost identical we didn't really lose
any<00:01:45.720> width<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:46.560> we<00:01:46.680> just<00:01:46.829> cut<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> little<00:01:47.310> off

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
any width so we just cut a little off

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.620 
any width so we just cut a little off
the<00:01:47.640> length<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.000> kind<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.299> trim<00:01:48.450> them<00:01:48.600> down

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
the length and kind of trim them down

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.450 
the length and kind of trim them down
and<00:01:49.020> that's<00:01:49.439> truly<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.829> case<00:01:50.040> for<00:01:50.280> me<00:01:50.369> in

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
and that's truly the case for me in

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.120 
and that's truly the case for me in
kayak<00:01:50.700> fishing<00:01:50.909> like<00:01:51.270> I've<00:01:51.420> started<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:52.020> a

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
kayak fishing like I've started in a

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.469 
kayak fishing like I've started in a
16-foot<00:01:53.130> boat<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.460> I'm<00:01:53.549> now<00:01:53.700> down<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.119> 12

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
16-foot boat and I'm now down to a 12

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.050 
16-foot boat and I'm now down to a 12
yeah<00:01:54.869> exactly<00:01:55.020> simply<00:01:55.530> because<00:01:55.860> we<00:01:56.040> we<00:01:56.850> just

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
yeah exactly simply because we we just

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.370 
yeah exactly simply because we we just
unloaded<00:01:57.390> off<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.719> truck<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.140> know<00:01:58.229> what

I don't go that far anymore and the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.209 
I don't go that far anymore and the
shorter<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.479> more<00:02:00.689> convenient<00:02:01.049> right<00:02:01.619> yeah<00:02:02.189> I

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219
