00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.529
 these two football helmets are in 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.210
 very similar appearance but that of 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.769
 left can contribute even more to the 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.500
 health of a player since he is equipped 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.130
 shock sensors 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.240
 personally it changes nothing at the level 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.650
 skills at the level of 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.869
 performance but what is interesting 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.660
 we all know the transport boss 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.970
 of physics then it allows the level of 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.010
 prevention to prevent especially the 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.350
 level of impact that gives me strength 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.490
 angers it gives a number of impacts so 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.020
 on all the joys of the line 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.789
 defensive I think he's harmless 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.579
 those who are in sugar with their country 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.710
 are provided with their boxes are equipped 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.640
 belts like this for the season 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.530
 2014 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.390
 the green &amp; gold has about thirty 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.130
 helmets with sensors that are connected 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.750
 wireless to a digital tablet 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.760
 if a shock of the passes have made 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.930
 acceptable the medical staff of 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.600
 the team can intervene quickly 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.000
 with a player is to have a 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.800
 additional tool more objective than 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.570
 in relation to the impacts the players have 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.940
 received that to trust the players who 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.670
 come to see us after receiving a 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.199
 helping hand that may not be good 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.879
 we can have young information and 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.860
 to see them the athlete directly for 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.560
 make sure that all today ten times 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.909
 the player also to hide 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.939
 his wound or until and everything mixed for 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.740
 know that two want from the north the world 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.360
 sports medicine is growing 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.270
 informed about the consequences of 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.920
 concussions to the candidate 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.960
 Japanese a flash as they say on a 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.670
 contact with a ball carrier 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.780
 if ever interesting especially that here 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.090
 when we say that a big one can 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.800
 come back ankle knee but the head 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.970
 is up an important pistachio of 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.800
 protect his size and especially kemoun 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.619
 later in the future I hope to have 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.909
 my accountant of fallope the size will be 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.200
 important yes exactly we do not want 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.799
 mortgaging our as soon as a 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.119
 coach may perceive signs of 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.759
 concussions that I am that before his 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.440
 famous deaf tower actually we do 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.770
 call to the medical team who will go there 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.240
 monitored from the time that 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.640
 medical teams take over a 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.729
 athlete us simply a big sportsman 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.530
 we remove from our time alignment 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.869
 to stop this and bike the evaluation 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.600
 surface after that is the team 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.399
 medical who advocates as difficult 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.810
 the athlete could return to the game or not 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.370
 shock sensors and software 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.600
 transmit the data but do not pose 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.160
 no diagnosis 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.410
 this work remains that of the team 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.660
 medical field because this 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.720
 operation we were given the information 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.880
 than 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.060
 I see a concussion but no tools 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.740
 in the market caught 50 elections for 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.030
 to prevent is always what we want 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.310
 not warned we start it's true 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.440
 we can do it in bleed have 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.780
 no problem of goal to be match but 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.580
 there is more than the diagnosis of 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.200
 concussion on the field yossi 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.360
 studying all the data 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.580
 statistics in terms of making 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.960
 best practice choices we speak 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.780
 of educational that could 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.790
 at higher risk of limiting these 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.170
 educational not to make others are 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.850
 a little less and this same but a 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.530
 sports point of view confirmed anyway 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.270
 to improve the team to prepare 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.920
 for a match in the heat of the action 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.020
 players are sometimes ready for anything 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.240
 but for the green &amp; gold the health of 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.400
 student athletes is the priority 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.650
 left staff this is the homeland will only 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.720
 not on this big couple who went there a 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.980
 little will take them products will come out 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.720
 still points -2 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.910
 the green and gold is the first team of the 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.080
 Quebec circuit to acquire helmets 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.080
 equipped with shock sensors
