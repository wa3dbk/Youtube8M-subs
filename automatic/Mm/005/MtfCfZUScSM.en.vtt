00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.679
 operating with the system m due 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.210
 advantages are already evident from the 

00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:10.219
 foundations in effect 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.070
 regardless of the type of foundation 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.169
 employee curbs beams or soleras this 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.119
 can be dimensioned in a reduced way 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:19.520
 thanks to the uniform distribution of 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.440
 the loads and the greater lightness what 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.360
 It translates into an obvious saving 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.430
 economic from the foundations leave 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.830
 6 mm reinforcing irons 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.990
 diameter that have an altitude of 30 to 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.029
 40 centimeters to allow the 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.870
 introduction and anchoring of panels 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.870
 structural 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.640
 in the double panel is then introduced a 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.380
 connection formwork so that the 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.380
 set to be even more supportive 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.070
 the next phase consists of mounting 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:54.800
 align and approve the panels in the base 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.719
 of construction the operation can 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.420
 run with metal brassieres 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.250
 adjustable and with aluminum bars or 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.710
 also with traditional material from 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.009
 works like mural boards or whatever 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.009
 available 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.329
 to guarantee static continuity 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.750
 the panels are tied together and 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:18.300
 fix on reinforcement irons 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.190
 the execution can be done with the use 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.570
 of specific devices or more 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.730
 simply with tools 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.820
 traditional that are used in the works 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.040
 like tweezers or pincers 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.080
 all the structural nodes like 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.240
 angles and splices and all the parts 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.979
 submitted mostly to effort are 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.860
 reinforced with mesh portions 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.140
 Galvanized electrowelded steel for 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.380
 have a better continuity between 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.329
 the walls 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.280
 in areas with a seismic risk 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.530
 strong with the case of problems 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.240
 structural changes can be 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.170
 introduce internal reinforcements 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.170
 integrative 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.860
 the intrados is internally armed to 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.299
 can contain the concrete casting 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.789
 positioning the assembly so that 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:06.310
 can build or not the accommodation of 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.500
 an eventual roll holder container in 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.360
 the inside of the panel double the casting of 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.209
 concrete is executed in a traditional way 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.980
 with the system m due the laundry can 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.620
 run even in conditions 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.480
 Adverse climate also thanks to the 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.940
 high degree of isolation of 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.250
 panels the hardening time of 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.650
 Concrete turns out to be much faster 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.830
 with the system m due the positioning 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.120
 of the fabrics has been extremely 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.310
 simplified thanks to the proven 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.890
 lightness and malleability of the panels 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.170
 structures like balconies cornices and 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.209
 similar ones are executed by positioning the 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.340
 frameworks compatible with the 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.319
 beams and the light of them what 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.420
 results in an obvious saving of time 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.790
 and a greater structural homogeneity 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.280
 the placement of orthogonal walls 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.590
 slabs and everything you want to anchor in 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.959
 The supporting panel can be made in 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.970
 any point leaving the irons of 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.910
 call or integrating them in any 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.550
 moment 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.650
 The placement of the staircase module is very 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.200
 simple as in the case of the foundations 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.090
 it is necessary to predispose irons 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.250
 call that can be integrated or 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.460
 also introduced in a second 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.320
 moment the staircase module constituted 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.240
 by landings and ramps is already delivered 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.190
 ready for the coating and not 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.590
 requires subsequent interventions for 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:27.470
 the formation of the steps 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.930
 its solidity is guaranteed not only by 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.940
 the armor cast in situ but also 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.330
 by coating itself mesh 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.330
 galvanized steel 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.690
 in industrial engineering, they are valued 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.000
 totally the constructive speed of the 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.890
 system and cleaning work 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.800
 tracings are executed with a simple 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.150
 hot air jet at this point the 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.100
 connection of the pipes already 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.560
 predisposed becomes a 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.510
 Extremely simple operation and no 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.120
 involves demolition costs and 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.760
 additional restoration the cut of 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.100
 possible portions of mesh allows the 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.590
 placement and housing of parts of 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.120
 the installation of any dimension the 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.220
 installation of the junction boxes 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.650
 of electrical installations or 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.200
 telephone the step fixing and 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.980
 cable or tube housing runs 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.980
 quickly 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.639
 the internal and external plaster in this 

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:22.630
 case is limited to being the element of 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.030
 traditional finish 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.430
 normally a first hand is given until 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.810
 coat the irons and a second hand 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.810
 leveling and finishing 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.810
 it is necessary that the different phases are 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.240
 execute using good materials 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.409
 quality and respecting the times of 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.929
 hardening 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:45.149
 Coverages can be executed with 

00:04:42.929 --> 00:04:47.639
 any inclination shape or 

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:50.729
 geometric composition with surfaces 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.889
 flat curves or composite all 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:55.469
 always with uniformity and continuity 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.969
 functional and static characteristics of 

00:04:55.469 --> 00:05:00.399
 m due system 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:03.309
 in the cover casting will be placed 

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:05.199
 then waterproofing the system 

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:07.629
 of water drainage and the layer of 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:09.279
 coverage if the 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:11.229
 building is now ready to be 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:13.799
 finished and completed with the placement 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:17.619
 of internal and external joinery 

00:05:13.799 --> 00:05:21.119
 flooring sanitary coatings and 

00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:21.119
 finally to be painted
