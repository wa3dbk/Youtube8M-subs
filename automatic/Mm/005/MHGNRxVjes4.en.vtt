00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.160
 Hi all 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.950
 incredible novelty and we're going to have to 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.700
 learn to run again from what 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.270
 We are talking 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:27.210
 war moments of newton this sneaker 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.880
 in particular particularities is a 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.900
 shoe that forces or demands us 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:38.420
 run with the front of what 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:41.640
 because you will ask many understand 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.980
 we understand that it is the natural way of 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.079
 all if you do not try to take away our 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.600
 running shoes and running 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.460
 you will see how clearly does not enter 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920
 confronted but in three with the 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.699
 front of the foot and what it raises 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.799
 this brand that is newton is that 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.710
 rediscover is the way to run that 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:06.159
 has particular in the afternoon of his 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.890
 sole has some shock absorbers for 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.380
 each of our metatarsals or 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.990
 our fingers in short with a 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.330
 chassis that gives rigidity to the torsion 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.460
 side and a small cushion in 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.470
 heel is a sneaker to bring 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.479
 running shoes are also available 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.069
 runway shoes 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:29.640
 The manufacturer assures us that you save 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:33.940
 approximately 30% effort not 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.720
 we're only going to save 30% of 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.810
 our energy when it comes to running 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.750
 but also let's save or go 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.890
 to greatly reduce the possibility of 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:50.070
 knee ankle injuries 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.400
 as hip because this is given 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.140
 that we run we enter with the 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.140
 heel 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.110
 and what happens to us that hits our 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.780
 heel especially our structure 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:07.640
 when you go from tip to navas what 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.220
 does it pivot so 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.800
 that we managed to muffle a very 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.610
 a very important part of the blow 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:20.210
 this that seems very simple is in 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:23.120
 definitive the way in which we 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.710
 we are made and by changing or having 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.870
 changed over time our 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.550
 way of running has caused many 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.150
 Sometimes injuries 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.680
 important issues 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.989
 you have to keep in mind that as 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.049
 you have to learn to run again to 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.989
 times that repositioning rhythm of the 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:44.470
 musculature generates some problem not 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:47.470
 only insured that between 15 days 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.650
 and about 20 of adaptation this 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:54.210
 new product then you can not no longer 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.010
 you will be able to leave it definitively 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.030
 who has used it 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.810
 speak frankly well 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.310
 I think it's interesting to understand from 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.010
 the biomechanical view how 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.110
 it works and we're going to give you a little 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.170
 support in this same video so that what 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.500
 you can see in what agreement comes up 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.500
 other 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:21.099
 I hope I can introduce ourselves 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:21.099
 continuously products as many as this one 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.060
 and
