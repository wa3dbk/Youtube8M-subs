00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.130
 well we think after these videos 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.600
 quite educational where feeding 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.760
 is the most important thing to be on hand 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:18.130
 the fruits and vegetables exactly 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:20.230
 worked is good to continue another review 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.580
 more we have metal and still live which 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.259
 now available for pressure 3 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:28.990
 playstation 4 460 one and for all 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.210
 consoles it is true that it is very short and 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.010
 plasencia you can you me there are videos that 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.620
 only fit in 10 minutes but let's say a 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.719
 average that the normal gamer 2 hours is 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.579
 it's up to look here after we're 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.649
 in a very interesting detail this game 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.079
 is technically a demo for which 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.629
 it follows that a metal comb is lifted 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.670
 which does not have an exit date but 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.620
 while this kojima spinner producer said 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.690
 post they have there as it entertains 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.360
 entertain and in the detail is that is 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.880
 charging for this demo then 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.739
 around how much are they charging from 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.530
 to have paid me depends on where 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.000
 buy or that is in 1999 in 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.600
 benefits if you buy it here in 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.850
 Mexico 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.360
 physically they cost 500 pesos interest 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:16.340
 with Monday twice for ten minutes 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:17.450
 let's say for those but there are exactly 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.760
 many missions are unlocked 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.070
 also recounts to plays interest for 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.720
 the playstation version is in what 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.850
 it's Friday in force to return those 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.220
 metal transmissions of an original 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.920
 of playstation and pérez engines for xbox 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.410
 is this one retained the character of 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.090
 shows and the 2 the raid corner in this one 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.280
 for this radio then like that in 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.720
 vain added to a plus to each console 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.399
 but hey that is ground zero method 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:48.189
 recommendable if they have a lot of wool 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.619
 it was also in the anniversary edition 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:52.539
 which is in hd if you remember this game that 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.670
 came out there for the original xbox in 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:57.450
 his first years I still have notes 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.090
 so the truth was a game 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.920
 that promised many things that good the 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.170
 game was not promised by the one who promised 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.210
 it was the same as the creator Peter Molyneux 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.489
 the trigger will event a string of 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.349
 lies that if you stay a while 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.269
 stopped you can see the grass growing and 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.480
 the trees also believing pure 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:19.440
 lies at the end of the game go being 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.000
 moment, yes, but look what it has 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.549
 this game is that you can use the 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.849
 application of xbox smart glass 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.769
 Luis back as never consult the 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.840
 map screen describes what they say 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.190
 and much more has it all includes the 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.920
 additional soccer content of the 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.530
 charters have also added achievements 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.000
 for the first time also new engine 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.769
 of game that moves the graphics 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.769
 remastered in high definition 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.450
 actually the facebook of the first one does not 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.250
 is very cool already with the graphics improvement 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.140
 what they did looks more like 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.680
 grown not because the beginning of 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.680
 cartoons 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:06.769
 we have already talked about this and we see with 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.739
 which is also deleted for 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.030
 exclusive playstation 4 we were doing 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.890
 a week also in the df in the 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.319
 presentation where in fact the character 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.780
 had to be like imitating that what 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.970
 they had arrested made if they leave came out in 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.319
 the news as well as that for part of 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.510
 the campaign not of the realities of 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.150
 control and we can see where they arrest the 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.810
 beaten the game is very cool 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.489
 from sandbox or is it an open world 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.670
 where they control this shake that goes 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.920
 acquiring to be able to know I understand 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.790
 powers now use a lot of karma 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.160
 remember that it is making decisions 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.069
 also if you want to be take poison or 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.390
 more good or bad and if it is already a sandbox and 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.800
 the action is so big you have then 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.620
 then flying can be many things 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.200
 in seeing oneself with the truth is very good 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.620
 He had had good reviews other 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.640
 bad reviews however youtube 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.690
 final edition 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.580
 in that control 7 is good game is very 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.310
 good sandbox is graphically very cool 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.240
 in game gameplay in what is the game 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.310
 per se 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.260
 you have several powers to choose but 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.360
 they are very similar with each other 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.710
 then in the gameplay he lacked the 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.750
 truth I would give it a rating 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.209
 from 1 to 10 I would give it 18 hours and it's 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.410
 very cool but it could have been better not 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.790
 taking into account the two games 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.840
 previous if you have not played the others 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.940
 answer that gets to be for 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.620
 playstation3 in both the one and the two 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.960
 and as well as its contents that sometimes 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.430
 but well, with more music mozart 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.040
 our film section which everything 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.770
 the world is asking and this and also 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.750
 for aníbal to the mix but yes indeed 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.400
 this guy you like us a lot 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.290
 try with the old programs to 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.360
 hamas goodbye interactive 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.950
 we enter here out of control 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.950
 out of control 6 control
