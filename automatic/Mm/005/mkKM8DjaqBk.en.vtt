00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:05.080
 and good to all youtube guys in 

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:08.860
 this time we are in a new video and 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:12.550
 I'm going to teach this how to make mechanisms 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:15.940
 in minecraft and without needing any 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:18.490
 good way for this as you can see 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.250
 here we have what would be this 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.610
 small barrier that well in many of 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:27.310
 the maps that you download at 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.240
 better and they find something similar 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.759
 like this they ask you what 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.690
 put sand inside what 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.219
 I would come doing this chicken 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.030
 and well this is what happens when 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.030
 you put it 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.280
 as you can see there is the barrier of 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:49.670
 sand 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.570
 that the truth is very cool and I'm going to 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:56.370
 be showing as how to create one 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.660
 good for this let's go to a place 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.660
 I'm going to teach you 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.260
 let's see it here you dig 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.950
 the size that you want in me 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:17.610
 I'm going to put it here 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:21.479
 high you put about five or 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.439
 six of deep there are you see how much 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.770
 they need 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.770
 well it can be five 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:32.830
 2. 3. 4 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.350
 5 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.350
 and they all put him like that in 5 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.240
 We dig around 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.980
 let's go here 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:56.410
 that this trick is very signal 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:59.540
 since it will be of much use to us 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:02.930
 good once you have downloaded 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:06.260
 so they make a small hole 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:09.220
 there in the penultimate place 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:13.790
 sand will now break on the sides 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:17.200
 here and here then they will put what 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.200
 it would be a cactus 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.980
 how can you see here like this 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:29.290
 now the next thing is to grab a sign 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.290
 and they're going to be putting them on 2 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.930
 we put others here 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.459
 well so now they are going to put us 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.459
 ahead 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.060
 as you are seeing right now here 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.970
 good to see we need one here ready 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.060
 once you have this 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:09.110
 you can put here a 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.110
 a wall type 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.780
 it's just an example you want with more 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.400
 they calm it 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.799
 and because 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.890
 and they are going to put what would be the 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:27.120
 sand here as you can see it does not fall 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.120
 because there are the signs 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:35.940
 you are going to calculate how deep 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:41.210
 they were 5 we are not going to 1 with this 2 3 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.210
 it's 45 they all put them like that 5 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.670
 here we have this 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.530
 and you guys there decide how deep 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:02.790
 they want this to be 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:05.130
 I do it like that only because then for 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:09.020
 not be so long the video good as 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.020
 they can see us stay something 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.130
 and you're ready guys you'll have one that would come 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.130
 being its mechanism 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.050
 since as we still do not 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:28.130
 we have this what it would have been 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:31.250
 rest rest, we can not do well 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.140
 the mechanisms and good guys I say 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.849
 that this is you already with more 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:40.949
 imagination could deliver 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:42.779
 so many something so super cool I do not 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:46.460
 I do it because for lack of time 

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:50.470
 well, it's just a matter of 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.470
 making gravel and sand 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.240
 and the wall falls 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.190
 you liked the video subscribe to me 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.760
