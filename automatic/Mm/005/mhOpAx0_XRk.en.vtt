00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.780
 all we will do a demonstration of the abdominal region 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.999
 beginning with parental peace after an indecision 

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:11.489
 the skin is an event 

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:15.409
 here in this party was not totally separated the sudden tissue 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:17.419
 of the skin 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:20.419
 subcutaneous tissue in the region to have some 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.939
 presents the muscle 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:27.849
 Let's go with the prisoner would have called him moscow 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.810
 here the fibers appear 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:30.949
 a little more 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.590
 The stones with the sales are the muscle fibers 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.950
 I do not know if they noticed you when you pulled a song 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.450
 the pair will be high 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.550
 we should have cucumber years of contract 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.820
 here is another layer of subcutaneous tissue called deep leaflet 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.380
 and after seeing the muscular plane 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.930
 in the region to have something of the order we bought three abdominal muscles well 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.030
 developed the first muscle 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.460
 the public or 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.730
 I expect 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.130
 of the actor 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.860
 after 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.340
 rebate 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.820
 let's observe 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.930
 public 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.860
 of the abdomen 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.260
 whose fibers are disposed in a manner 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.890
 is vice-versa to obmep and external ensuring greater protection for the 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.380
 abdominal cavity 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.570
 is the second layer of skeletal muscles the internal audience of the 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.400
 abdomen 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.020
 and the third layer the transverse abdomen 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.900
 these are the lateral muscles of the actor 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.000
 the abdomen 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.180
 presents the 4th well the muscle 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.180
 to stand 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.440
 centrally 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.870
 with the fibers the sense or institutional in relation to the major axis of the body of the 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.050
 animal 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.420
 is a straight abdominal muscle 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.590
 so there are four abdominal musicians the clip this season 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.470
 internal public 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.679
 transversal 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:13.959
 they approve 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.269
 internal public 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:15.739
 in the interview
