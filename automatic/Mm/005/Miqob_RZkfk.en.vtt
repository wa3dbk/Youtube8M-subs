00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.740 
clocks in them grana all the clocks see
at<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.430> same<00:04:14.609> time<00:04:14.849> but<00:04:15.000> the<00:04:15.120> point<00:04:15.269> of<00:04:15.510> this

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
at the same time but the point of this

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.539 
at the same time but the point of this
is<00:04:16.079> is<00:04:16.289> you<00:04:16.590> have<00:04:16.680> three<00:04:16.889> different<00:04:17.099> entrance

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
is is you have three different entrance

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.009 
is is you have three different entrance
ways<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.030> tracks<00:04:18.299> and<00:04:18.599> then<00:04:18.840> you're<00:04:18.930> gonna

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
ways to the tracks and then you're gonna

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.330 
ways to the tracks and then you're gonna
place<00:04:19.169> signs<00:04:19.560> and<00:04:19.739> you<00:04:19.799> can<00:04:19.919> pretty<00:04:20.039> much<00:04:20.130> be

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
place signs and you can pretty much be

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.719 
place signs and you can pretty much be
like<00:04:20.549> train<00:04:21.419> to<00:04:21.599> Boston<00:04:21.840> 5:00<00:04:22.710> to<00:04:23.070> 9:00<00:04:23.099> so

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
like train to Boston 5:00 to 9:00 so

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:24.890 
like train to Boston 5:00 to 9:00 so
that's<00:04:23.849> pretty<00:04:23.969> much<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.150> signs<00:04:24.599> before<00:04:24.750> I

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
that's pretty much the signs before I

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.940 
that's pretty much the signs before I
didn't<00:04:25.110> write<00:04:25.260> on<00:04:25.380> them<00:04:25.500> to<00:04:25.560> show<00:04:25.710> you<00:04:25.800> because
