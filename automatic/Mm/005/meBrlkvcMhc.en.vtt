its alleged narcotic properties Anthony
really<00:00:26.160> yes<00:00:26.609> because<00:00:27.210> for<00:00:27.660> too<00:00:27.900> long<00:00:28.140> we<00:00:28.769> have

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
really yes because for too long we have

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.589 
really yes because for too long we have
been<00:00:29.099> not<00:00:29.310> only<00:00:29.340> allowing<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.150> turkey<00:00:30.449> to

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
been not only allowing the turkey to

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.959 
been not only allowing the turkey to
fill<00:00:30.779> us<00:00:30.929> up<00:00:31.080> on<00:00:31.349> Thanksgiving<00:00:32.099> but<00:00:32.640> also

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
fill us up on Thanksgiving but also

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.810 
fill us up on Thanksgiving but also
expecting<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.440> put<00:00:34.620> us<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.829> sleep<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:35.460> what

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
expecting it to put us to sleep so what

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.770 
expecting it to put us to sleep so what
are<00:00:35.910> we<00:00:35.969> talking<00:00:36.270> about<00:00:36.300> we're<00:00:36.570> talking<00:00:36.660> about

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
are we talking about we're talking about

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.000 
are we talking about we're talking about
tryptophan<00:00:38.570> turkeys<00:00:39.570> yes<00:00:40.170> we<00:00:40.620> are<00:00:40.770> talking

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
tryptophan turkeys yes we are talking

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.830 
tryptophan turkeys yes we are talking
about<00:00:41.070> Turkey<00:00:41.430> Kristen<00:00:41.760> because<00:00:41.879> tryptophan

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
about Turkey Kristen because tryptophan

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.060 
about Turkey Kristen because tryptophan
is<00:00:43.110> an<00:00:43.140> amino<00:00:43.290> acid

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
is an amino acid

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.250 
is an amino acid
aka<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.940> protein<00:00:45.390> building<00:00:45.719> block<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:46.200> is

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
aka a protein building block that is

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.660 
aka a protein building block that is
found<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.590> Turkey<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.160> its<00:00:47.340> chemical

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
found in Turkey and its chemical

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.910 
found in Turkey and its chemical
properties<00:00:47.700> are<00:00:48.629> thought<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.050> make<00:00:49.170> us<00:00:49.320> drowsy

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
properties are thought to make us drowsy

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.369 
properties are thought to make us drowsy
after<00:00:50.250> Thanksgiving<00:00:51.120> our<00:00:51.329> bodies<00:00:51.930> use

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
after Thanksgiving our bodies use

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.750 
after Thanksgiving our bodies use
tryptophan<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.280> produce<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.610> hormone

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
tryptophan to produce a hormone

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.319 
tryptophan to produce a hormone
serotonin<00:00:54.469> which<00:00:55.469> produces<00:00:56.270> slow-wave<00:00:57.270> sleep

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
serotonin which produces slow-wave sleep

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.430 
serotonin which produces slow-wave sleep
hence<00:00:58.289> this<00:00:58.920> turkey<00:00:59.609> napping<00:01:00.359> connection<00:01:01.260> but

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
hence this turkey napping connection but

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.500 
hence this turkey napping connection but
there<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.739> wrinkle<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:03.090> turkey

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
there is a wrinkle in this turkey

there is a wrinkle in this turkey

leave<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.750> Thanksgiving<00:02:07.200> table<00:02:07.320> for

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
leave the Thanksgiving table for

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.059 
leave the Thanksgiving table for
instance<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:08.670> is

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
instance and this is

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.610 
instance and this is
gross<00:02:09.459> for<00:02:09.789> instance<00:02:10.179> alright<00:02:10.539> but<00:02:10.810> our<00:02:11.379> small

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
gross for instance alright but our small

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.199 
gross for instance alright but our small
intestines<00:02:12.099> and<00:02:12.219> large<00:02:12.430> things<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.939> all<00:02:13.030> that

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
intestines and large things to all that

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.149 
intestines and large things to all that
food<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.900> studies<00:02:14.290> have<00:02:14.379> shown<00:02:14.560> that<00:02:14.739> that<00:02:14.980> is

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:15.159 
food and studies have shown that that is

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.270 
food and studies have shown that that is
related<00:02:15.609> to<00:02:15.780> sleeping<00:02:16.780> so<00:02:17.260> our<00:02:17.590> intestine

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
related to sleeping so our intestine

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.030 
related to sleeping so our intestine
stretches<00:02:18.999> out<00:02:19.329> and<00:02:19.659> we<00:02:19.959> want<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.379> take<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:20.620> nap

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
stretches out and we want to take a nap

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.500 
stretches out and we want to take a nap
probably<00:02:21.430> because<00:02:21.609> our<00:02:21.730> bodies<00:02:22.030> are<00:02:22.180> like<00:02:22.299> you

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
probably because our bodies are like you

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.050 
probably because our bodies are like you
need<00:02:22.689> to<00:02:22.840> slow<00:02:23.139> down<00:02:23.189> yeah<00:02:24.189> you're<00:02:24.849> right<00:02:24.999> that

was gross yeah you are right

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.349 
was gross yeah you are right
studies<00:02:26.980> have<00:02:27.010> also<00:02:27.250> shown<00:02:27.370> protein<00:02:28.060> fat

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:28.359 
studies have also shown protein fat

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:30.569 
studies have also shown protein fat
loading<00:02:28.750> induces<00:02:29.109> drowsiness<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:29.920> not<00:02:30.459> to

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
loading induces drowsiness and not to

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:32.520

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
mention how all of the blood directed to

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.589 
mention how all of the blood directed to
our<00:02:32.560> gastrointestinal<00:02:33.040> systems<00:02:33.879> to<00:02:34.030> digest

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
our gastrointestinal systems to digest

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.899 
our gastrointestinal systems to digest

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
because it was a really important source

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.939 
because it was a really important source
of<00:03:39.669> fat<00:03:39.939> and<00:03:40.120> protein<00:03:40.500> during<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:41.709> hard

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:41.949 
of fat and protein during the hard

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:45.030 
of fat and protein during the hard
winter<00:03:42.310> and<00:03:43.150> in<00:03:43.900> November<00:03:44.500> there<00:03:44.739> was<00:03:44.859> like<00:03:45.009> a

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
massive eel harvest and so there was

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.990 
massive eel harvest and so there was
probably<00:03:47.979> eel<00:03:48.220> at<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.489> first<00:03:48.729> Thanksgiving
