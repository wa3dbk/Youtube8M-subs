00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.610
 and later 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.860
 the fifth doctor is considered by 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.390
 many fans one of the most incarnations 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.370
 sympathetic doctor below 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.100
 fourth during the classical era 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.500
 this because he was too polite 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.170
 and he was never willing to do things 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.910
 that he considered immoral doing it 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.940
 also an incarnation of the character 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.650
 that he was absolutely pacifist and 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.980
 he is always indomitable with others like 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.980
 a gentleman 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.780
 the fifth doctor was a great fan 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.970
 of cricket a sport like an Englishman 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.040
 this is what you remember by how they appear 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.870
 Alice in Wonderland ' was 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.270
 so good in this sport that 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.630
 it literally has a cricket field 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.100
 whole in your lane and still today 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.750
 it's been mentioned that he has it out there 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.900
 but he's not sure in which part 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.900
 is 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.609
 it is at this stage of the series that occurred 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.260
 the death of a partner for the first time 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:04.330
 on screen 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.250
 in this case it was adri here a child genius 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.410
 that he started traveling with the doctor from 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.080
 his fourth incarnation 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.370
 Adri as you are during the story 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.110
 considered by many one of the 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.980
 best of the doctor team and really 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.980
 it's worth seeing 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.240
 peter davison who will interpret this 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.490
 Incarnation of the doctor is one of the most 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.380
 connected with the fans and in fact has 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.870
 participated not only in conventions 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.870
 but in fact he directed the 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.910
 short film the reboot of the most or 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.910
 at least five doctors of Felix doctor 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.490
 reboot that is a little gem that 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:46.150
 the mangroves love it if you can see it 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:46.150
 you recommend it is a genius 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.950
 the doctor participated in an audio 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.990
 comment on a DVD of a movie of 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.180
 terror of the 70s that's because in the 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.830
 film there was an alien parasite that 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.930
 he had people who had a certain part 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.430
 from the movie he took it upon himself to erase 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.120
 all parts of the movie where 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.250
 was said alien 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.260
 this happened in the exclusive history of 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.299
 the audio dramas expression features 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.810
 for its title in Spanish features 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.810
 special 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.450
 100% the doctor is a fugitive for his 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.490
 people during this stage that was seen 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.160
 an even greater fugitive because he was 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.480
 condemned to death and managed to escape to elsa 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.640
 it was during the history of the arch of 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.730
 infinite that as another curious fact 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.740
 let's say an extra data was while 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.320
 I was in this process prior to what 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.210
 was going to be his execution when it was 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.570
 found by clear 2 goals during the 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.130
 events we have from the doctor 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.380
 officially he was saved by his 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:49.000
 companion mass although it is rumored that 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.000
 Clara could have helped and escaped 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.730
 the second time he faced them omega 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:04:00.040
 it was during beats the audio drama 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.080
 highly titled omega during his 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.120
 history the doctor with call caliber 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.510
 because there was another doctor looking for him 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.910
 when he arrived he discovered that omega took his 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.220
 body took its body configuration and 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.680
 I copy it, leaving it on a copy of the 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.329
 body of his fifth incarnation without 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.130
 But that also began to affect the 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.769
 ant mind making it a bit more 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.080
 as the doctor more specifically as 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.090
 the fifth doctor and starts to see the 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.449
 that a villain suddenly if he sits down 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:32.430
 as someone kind and who seeks to do the 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.430
 While it is never good for that villain 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.319
 even though the blind doctor was 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:41.080
 skeptical vampires were already 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:43.690
 entered with them before during the audio 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.430
 of the opera amago the fifth doctor was 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.650
 attacked by a vampire baby is kidding 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.139
 sent by an old friend of the taylor 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.960
 swift who wanted the doctor's blood 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.910
 to resurrect the vampire llardÃ©n without 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.380
 But his nice partner was bitten and 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.289
 she was the one who became a 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:02.369
 vampire 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:03.869
 but also in a vampire and I was 

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:05.669
 remaining machine to freeze time 

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:09.420
 in eternal night to allow the 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:12.330
 vampires that will feed forever 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.460
 it's a bit bizarre but it 's a good 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.650
 fact story 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.509
 but if it generates a bit of conflict with 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.550
 continuity and continuity of 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:22.080
 eleventh because as shown 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.830
 Vampires of Venice is skeptical of 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.830
 about vampires 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.789
 the fifth doctor was with protagonist 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.420
 of the first crossover among doctors of 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:35.180
 the modern stage 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:37.250
 the special time a short film that 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.840
 located between the third and fourth 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.060
 season 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.180
 the evening of the fifth doctor plays with the 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.220
 of the tenth and merge and then the 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.229
 two try to repair the ailment of a 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.290
 very curious paradox where the tenth 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:53.240
 Doctor knew how to repair tardis 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.980
 because when he was fifth he saw the 10th 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.870
 repair it 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.190
 it's a very interesting exchange between 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.890
 the two characters is a very short 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.600
 fun and it's funnier when 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.940
 you think that one of the doctors who 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.710
 they saw from sight in alconera child I am 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.210
 fifth since he was a boy during 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.259
 this stage 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.259
 you are thinking 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.849
 the actress we wanted to be is the daughter of 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.740
 peter davison 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:21.719
 and hence would not happen if not for 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.139
 she for the casting for eggs when 

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:26.520
 was going to make two good in 2005 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:29.099
 and although he did not keep the paper then 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:32.039
 they called him to say the daughter of the 

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:33.330
 doctor where he played yesterday and the daughter 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:35.520
 of the doctor 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.110
 that's why I did not interpret justly 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.750
 that role was obviously planned 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:43.600
 but not only that, he also interpreted 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:46.660
 a waitress in the special chapter of the 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.940
 when it was an animated special that 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.570
 He appeared on the red 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.570
 confidential 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:58.360
 and to make it more interesting too 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:01.379
 he married then with visiting 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:05.189
 so if you think about it the doctor's daughter 

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:05.189
 he married the doctor 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.979
 You can use that however you want 

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:30.000
 so well guys write previously 

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.920
 your theory of the hundredth episode and 

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.350
 usually reaches the thalamus but 

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:36.350
 she always tolerates it 

00:07:36.569 --> 00:07:39.569
 another case that is worth of 

00:07:38.129 --> 00:07:41.249
 mentioned 

00:07:39.569 --> 00:07:43.619
 is that sometimes he mentioned it as 

00:07:41.249 --> 00:07:46.520
 potential partner of the doctor but it is 

00:07:43.619 --> 00:07:46.520
 for the idea of what
