00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
I'm gonna tell you with this pedal this

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.590 
I'm gonna tell you with this pedal this
is<00:01:14.490> not<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:17.479> noise<00:01:18.479> gate<00:01:18.530> okay<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.130> noise

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
is not a noise gate okay this is a noise

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.580 
is not a noise gate okay this is a noise
suppressor<00:01:21.600> alright

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
suppressor alright

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.530 
suppressor alright
and<00:01:22.680> what<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.189> does<00:01:23.400> this<00:01:23.820> allows<00:01:24.000> your

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
and what this does this allows your

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.539 
and what this does this allows your
signal<00:01:25.080> your<00:01:25.200> guitar<00:01:25.500> signal<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:26.340> come

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
signal your guitar signal to come

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.679 
signal your guitar signal to come
through<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:28.670> it<00:01:29.670> doesn't<00:01:30.000> cut<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.270> out<00:01:30.420> but

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
through and it doesn't cut it out but

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.420 
through and it doesn't cut it out but
what<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.900> does<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.290> when<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.680> signal<00:01:32.130> starts

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
what it does is when that signal starts

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.420 
what it does is when that signal starts
to<00:01:32.549> fade<00:01:32.880> okay<00:01:33.840> you'll<00:01:34.140> most<00:01:34.710> likely<00:01:34.799> start<00:01:35.340> to

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
to fade okay you'll most likely start to

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.910 
to fade okay you'll most likely start to
hear<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.759> hiss<00:01:35.970> or<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.299> hum<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.920> different

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
hear the hiss or the hum of different

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.560 
hear the hiss or the hum of different
components<00:01:38.130> in<00:01:38.369> your<00:01:38.460> signal<00:01:38.850> chain<00:01:39.030> okay

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
components in your signal chain okay

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.600 
components in your signal chain okay
what<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:39.869> does<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.259> fig<00:01:40.590> filters<00:01:41.220> out<00:01:41.400> all

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
see what this sounds like if we just

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:54.720 
see what this sounds like if we just
hold<00:02:43.310> a<00:02:43.520> note

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.120

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
you hear that noise in there so with the

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:06.820 
you hear that noise in there so with the
hospital<00:03:01.840> it's<00:03:02.840> much<00:03:03.110> better<00:03:05.500> now<00:03:06.500> let's<00:03:06.680> do

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830

hospital it's much better now let's do
that<00:03:07.010> same<00:03:07.340> note

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.870 

you<00:03:16.770> don't<00:03:16.920> lose<00:03:17.070> any<00:03:17.310> sustain<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:18.060> yet<00:03:19.880> the

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
you don't lose any sustain and yet the

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.510

noise<00:03:21.090> is<00:03:21.330> gone<00:03:21.510> so<00:03:22.230> does<00:03:22.950> this<00:03:23.070> job<00:03:23.310> pretty

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520
