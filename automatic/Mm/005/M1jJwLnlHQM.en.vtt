itself but let's say you want it to move
this<00:01:54.210> anchor<00:01:54.630> point<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:55.020> little<00:01:55.110> bit<00:01:55.259> further

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
this anchor point a little bit further

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.920 
this anchor point a little bit further
away<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.850> can<00:01:57.030> actually<00:01:57.180> do<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.689> while

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
away and you can actually do that while

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.440 
away and you can actually do that while
you<00:01:58.110> are<00:01:58.140> still<00:01:58.560> holding<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.460> mouse<00:01:59.640> so<00:02:00.299> if

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
you are still holding the mouse so if

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.600 
you are still holding the mouse so if
you<00:02:00.600> press<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.079> hold<00:02:01.140> space<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:02.159> can<00:02:02.399> move

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
you press and hold space you can move

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.090 
you press and hold space you can move
that<00:02:02.850> other<00:02:03.090> point<00:02:03.509> around<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.170> when<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:04.860> let

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
that other point around and when you let

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.240 
that other point around and when you let
go<00:02:05.130> space<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.790> can<00:02:05.969> still<00:02:06.210> continue<00:02:06.659> drawing

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
go space you can still continue drawing

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.880 
go space you can still continue drawing
your<00:02:08.250> curve<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:09.239> holding<00:02:09.899> down<00:02:09.959> space<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.679> can

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
your curve so holding down space you can

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.820 
your curve so holding down space you can
reposition<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.879> second<00:02:12.480> Anchor<00:02:12.870> Point

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
reposition the second Anchor Point

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.680 
reposition the second Anchor Point
and<00:02:13.920> then<00:02:14.280> when<00:02:14.460> you<00:02:14.550> let<00:02:14.700> go<00:02:14.760> space<00:02:15.210> you<00:02:15.450> can

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
and then when you let go space you can

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.740 
and then when you let go space you can
still<00:02:16.020> create<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.980> curve<00:02:17.220> itself<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:18.450> let<00:02:18.630> me

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
still create the curve itself so let me

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.320 
still create the curve itself so let me
just<00:02:18.930> create<00:02:19.260> something<00:02:19.860> like<00:02:20.160> this<00:02:20.640> here<00:02:20.940> for

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
just create something like this here for

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.070 
just create something like this here for
this<00:02:21.510> fish<00:02:22.160> something<00:02:23.160> like<00:02:23.490> that<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:24.060> as<00:02:24.960> you

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
this fish something like that and as you

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.290 
this fish something like that and as you
can<00:02:25.230> see<00:02:25.290> once<00:02:25.770> we<00:02:25.980> created<00:02:26.310> this<00:02:26.610> first<00:02:26.940> curve

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
can see once we created this first curve

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.070 
can see once we created this first curve
and<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:28.470> next<00:02:28.890> curve<00:02:29.220> wants<00:02:30.210> to<00:02:30.330> be<00:02:30.510> already<00:02:30.900> a

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
and the next curve wants to be already a

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.830 
and the next curve wants to be already a
continuation<00:02:31.830> of<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.460> first<00:02:32.730> one<00:02:32.970> because<00:02:33.660> of

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
continuation of the first one because of

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.410 
continuation of the first one because of
the<00:02:33.960> symmetrical<00:02:34.650> handles<00:02:35.160> you<00:02:35.730> can<00:02:35.790> see<00:02:36.180> that

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
the symmetrical handles you can see that

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.020 
the symmetrical handles you can see that
because<00:02:36.960> there's<00:02:37.230> already<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.830> handle<00:02:38.430> here<00:02:38.850> it

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
because there's already a handle here it

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.930 
because there's already a handle here it
will<00:02:39.510> lead<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.930> next<00:02:40.170> segment<00:02:40.980> of<00:02:41.190> this<00:02:41.610> path

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
will lead the next segment of this path

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.870 
will lead the next segment of this path
and<00:02:42.270> turn<00:02:42.960> it<00:02:43.140> also<00:02:43.470> into<00:02:43.770> a<00:02:43.830> curve<00:02:44.130> so<00:02:44.670> as<00:02:44.760> you

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
and turn it also into a curve so as you

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.640 
and turn it also into a curve so as you
can<00:02:45.030> see<00:02:45.090> even<00:02:45.540> before<00:02:45.660> I'm<00:02:45.990> creating<00:02:46.620> that

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
can see even before I'm creating that

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.940 
can see even before I'm creating that
curve<00:02:47.070> I<00:02:47.190> can<00:02:47.400> already<00:02:47.640> see<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.030> preview<00:02:48.570> now<00:02:48.950> if

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
curve I can already see a preview now if

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.310 
curve I can already see a preview now if
I<00:02:50.130> want<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.610> make<00:02:50.820> sure<00:02:51.120> that<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.870> next

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
I want to make sure that the next

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.060 
I want to make sure that the next
segment<00:02:53.010> of<00:02:53.160> my<00:02:53.310> path<00:02:53.580> is<00:02:53.910> going<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.420> be<00:02:54.660> a

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
segment of my path is going to be a

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.210 
segment of my path is going to be a
straight<00:02:56.070> line<00:02:56.430> or<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:57.450> completely<00:02:58.350> different

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
straight line or a completely different

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.600 
straight line or a completely different
direction<00:02:59.459> for<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.720> curve<00:03:01.440> then<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.130> have<00:03:02.430> to

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
direction for the curve then I have to

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.310 
direction for the curve then I have to
click<00:03:02.880> on<00:03:03.090> this<00:03:03.240> last<00:03:03.540> point<00:03:03.810> here<00:03:04.050> in<00:03:04.200> the

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
click on this last point here in the

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.280 
click on this last point here in the
middle<00:03:04.620> now<00:03:05.340> in<00:03:05.940> Illustrator<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:06.959> just

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
middle now in Illustrator you just

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.199 
middle now in Illustrator you just
simply<00:03:07.590> click<00:03:07.800> in<00:03:08.040> Photoshop<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:08.880> have<00:03:09.060> to

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
simply click in Photoshop you have to

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.690 
simply click in Photoshop you have to
alt<00:03:09.450> click<00:03:09.900> on<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.500> last<00:03:10.709> anchor<00:03:11.070> point<00:03:11.490> in

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
alt click on the last anchor point in

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.670 
alt click on the last anchor point in
case<00:03:12.360> you<00:03:12.540> want<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.810> get<00:03:12.990> rid<00:03:13.200> of<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.500> free

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
case you want to get rid of the free

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.550 
case you want to get rid of the free
handle<00:03:14.130> so<00:03:14.730> if<00:03:14.850> I<00:03:14.970> click<00:03:15.180> on<00:03:15.330> that<00:03:15.570> now<00:03:16.080> you<00:03:16.140> can

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
handle so if I click on that now you can

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.560 
handle so if I click on that now you can
see<00:03:16.770> I<00:03:16.800> can<00:03:17.070> drew<00:03:17.340> a<00:03:17.370> straight<00:03:17.580> line<00:03:18.180> so<00:03:18.480> I'm

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
see I can drew a straight line so I'm

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.199 
see I can drew a straight line so I'm
not<00:03:18.720> restricted<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.470> draw<00:03:19.800> a<00:03:20.040> continuation<00:03:20.850> of

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
not restricted to draw a continuation of

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.990 
not restricted to draw a continuation of
the<00:03:21.360> previous<00:03:21.810> curve<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:22.380> I<00:03:22.920> can<00:03:23.190> either<00:03:23.459> draw

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
the previous curve and I can either draw

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.750 
the previous curve and I can either draw
a<00:03:24.030> straight<00:03:24.450> line<00:03:24.930> or<00:03:25.230> I<00:03:25.680> can<00:03:26.100> click<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:26.700> drag

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
a straight line or I can click and drag

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.479 
a straight line or I can click and drag
and<00:03:27.180> create<00:03:27.900> a<00:03:27.959> completely<00:03:28.739> different<00:03:29.010> angle

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
and create a completely different angle

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.479 
and create a completely different angle
from<00:03:30.300> the<00:03:30.510> previous<00:03:30.959> one<00:03:31.200> once<00:03:31.769> you<00:03:31.860> created<00:03:32.250> a

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
from the previous one once you created a

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.150 
from the previous one once you created a
couple<00:03:32.700> of<00:03:32.940> lines<00:03:33.239> you<00:03:33.750> can<00:03:34.019> still<00:03:34.410> move<00:03:34.830> these

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
couple of lines you can still move these

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.780 
couple of lines you can still move these
points<00:03:35.850> around<00:03:36.390> by<00:03:36.840> using<00:03:37.140> a<00:03:37.500> shortcut<00:03:38.070> if<00:03:38.280> you

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
points around by using a shortcut if you

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.690 
points around by using a shortcut if you
hold<00:03:39.000> down<00:03:39.180> command<00:03:39.420> or<00:03:39.840> ctrl<00:03:40.260> on<00:03:40.410> PC<00:03:40.890> let's<00:03:41.430> we

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
hold down command or ctrl on PC let's we

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.210 
hold down command or ctrl on PC let's we
choose<00:03:41.940> temporarily<00:03:42.600> to<00:03:43.080> the<00:03:43.350> selection<00:03:44.010> tool

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
choose temporarily to the selection tool

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.490 
choose temporarily to the selection tool
depending<00:03:45.030> which<00:03:45.540> one<00:03:45.780> was<00:03:45.959> selected<00:03:46.470> the

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
depending which one was selected the

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.820 
depending which one was selected the
last<00:03:46.830> time<00:03:47.450> so<00:03:48.450> for<00:03:48.630> example<00:03:49.019> if<00:03:49.110> I<00:03:49.260> select<00:03:49.320> the

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
last time so for example if I select the

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.580 
last time so for example if I select the
direct<00:03:50.610> selection<00:03:50.940> tool<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.570> then<00:03:52.260> go<00:03:52.410> back

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
direct selection tool and then go back

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.160 
direct selection tool and then go back
to<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.860> pen<00:03:53.070> tool<00:03:53.100> now<00:03:54.090> I<00:03:54.420> can<00:03:54.810> continue

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
to the pen tool now I can continue

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.199 
to the pen tool now I can continue
drawing<00:03:55.590> let<00:03:55.980> me<00:03:56.130> just<00:03:56.340> drew<00:03:56.519> a<00:03:56.550> straight<00:03:56.700> line

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
drawing let me just drew a straight line

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.620 
drawing let me just drew a straight line
here<00:03:57.239> and<00:03:57.959> another<00:03:58.530> curve<00:03:58.920> there<00:03:59.370> so<00:03:59.970> now<00:04:00.300> if<00:04:00.480> I

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
here and another curve there so now if I

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.050 
here and another curve there so now if I
want<00:04:00.900> to<00:04:01.019> move<00:04:01.170> these<00:04:01.440> points<00:04:01.890> around<00:04:02.010> if<00:04:02.550> I

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
want to move these points around if I

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.170 
want to move these points around if I
hold<00:04:03.360> down<00:04:03.600> ctrl<00:04:04.110> or<00:04:04.290> command<00:04:04.470> I<00:04:05.190> will<00:04:05.760> get

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
hold down ctrl or command I will get

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.380 
hold down ctrl or command I will get
temporarily<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:07.519> direct<00:04:08.519> selection<00:04:08.820> tool

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
temporarily the direct selection tool

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.360 
temporarily the direct selection tool
so<00:04:09.750> I<00:04:09.780> can<00:04:10.140> now<00:04:10.320> move<00:04:10.590> these<00:04:10.860> points<00:04:11.100> around

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
so I can now move these points around

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.780 
so I can now move these points around
and<00:04:11.820> I<00:04:12.239> can<00:04:12.510> make<00:04:12.780> adjustments<00:04:13.190> so<00:04:14.190> I<00:04:14.250> can<00:04:14.519> even

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
and I can make adjustments so I can even

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.940 
and I can make adjustments so I can even
make<00:04:15.510> adjustments<00:04:16.140> to<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:16.260> whole<00:04:16.560> curve

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
make adjustments to the whole curve

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.599 
make adjustments to the whole curve
itself<00:04:17.519> or<00:04:17.760> I<00:04:17.820> can<00:04:18.690> change<00:04:19.229> the<00:04:19.530> handles<00:04:20.370> as

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
itself or I can change the handles as

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.150 
itself or I can change the handles as
well<00:04:20.640> I<00:04:21.090> can<00:04:21.570> change<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:22.169> anchor<00:04:22.650> points<00:04:23.070> and

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
well I can change the anchor points and

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.300 
well I can change the anchor points and
so<00:04:23.850> on<00:04:23.970> and<00:04:24.120> so<00:04:24.270> forth<00:04:24.630> another<00:04:25.500> useful<00:04:25.860> thing

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
so on and so forth another useful thing

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.710 
so on and so forth another useful thing
to<00:04:26.340> remember<00:04:26.789> is<00:04:27.120> when<00:04:27.300> you

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
to remember is when you

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.720 
to remember is when you
want<00:04:27.900> to<00:04:28.020> draw<00:04:28.260> straight<00:04:28.710> lines<00:04:28.770> and<00:04:29.490> you<00:04:29.700> want

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
want to draw straight lines and you want

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.900 
want to draw straight lines and you want
to<00:04:30.090> make<00:04:30.270> sure<00:04:30.300> that<00:04:30.780> they<00:04:31.020> are<00:04:31.200> either

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
to make sure that they are either

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.550 
to make sure that they are either
horizontal<00:04:32.910> or<00:04:33.060> vertical<00:04:33.090> you<00:04:34.080> should<00:04:34.320> hold

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
horizontal or vertical you should hold

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.220 
horizontal or vertical you should hold
them<00:04:34.770> shift<00:04:35.250> that<00:04:36.090> will<00:04:36.240> constrain<00:04:36.960> your

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
them shift that will constrain your

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.010 
them shift that will constrain your
lines<00:04:37.590> and<00:04:37.920> you<00:04:38.340> can<00:04:38.490> actually<00:04:38.670> draw<00:04:39.120> in<00:04:39.300> 45

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
lines and you can actually draw in 45

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.260 
lines and you can actually draw in 45
degrees<00:04:40.320> as<00:04:40.800> well<00:04:40.980> so<00:04:41.820> as<00:04:41.940> you<00:04:42.060> can<00:04:42.210> see

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
degrees as well so as you can see

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.500 
degrees as well so as you can see
straight<00:04:42.930> horizontal<00:04:43.290> or<00:04:43.950> 45<00:04:44.670> degrees<00:04:45.150> lines

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
straight horizontal or 45 degrees lines

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.920 
straight horizontal or 45 degrees lines
with<00:04:46.170> the<00:04:46.290> pen<00:04:46.530> tool<00:04:46.770> if<00:04:46.920> you<00:04:47.040> hold<00:04:47.250> down<00:04:47.430> shift

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
with the pen tool if you hold down shift

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.360 
with the pen tool if you hold down shift
another<00:04:48.930> useful<00:04:49.290> thing<00:04:49.650> to<00:04:49.710> know<00:04:49.860> is<00:04:50.160> also

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
another useful thing to know is also

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.420 
another useful thing to know is also
that<00:04:50.730> you<00:04:50.760> can<00:04:51.090> add<00:04:51.390> or<00:04:51.660> remove<00:04:51.890> points<00:04:52.890> on

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
that you can add or remove points on

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.420 
that you can add or remove points on
your<00:04:53.910> already<00:04:54.300> existing<00:04:54.930> path<00:04:55.230> if<00:04:55.530> you<00:04:56.190> click

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
your already existing path if you click

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.630 
your already existing path if you click
on<00:04:56.550> a<00:04:56.580> point<00:04:56.850> which<00:04:57.090> didn't<00:04:57.810> exist<00:04:58.230> before

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
on a point which didn't exist before

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.490 
on a point which didn't exist before
like<00:04:59.640> here<00:05:00.030> I<00:05:00.180> see<00:05:00.600> already<00:05:00.810> a<00:05:00.990> little<00:05:01.230> plus

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
like here I see already a little plus

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.980 
like here I see already a little plus
sign<00:05:01.970> indicating<00:05:02.970> that<00:05:03.000> I'm<00:05:03.300> going<00:05:03.570> to<00:05:03.600> add<00:05:03.810> an

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
sign indicating that I'm going to add an

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.770 
sign indicating that I'm going to add an
additional<00:05:04.250> anchor<00:05:05.250> point<00:05:05.550> there<00:05:05.730> if<00:05:06.060> I<00:05:06.450> click

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
additional anchor point there if I click

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.320 
additional anchor point there if I click
on<00:05:06.810> an<00:05:07.170> existing<00:05:07.640> anchor<00:05:08.640> point<00:05:08.910> that<00:05:09.150> will<00:05:09.300> be

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
on an existing anchor point that will be

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.110 
on an existing anchor point that will be
a<00:05:09.510> minus<00:05:09.840> so<00:05:10.560> I'm<00:05:10.680> going<00:05:11.040> to<00:05:11.190> subtract<00:05:11.700> this<00:05:11.910> I

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
a minus so I'm going to subtract this I

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.880 
a minus so I'm going to subtract this I
will<00:05:12.360> remove<00:05:12.720> it<00:05:12.870> from<00:05:12.930> the<00:05:13.290> path<00:05:13.500> in

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
will remove it from the path in

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.080 
will remove it from the path in
Illustrator<00:05:14.820> you<00:05:14.970> also<00:05:15.510> have<00:05:15.750> the<00:05:15.930> chance<00:05:16.230> to

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.790 
Illustrator you also have the chance to
reposition<00:05:18.090> the<00:05:18.480> curves<00:05:18.870> if<00:05:19.140> you<00:05:19.440> hold<00:05:19.680> down

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
reposition the curves if you hold down

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.250

command or control by clicking on the
actual<00:05:22.410> curve<00:05:22.950> and<00:05:23.220> you<00:05:23.490> don't<00:05:23.730> actually<00:05:23.940> need

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
actual curve and you don't actually need

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.450 
actual curve and you don't actually need
to<00:05:24.360> move<00:05:24.660> the<00:05:24.840> anchor<00:05:25.230> points<00:05:25.590> around<00:05:25.890> so<00:05:26.370> you

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
to move the anchor points around so you

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.900 
to move the anchor points around so you
can<00:05:26.640> see<00:05:26.880> I<00:05:27.120> can<00:05:27.510> move<00:05:27.720> this<00:05:28.020> curve<00:05:28.290> around<00:05:28.910> by

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
can see I can move this curve around by

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.970 
can see I can move this curve around by
just<00:05:29.940> clicking<00:05:30.510> on<00:05:30.840> the<00:05:30.990> curve<00:05:31.200> itself<00:05:31.620> I<00:05:31.919> can

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980 
just clicking on the curve itself I can

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.700 
just clicking on the curve itself I can
do<00:05:32.250> the<00:05:32.400> same<00:05:32.610> thing<00:05:32.880> here<00:05:33.450> I<00:05:33.630> can<00:05:34.230> turn<00:05:34.500> it

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
do the same thing here I can turn it

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.450 
do the same thing here I can turn it
around<00:05:34.830> and<00:05:35.490> I<00:05:36.180> can<00:05:36.419> also<00:05:36.600> move<00:05:37.410> a<00:05:37.800> straight
