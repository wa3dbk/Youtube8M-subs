kingsville<00:07:05.630> Alfred<00:07:06.050> I<00:07:06.229> thought<00:07:06.500> it<00:07:06.650> was<00:07:06.740> it

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:06.949 
kingsville Alfred I thought it was it

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:08.260 
kingsville Alfred I thought it was it
was<00:07:07.070> fairly<00:07:07.310> straightforward<00:07:07.910> I<00:07:07.940> mean<00:07:08.090> that

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:08.270 
was fairly straightforward I mean that

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.620 
was fairly straightforward I mean that
they're<00:07:08.720> all<00:07:08.960> great<00:07:09.949> man<00:07:10.460> servants<00:07:10.910> but<00:07:11.600> I

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:11.630 
they're all great man servants but I

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.810 
they're all great man servants but I
think<00:07:11.810> Alfred<00:07:12.260> has<00:07:12.440> been<00:07:12.620> around<00:07:12.889> longer<00:07:13.490> than

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:13.820 
think Alfred has been around longer than

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.909 
think Alfred has been around longer than
