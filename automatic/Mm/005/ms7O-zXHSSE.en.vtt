00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
games and you know that that was the

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.760 
games and you know that that was the
problem<00:02:16.150> really<00:02:16.450> either<00:02:16.750> you've<00:02:17.140> got<00:02:17.530> a<00:02:17.560> look

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
problem really either you've got a look

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.190 
problem really either you've got a look
at<00:02:17.890> vango<00:02:18.250> for<00:02:18.459> but<00:02:19.000> for<00:02:19.450> that<00:02:19.600> but<00:02:19.900> i<00:02:19.930> think

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
at vango for but for that but i think

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.199 
at vango for but for that but i think
that<00:02:20.410> lack<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.220> protection<00:02:21.520> midfield<00:02:22.150> with

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
that lack of protection midfield with

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.850 
that lack of protection midfield with
you<00:02:22.510> know<00:02:22.660> talked<00:02:22.990> about<00:02:23.170> what<00:02:23.470> matage

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
you know talked about what matage

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.340 
you know talked about what matage
brought<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.340> chelsea<00:02:24.730> that<00:02:25.270> sort<00:02:25.660> of<00:02:25.810> player<00:02:26.050> I

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
brought to chelsea that sort of player I

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.050 
brought to chelsea that sort of player I
don't<00:02:26.800> think<00:02:26.920> it<00:02:27.010> necessarily<00:02:27.190> has<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.819> be<00:02:28.030> a

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
don't think it necessarily has to be a

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.550 
don't think it necessarily has to be a
name<00:02:28.270> that<00:02:28.300> everyone<00:02:28.660> expects<00:02:29.290> without

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
name that everyone expects without

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.680 
name that everyone expects without
thinking<00:02:29.860> what's<00:02:30.430> in<00:02:30.640> it<00:02:30.760> yeah<00:02:31.000> pretty<00:02:31.239> good

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
thinking what's in it yeah pretty good

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.600 
thinking what's in it yeah pretty good
but<00:02:31.810> what<00:02:31.959> I<00:02:31.989> think<00:02:32.200> it<00:02:32.260> does<00:02:32.290> need<00:02:32.620> as<00:02:32.770> well<00:02:32.800> as

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
but what I think it does need as well as

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.960 
but what I think it does need as well as
a<00:02:33.640> leader<00:02:34.239> of<00:02:34.540> exam<00:02:35.170> it's<00:02:35.800> a<00:02:35.860> noun<00:02:36.160> apparently

well<00:02:57.850> ride<00:02:58.120> that<00:02:58.450> those<00:02:59.110> losses<00:02:59.500> had<00:02:59.830> a

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
well ride that those losses had a

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.000 
well ride that those losses had a
knock-on<00:03:00.190> effect<00:03:00.730> so<00:03:01.300> even<00:03:01.930> if<00:03:02.440> we<00:03:02.830> would<00:03:02.980> have

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
knock-on effect so even if we would have

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.850 
knock-on effect so even if we would have
just<00:03:03.280> not<00:03:03.850> lost<00:03:04.120> six<00:03:04.480> Neil<00:03:04.750> lost<00:03:05.230> of<00:03:05.380> two<00:03:05.620> new
