this<00:01:11.729> wall<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.439> think<00:01:13.439> exactly<00:01:13.790> so<00:01:14.790> that's<00:01:14.909> what

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
this wall I think exactly so that's what

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.140 
this wall I think exactly so that's what
the<00:01:15.119> doors<00:01:15.330> going<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.540> go<00:01:15.630> right<00:01:15.840> here<00:01:17.150> we'll

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
the doors going to go right here we'll

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:45.140 
the doors going to go right here we'll
be<00:01:18.240> all<00:01:18.390> good<00:01:18.420> neighborhood

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.280 

well<00:01:45.920> finish<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.190> wall<00:01:48.080> sometimes<00:01:49.080> it<00:01:49.170> was<00:01:49.230> a

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
well finish this wall sometimes it was a

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.330 
well finish this wall sometimes it was a
little<00:01:49.410> hard<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.680> get<00:01:49.800> a<00:01:49.830> minute<00:01:50.130> because<00:01:50.220> I

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
little hard to get a minute because I

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.220 
little hard to get a minute because I
cut<00:01:50.550> them<00:01:50.610> all<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:51.030> same<00:01:51.060> length<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:52.110> way

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
cut them all to the same length that way

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.960 
cut them all to the same length that way
if<00:01:52.410> there<00:01:52.590> was<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> sag<00:01:53.100> number<00:01:53.370> if<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.550> lifted<00:01:53.940> a

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
if there was a sag number if it lifted a

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.140 
if there was a sag number if it lifted a
little<00:01:54.030> bit<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.230> see<00:01:55.410> I<00:01:55.850> put<00:01:56.850> them<00:01:57.000> at<00:01:57.060> an

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
little bit and you see I put them at an

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.490 
little bit and you see I put them at an
angle<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.660> can<00:01:57.840> whack<00:01:58.020> me<00:01:58.170> at<00:01:58.350> this

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
angle so I can whack me at this

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.640 
angle so I can whack me at this
direction<00:01:59.010> you<00:01:59.280> see<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.580> one<00:01:59.730> there<00:01:59.910> too<00:02:00.650> so
