00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
 and 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:16.299
 to teach how I prepared the cuttlefish for 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.240
 the golden fish I'll show it 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.720
 three ways to try also not 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.779
 miss nothing of the cuttlefish for this 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:29.110
 process we are going to use a sepia one 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:32.560
 hooks that are usually me I use 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:35.590
 between 1 and 2 and the average and one 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:40.030
 good knife first thing we will do is 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:44.399
 heal the sepia a little bit 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.399
 we will cut a little bit what they are 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.760
 the tentacles but never for 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.030
 to waste the then I will tell you another 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.129
 way to cancel it and we'll take the 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.370
 sepia and all this fabric that has 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.370
 here 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.760
 we will remove it, I forgot it before 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.460
 tell you that I will also use a 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.950
 hammer is worth depending on the sepia 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.560
 you have to leave it a bit soft 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.229
 so what do we do good in this 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.190
 case well as I do here I 'm going to 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:20.890
 put a washcloth and give it a 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.530
 taps with a hammer is worth either 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.409
 pass because he does not have to 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:31.540
 stay very tender, but yes, it is 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:35.330
 it is normal to stay a little tender 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:38.960
 once we have the 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:43.460
 sepia land is worth going to be such 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:46.920
 that so and now we will proceed to do 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.690
 strips to then put them on the hook 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.360
 OK 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.220
 we are not going to unemploy anything I turn to you 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.190
 repeat is worth a few strips will be the 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.090
 better others worse but we are not going to 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.090
 unemploy anything 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.650
 and with two pieces will be worth to teach you 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.690
 the two ways 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.240
 we still like bigger others more 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.450
 small we have here a strip of 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.410
 sepia is worth to me I do not like so big 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:21.680
 I'm going to cut it around here 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:25.280
 ok and this piece will be used for 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.250
 another way to hook it up we take a 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.710
 piece of sepia 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.160
 we take our needle and what to nail it 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:35.740
 better to leave a little glue it 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.300
 always try to leave a little bit of 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.770
 tail 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.950
 You see how it is so that this later 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.860
 float in the water and I'll do 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.880
 Once this is done, and what are we going 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:56.030
 to do as it is the first time 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:58.790
 to pass our hook is worth to catch it 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.209
 pass it this the best thing is to have good 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.209
 view 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.010
 once we have passed it 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.930
 we slide our cuttlefish 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:31.490
 here we slide our sepia 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.610
 to see if you can see it is worth staying 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:39.090
 what we will do is turn it around 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:43.230
 stretch and introduce our hook 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:46.440
 and that's how it would look like there is a 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.450
 part here to move is worth and so 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.930
 is how would this be one of the 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.930
 systems 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.030
 with the other piece that we have previously 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.860
 cut so we're going to see how it 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.900
 can cancel in another way very 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:06.760
 different also our sepia 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:10.069
 we will take the piece of sepia the needle 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.990
 and we will place it there 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:16.550
 then we will also take 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.550
 what is the media book 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.780
 we will start to spin 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.979
 you have to give it try to squeeze enough 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:32.469
 so that it does not break but 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:35.430
 squeeze enough for the cuttlefish to make 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:35.430
 a whole tube 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:45.389
 spinning it 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.389
 once we see that it is compact 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:59.699
 and me 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:06.110
 we already have there as well as other 

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:08.849
 times if it was not the first 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.759
 we would place here the hook and the 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:14.129
 would happen in this case as is the 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:18.710
 first time we're going fishing 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:18.710
 We will pass the thread through our needle 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:26.129
 we have already passed all 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.129
 we take 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.850
 going down 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.240
 and when the hook comes 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.620
 because I 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:46.940
 we have our bait ready for 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:48.680
 golden as you see we have been perfect 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.750
 finally in this video I'm going to 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.990
 teach because here is not wasted 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:56.420
 nothing we are going to take advantage of the tentacles 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:59.690
 to put it also as bait is worth to 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:02.470
 that we will take and cut the 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:06.030
 tentacles one to one 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:08.950
 and you are going to be some things just so 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:11.910
 if instead of sepia we use squid 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:15.750
 what are made are the suction cups 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:19.340
 cutting them is worth it and that it remains 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:23.650
 Once we have it like that 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.650
 let's take our needle 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:30.930
 As if it were a worm , we will pass it on 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:33.009
 through the middle of the tentacle 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:38.039
 once and 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:38.039
 we have it ready for hook 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:44.310
 if it is the first one we pass it as 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:47.370
 we will go through the thread if it is another 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:51.000
 It can also happen like that if it's done 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:53.100
 in this case, it is worth how the first one is 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.660
 what we are going to do is pass the thread 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.880
 the middle 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:59.730
 inside the needle as you are 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:03.240
 seeing the three forms are very simple 

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:05.430
 effective because golden bites a lot and 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.950
 especially also very important super 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:12.360
 super economical, we have it already 

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:14.780
 last we hold and we pass it the 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.780
 sepia 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:20.050
 we remove the needle 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:23.530
 you can see it well 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:25.680
 and once the hook has arrived, the same thing 

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:30.479
 we will introduce 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:35.639
 I like to let him die out is and 

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:39.389
 we have ready three ways to tie 

00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:41.669
 the sepia is worth and super effective I hope 

00:07:39.389 --> 00:07:43.880
 that you liked it and one thing if 

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:47.300
