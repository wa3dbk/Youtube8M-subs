00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.400
 part of scherrer 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.350
 only at dawn I say here too 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.500
 Return the Key data of the book the 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.529
 book by city â€‹â€‹hunter from the fcb 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:27.890
 publishing and has cost for ten euro 99 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:31.500
 is a paperback and I had yes 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.200
 Yesterday the assumption expressed that in 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.510
 the topic is now about it like no 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.489
 now after the camp in her normal 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.620
 life comes that she is the supernatural 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.329
 does not get along and that then 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.400
 probably with the first time in the 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.420
 Internat starts 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.550
 I have been with my first 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.340
 suspected to be mistaken in this part 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.910
 it's about the second part, so to speak 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:57.510
 the camp life so the camp was still 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.040
 not over and her sacred mess 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.450
 is actually much much bigger 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.549
 because she is constantly changing and knows 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.350
 Agents still do not know what 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.600
 she really is so at the beginning 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.150
 be she would be a mistake because they are ghosts 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.460
 able to see 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.030
 In between, she might have one 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.200
 vampire can be her blood tastes 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.580
 then the thesis was that she maybe 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.920
 a werewolf may be one 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.200
 Shapeshifter is and then there is 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.390
 actually constantly back and forth nobody 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.070
 knows exactly what is not she right 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.110
 yes, not always, she discovers 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.360
 new skills and that scares them 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.159
 of course totally and that makes the book 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.320
 but also so exciting because you yourself 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.420
 over and over again and back and forth 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.090
 it is fiddly and of course that is 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.670
 feeling chaos with 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.929
 the men have not eaten it for a long time 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.030
 is actually still much much 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:49.310
 worse and much more exciting 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.039
 for the reader it has me again 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.469
 This series was great fun 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.960
 To read further I have to say the first one 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:58.369
 part we had even better what 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.100
 you also liked the first part better 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.840
 it was that was the chapter short 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.640
 it was something I very much a book 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.170
 I like that he likes and likes 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.310
 in this part the chapters were easy 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.310
 again a little bit longer and it is 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.930
 so small where the parts stop 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.390
 a bit different from each other 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.120
 In any case, that was easy again 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.870
 a terrific continuations and me 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.660
 Exterior today paint the thesis for the 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.010
 third part 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.579
 I hope that in the third part then 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.400
 finally get going with the internatsleben 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:34.549
 and I believe that in the third part 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.370
 finally what is not really solved 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:40.489
 I think that she is just one 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.190
 mixture of all supernatural beings 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.269
 is as always that it is there 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.730
 I've not yet I have a 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:50.780
 somehow she carries something of every kind 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:54.620
 in itself and I'm very curious how 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.230
 that then everything comes together i have 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.340
 the book still after mine 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:03.200
 Rating criteria grades if they are 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.880
 now differ greatly from the first part 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:12.530
 i do not think so but the content 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.940
 get me a 2+ the guise 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.349
 heard here in the last part of school says 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.470
 they 're not pretending to be me 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:20.840
 that can be more beautiful than 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.239
 in the serious part restored in the 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.500
 waterfall and that's why 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:33.230
 get the cover of mine my 1 - am 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:35.359
 Addiction factor gets a 2+ romance yes 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.190
 There were already some romantic ones 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.860
 I really liked it 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.170
 above all things if no 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.050
 that's why romance comes along 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.720
 with 2 plus 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.430
 Credibility gets a 3 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.750
 Write you get a 2+ of the 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.670
 I like it very much just like that 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.990
 it's easy to follow this easily 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.150
 you can forget everything around you 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.550
 what makes me so fun actually too 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.090
 to get a book reading fun too 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.340
 a one and value for money 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.800
 So a 2 gets all in all too 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.780
 this part of the series just terrific 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.540
 It was great fun to go on 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.070
 read and yes we'll meet tomorrow 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.970
 If I give you the third part of the series 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.470
 imagine 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.470
 until then teens
