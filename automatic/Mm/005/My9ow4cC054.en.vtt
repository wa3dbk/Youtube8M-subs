that<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:35.909> want<00:01:36.000> in<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.750> game<00:01:36.930> like<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.170> makes

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
that you want in a game like this makes

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.380 
that you want in a game like this makes
you<00:01:37.710> feel<00:01:38.670> like<00:01:38.700> you're<00:01:38.880> really<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.240> world

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
you feel like you're really in the world

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.899 
you feel like you're really in the world
so<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.200> we're<00:01:40.500> working<00:01:40.590> with<00:01:40.799> other<00:01:40.950> world<00:01:41.159> to

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
so and we're working with other world to

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.039 
so and we're working with other world to
really<00:01:42.150> bring<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.570> whole<00:01:42.750> experience

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
really bring the whole experience

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.440 
really bring the whole experience
together<00:01:43.259> graphically<00:01:44.189> okay<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.270> what's

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
together graphically okay so what's

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.450 
together graphically okay so what's
other<00:01:45.600> world<00:01:45.810> doing<00:01:46.049> for<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.259> guys<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:46.979> they

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
other world doing for you guys so they

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.999 
other world doing for you guys so they
designed<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.090> game<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.540> they<00:01:48.960> helped<00:01:49.200> us<00:01:49.350> do

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
designed the game and they helped us do

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.719 
designed the game and they helped us do
the<00:01:50.460> integration<00:01:50.820> for<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.659> stem<00:01:52.409> system<00:01:52.740> so

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
the integration for the stem system so

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.490 
the integration for the stem system so
that<00:01:53.759> basically<00:01:54.210> like<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.020> whole<00:01:55.140> game<00:01:55.350> that

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
that basically like the whole game that

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.749 
that basically like the whole game that
you're<00:01:55.560> saying<00:01:55.740> behind<00:01:56.040> them<00:01:56.189> that's<00:01:56.579> all

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
you're saying behind them that's all

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.240 
you're saying behind them that's all
other<00:01:56.969> world<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.540> we<00:01:57.990> gave<00:01:58.200> them<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.920> model

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
other world and we gave them the model

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.389 
other world and we gave them the model
for<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.520> gun<00:01:59.719> basically<00:02:00.719> what<00:02:01.439> we<00:02:01.590> what<00:02:01.979> we<00:02:02.009> 3d

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
for the gun basically what we what we 3d

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.490 
for the gun basically what we what we 3d
printed<00:02:02.729> what<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.000> see<00:02:03.149> behind<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.750> they

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
printed what you see behind you and they

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.660 
printed what you see behind you and they
kind<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.770> skimmed<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.250> made<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.549> look

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
kind of skimmed it and made it look

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.719 
kind of skimmed it and made it look
really<00:02:06.030> cool<00:02:06.149> in<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.360> game<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.799> we<00:02:08.429> the

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
really cool in the game and so we the

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.010 
really cool in the game and so we the
last<00:02:08.849> time<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.119> got<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.300> chance<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.569> try<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:09.810> was

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
last time I got a chance to try this was

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.960 
last time I got a chance to try this was
that<00:02:10.140> connect<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:10.679> felt<00:02:10.860> great<00:02:11.069> to

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
that connect and it felt great to

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.330 
that connect and it felt great to
I<00:02:12.030> it's<00:02:12.630> been<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.810> while<00:02:13.020> but<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.560> my<00:02:13.740> feeling

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
I it's been a while but to my feeling

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.040 
I it's been a while but to my feeling
this<00:02:14.490> felt<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.910> little<00:02:15.030> bit<00:02:15.210> more<00:02:15.300> powerful<00:02:15.840> did

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
this felt a little bit more powerful did

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.600 
this felt a little bit more powerful did
you<00:02:16.200> make<00:02:16.350> any<00:02:16.380> changes<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.220> tech<00:02:17.400> there

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
you make any changes to the tech there

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.670 
you make any changes to the tech there
is<00:02:17.730> there<00:02:17.910> am<00:02:18.210> I<00:02:18.270> just<00:02:18.450> crazy<00:02:18.660> no<00:02:19.260> no<00:02:19.560> you're

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
is there am I just crazy no no you're

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.710 
is there am I just crazy no no you're
not<00:02:19.710> crazy<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.250> think<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:20.970> did<00:02:21.270> like<00:02:21.570> there

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
not crazy so I think you did like there

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.690 
not crazy so I think you did like there
was<00:02:21.840> like<00:02:21.960> a<00:02:21.990> magnum<00:02:22.560> handgun<00:02:22.800> like<00:02:23.340> from<00:02:23.520> the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
was like a magnum handgun like from the

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.270 
was like a magnum handgun like from the
from<00:02:24.510> Halo<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.350> tried<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.890> that

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
from Halo that you tried and that

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.890 
from Halo that you tried and that
actually<00:02:26.550> has<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.700> shorter<00:02:27.090> stroke<00:02:27.420> so<00:02:27.840> it

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
actually has a shorter stroke so it

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.850 
actually has a shorter stroke so it
doesn't<00:02:28.110> go<00:02:28.170> through<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.410> same<00:02:28.560> linear

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
doesn't go through the same linear

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.620 
doesn't go through the same linear
motion<00:02:29.250> that<00:02:29.340> that<00:02:29.490> one<00:02:29.640> does<00:02:29.850> so<00:02:30.240> you<00:02:30.330> get<00:02:30.570> a

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
motion that that one does so you get a

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.360 
motion that that one does so you get a
bigger<00:02:30.930> impact<00:02:31.260> that<00:02:31.770> was<00:02:31.890> something<00:02:32.070> that<00:02:32.190> we

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
bigger impact that was something that we

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.400 
bigger impact that was something that we
really<00:02:32.400> tried<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.820> focus<00:02:32.910> on<00:02:33.330> so<00:02:33.630> people<00:02:34.080> felt

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
really tried to focus on so people felt

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.690 
really tried to focus on so people felt
satisfied<00:02:34.980> in<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.220> game<00:02:35.370> when<00:02:35.550> they<00:02:35.640> were

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
satisfied in the game when they were

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.460 
satisfied in the game when they were
like<00:02:35.910> dropping<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.660> little<00:02:36.870> robots<00:02:37.230> out<00:02:37.380> of

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
like dropping the little robots out of

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.700 
like dropping the little robots out of
this<00:02:37.530> guy<00:02:37.710> no<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:39.330> does<00:02:39.750> feel<00:02:40.020> great<00:02:40.320> it<00:02:40.560> feels

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
this guy no it does feel great it feels

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.520 
this guy no it does feel great it feels
better<00:02:41.010> than<00:02:41.160> any<00:02:41.340> kind<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:41.820> arcade<00:02:42.530> feedback

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
better than any kind of arcade feedback

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.170 
better than any kind of arcade feedback
system<00:02:43.890> that<00:02:44.010> I've<00:02:44.100> ever<00:02:44.250> seen<00:02:44.459> but<00:02:44.790> let's<00:02:44.970> say

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
system that I've ever seen but let's say

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.270 
system that I've ever seen but let's say
I<00:02:45.209> do<00:02:45.480> want<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:46.170> feel<00:02:46.380> like<00:02:46.560> I'm<00:02:46.740> firing<00:02:47.010> a

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
I do want to feel like I'm firing a

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.100 
I do want to feel like I'm firing a
shotgun<00:02:47.550> for<00:02:47.970> my<00:02:48.090> hip<00:02:48.270> is<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.660> possible<00:02:49.080> to

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
shotgun for my hip is it possible to

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.680 
shotgun for my hip is it possible to
bump<00:02:49.680> up<00:02:49.920> you<00:02:50.250> know<00:02:50.340> just<00:02:50.370> from<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.570> way

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
bump up you know just from the the way

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.850 
bump up you know just from the the way
that<00:02:51.840> your<00:02:51.930> system<00:02:52.110> works<00:02:52.290> is<00:02:52.380> possible<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:52.800> go

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
that your system works is possible to go

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.740 
that your system works is possible to go
even<00:02:53.160> stronger<00:02:53.640> than<00:02:53.850> this<00:02:54.000> just<00:02:54.300> just

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
even stronger than this just just

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.940 
even stronger than this just just
technically<00:02:55.050> yeah<00:02:55.380> as<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.650> can<00:02:55.680> see<00:02:55.830> behind

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
technically yeah as you can see behind

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.470 
technically yeah as you can see behind
him<00:02:56.130> we<00:02:56.190> just<00:02:56.340> put<00:02:56.430> him<00:02:56.520> in<00:02:56.610> a<00:02:56.640> fully<00:02:57.180> automatic

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
him we just put him in a fully automatic

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.270 
him we just put him in a fully automatic
mode<00:02:57.810> so<00:02:58.350> he's<00:02:58.530> got<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.709> little<00:02:58.950> more<00:02:59.100> kick

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
mode so he's got a little more kick

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.730 
mode so he's got a little more kick
their<00:02:59.550> butt<00:03:00.480> yeah<00:03:00.600> you<00:03:00.660> can<00:03:01.050> change<00:03:01.560> the

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
their butt yeah you can change the

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.130 
their butt yeah you can change the
weight<00:03:01.890> only<00:03:02.130> on<00:03:02.490> the<00:03:02.580> slider<00:03:02.850> you<00:03:03.780> can<00:03:03.900> change

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
weight only on the slider you can change

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.440 
weight only on the slider you can change
like<00:03:04.410> how<00:03:04.650> long<00:03:04.920> its<00:03:05.400> linear<00:03:05.640> path<00:03:05.880> is<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.330> give

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
like how long its linear path is to give

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.910 
like how long its linear path is to give
it<00:03:06.540> a<00:03:06.660> bigger<00:03:07.140> kick<00:03:07.380> so<00:03:07.530> can<00:03:07.650> accelerate

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
it a bigger kick so can accelerate

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.040 
it a bigger kick so can accelerate
faster<00:03:08.520> and<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.000> can<00:03:09.120> actually<00:03:09.270> even<00:03:09.630> bump<00:03:09.930> up

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
faster and you can actually even bump up

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.300 
faster and you can actually even bump up
the<00:03:10.170> motors<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.650> motors<00:03:10.860> come<00:03:11.040> in<00:03:11.130> several

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
the motors the motors come in several

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.400 
the motors the motors come in several
different<00:03:11.490> classes<00:03:12.090> so<00:03:12.600> they're<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.260> little

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
different classes so they're a little

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.690 
different classes so they're a little
more<00:03:13.530> expensive<00:03:13.770> as<00:03:14.010> you<00:03:14.040> bump<00:03:14.340> them<00:03:14.490> up<00:03:14.550> but

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
more expensive as you bump them up but

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.830 
more expensive as you bump them up but
we're<00:03:14.880> working<00:03:15.030> with<00:03:15.240> the<00:03:15.330> manufacturer

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
we're working with the manufacturer

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.330 
we're working with the manufacturer
right<00:03:15.989> now<00:03:16.140> to<00:03:16.560> reduce<00:03:16.769> the<00:03:16.920> cost<00:03:17.100> for<00:03:17.280> a

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
right now to reduce the cost for a

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.120 
right now to reduce the cost for a
consumer<00:03:17.580> offer<00:03:18.019> so<00:03:19.019> is<00:03:19.470> it<00:03:19.650> possible<00:03:19.769> to<00:03:19.980> have

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
consumer offer so is it possible to have

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.979 
consumer offer so is it possible to have
a<00:03:20.160> variable<00:03:20.940> system<00:03:21.239> where<00:03:21.600> you<00:03:21.720> can<00:03:21.750> have<00:03:21.930> a

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
a variable system where you can have a

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.840 
a variable system where you can have a
gun<00:03:22.170> that<00:03:22.200> ranges<00:03:22.830> from<00:03:22.890> what<00:03:23.400> might<00:03:23.610> feel

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
gun that ranges from what might feel

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.000 
gun that ranges from what might feel
kind<00:03:23.880> of<00:03:24.180> like<00:03:24.300> a<00:03:24.330> pistol<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:25.050> one<00:03:25.769> with<00:03:25.980> a

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
kind of like a pistol to one with a

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.680 
kind of like a pistol to one with a
really<00:03:26.519> long<00:03:26.550> stroke<00:03:27.060> that<00:03:27.209> might<00:03:27.360> feel<00:03:27.540> like

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
really long stroke that might feel like

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.810 
really long stroke that might feel like
a<00:03:27.720> powerful<00:03:28.260> sniper<00:03:28.530> rifle<00:03:28.950> so<00:03:29.340> absolutely

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
a powerful sniper rifle so absolutely

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.120 
a powerful sniper rifle so absolutely
we're<00:03:30.060> kind<00:03:30.300> of<00:03:30.390> working<00:03:30.600> on<00:03:30.959> on<00:03:31.769> a<00:03:31.830> prototype

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
we're kind of working on on a prototype

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.310 
we're kind of working on on a prototype
that<00:03:32.700> has<00:03:33.060> several<00:03:33.330> different<00:03:33.660> grab<00:03:33.900> points

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
that has several different grab points

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.500 
that has several different grab points
on<00:03:34.440> it<00:03:34.590> so<00:03:34.800> it's<00:03:35.010> a<00:03:35.330> depending<00:03:36.330> on<00:03:36.420> your

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
on it so it's a depending on your

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.180 
on it so it's a depending on your
handedness<00:03:37.200> you'll<00:03:37.440> either<00:03:37.560> like<00:03:37.920> have<00:03:38.070> your

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
handedness you'll either like have your

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.160 
handedness you'll either like have your
left<00:03:38.700> hand<00:03:38.940> or<00:03:39.209> your<00:03:39.330> right<00:03:39.510> hand<00:03:39.720> up<00:03:39.840> front

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
left hand or your right hand up front

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.170 
left hand or your right hand up front
and<00:03:40.320> then<00:03:40.650> you're<00:03:40.799> the<00:03:41.070> hand<00:03:41.580> in<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.760> back<00:03:41.940> we

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
and then you're the hand in the back we

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.550 
and then you're the hand in the back we
can<00:03:42.330> grab<00:03:42.510> several<00:03:42.810> different<00:03:43.080> parts<00:03:43.350> and<00:03:43.500> in

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
can grab several different parts and in

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.860 
can grab several different parts and in
the<00:03:43.650> game<00:03:43.890> it'll<00:03:44.489> transform<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.390> model<00:03:45.720> and

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
the game it'll transform the model and

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.750 
the game it'll transform the model and
then<00:03:46.080> also<00:03:46.260> on<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.650> fly<00:03:46.860> reprogram<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.580> motor

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
then also on the fly reprogram the motor

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.180 
then also on the fly reprogram the motor
for<00:03:48.060> that<00:03:48.209> model<00:03:48.420> so<00:03:48.989> say<00:03:49.260> you're<00:03:49.769> grabbing<00:03:49.950> it

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
for that model so say you're grabbing it

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.130 
for that model so say you're grabbing it
in<00:03:50.280> one<00:03:50.459> stance<00:03:50.760> it's<00:03:50.970> a<00:03:51.030> chainsaw<00:03:51.330> and<00:03:51.870> now

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
in one stance it's a chainsaw and now

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.780 
in one stance it's a chainsaw and now
it's<00:03:52.320> vibrating<00:03:52.650> like<00:03:52.890> a<00:03:52.950> chainsaw<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.489> really

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
it's vibrating like a chainsaw to really

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.340 
it's vibrating like a chainsaw to really
give<00:03:53.910> you<00:03:53.970> that<00:03:54.120> in-depth<00:03:54.510> experience<00:03:54.660> and

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
give you that in-depth experience and

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.680 
give you that in-depth experience and
then<00:03:55.739> yes<00:03:56.040> yeah<00:03:56.310> and<00:03:56.670> say<00:03:57.060> it's<00:03:57.239> another<00:03:57.450> one

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
then yes yeah and say it's another one

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.360 
then yes yeah and say it's another one
it<00:03:57.989> could<00:03:58.110> be<00:03:58.230> like<00:03:58.440> you<00:03:58.620> know<00:03:58.739> a<00:03:58.769> hand<00:03:59.070> going

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
it could be like you know a hand going

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.130 
it could be like you know a hand going
our<00:03:59.459> futuristic<00:04:00.030> gun<00:04:00.180> or<00:04:00.390> even<00:04:00.989> like<00:04:01.110> a

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
our futuristic gun or even like a

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.780 
our futuristic gun or even like a
baseball<00:04:01.560> bat<00:04:01.739> or<00:04:01.769> a<00:04:01.890> tennis<00:04:02.070> racket<00:04:02.459> we're

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
baseball bat or a tennis racket we're

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.430 
baseball bat or a tennis racket we're
trying<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.269> really<00:04:03.750> make<00:04:03.959> a<00:04:03.989> peripheral

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
trying to really make a peripheral

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.170 
trying to really make a peripheral
that's<00:04:04.650> multi-use<00:04:05.190> so<00:04:05.610> you<00:04:05.670> don't<00:04:05.880> have<00:04:06.030> to

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
that's multi-use so you don't have to

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.060 
that's multi-use so you don't have to
keep<00:04:06.330> going<00:04:06.600> to<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.930> store<00:04:07.140> and<00:04:07.410> buy<00:04:07.590> buy<00:04:07.830> buy

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
keep going to the store and buy buy buy

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.740 
keep going to the store and buy buy buy
every<00:04:08.459> peripheral<00:04:08.880> you<00:04:09.000> want<00:04:09.150> to<00:04:09.209> play<00:04:09.360> in<00:04:09.480> VR

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
every peripheral you want to play in VR

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.870 
every peripheral you want to play in VR
we<00:04:10.019> want<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.320> one<00:04:10.470> thing<00:04:10.739> that<00:04:10.980> that<00:04:11.549> solves

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
we want the one thing that that solves

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.850 
we want the one thing that that solves
it<00:04:11.970> all<00:04:12.060> can<00:04:12.810> we<00:04:13.019> actually<00:04:13.200> grabbed<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.739> gun

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
it all can we actually grabbed the gun

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.900 
it all can we actually grabbed the gun
real<00:04:14.070> quick<00:04:14.190> and<00:04:14.280> just<00:04:14.340> take<00:04:14.549> a<00:04:14.580> look<00:04:14.760> at<00:04:14.820> it

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
real quick and just take a look at it

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:15.559 
real quick and just take a look at it
yeah

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
yeah

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.110 
yeah
can<00:04:15.719> I<00:04:15.749> come<00:04:15.900> over<00:04:15.959> so<00:04:16.889> when<00:04:17.609> when<00:04:17.910> did<00:04:18.000> you

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
can I come over so when when did you

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.640 
can I come over so when when did you
create<00:04:18.299> this<00:04:18.389> prototype<00:04:18.780> and<00:04:19.169> does<00:04:19.410> it<00:04:19.500> have<00:04:19.530> a

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
create this prototype and does it have a

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.749 
create this prototype and does it have a
name<00:04:19.889> uh<00:04:21.500> not<00:04:22.500> really<00:04:22.770> and<00:04:23.130> you<00:04:23.370> just<00:04:23.520> you<00:04:23.729> just

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 
name uh not really and you just you just

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:25.730 
name uh not really and you just you just
know<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.150> sound<00:04:24.419> it<00:04:24.600> makes<00:04:24.780> when<00:04:24.990> you<00:04:25.229> kill<00:04:25.710> a

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
know the sound it makes when you kill a

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.909 
know the sound it makes when you kill a
virtual<00:04:26.190> person<00:04:26.580> yet<00:04:26.820> let's<00:04:27.120> hear<00:04:27.270> it<00:04:30.919> what's

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
virtual person yet let's hear it what's

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.529 
virtual person yet let's hear it what's
what's<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.310> durability<00:04:32.759> out<00:04:33.210> of<00:04:33.300> the<00:04:33.389> system

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
what's the durability out of the system

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:34.969 
what's the durability out of the system
like<00:04:33.840> this<00:04:34.020> so<00:04:34.169> these<00:04:34.289> gonna<00:04:34.530> are<00:04:34.740> these<00:04:34.860> going

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
like this so these gonna are these going

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:36.770 
like this so these gonna are these going
to<00:04:35.070> break<00:04:35.220> up<00:04:35.370> for<00:04:35.490> a<00:04:35.520> few<00:04:35.669> weeks<00:04:35.759> so<00:04:36.599> this

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
to break up for a few weeks so this

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.810 
to break up for a few weeks so this
system<00:04:37.050> is<00:04:37.080> a<00:04:37.259> prototype<00:04:37.590> like<00:04:38.370> we<00:04:38.490> designed

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
system is a prototype like we designed

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.249 
system is a prototype like we designed
this<00:04:38.940> and<00:04:39.210> actually<00:04:39.300> about<00:04:39.599> two<00:04:39.810> weeks<00:04:39.960> and

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 
this and actually about two weeks and

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:42.260 
this and actually about two weeks and
this<00:04:40.800> is<00:04:40.919> all<00:04:41.039> 3d<00:04:41.340> printed<00:04:41.669> and<00:04:41.970> we<00:04:42.030> poured

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
this is all 3d printed and we poured

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.210 
this is all 3d printed and we poured
epoxy<00:04:42.750> on<00:04:42.780> top<00:04:43.020> of<00:04:43.169> them<00:04:43.289> painted<00:04:43.650> so<00:04:44.099> this

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
epoxy on top of them painted so this

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.029 
epoxy on top of them painted so this
wouldn't<00:04:44.400> be<00:04:44.550> like<00:04:44.699> a<00:04:45.139> consumer-based<00:04:46.139> item

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
wouldn't be like a consumer-based item

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:49.879 
wouldn't be like a consumer-based item
but<00:04:47.699> we<00:04:47.789> are<00:04:47.910> planning<00:04:48.180> to<00:04:48.300> release<00:04:48.780> the<00:04:49.050> the

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
but we are planning to release the the

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.460 
but we are planning to release the the
build<00:04:50.639> on<00:04:50.910> grab<00:04:51.389> cab<00:04:51.599> so<00:04:52.110> people<00:04:52.349> could

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
build on grab cab so people could

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.980 
build on grab cab so people could
download<00:04:52.620> it<00:04:52.889> and<00:04:52.979> print<00:04:53.099> it<00:04:53.220> themselves<00:04:53.699> and

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
download it and print it themselves and

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.150 
download it and print it themselves and
we're<00:04:54.990> getting<00:04:55.080> we're<00:04:55.470> getting<00:04:55.560> ready<00:04:55.860> to

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
we're getting we're getting ready to

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.330 
we're getting we're getting ready to
release<00:04:57.030> an<00:04:57.270> API<00:04:57.539> as<00:04:57.900> well<00:04:58.080> so<00:04:58.650> an<00:04:58.979> API<00:04:59.280> for

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
release an API as well so an API for

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.400 
release an API as well so an API for
unity<00:04:59.820> so<00:05:00.000> no<00:05:00.389> longer<00:05:00.539> will<00:05:00.750> you<00:05:00.960> have<00:05:00.990> to<00:05:01.199> use

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
unity so no longer will you have to use

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.100 
unity so no longer will you have to use
like<00:05:01.830> a<00:05:02.490> proprietary<00:05:03.180> microcontroller<00:05:03.960> to

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
like a proprietary microcontroller to

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.749 
like a proprietary microcontroller to
program<00:05:04.380> the<00:05:04.470> motors<00:05:04.770> and<00:05:05.220> go<00:05:05.310> straight<00:05:05.550> it

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 
program the motors and go straight it

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:07.339 
program the motors and go straight it
you<00:05:05.849> plug<00:05:06.120> the<00:05:06.270> motor<00:05:06.419> straight<00:05:06.750> into<00:05:07.050> your

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
you plug the motor straight into your

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.040 
you plug the motor straight into your
computer<00:05:07.680> via<00:05:07.860> serial<00:05:08.130> port<00:05:08.490> USB<00:05:08.610> and<00:05:09.060> you

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
computer via serial port USB and you

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.860 
computer via serial port USB and you
throw<00:05:10.710> in<00:05:10.860> the<00:05:11.070> unity<00:05:11.490> asset<00:05:12.030> and<00:05:12.449> then<00:05:12.780> you

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
throw in the unity asset and then you

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.330 
throw in the unity asset and then you
can<00:05:12.990> graphically<00:05:13.349> program<00:05:13.800> the<00:05:13.949> motor<00:05:14.130> for

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
can graphically program the motor for

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.100 
can graphically program the motor for
any<00:05:14.460> event<00:05:14.820> and<00:05:15.060> unity<00:05:15.360> that<00:05:15.509> you<00:05:15.599> want<00:05:15.780> we

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
any event and unity that you want we

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.960 
any event and unity that you want we
hope<00:05:16.289> to<00:05:16.320> really<00:05:16.800> sad<00:05:17.070> for<00:05:17.220> free<00:05:17.460> on<00:05:17.580> the<00:05:17.669> unity

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
hope to really sad for free on the unity

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.879 
hope to really sad for free on the unity
store<00:05:18.210> so<00:05:18.630> by<00:05:18.900> the<00:05:18.960> time<00:05:19.110> we<00:05:19.259> get<00:05:19.349> to<00:05:19.410> dev<00:05:19.620> kits

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
store so by the time we get to dev kits

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:21.350 
store so by the time we get to dev kits
we<00:05:20.310> have<00:05:20.400> the<00:05:20.490> hardware<00:05:20.729> but<00:05:21.090> we<00:05:21.150> have<00:05:21.270> the

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
we have the hardware but we have the

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.640 
we have the hardware but we have the
firmware<00:05:21.690> to<00:05:21.780> support<00:05:22.110> it<00:05:22.199> because<00:05:22.320> we<00:05:22.530> think

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
firmware to support it because we think

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.950 
firmware to support it because we think
that's<00:05:22.830> really<00:05:23.039> important<00:05:23.430> great<00:05:24.300> and<00:05:24.599> so

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
that's really important great and so

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.689 
that's really important great and so
what's<00:05:25.169> the<00:05:25.349> road<00:05:25.800> map<00:05:26.039> from<00:05:26.070> here<00:05:26.520> you're

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:26.699 
what's the road map from here you're

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:27.830 
what's the road map from here you're
gonna<00:05:26.759> go<00:05:27.000> you're<00:05:27.030> gonna<00:05:27.360> get<00:05:27.479> the<00:05:27.570> plug-in

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
gonna go you're gonna get the plug-in

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.060 
gonna go you're gonna get the plug-in
out<00:05:27.960> is<00:05:28.169> there<00:05:28.289> going<00:05:28.380> to<00:05:28.440> be<00:05:28.500> a<00:05:28.590> development

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
out is there going to be a development

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.770 
out is there going to be a development
kit<00:05:29.280> that<00:05:29.759> people<00:05:29.940> can<00:05:30.060> get<00:05:30.120> access<00:05:30.419> to<00:05:30.570> some

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
kit that people can get access to some

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.899 
kit that people can get access to some
hot<00:05:30.960> yeah<00:05:31.500> we're<00:05:32.070> still<00:05:32.250> working<00:05:32.370> on<00:05:32.610> like<00:05:32.789> the

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:32.909 
hot yeah we're still working on like the

actual date I don't want to release a

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:35.990 
actual date I don't want to release a
date<00:05:34.380> just<00:05:34.650> yet<00:05:34.710> but<00:05:35.159> we're<00:05:35.490> still<00:05:35.669> working<00:05:35.759> on

date just yet but we're still working on
that<00:05:36.120> but<00:05:36.780> the<00:05:36.900> big<00:05:37.050> thing<00:05:37.080> that<00:05:37.349> we<00:05:37.440> have<00:05:37.470> in

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
that but the big thing that we have in

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.020 
that but the big thing that we have in
the<00:05:37.740> works<00:05:37.889> right<00:05:38.009> now<00:05:38.130> we're<00:05:38.669> talking<00:05:38.940> to

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
the works right now we're talking to

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.779 
the works right now we're talking to
several<00:05:39.180> different<00:05:39.630> marfil<00:05:40.050> manufacturers

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:40.789 
several different marfil manufacturers

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:43.760 
several different marfil manufacturers
and<00:05:41.789> basically<00:05:42.659> we<00:05:42.900> would<00:05:43.050> like<00:05:43.229> to<00:05:43.259> iterate

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
and basically we would like to iterate

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.560 
and basically we would like to iterate
upon<00:05:44.099> the<00:05:44.250> existing<00:05:44.669> controllers<00:05:45.150> like<00:05:45.180> you

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
upon the existing controllers like you

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.450 
upon the existing controllers like you
know<00:05:45.659> your<00:05:45.840> PlayStation<00:05:46.470> controller<00:05:46.800> or<00:05:47.130> your

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
know your PlayStation controller or your

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.129 
know your PlayStation controller or your
xbox<00:05:47.820> controller<00:05:48.270> they<00:05:48.810> have<00:05:48.960> the<00:05:49.050> little

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 
xbox controller they have the little

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:51.589 
xbox controller they have the little
spinny<00:05:49.590> pager<00:05:49.949> motors<00:05:50.340> in<00:05:50.460> them<00:05:50.550> right<00:05:50.699> now<00:05:50.849> we

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:51.599 
spinny pager motors in them right now we

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:53.270 
spinny pager motors in them right now we
would<00:05:51.750> like<00:05:51.870> to<00:05:51.900> make<00:05:52.139> our<00:05:52.380> motors<00:05:52.830> smaller

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
would like to make our motors smaller

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.700 
would like to make our motors smaller
and<00:05:53.639> have<00:05:54.060> two<00:05:54.270> of<00:05:54.389> them<00:05:54.479> in<00:05:54.630> there<00:05:54.659> one<00:05:55.500> for

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
and have two of them in there one for

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.620 
and have two of them in there one for
each<00:05:55.740> paid<00:05:55.979> paid<00:05:56.280> remoter<00:05:56.610> for<00:05:56.789> each<00:05:56.880> hand<00:05:57.150> so

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
each paid paid remoter for each hand so

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.360 
each paid paid remoter for each hand so
you<00:05:57.720> can<00:05:57.960> not<00:05:58.169> only<00:05:58.289> give<00:05:58.500> vibrations<00:05:58.680> but<00:05:59.190> you

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
you can not only give vibrations but you

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.339 
you can not only give vibrations but you
can<00:05:59.490> actually<00:05:59.639> give<00:06:00.300> kick<00:06:00.659> back<00:06:00.900> to<00:06:01.050> the<00:06:01.169> user

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:01.349 
can actually give kick back to the user

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:02.930 
can actually give kick back to the user
and<00:06:01.800> you<00:06:01.949> can<00:06:02.070> simulate<00:06:02.250> a<00:06:02.430> lot<00:06:02.639> of<00:06:02.699> different

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
and you can simulate a lot of different

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:03.950 
and you can simulate a lot of different
things<00:06:02.969> so<00:06:03.300> say<00:06:03.449> if<00:06:03.509> there's<00:06:03.690> like<00:06:03.840> an

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
things so say if there's like an

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.629 
things so say if there's like an
explosion<00:06:04.349> you<00:06:04.949> can<00:06:05.070> have<00:06:05.250> our<00:06:05.280> motor

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 
explosion you can have our motor

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:07.820 
explosion you can have our motor
simulate<00:06:06.419> the<00:06:06.539> vibration<00:06:07.080> as<00:06:07.199> the<00:06:07.409> shock<00:06:07.620> wave

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
simulate the vibration as the shock wave

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.740 
simulate the vibration as the shock wave
approaches<00:06:08.370> you<00:06:08.520> and<00:06:08.699> then<00:06:09.120> give<00:06:09.270> you<00:06:09.419> shock

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
approaches you and then give you shock

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.379 
approaches you and then give you shock
when<00:06:10.409> that<00:06:10.590> actually<00:06:10.919> reaches<00:06:11.280> you<00:06:11.400> so<00:06:12.030> we<00:06:12.240> can

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:12.389 
when that actually reaches you so we can

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:14.300 
when that actually reaches you so we can
do<00:06:12.449> a<00:06:12.479> lot<00:06:12.690> of<00:06:12.719> really<00:06:13.080> cool<00:06:13.259> haptic<00:06:14.009> effects

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
do a lot of really cool haptic effects

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.100 
do a lot of really cool haptic effects
that<00:06:14.759> we<00:06:14.880> think<00:06:15.090> is<00:06:15.180> important<00:06:15.630> because

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
that we think is important because

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.659 
that we think is important because
locomotion<00:06:16.650> is<00:06:16.830> going<00:06:16.949> to<00:06:17.009> take<00:06:17.130> a<00:06:17.159> while<00:06:17.460> to

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669 
locomotion is going to take a while to

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.760 
locomotion is going to take a while to
get<00:06:17.759> solved<00:06:18.120> in<00:06:18.240> VR<00:06:18.509> and<00:06:18.719> we<00:06:18.960> think<00:06:19.139> the<00:06:19.500> gaming

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
get solved in VR and we think the gaming

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.080 
get solved in VR and we think the gaming
controllers<00:06:20.159> as<00:06:20.280> they<00:06:20.400> exist<00:06:20.639> today<00:06:20.759> need<00:06:21.030> to

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
controllers as they exist today need to

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.990 
controllers as they exist today need to
be<00:06:21.180> iterated<00:06:21.630> on<00:06:21.889> absolutely<00:06:22.889> and<00:06:23.130> do<00:06:23.880> you

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 
be iterated on absolutely and do you

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.939 
be iterated on absolutely and do you
have<00:06:24.180> any<00:06:24.510> kind<00:06:25.050> of<00:06:25.110> target<00:06:25.409> price<00:06:25.590> for<00:06:25.919> a

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:25.949 
have any kind of target price for a

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:27.649 
have any kind of target price for a
controller<00:06:26.490> like<00:06:26.729> this<00:06:27.000> I<00:06:27.210> mean<00:06:27.330> is<00:06:27.479> it<00:06:27.510> going

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:27.659 
controller like this I mean is it going

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:28.700 
controller like this I mean is it going
to<00:06:27.719> be<00:06:27.810> a<00:06:27.840> thousand<00:06:28.320> dollar

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
to be a thousand dollar

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.980 
to be a thousand dollar
oh<00:06:28.770> no<00:06:29.340> so<00:06:29.700> so<00:06:30.420> we're<00:06:30.540> talking<00:06:30.630> to<00:06:30.810> the<00:06:30.870> motor

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
oh no so so we're talking to the motor

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.360 
oh no so so we're talking to the motor
manufacturer<00:06:31.500> right<00:06:31.680> now<00:06:31.860> we're<00:06:32.340> working

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370 
manufacturer right now we're working

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.490 
manufacturer right now we're working
really<00:06:32.730> closely<00:06:32.850> with<00:06:33.180> them<00:06:33.450> and<00:06:33.660> we<00:06:34.320> think

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 
really closely with them and we think

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.990 
really closely with them and we think
that<00:06:34.620> at<00:06:34.890> volume<00:06:35.130> we<00:06:35.460> can<00:06:35.580> get<00:06:35.670> them<00:06:35.820> down<00:06:35.850> to

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 
that at volume we can get them down to

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.060 
that at volume we can get them down to
around<00:06:36.210> 90<00:06:36.480> cents<00:06:36.780> to<00:06:37.320> five<00:06:37.590> or<00:06:37.770> six<00:06:37.950> dollars

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.070 
around 90 cents to five or six dollars

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.190 
around 90 cents to five or six dollars
so<00:06:38.730> like<00:06:38.970> a<00:06:39.000> complete<00:06:39.420> system<00:06:39.660> with<00:06:39.960> all<00:06:40.080> the

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.200 
so like a complete system with all the

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.570 
so like a complete system with all the
electronics<00:06:40.800> and<00:06:40.950> the<00:06:40.980> battery<00:06:41.340> and<00:06:41.430> the

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
electronics and the battery and the

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.190 
electronics and the battery and the
tracking<00:06:42.000> and<00:06:42.060> everything<00:06:42.450> we<00:06:42.840> hope<00:06:42.960> to<00:06:43.080> make

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:43.200 
tracking and everything we hope to make

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.900 
tracking and everything we hope to make
a<00:06:43.230> consumer<00:06:43.620> offering<00:06:44.070> around<00:06:44.310> sixty<00:06:44.610> dollars

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:44.910 
a consumer offering around sixty dollars

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.060 
a consumer offering around sixty dollars
the<00:06:45.270> cost<00:06:45.510> of<00:06:45.660> any<00:06:45.780> modern<00:06:46.350> day<00:06:46.530> System

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.070 
the cost of any modern day System

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.340 
the cost of any modern day System
Controller<00:06:47.190> six<00:06:47.940> dollars<00:06:48.210> for<00:06:48.270> a<00:06:48.660> gun<00:06:49.020> system

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:49.350 
Controller six dollars for a gun system

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.970 
Controller six dollars for a gun system
like<00:06:49.590> this<00:06:49.910> you<00:06:50.910> would<00:06:51.090> have<00:06:51.210> me<00:06:51.390> sold<00:06:51.690> if<00:06:52.170> if

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:52.980 
like this you would have me sold if if

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.400 
like this you would have me sold if if
you<00:06:53.160> can<00:06:53.280> do<00:06:53.370> that<00:06:53.720> that's<00:06:54.720> really<00:06:54.930> exciting<00:06:55.140> I

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:55.410 
you can do that that's really exciting I

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:57.500 
you can do that that's really exciting I
mean<00:06:55.680> I<00:06:55.920> would<00:06:56.340> think<00:06:56.490> that<00:06:56.610> just<00:06:57.150> based<00:06:57.330> on

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:57.510 
mean I would think that just based on

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:58.700 
mean I would think that just based on
kind<00:06:57.840> of<00:06:57.990> the<00:06:58.050> feedback<00:06:58.380> that<00:06:58.410> I'm<00:06:58.680> getting

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:58.710 
kind of the feedback that I'm getting

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.130 
kind of the feedback that I'm getting
out<00:06:59.010> of<00:06:59.040> this<00:06:59.130> and<00:06:59.400> how<00:06:59.490> solid<00:06:59.910> it<00:07:00.000> feels<00:07:00.240> I

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:01.140 
out of this and how solid it feels I

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:02.270 
out of this and how solid it feels I
would<00:07:01.530> think<00:07:01.650> that<00:07:01.770> something<00:07:02.070> like<00:07:02.100> this

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 
would think that something like this

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.970 
would think that something like this
would<00:07:02.430> be<00:07:02.490> in<00:07:02.880> the<00:07:03.810> you<00:07:04.260> know<00:07:04.290> triple<00:07:04.680> digits

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:04.980 
would be in the you know triple digits

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.560 
would be in the you know triple digits
so<00:07:05.370> you<00:07:05.430> know<00:07:05.610> and<00:07:05.940> like<00:07:06.120> you<00:07:06.240> know<00:07:06.270> the<00:07:06.450> dev

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:06.570 
so you know and like you know the dev

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:07.790 
so you know and like you know the dev
kits<00:07:06.810> they<00:07:06.960> probably<00:07:07.200> are<00:07:07.470> going<00:07:07.620> to<00:07:07.680> be<00:07:07.770> a

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 
kits they probably are going to be a

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.960 
kits they probably are going to be a
little<00:07:07.980> more<00:07:08.070> expensive<00:07:08.460> when<00:07:08.730> they<00:07:08.790> come<00:07:08.940> out

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:08.970 
little more expensive when they come out

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.760 
little more expensive when they come out
because<00:07:09.180> they<00:07:09.390> will<00:07:09.510> be<00:07:09.690> tailored<00:07:10.590> toward

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:10.770 
because they will be tailored toward

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.080 
because they will be tailored toward
people<00:07:10.890> have<00:07:11.190> that<00:07:11.340> like<00:07:11.520> three<00:07:11.730> thousand

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:12.090 
people have that like three thousand

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:13.580 
people have that like three thousand
computers<00:07:12.270> to<00:07:12.540> currently<00:07:12.870> run<00:07:13.020> the<00:07:13.140> oculus

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:13.590 
computers to currently run the oculus

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:15.470 
computers to currently run the oculus
you<00:07:14.070> know<00:07:14.190> without<00:07:14.370> any<00:07:14.670> kind<00:07:14.880> of<00:07:15.000> frame<00:07:15.240> rate

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:15.480 
you know without any kind of frame rate

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.350 
you know without any kind of frame rate
glitch<00:07:15.800> but<00:07:16.800> but<00:07:17.250> when<00:07:17.640> we<00:07:17.730> make<00:07:17.910> a<00:07:17.940> consumer

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 
glitch but but when we make a consumer

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.360 
glitch but but when we make a consumer
offering<00:07:18.840> like<00:07:19.050> we<00:07:19.290> really<00:07:19.530> want<00:07:19.800> the<00:07:20.160> price

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:20.370 
offering like we really want the price

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:21.590 
offering like we really want the price
to<00:07:20.400> come<00:07:20.640> down<00:07:20.820> we<00:07:20.940> want<00:07:21.090> everybody<00:07:21.420> to<00:07:21.540> have

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:21.600 
to come down we want everybody to have

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.910 
to come down we want everybody to have
access<00:07:21.840> to<00:07:22.140> it<00:07:22.290> because<00:07:22.560> we<00:07:22.650> think<00:07:22.740> it's

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:22.920 
access to it because we think it's

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.380 
access to it because we think it's
really<00:07:23.100> important<00:07:23.490> great<00:07:24.000> well<00:07:24.150> thank<00:07:24.300> you
