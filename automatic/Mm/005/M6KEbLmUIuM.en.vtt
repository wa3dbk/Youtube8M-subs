00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 good morning girls today we will make a face 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.550
 more outfits where the face actually is 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.920
 it's just about mascara pencils i'm from 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.110
 always doing the same basis therefore not 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.619
 there is nothing new 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.060
 however, today's replied only to me 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:24.510
 tell you these two things it's all about 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.990
 on two leaders of Roma who are this 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.080
 transparent shirt and this 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:35.430
 maglioncione as I call it by 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:37.940
 ethical draw after you see too much is in you 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.350
 I thought I had crushed and instead 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.940
 I'm burning my eyes I 'm not 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.469
 putting on the lenses these days 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.610
 rather merely the station in 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.969
 gym otherwise with the name 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.649
 of the instructor and it is a mess and nothing 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.260
 I'll show you how I'm dressed 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.110
 good day to all c abu ok then 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.760
 the base I've already done I'm going to put the 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.730
 arm that I really wanted to put the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.890
 my usual, however, I now know of 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.970
 paola p we took to use it 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.720
 space the truth the only left in 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.939
 changing room 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:15.090
 the numbers in the bathroom and then I apply the 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.000
 pink blush here on the other 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.080
 I see that there is also a whole church there 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.700
 right between me and a subspecies of con 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.740
 touring with the earth there is no feeling 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.570
 and not just girls 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:35.439
 there is the earth but its only puts 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:39.020
 normal but does nothing 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:44.950
 after applying the blush I go to do 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:48.560
 a thin thin black line I use the 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:53.799
 band and keith wade on high you think the 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:56.960
 color for jean I am going to blend it with a 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.610
 brush in this way does not wash 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.709
 take a lot because a lot of black 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.220
 intense and I do n't want this 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:05.690
 feature you get lost or did it 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.269
 both eyes at this point 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.880
 I have to admit the stretching mascara of 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:14.530
 offida is a bit of a gloss any one 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.530
 key I took this green deal 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.530
 lac on the shiny eye result 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.209
 lips I put on my glasses because 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.459
 lenses behind but in these days that is 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.900
 yesterday I won't put them there because of it 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.569
 burn your eyes a little while putting on 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.580
 eye drops then that's all 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.930
 element later but it goes putting the 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.280
 glasses now let's see how 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.890
 I'm dressed 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.790
 then we start from the above you can see 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:44.090
 this necklace tailed this necklace and 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.579
 of sodini bought in super super super 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.859
 real discount too in some lines you 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:51.680
 like then I walk away to show you 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:54.829
 well shirt and sweater then being 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.450
 the sweater very very very hot and 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.670
 even doing pretty hot in 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.810
 office I put under a blouse 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.989
 light so 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.360
 so don't put too much 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.580
 you see it opens like this 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.840
 behind a little more frou frou to the buttons 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.620
 that on the sleeves for eventually 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:16.099
 to brown a practically submissive one 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.890
 tank top the blouse the sweater I am 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.480
 of rom harry passionate about this 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.480
 sweater because I don't know maybe me 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.190
 it looks like an animal and if the magnÃ  this is it 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.580
 the hammer a young man I call 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.400
 style I like a lot the 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.870
 jackets made sweaters like this and 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.680
 This is my first I had pointed 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.910
 immediately on the Roma site and I took it for 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:43.610
 don't have a total black look let's say 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:47.030
 below he wore eight-piece jeans 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.880
 a little so here is gis of sisley 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.709
 year the studs under and always for 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.560
 avoid the total black look 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:57.019
 I put the gray boot for a while 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.110
 studied so much it does not rain not 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:04.130
 rain threat of the mauro leone brand 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.930
 I also put a lot of nail polish 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.630
 very cheerful very spring that me 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.239
 somewhat reminiscent of the pink of the necklace 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:15.260
 always to avoid the total black look 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:17.329
 to help the total black look instead 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.350
 I'm going to put chartres at this one 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:25.010
 very simple cotton scarf the 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.900
 I have my black zara down jacket 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.670
 purchased last year 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.150
 I must say that it turned out 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:34.180
 a good buy because I used it 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.220
 a lot last year and stop it 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:41.240
 using again this year is true a 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:44.630
 so soft it closes like this up to 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.990
 also top the waist belt for 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.450
 stay tighter to challenge 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.520
 still of her hips and like a bag that 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.880
 reminds me of the boots I put this here 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.590
 of practically plastic armani 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.400
 fine and renato my sister three years ago 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:04.280
 for the birthday and the look is over 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.990
 I hope you like it is a little different from the 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:10.220
 usually because of the use of this 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:12.530
 maglioncione ga the bodies and us there 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.880
