00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.569
 in this video we see how to make 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:08.990
 a double overlap which is one 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:11.269
 decrease that in one shot talk and 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.410
 two points usually one point is taken away 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.290
 at a time 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.690
 with this technique instead they are eliminated 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:21.200
 we say that two points are reduced comes 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.570
 usually used for decreases 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.870
 converge and this is the closure 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.940
 let's say so final is often used 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:32.720
 in laces in manufacturing she liszt 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:37.490
 perforated and and is extremely simple 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:40.280
 then I work my first points for 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:45.230
 realize it here is how I do it passed a 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:52.160
 point without working it I work two points 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:55.010
 together with the right one and riding the shirt 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.180
 that I passed on what I know 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.600
 by the decrease 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:04.360
 here it continues to the end now 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.360
 reverse work in another 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.450
 of reverse side 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:24.530
 usually the double horse is 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.450
 accompanied by thrown who create gods 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.500
 little holes just because you use them 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.450
 often in perforated work 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:38.899
 you can often find it just next to it 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:43.880
 of the dictates in this case step one 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:45.069
 stitch without working it work 2 stitches 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.920
 together 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:50.959
 here I made a decrease and here it is 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.049
 decrease second point because a 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:57.080
 horse to the knit passed on that 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.840
 worked and now I show you the result 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.959
 the final 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.959
 here it is
