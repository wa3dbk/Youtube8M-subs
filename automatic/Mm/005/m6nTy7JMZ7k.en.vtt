00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 All welcome in this video I you 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.880
 I'll show you how to fit in here 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.790
 beautiful unusual pattern 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:16.650
 found it on the internet very much 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:20.840
 I liked the original which blouse 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.970
 bolero was connected in such a pattern 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:29.010
 looks so pretty airy 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.109
 such here it turns out for sample 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.189
 will need to dial the number of loops 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.420
 multiple 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.250
 peaks and pattern it turns out we have 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.489
 two-way that with one that with another 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.989
 hand, he looks the same this here 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.800
 interesting air pattern is obtained as 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.530
 and let's see how it fit 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:56.010
 the first row we will need to knit 5 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.129
 facial and 5 purl alternating 5 facial 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.650
 and 5 purl 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:09.950
 next row knit this way 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.950
 edge we remove so 5 facial 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:27.390
 5 facial and then knit over the purl 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:30.020
 knit 1 purl and nakid 1 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.570
 wrong coat 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:37.369
 that is, we knit 5 purls and after 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.369
 each do a cape 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.890
 so the next 5 are facial 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:02:02.820
 and again purl and nakid purl and 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:11.910
 nakid after each purl do 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:19.040
 we knit and edging further knit 5 rows 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:19.040
 on the edge of the picture we remove 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.740
 so here I first had a purl and 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.560
 knit on facial pattern over facial 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:32.850
 purl over purl nakida 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:36.830
 knit purl loop so 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:39.830
 alternate facial purl and facial 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.830
 wrong side 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:54.670
 further knit purl and again facial 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:03:00.769
 and nakida knit purl 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:07.819
 We connect according to the pattern and we still knit 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:15.920
 4 rows of facial over face 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:18.560
 purl over purl and so we 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.349
 knit and now 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:25.250
 the eighth row we knit as follows 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:27.489
 We edify 5 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.489
 facial 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.139
 so now 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:42.560
 wrong side 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:43.489
 and we reset the face that is 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.599

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:50.120
