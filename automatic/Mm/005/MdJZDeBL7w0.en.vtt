00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.430
 [Music] 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.120
 very good friendly changes that you are 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.710
 good in this video I 'll try 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.870
 clarify once and for all and most 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.640
 simple I can of which consoles it 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.680
 may play 3 can be hacked and 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.940
 that perez can not be hacked and good 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.470
 it's going to be very simple but first of all 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.660
 I'm going to make a bit of progress 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.580
 subliminal advertising if you want to be 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.500
 Attentive to the news you have in my 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.170
 channel go to our youtube channel that 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.660
 you see here administer subscriptions 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.250
 and here where you see the section that you are 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.750
 two boxes you have to mark this 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.309
 box that says I want to receive notices 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.289
 by email of the videos 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.899
 new so when I upload a new 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:52.510
 tutorial or a mail will follow 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.729
 to good email without further delay is 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.399
 quite simple and very very very easy to 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:59.500
 understand you can only hack the 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.449
 playstation 3 that have a system 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.299
 official sony the normal system does not 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.039
 higher than 3.55 everything that happens there 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.110
 you have to do a downgrade towards the 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:10.780
 version 3.55 which is the version that 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.869
 allows to make a hack even 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.039
 previous versions also good much 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.770
 people are wondering I have the 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:21.580
 version 4.46 I can hack them then no 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.220
 you have to go down to 3.55 as good as 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.600
 this is done through a chip in a 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.429
 chip that is installed inside there 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.280
 that open the console and you have to put the 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:31.869
 chip that is called three classes good this 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.069
 chip can not be put in all the 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.110
 consoles you can only have the 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:38.920
 consoles that from the factory brought the 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.720
 system not higher than 3.55 because of not 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.930
 be so if the factory console brought 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.980
 a system higher than 3.55 can be 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.070
 lock the console 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.960
 it can be ruined forever 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.450
 how do you check if we had a 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.659
 lower factory version no higher 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.790
 at 3.55 there are several ways I'm going to 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.170
 be a tutorial where you can check it 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.780
 in a compatibility table but 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.280
 Well, people have a bit of trouble 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.500
 that I'm going to make it easier and it's 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.330
 through an update if you have 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.250
 followed my tutorials I guess I've 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.140
 seen how easy it is to update a 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.020
 firmware that is catch put the firmware 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.280
 on the pendrive and update as this is 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.490
 will try the same but without 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.650
 update well you download the file 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.560
 and to download it click on 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.940
 the link and access here if you have a 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.430
 ad blocker you have to 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.880
 unlock it and catch and give it not act 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.710
 of this page 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.660
 will be reloaded to the page 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.940
 now I count back and say for 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.770
 continue 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.930
 here there will be a countdown of 5 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.480
 seconds you wait do not touch here this is not 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.550
 it's a file this is advertising 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.590
 here 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.960
 and jump and advertising and here's the 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.020
 file and what downloads it is to check 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.940
 the minimum version of play 3 extracts it 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.850
 we left the folder that is ps3 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.430
 inside ps3 is the update folder and 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.070
 inside the ps3 update point which is the 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.590
 file him to check the 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:06.040
 good version as always I tell you that 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.520
 check the m of 5 and check the mi5 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.780
 to the point file not to the tablet 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.400
 good you select the directory not 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.750
 you have like for example is the folder 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:20.540
 ps3 I say it create shams 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.670
 there will be update folder and this gave the ok 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.470
 [Music] 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.260
 and it tells us where you want to save the 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.209
 I tell you in txt and I'll 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.349
 save on the desktop I'm just going to 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.930
 attach the video selection as 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.090
 always what is this for the md 5 this 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.190
 is to corroborate that it has not 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.130
 spoiled the file when downloading it from 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.530
 good internet because nothing is so simple 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.069
 how to take the file and put it in a 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.159
 pendrive 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.380
 we have equipment and we take the folder ps3 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:50.020
 entire 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.780
 good he depends they say be format 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.290
 fa 32 and you do not know by matter right away 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.290
 its moment 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.290
 and what you have to do is drag 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.550
 the decompressed folder here at 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.130
 pendrive 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.840
 As I have seen it is very little and good 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.520
 Once this is done we extract the pendrive 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.560
 and we go to the play see you in the 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.970
 play good we are here in the play 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.290
 I have the pendrive connected with the 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.270
 update that I have told you before 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.730
 inside and we are in that we carry here 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.590
 system authorization settings and 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.560
 we choose to update through a support 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:26.070
 good storage as you see here 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:29.100
 puts version check by Icarus the author of 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.810
 this publication and well very simple you 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.840
 We give ok and look what happens 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:37.650
 highlights this error but tells us that the 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.630
 update version of is 340 or 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.670
 Top can be installed in this 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.150
 system this has told me that my 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:48.000
 console brings to the 3.40 series here I 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.700
 could update and do a downgrade 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.430
 towards 355 for example because it's the 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.830
 that the minimum that can be hacked or 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.990
 be the maximum until 355 already starting 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.520
 from there you can not hack with which 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.380
 my version of the 340 could do the 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.620
 name and perfectly you if you 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:08.340
 put a lower number or not 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:10.770
 higher than 3.5 555 you can do it 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.810
 everything that happens from 3.55 can no longer be 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.460
 hack with which is very simple 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.770
 you make this update and you're done 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.199
 Well I hope it has been easy 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.240
 it's easy to understand and how good it is 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.010
 the taste you give to like favorites and 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.850
 subscribe then we'll see another video
