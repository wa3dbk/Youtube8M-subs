shortened<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.090> little<00:01:00.449> bit<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.930> then

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
shortened it a little bit and then

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.289 
shortened it a little bit and then
modified<00:01:02.539> the<00:01:03.539> attachment<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.769> engine

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
modified the attachment to the engine

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.820 
modified the attachment to the engine
had<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.420> attached<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.110> valve<00:01:07.290> cover<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:07.799> I

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
had it attached to the valve cover so I

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.969 
had it attached to the valve cover so I
just<00:01:08.240> epoxy<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.450> piece<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.869> aluminum<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
just epoxy the piece of aluminum on the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.969 
just epoxy the piece of aluminum on the
bottom<00:01:11.400> side<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.799> that's<00:01:13.799> how<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
bottom side of that and that's how the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.910 
bottom side of that and that's how the
scoop<00:01:14.250> works<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:15.479> on<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.810> interior<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.530> shot

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
scoop works so on the interior I shot

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.219 
scoop works so on the interior I shot
the<00:01:17.040> cage<00:01:17.250> black<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.659> querque<00:01:18.990> front

they<00:01:21.570> have<00:01:21.780> pretty<00:01:22.680> tall<00:01:23.490> walls<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.299> so

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
they have pretty tall walls on it so

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.630 
they have pretty tall walls on it so
it's<00:01:24.600> kind<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.900> tricky<00:01:25.110> getting<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.549> out

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.320 
it's kind of tricky getting in and out
of<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.909> seats

of the seats

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.480 
of the seats
you<00:01:27.689> just<00:01:27.900> can't<00:01:28.229> slide<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.070> out<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.340> them

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
you just can't slide in and out of them

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.630 
you just can't slide in and out of them
which<00:01:29.909> obviously<00:01:30.829> the<00:01:31.829> design<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.369> way<00:01:32.579> so

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
which obviously the design that way so

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.819

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
applications and you know you go after

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.920 
applications and you know you go after
throttle<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:29.800> you<00:02:30.430> wait<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:30.700> it<00:02:31.510> comes<00:02:31.750> in

smoothly this one is abrupt it's it's
just<00:02:36.250> throttle<00:02:36.700> response<00:02:36.850> like<00:02:37.390> you<00:02:37.990> just

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
just throttle response like you just

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.980 
just throttle response like you just
can't<00:02:38.440> believe<00:02:38.760> it's<00:02:39.760> just<00:02:39.970> on<00:02:40.180> when<00:02:40.600> when<00:02:40.870> you

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
can't believe it's just on when when you

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:47.170 
can't believe it's just on when when you
push<00:02:41.170> a<00:02:41.200> pedal<00:02:41.530> down

handling<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:55.660> braking<00:02:55.800> it's<00:02:57.030> it's<00:02:58.030> amazing

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
handling and braking it's it's amazing

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.320 
handling and braking it's it's amazing
to<00:02:58.750> have<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:58.900> car<00:02:59.230> that<00:02:59.970> can<00:03:00.970> can<00:03:01.690> turn<00:03:02.020> and<00:03:03.330> not

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
to have a car that can can turn and not

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.050 
to have a car that can can turn and not
a<00:03:04.390> lot<00:03:04.570> of<00:03:04.660> body<00:03:04.840> roll<00:03:05.050> and<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:06.100> braking<00:03:06.550> is<00:03:06.640> is

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
a lot of body roll and the braking is is

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.240 
a lot of body roll and the braking is is
there<00:03:07.300> we've<00:03:07.660> got<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.870> bear<00:03:08.050> brakes<00:03:08.380> and<00:03:08.740> then

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
there we've got the bear brakes and then

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.690 
there we've got the bear brakes and then
we<00:03:09.310> have<00:03:09.460> the<00:03:09.580> hydro<00:03:09.850> boost<00:03:10.000> from<00:03:10.990> hydro<00:03:11.350> tech

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
we have the hydro boost from hydro tech

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.340 
we have the hydro boost from hydro tech
so<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:12.850> goal<00:03:13.000> of<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.180> car<00:03:13.390> is<00:03:13.630> to<00:03:13.900> do<00:03:14.020> double

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
so the goal of the car is to do double

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.900 
so the goal of the car is to do double
duty<00:03:14.380> if<00:03:14.680> we<00:03:14.800> want<00:03:14.980> to<00:03:15.010> do<00:03:15.100> some<00:03:15.310> road<00:03:15.460> racing

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
duty if we want to do some road racing

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.780 
duty if we want to do some road racing
with<00:03:16.060> it<00:03:16.210> and<00:03:16.440> do<00:03:17.440> some<00:03:17.620> drag<00:03:17.830> racing<00:03:18.250> go<00:03:18.730> to

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
with it and do some drag racing go to

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.220 
with it and do some drag racing go to
the<00:03:19.030> track<00:03:19.530> 28<00:03:20.530> degrees<00:03:20.920> of<00:03:20.980> timing<00:03:21.130> went<00:03:21.670> 10

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
the track 28 degrees of timing went 10

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:30.690 
the track 28 degrees of timing went 10
49<00:03:23.230> and<00:03:23.680> 130<00:03:25.320> 160<00:03:26.320> foot<00:03:26.590> was<00:03:27.160> a<00:03:27.930> 155<00:03:29.310> car<00:03:30.310> pulls

49 and 130 160 foot was a 155 car pulls
wheels<00:03:31.110> with<00:03:32.110> just<00:03:32.350> a<00:03:32.470> 155<00:03:33.100> real<00:03:33.760> lazy<00:03:34.060> lead<00:03:34.710> so

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
wheels with just a 155 real lazy lead so

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.710 
wheels with just a 155 real lazy lead so
that<00:03:35.890> part<00:03:36.160> of<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:36.460> part<00:03:37.270> of<00:03:37.360> the<00:03:37.420> chassis

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
that part of the part of the chassis

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.260 
that part of the part of the chassis
works<00:03:38.280> so<00:03:39.280> unfortunately<00:03:39.940> we<00:03:40.030> didn't<00:03:40.210> get

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
works so unfortunately we didn't get

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.130 
works so unfortunately we didn't get
that<00:03:40.420> on<00:03:40.600> film<00:03:42.000> just<00:03:43.000> a<00:03:43.210> quick<00:03:43.540> test<00:03:43.780> for<00:03:43.990> me

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
that on film just a quick test for me

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.530 
that on film just a quick test for me
just<00:03:44.410> to<00:03:44.470> see<00:03:44.650> where<00:03:44.890> the<00:03:44.980> car<00:03:45.160> was<00:03:45.540> but

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
just to see where the car was but
