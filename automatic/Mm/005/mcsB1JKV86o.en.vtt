00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.730
 counterpart of molluscs and all their equipment 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.370

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.140
 in this play and also gives me the 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.640
 opportunity to work with daddy that 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.170

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.090
 time I was doing the first time 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.090
 The first time is that we share the 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.290
 tables and experience but super 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.110
 unforgettable 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.849
 like this union of comedy and daddy's 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.319
 father and son truth and studying comedy 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.459
 of the old school comedy that 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.530

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.250
 has its experience that implements 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.599
 also and we have seen many times that 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.829
 for example the scripts do not copy the 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.620
 movements but that makes them from memory 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:08.200
 and every time we rehearse he adds lines 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.690

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.890
