00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 you know what is special about this photo 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.620
 or this one or even this one all 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.719
 made on a camera phone with just 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.059
 5 megapixels and now I will tell you 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.009
 how can you do exactly the same thing 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.289
 what is needed is your phone with 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:25.190
 camera not less than 5 megapixels 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:27.410
 this will be more than enough. 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.840
 20 fight this is not paradise on the phone i 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.620
 Now I will tell you about what it is 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.620
 little thing 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.530
 tom as it usually happens in all 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.840
 issues I wanted to remove the issue about here 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.640
 This little thing kind talk in 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.890
 next time because now nothing 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.850
 cool with him could come up and you 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.880
 just went saw 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.830
 cool look and decided it sfotkat but if 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:01.200
 you just take pictures on the usual 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:03.040
 camera like this for example it turns out 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.620
 photos are not the best quality 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.390
 because the social network is right for us 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.000
 taking photographs of the sun is very very 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.690
 bad application comes to the rescue 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 hd 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.640
 camera about which allows you to do 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.479
 photos just here against the sun and 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.190
 any such 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.260
 and in principle with such an application you can 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.840
 make absolutely new bullet photos 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.330
 just bek cool on transparent just 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.290
 take a picture and we get fucking 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.290
 cool photo 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.689
 timur horizon littered with applications and dr 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.310
 allows you to shoot first against 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.500
 sun secondly it allows you to do 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.960
 just more beautiful pictures due to 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.299
 shadow enhancement because the camera behind 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.909
 one time can't then take a picture and 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.470
 light and dark areas normal and us 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.479
 comes to the aid of HDR which follows 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.369
 so copes fine besides 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.560
 after you have taken photos 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.720
 process it immediately lighten something 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.490
 make something more vivid can even 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.259
 apply several different light filters 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.439
 and see how they will be different 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:06.080
 pictures are made just with HDR from HDR with 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.090
 post processing is important not to overdo it 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.830
 processing as I did but in any 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.780
 moment picture can be cropped 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.060
 and we will get less quality 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.340
 photo with bright color with 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.890
 exposed shadows and without any 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.170
 distortion as if we became for example 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.049
 full picture because full 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.760
 the pictures see the sky turned a little 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.680
 it is dark and they can quite gloomy 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.840
 but if it is cropped and left only 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.430
 this part then everything looks more or less 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.060
 but don't forget another one 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.680
 features 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.420
 That would be so fashioned his photos 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.420
 autograph and ravana just on the phone 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.250
 I use a special fishing nozzle 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.620
 This one is done absolutely on 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.760
 any phone due to the picture 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.200
 very distorted and looks enough 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.109
 perhaps the biggest 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.400
 The disadvantage of HDR photos are 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:54.680
 distortion on the photo because 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.660
 the camera takes three whole shots and then 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.910
 stitches them if the object is moving then we 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.100
 we get something like this 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.709
 very ugly distortion so 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.660
 the camera needs to be kept as smooth as possible 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.310
 preferably shoot static scenes then 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.920
 there are no move people 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.590
 buses to the car and everything else than 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.269
 the more static the better i am all the same 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.370
 decided to take a picture of the car and waited 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.079
 until you stop at traffic lights and 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.730
 it turned out quite good 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.040
 picture is a bit distorted but 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.660
 the smallest is still pretty good 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.940
 In general, be sure to experiment 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.620
 from hdr photos besides that last 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.630
 time this function is soldered most 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.760
 compact cameras as well as in all 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.620
 New iPhones and iPads This feature is already 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.290
 there is like built in but if your 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.750
 phone and no, then just download and from 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.670
 google play from windows market or for 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.860
 parties here have such applications and 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.810
 how do you download run to the street and 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.760
 experiment these against the sun 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.319
 photo sun type doesn't matter pictures in 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.480
 anyway it will turn out very 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.500
 interesting my name is timur not 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.120
 forget to subscribe to the channel 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.730
 join the VKontakte group to not 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.799
 skip new releases on mobile 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.180
 also follow me expose because 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.829
 what exactly there I will lay out 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.829
 photos taken on the phone
