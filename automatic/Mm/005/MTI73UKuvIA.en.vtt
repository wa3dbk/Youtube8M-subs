00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.230
 even with the appropriate drivers to 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.170
 installation of new boards can generate 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.210
 headaches to many reasons for 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.920
 that a particular device does not 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.890
 works correctly 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.199
 formerly the fault was the system but the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.720
 windows 8 for example is already there almost 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.029
 all components without the need for 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.580
 a cd with specific drivers 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.140
 although the 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.300
 usually install a driver 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.210
 generic that is not always the best 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.790
 solution either by one or the other 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.620
 some ways to install and 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.870
 update the drivers and improve 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:47.520
 usability of your computer 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:50.010
 today we will show how before 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.860
 start for automatic updates 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.140
 let's check the basics for the best solution 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.789
 is to use the proprietary driver of the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.460
 component you added to your 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.010
 machine if you have installed a 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.030
 sound should install the software is on cd 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.580
 of product 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.170
 if the installed part is already a little old the 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.729
 software may be 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.979
 out of date 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.229
 in these cases it is worth consulting the website 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.140
 and obtain the latest version of the 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.020
 the situations in which we do not have 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.970
 plus the other installation CD in which the 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.640
 media is corrupted, and so on 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.070
 whatever the problem you may be 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.250
 to circumvent the use of software to 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.369
 such a task our tip is iran get 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.890
 booster 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.259
 already in the first initiation the application 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.509
 will check all drivers inform 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.350
 if you have the latest version or if 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.350
 they are outdated 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.450
 the program sorts items in old 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.630
 very old and old indicating the 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.270
 update priority you need 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.610
 just click refresh and wait for the 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.100
 driver booster bass new driver create 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.439
 a restore point and performs all the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.729
 installation process without the need for 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.369
 any command 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.110
 then just reboot to enjoy 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.079
 improvements in the system 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.929
 finally we want to leave a tip for 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.270
 who uses an offboard video card 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.830
 be an amd or nvidia board 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.450
 Wow 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.610
 The foundation is that you always use the 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.530
 latest official driver version 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.290
 recommended for her 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.120
 so go straight to the official website and 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.480
 step by step to obtain the 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.490
 driver the use of beta versions 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.350
 it might be interesting if you 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.200
 specific improvements that are not 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.270
 possible with the common driver but 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.800
 need to stay connected that the 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.570
 tests may have problems 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.000
 several 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.290
 we hope you succeed in this 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.290
 mission and until the next
