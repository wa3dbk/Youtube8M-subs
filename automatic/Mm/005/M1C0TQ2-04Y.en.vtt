00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 I am welcome to a new video and to 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.870
 it seems there is a small controversy 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.820
 between us we can load our iphone 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.590
 old with a charger as we will see 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.590
 if this is a myth or a reality 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.000
 and well, everything started when someone 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.400
 he commented on energy in sharm and that if he could 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.130
 charge your iphone with the charger 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.170
 ipad everything went complicated when everything 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.130
 the world gave many different opinions 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:32.080
 they said that it was going to be damaged that better not 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.390
 I did and there were many others who 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.980
 have the others been crazy then 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.079
 I gave myself the task of investigating good 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.510
 You already know a little bit about this topic but 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.670
 I took on the task of investigating this and 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.070
 let's start with the first thing that is my 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.740
 personal experience I have always had 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.110
 had iphone from the iphone 3 that 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.240
 has never used the iphone charger 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.070
 always used the ipad charger from 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.380
 done this is my boot of my first 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.690
 ipad which is the ipad with my ipad 2 me 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.490
 it seems or ipad one I do not remember but 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.920
 this is my charger of my age and always 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.989
 used this charger because it has always 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.000
 seemed like it is loading faster 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.130
 iphone with ipad charger and many 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.860
 of you connoisseurs are going to say that 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.560
 yes you have is right energy that 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.090
 It is charged with the ipad manager by 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.220
 the same thing is going to break down that is not 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.730
 that I have the iphone 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.940
 up to the iphone5 right now loading it with 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:28.520
 the ipad charger and I 've never had 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.100
 no problem that is my point of view 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.780
 from my experience and I say of my 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.640
 experience that there is no problem 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.620
 using the ipad charger but as 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.660
 I do not always like to talk to 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.970
 silly I like to investigate things 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.790
 like to know what I'm talking about 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.470
 and always recommend the best for 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.890
 you then I gave myself to the task of 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.300
 research blogs in forums about this 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.479
 topic to get all the information 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:57.020
 necessary and then you can discover 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.119
 that in many of the forums they said that 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.890
 there was no problem the experts 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.490
 they said there was no problem 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.520
 also in fact there are cases of people who 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.890
 says that when using your ipad's charger 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.770
 they were either decomposed their battery their 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.850
 loading port but I reading all 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.970
 the comments I came to the conclusion 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:20.330
 I had to not see the boot 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.820
 ipad with the failures that I had 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.030
 I attribute these failures to a 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.030
 cable no 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.300
 end some cable that is failing 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.560
 some defective cable or just one 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.140
 electric discharge in your 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.970
 in the loader in the system in its 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.520
 electrical system and then that caused 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.940
 the flaw in your iphone and now what the 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.160
 others say in the forums is that the 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.620
 ipad charger detects that you're 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.130
 connecting if it's an iphone if it's an ipod 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.769
 if it's an ipad and solito fits the 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.230
 needs of the device that you are 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:59.080
 connecting which makes me a lot 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.420
 much sense as they get home and 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.250
 things only guy always has everything 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.380
 thought and do not think that those 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.269
 companies that take out a product that 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.220
 will decompose another of your products 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.019
 is not one of those companies say the bolt 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.150
 that they want but support is not of those 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.519
 companies so it does me a lot 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.730
 meaning that this charger is planned 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:21.700
 of ipad for some clueless or 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.069
 Some user like me who wants to use the 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.260
 charger with your iphone detect it is a 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.810
 iphone and solito adapts so that no 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.849
 will cause damage to your device 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.430
 That said, many will not believe me 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:36.190
 many good and you're not good 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.380
 crazy you do not know what you're talking about but I 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.500
 I tell you 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.870
 and even more so I went to the forums 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.550
 official apple and then there are many 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.580
 questions also within the forums of 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:51.060
 apple also asking about this 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.950
 problem this myth about the charger the 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.260
 ipad and iphone and there are answers from 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.510
 all types there are answers of the same 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.970
 users and there are also responses from the 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.460
 same from apple that say there's no 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.100
 no problem that you use your charger 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.080
 your ipad with your iphone there is no 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.360
 problem are basically saying 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.740
 also that adapts alone to 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.000
 device that you are 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.910
 connecting and also on the page 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.120
 Official of the store if you are going to buy 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.610
 a charger of these separately there 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.400
 says it's basically compatible 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:28.450
 virtually with all the devices 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.940
 of contribution that can be charged by a 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:34.910
 usb cable so you already know myth solved 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:38.330
 charge your iphone your ipod with the charger 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:41.420
 of the iPad is not going to cause any problems 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.520
 with your device if you ever arrive 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.800
 to have an error if ever you take 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.350
 have a problem that is attributed 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:52.070
 to the charger of poets was surely 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.630
 some other fault that caused 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.310
 this problem with your battery with your 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.730
 Loading port said by the experts 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:01.870
