00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:10.690 

here<00:00:08.639> we<00:00:09.179> are<00:00:09.210> going<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.540> study<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.990> clutch

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:10.700 
here we are going to study a clutch

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.190 
here we are going to study a clutch
basically<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.730> clutch<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.480> kind<00:00:12.750> of<00:00:12.900> switch

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
basically a clutch is a kind of switch

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.700 
basically a clutch is a kind of switch
just<00:00:14.190> like<00:00:14.400> in<00:00:14.580> electricity<00:00:15.330> we<00:00:15.900> start<00:00:16.470> and

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
just like in electricity we start and

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.439 
just like in electricity we start and
stop<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.039> electrical<00:00:17.940> current<00:00:18.270> or

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
stop the electrical current or

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.810 
stop the electrical current or
electrical<00:00:18.900> energy<00:00:19.080> flow<00:00:19.590> by<00:00:20.160> using<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.640> switch

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
electrical energy flow by using a switch

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.660 
electrical energy flow by using a switch
in<00:00:21.289> mechanical<00:00:22.289> engineering<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:23.100> start<00:00:23.430> or

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
in mechanical engineering to start or

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.939 
in mechanical engineering to start or
stop<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.449> transfer<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:24.900> motion<00:00:25.260> or<00:00:25.619> transfer

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
stop the transfer of motion or transfer

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.240 
stop the transfer of motion or transfer
of<00:00:25.980> kinetic<00:00:26.340> energy<00:00:26.609> we<00:00:27.330> use<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.570> clutch<00:00:28.260> so

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
of kinetic energy we use a clutch so

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.679 
of kinetic energy we use a clutch so
basically<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.760> clutch<00:00:30.179> should<00:00:30.359> be<00:00:30.480> sitting

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
basically a clutch should be sitting

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.500 
basically a clutch should be sitting
between<00:00:31.019> two<00:00:31.380> elements<00:00:31.650> one<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.270> prime

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
between two elements one is the prime

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.380 
between two elements one is the prime
mover<00:00:33.690> say<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.469> motor<00:00:34.739> or<00:00:35.160> engine<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.820> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
mover say a motor or engine and the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.990 
mover say a motor or engine and the
other<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.110> load<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:38.010> we<00:00:38.040> can<00:00:38.430> disconnect

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
other is the load so we can disconnect

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.680 
other is the load so we can disconnect
these<00:00:39.329> two<00:00:39.600> entities<00:00:39.930> at<00:00:40.320> will<00:00:41.270> let<00:00:42.270> us<00:00:42.450> look

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
these two entities at will let us look

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.860 
these two entities at will let us look
at<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.110> clutch<00:00:43.399> part<00:00:44.399> by<00:00:44.579> part<00:00:44.820> now<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.690> we'll

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
at the clutch part by part now so we'll

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.290 
at the clutch part by part now so we'll
start<00:00:46.170> at<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.890> input<00:00:47.219> side<00:00:47.460> where<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
start at the input side where the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.389 
start at the input side where the
flywheel<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:48.840> situated<00:00:49.350> Here<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.160> am<00:00:50.309> showing

the 3d view so in this 3d view you can

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.290 
the 3d view so in this 3d view you can
see<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.219> flywheel<00:00:56.579> as<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.850> know<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
see this is the flywheel as you know the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.840 
see this is the flywheel as you know the
rim<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.170> flywheel<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.710> made<00:00:59.160> heavy<00:00:59.430> to

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
rim of the flywheel is made heavy to

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.000 
rim of the flywheel is made heavy to
increase<00:01:00.120> its<00:01:00.329> moment<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.750> inertia<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.859> that

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
increase its moment of inertia so that

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.100 
increase its moment of inertia so that
you<00:01:02.100> can<00:01:02.250> store<00:01:02.520> kinetic<00:01:03.120> energy<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.690> that

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
you can store kinetic energy in it that

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.219 
you can store kinetic energy in it that
also<00:01:04.500> creates<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.700> recess<00:01:06.360> here<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.930> space

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
also creates this recess here the space

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.429 
also creates this recess here the space
in<00:01:07.530> which<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.130> clutch<00:01:08.369> resides<00:01:09.260> this<00:01:10.260> is

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
in which the clutch resides this is

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.770 
in which the clutch resides this is
basically<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.340> engine<00:01:11.700> side<00:01:11.939> on<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.540> left

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
basically the engine side on the left

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.810 
basically the engine side on the left
there<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.110> engine<00:01:13.530> which<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:13.920> driving<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.369> fly

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
there is engine which is driving the fly

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.980 
there is engine which is driving the fly
will<00:01:15.080> then<00:01:16.700> coaxial<00:01:17.700> with<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:18.119> flywheel<00:01:18.810> is

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
will then coaxial with this flywheel is

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.560 
will then coaxial with this flywheel is
going<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.500> be<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.920> output<00:01:20.070> shaft<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.450> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
going to be the output shaft so in the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.690 
going to be the output shaft so in the
section<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:22.200> will<00:01:22.350> look<00:01:22.799> like<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
section it will look like this and the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.789 
section it will look like this and the
point<00:01:23.880> we<00:01:24.119> noted<00:01:24.450> here<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.810> although<00:01:25.290> they<00:01:25.710> are

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
point we noted here is although they are

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.740 
point we noted here is although they are
coaxial<00:01:26.400> they<00:01:27.060> are<00:01:27.119> not<00:01:27.299> going<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.630> rotate

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
coaxial they are not going to rotate

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.569 
coaxial they are not going to rotate
together<00:01:28.229> because<00:01:28.560> there<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:28.829> some<00:01:29.009> clearance

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
together because there is some clearance

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.120 
together because there is some clearance
a<00:01:29.670> kind<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.939> spring<00:01:30.210> or<00:01:30.329> joint<00:01:30.860> another<00:01:31.860> thing

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
a kind of spring or joint another thing

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.520 
a kind of spring or joint another thing
to<00:01:32.250> be<00:01:32.340> noticed<00:01:32.700> here<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.900> output<00:01:34.290> shaft

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
to be noticed here is the output shaft

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.800 
to be noticed here is the output shaft
is<00:01:34.860> having<00:01:34.890> splines<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.060> we<00:01:36.180> can<00:01:36.329> have<00:01:36.540> things

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
is having splines so we can have things

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.530 
is having splines so we can have things
mounted<00:01:37.590> on<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.979> output<00:01:38.280> shaft<00:01:38.490> which<00:01:39.329> can

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
mounted on the output shaft which can

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.600 
mounted on the output shaft which can
rotate<00:01:39.750> with<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.290> at<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.979> same<00:01:41.159> time<00:01:41.369> they<00:01:41.549> can

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
rotate with it at the same time they can

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.960 
rotate with it at the same time they can
also<00:01:41.880> slide<00:01:42.659> along<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.770> these<00:01:44.009> are<00:01:44.280> our<00:01:44.460> two

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.319 
which is having some frictional surface
some<00:02:04.439> special<00:02:05.009> lining<00:02:05.460> which<00:02:05.640> gives<00:02:05.880> us<00:02:06.000> grip

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
some special lining which gives us grip

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.650 
some special lining which gives us grip
and<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.619> also<00:02:08.009> going<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.280> have<00:02:08.550> some

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
and it is also going to have some

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.780 
and it is also going to have some
splines<00:02:09.660> at<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.110> hub<00:02:10.259> so<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.069> capable<00:02:11.430> of

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
splines at the hub so it is capable of

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.600 
splines at the hub so it is capable of
routed

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
routed

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.150 
routed
with<00:02:12.850> and<00:02:13.090> sliding<00:02:13.960> along<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.260> output<00:02:14.950> shaft

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
with and sliding along the output shaft

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.490 
with and sliding along the output shaft
like<00:02:15.430> this<00:02:15.460> in<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.150> English<00:02:16.510> condition<00:02:17.080> it<00:02:17.290> is

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
like this in the English condition it is

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.260 
like this in the English condition it is
going<00:02:17.800> to<00:02:17.980> remain<00:02:18.250> pressed<00:02:18.670> against<00:02:19.210> the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
going to remain pressed against the

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.450 
going to remain pressed against the
flywheel<00:02:19.690> like<00:02:19.870> this<00:02:20.110> so<00:02:20.590> at<00:02:20.950> that<00:02:21.160> point

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
flywheel like this so at that point

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.800 
flywheel like this so at that point
there<00:02:21.730> will<00:02:21.820> be<00:02:21.850> some<00:02:22.060> contact<00:02:22.540> force

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
there will be some contact force

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.540 
there will be some contact force
there'll<00:02:23.170> be<00:02:23.230> some<00:02:23.440> frictional<00:02:23.920> force<00:02:24.220> which

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
there'll be some frictional force which

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.480 
there'll be some frictional force which
gives<00:02:24.790> rise<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.000> frictional<00:02:25.570> torque<00:02:25.900> and

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
gives rise to frictional torque and

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.040 
gives rise to frictional torque and
ultimately<00:02:27.490> the<00:02:27.730> power<00:02:27.940> gets<00:02:28.570> transferred

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
ultimately the power gets transferred

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.350 
ultimately the power gets transferred
from<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.530> flywheel<00:02:29.740> to<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.760> clutch<00:02:31.090> plate

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
from the flywheel to the clutch plate

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.680 
from the flywheel to the clutch plate
and<00:02:31.600> to<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:32.170> output<00:02:32.770> shaft<00:02:33.030> but<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.180> keep<00:02:34.450> it

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
and to the output shaft but to keep it

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.870 
and to the output shaft but to keep it
pressed<00:02:35.050> to<00:02:35.560> develop<00:02:35.980> that<00:02:36.130> contact<00:02:36.610> force

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
pressed to develop that contact force

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.020 
pressed to develop that contact force
between<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.390> two<00:02:37.540> we<00:02:38.260> need<00:02:38.470> some<00:02:38.880> agency<00:02:39.880> that

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
between the two we need some agency that

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.320 
between the two we need some agency that
exerts<00:02:40.480> pressure<00:02:41.010> between<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.280> two<00:02:42.430> so<00:02:42.790> this

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
exerts pressure between the two so this

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.810 
exerts pressure between the two so this
is<00:02:43.510> called<00:02:43.750> as<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.110> pressure<00:02:44.350> plate<00:02:44.680> it<00:02:45.640> is<00:02:45.760> a

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
is called as the pressure plate it is a

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.610 
is called as the pressure plate it is a
simple<00:02:46.180> plate<00:02:46.390> as<00:02:46.600> I<00:02:46.630> have<00:02:46.840> shown<00:02:47.020> with<00:02:47.410> some

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
simple plate as I have shown with some

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.220 
simple plate as I have shown with some
extra<00:02:48.070> studs<00:02:48.430> here<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:49.630> function<00:02:49.959> of<00:02:50.050> which

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
extra studs here the function of which

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.910 
extra studs here the function of which
I'll<00:02:50.380> come<00:02:50.560> to<00:02:50.590> later<00:02:51.239> this<00:02:52.239> plate<00:02:52.840> keeps<00:02:53.530> the

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
I'll come to later this plate keeps the

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.770 
I'll come to later this plate keeps the
clutch<00:02:54.160> plate<00:02:54.459> pressed<00:02:55.209> against<00:02:55.660> the

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
clutch plate pressed against the

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.410 
clutch plate pressed against the
flywheel<00:02:56.380> that<00:02:56.620> is<00:02:56.770> done<00:02:57.010> using<00:02:57.459> some<00:02:57.790> Springs

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
flywheel that is done using some Springs

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.050 
flywheel that is done using some Springs
so<00:02:59.080> the<00:02:59.770> pressure<00:03:00.010> plate<00:03:00.340> is<00:03:00.520> going<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:00.880> have

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
so the pressure plate is going to have

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.330 
so the pressure plate is going to have
these<00:03:01.300> Springs<00:03:01.959> which<00:03:02.620> keep<00:03:02.860> it<00:03:03.010> pressed

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
these Springs which keep it pressed

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.170 
these Springs which keep it pressed
against<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.270> clutch<00:03:04.540> plate<00:03:04.810> like<00:03:05.560> this<00:03:05.590> and

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.510 
against the clutch plate like this and
to<00:03:07.180> provide<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.930> support<00:03:08.140> to<00:03:08.410> this<00:03:09.280> whole

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
to provide the support to this whole

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.850 
to provide the support to this whole
thing<00:03:09.550> and<00:03:09.820> a<00:03:10.120> cover<00:03:10.330> there<00:03:10.930> is<00:03:11.050> a<00:03:11.080> cover<00:03:11.650> plate

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
thing and a cover there is a cover plate

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.370 
thing and a cover there is a cover plate
so<00:03:12.550> this<00:03:12.850> cover<00:03:13.060> plate<00:03:13.150> is<00:03:13.540> going<00:03:13.720> to<00:03:13.959> provide

close this box in which the clutch

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.590 
close this box in which the clutch
reside<00:03:19.690> now<00:03:20.110> in<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.190> English<00:03:21.340> position<00:03:22.120> let

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
reside now in the English position let

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.509 
reside now in the English position let
us<00:03:22.720> see<00:03:22.870> how<00:03:23.110> the<00:03:23.170> clutch<00:03:23.530> looks<00:03:23.799> the<00:03:24.280> clutch

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
us see how the clutch looks the clutch

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.320 
us see how the clutch looks the clutch
looks<00:03:24.820> like<00:03:25.030> this<00:03:25.350> here<00:03:26.350> is<00:03:26.500> our<00:03:26.799> flywheel

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
looks like this here is our flywheel

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.240 
looks like this here is our flywheel
pressed<00:03:28.330> against<00:03:28.660> that<00:03:28.870> is<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.739> clutch<00:03:29.980> plate

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
pressed against that is the clutch plate

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.820 
pressed against that is the clutch plate
that<00:03:30.880> is<00:03:30.940> done<00:03:31.299> by<00:03:31.570> this<00:03:32.320> pressure<00:03:32.590> plate

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
that is done by this pressure plate

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.490 
that is done by this pressure plate
which<00:03:33.640> in<00:03:33.850> turn<00:03:34.090> is<00:03:34.299> held<00:03:34.540> there<00:03:34.810> using<00:03:35.320> these

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
which in turn is held there using these

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.860 
which in turn is held there using these
Springs<00:03:36.010> so<00:03:37.000> power<00:03:37.299> will<00:03:37.510> be<00:03:37.600> transferred

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
Springs so power will be transferred

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.570 
Springs so power will be transferred
from<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.380> flywheel<00:03:38.860> to<00:03:38.980> the<00:03:39.100> output<00:03:39.549> shaft

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
from the flywheel to the output shaft

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.390 
from the flywheel to the output shaft
but<00:03:40.360> we<00:03:40.510> don't<00:03:40.720> want<00:03:41.019> that<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.470> happen<00:03:41.620> all<00:03:41.920> the

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
but we don't want that to happen all the

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.190 
but we don't want that to happen all the
time<00:03:42.580> sometimes<00:03:43.090> you<00:03:43.330> want<00:03:43.510> to<00:03:43.570> disengage<00:03:44.170> the

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
time sometimes you want to disengage the

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.220 
time sometimes you want to disengage the
two<00:03:44.470> so<00:03:45.190> we<00:03:45.400> should<00:03:45.610> have<00:03:45.790> some<00:03:46.060> means<00:03:46.420> of<00:03:46.720> you

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
two so we should have some means of you

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.080 
two so we should have some means of you
know<00:03:47.320> retracting<00:03:48.070> this<00:03:48.340> pressure<00:03:48.820> plate

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
know retracting this pressure plate

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.320 
know retracting this pressure plate
towards<00:03:49.810> right<00:03:50.260> and<00:03:50.980> thereby<00:03:51.340> disengage<00:03:52.209> the

is capable of sliding on the output
shaft<00:04:06.250> like<00:04:06.519> this<00:04:06.549> and<00:04:06.940> this<00:04:07.600> collar<00:04:07.930> is<00:04:08.230> a

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
shaft like this and this collar is a

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.330 
shaft like this and this collar is a
mood<00:04:09.610> using<00:04:10.450> some<00:04:10.690> kind<00:04:10.870> of<00:04:11.170> linkage<00:04:11.860> okay

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
mood using some kind of linkage okay

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.860 
mood using some kind of linkage okay
which<00:04:12.549> is<00:04:12.670> connected<00:04:13.090> to<00:04:13.120> the<00:04:13.360> clutch<00:04:13.690> pedal

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
which is connected to the clutch pedal

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.150

going to retract the pressure plate

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.270 
going to retract the pressure plate
against<00:04:29.360> the<00:04:29.539> force<00:04:29.810> of<00:04:30.080> the<00:04:30.470> springs<00:04:30.830> that<00:04:30.979> we

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
against the force of the springs that we

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.850 
against the force of the springs that we
have<00:04:31.389> so<00:04:32.389> that<00:04:32.419> is<00:04:32.630> how<00:04:32.840> you<00:04:32.900> disengage<00:04:33.740> the

in<00:04:49.639> a<00:04:49.880> cover<00:04:50.240> plate<00:04:50.560> then<00:04:51.560> for<00:04:51.919> retracting<00:04:52.520> we

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
in a cover plate then for retracting we

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.550 
in a cover plate then for retracting we
are<00:04:53.060> going<00:04:53.240> to<00:04:53.300> have<00:04:53.479> this<00:04:53.720> kind<00:04:53.990> of<00:04:54.139> linkages

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
are going to have this kind of linkages

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.339 
are going to have this kind of linkages
array<00:04:55.490> of<00:04:55.820> them<00:04:56.060> all<00:04:56.270> around<00:04:56.330> the<00:04:57.080> periphery
