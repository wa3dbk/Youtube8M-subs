00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.319 

so<00:00:20.109> now<00:00:20.259> we<00:00:20.320> move<00:00:20.500> on<00:00:20.679> to<00:00:20.800> part<00:00:21.039> 2<00:00:21.279> and<00:00:21.490> part<00:00:21.550> 2

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:22.329 
so now we move on to part 2 and part 2

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:23.819 
so now we move on to part 2 and part 2
is<00:00:22.449> where<00:00:22.599> I<00:00:22.839> want<00:00:23.050> you<00:00:23.109> to<00:00:23.199> become<00:00:23.529> a<00:00:23.560> little

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:23.829 
is where I want you to become a little

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:26.400 
is where I want you to become a little
bit<00:00:23.949> more<00:00:24.070> melodic<00:00:24.820> and<00:00:24.939> creative<00:00:25.480> but<00:00:25.720> using

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
bit more melodic and creative but using

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.189 
bit more melodic and creative but using
this<00:00:26.820> concept<00:00:27.820> or<00:00:28.090> using<00:00:28.419> this<00:00:28.539> pattern<00:00:28.840> as

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199 
this concept or using this pattern as

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.519 
this concept or using this pattern as
the<00:00:30.329> focus<00:00:31.329> point<00:00:31.599> for<00:00:31.689> the<00:00:31.840> lesson<00:00:32.199> it's

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
the focus point for the lesson it's

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:33.900 
the focus point for the lesson it's
really<00:00:32.739> important<00:00:33.190> that<00:00:33.220> when<00:00:33.460> you<00:00:33.579> work<00:00:33.730> on

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
really important that when you work on

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.759 
really important that when you work on
this<00:00:34.000> stuff<00:00:34.239> you<00:00:34.719> really<00:00:34.930> get<00:00:35.170> really<00:00:35.409> deep

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:35.769 
this stuff you really get really deep

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:38.340 
this stuff you really get really deep
into<00:00:36.220> it<00:00:36.370> in<00:00:36.579> the<00:00:36.670> kind<00:00:36.879> of<00:00:36.970> meditative<00:00:37.570> state

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
into it in the kind of meditative state

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.899 
into it in the kind of meditative state
it's<00:00:38.589> kind<00:00:38.769> of<00:00:38.829> like<00:00:38.980> a<00:00:39.010> deep<00:00:39.370> meditation

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:39.909 
it's kind of like a deep meditation

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:42.869 
it's kind of like a deep meditation
where<00:00:40.659> you<00:00:40.690> really<00:00:41.170> go<00:00:41.350> inside<00:00:41.800> and<00:00:42.129> really

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
where you really go inside and really

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:44.700 
where you really go inside and really
focus<00:00:43.269> on<00:00:43.420> what<00:00:43.570> you're<00:00:43.690> doing<00:00:43.720> and<00:00:44.170> just

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
focus on what you're doing and just

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.600 
focus on what you're doing and just
really<00:00:45.339> own<00:00:45.610> and<00:00:45.960> master<00:00:46.960> the<00:00:47.610> fundamental

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
really own and master the fundamental

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.549 
really own and master the fundamental
before<00:00:49.149> you<00:00:49.239> move<00:00:49.420> on<00:00:49.629> so<00:00:50.199> what<00:00:50.350> we're<00:00:50.470> going

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
before you move on so what we're going

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.890 
before you move on so what we're going
to<00:00:50.620> do<00:00:50.739> is<00:00:50.890> just<00:00:51.070> take<00:00:51.280> one<00:00:51.580> chord<00:00:52.269> at<00:00:52.540> a<00:00:52.570> time

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
to do is just take one chord at a time

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.570 
to do is just take one chord at a time
so<00:00:53.229> we're<00:00:53.350> going<00:00:53.439> to<00:00:53.500> start<00:00:53.799> with<00:00:53.949> the<00:00:54.070> C<00:00:54.280> -

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
so we're going to start with the C -

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.770 
so we're going to start with the C -
seven<00:00:54.939> and<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:56.680> first<00:00:56.890> thing<00:00:57.070> I<00:00:57.159> might<00:00:57.309> do

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
seven and the first thing I might do

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.509 
seven and the first thing I might do
without<00:00:58.780> any<00:00:59.080> metronome<00:00:59.619> or<00:00:59.769> anything<00:00:59.949> it's

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
without any metronome or anything it's

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:01.950 
without any metronome or anything it's
just<00:01:00.640> basically<00:01:01.119> start<00:01:01.509> from<00:01:01.570> the<00:01:01.780> lowest

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
just basically start from the lowest

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.950 
just basically start from the lowest
note<00:01:02.350> on<00:01:02.589> the<00:01:02.769> lowest<00:01:03.100> string<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:04.600> just<00:01:04.629> work

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
note on the lowest string and just work

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:13.310 
note on the lowest string and just work
my<00:01:04.989> way<00:01:05.379> up<00:01:05.409> the<00:01:05.650> thing<00:01:06.150> across<00:01:07.150> the<00:01:07.420> strings

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.920 

did<00:01:14.320> I<00:01:14.439> get<00:01:14.619> to<00:01:14.710> the<00:01:14.799> highest<00:01:15.540> approach<00:01:16.540> to

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
did I get to the highest approach to

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.960 
did I get to the highest approach to
chord<00:01:17.170> tone<00:01:17.350> on<00:01:17.530> the<00:01:17.560> highest<00:01:17.799> string<00:01:18.100> that's

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
chord tone on the highest string that's

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.819 
chord tone on the highest string that's
like<00:01:19.119> a<00:01:19.150> kind<00:01:19.450> of<00:01:19.540> linear<00:01:19.869> approach<00:01:20.170> and<00:01:20.470> then

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829 
like a kind of linear approach and then

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:22.560 
like a kind of linear approach and then
what<00:01:20.979> I<00:01:21.009> might<00:01:21.220> do<00:01:21.430> is<00:01:21.670> do<00:01:22.150> kind<00:01:22.390> of<00:01:22.450> an

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
what I might do is do kind of an

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.080 
what I might do is do kind of an
alternating<00:01:23.079> pun<00:01:23.520> descending<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.850> what<00:01:27.999> I'm

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
alternating pun descending so what I'm

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.609 
alternating pun descending so what I'm
doing<00:01:28.119> is<00:01:28.479> you<00:01:28.689> know<00:01:28.810> probably<00:01:29.140> approach<00:01:29.439> to<00:01:29.590> C

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.029 

so<00:01:35.619> I'm<00:01:35.679> approaching<00:01:36.159> the<00:01:36.479> seven<00:01:37.920> then<00:01:38.920> I'll

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
so I'm approaching the seven then I'll

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:41.399 
so I'm approaching the seven then I'll
go<00:01:39.159> down<00:01:39.189> and<00:01:39.429> approach<00:01:39.819> the<00:01:40.030> third<00:01:40.319> then<00:01:41.319> I'll

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
go down and approach the third then I'll

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.559 
go down and approach the third then I'll
go<00:01:41.560> up<00:01:41.770> and<00:01:41.920> approach<00:01:42.219> the<00:01:42.369> fifth<00:01:42.670> then<00:01:43.450> I'll

00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:43.569 
go up and approach the fifth then I'll

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:48.300 
go up and approach the fifth then I'll
go<00:01:43.719> down<00:01:43.749> and<00:01:43.960> approach<00:01:47.039> then<00:01:48.039> again<00:01:48.280> just

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
go down and approach then again just

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.030 
go down and approach then again just
repeat

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.320 

you<00:01:54.040> know<00:01:54.159> in<00:01:54.430> patterns<00:01:54.850> like<00:01:55.000> this<00:01:55.150> is<00:01:55.299> a

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
you know in patterns like this is a

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.080 
you know in patterns like this is a
really<00:01:55.540> good<00:01:55.750> way<00:01:55.930> of<00:01:56.189> practicing<00:01:57.189> sequences

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
really good way of practicing sequences

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.060 
really good way of practicing sequences
so<00:01:58.270> you<00:01:58.360> can<00:01:58.509> have<00:01:58.689> kind<00:01:58.900> of<00:01:59.020> lines<00:01:59.350> that<00:02:00.009> you

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
so you can have kind of lines that you

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.950 
so you can have kind of lines that you
can<00:02:00.250> play<00:02:00.490> in<00:02:00.670> your<00:02:00.820> solos<00:02:01.119> and<00:02:01.270> improvisation

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
can play in your solos and improvisation

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.020 
can play in your solos and improvisation
and<00:02:02.170> this<00:02:02.290> is<00:02:02.409> a<00:02:02.440> really<00:02:02.740> good<00:02:02.979> one<00:02:03.190> and<00:02:03.400> I<00:02:03.820> hear

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
and this is a really good one and I hear

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.920 
and this is a really good one and I hear
it<00:02:04.149> all<00:02:04.299> the<00:02:04.330> time

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
it all the time

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.510 
it all the time
and<00:02:05.020> I<00:02:05.350> never<00:02:05.500> really<00:02:05.860> understood<00:02:06.220> what<00:02:06.369> it

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
and I never really understood what it

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.950 
and I never really understood what it
was<00:02:06.670> until<00:02:06.909> I<00:02:07.000> started<00:02:07.060> breaking<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:07.750> stuff

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
was until I started breaking the stuff

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:19.680 
was until I started breaking the stuff
down<00:02:17.700> all<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.790> way<00:02:18.940> descending<00:02:19.480> from<00:02:19.600> the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
down all the way descending from the

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.140 
down all the way descending from the
highest<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.290> lowest<00:02:20.319> now<00:02:21.100> it<00:02:21.250> might<00:02:21.400> again

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
highest to lowest now it might again

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.699 
highest to lowest now it might again
take<00:02:22.420> you<00:02:22.540> some<00:02:22.690> time<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:22.900> work<00:02:23.140> out<00:02:23.350> but<00:02:23.590> it's

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
take you some time to work out but it's

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:33.540 
take you some time to work out but it's
really<00:02:23.860> worth<00:02:24.100> it<00:02:24.340> you<00:02:24.430> know<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:33.280> can<00:02:33.310> work

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
really worth it you know you can work

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.920 
really worth it you know you can work
out<00:02:33.700> symmetrical<00:02:34.300> patterns<00:02:34.660> so<00:02:34.870> you

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
out symmetrical patterns so you

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.580 
out symmetrical patterns so you
basically<00:02:35.170> having<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:36.900> same<00:02:37.900> position<00:02:38.350> shift

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
basically having the same position shift

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.800 
basically having the same position shift
every<00:02:38.860> time<00:02:39.100> that<00:02:39.340> just<00:02:39.489> lower<00:02:39.819> the<00:02:40.420> octave

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
every time that just lower the octave

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.350 
every time that just lower the octave
you<00:02:41.050> know<00:02:41.470> what<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:41.620> mean<00:02:41.860> so<00:02:42.430> just<00:02:42.730> experiment

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
you know what I mean so just experiment

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.479 
you know what I mean so just experiment
with<00:02:43.450> that<00:02:43.660> have<00:02:44.110> fun<00:02:44.380> with<00:02:44.560> it<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:44.860> then<00:02:45.370> what

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
with that have fun with it and then what

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.550 
with that have fun with it and then what
I<00:02:45.519> want<00:02:45.670> you<00:02:45.819> to<00:02:45.940> do<00:02:46.120> is<00:02:46.330> sustain<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.290> chord

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
I want you to do is sustain the chord

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.309 
I want you to do is sustain the chord
again<00:02:47.950> you<00:02:48.340> can<00:02:48.519> use<00:02:48.819> the<00:02:49.150> mp3<00:02:49.780> I've<00:02:49.930> given<00:02:50.200> you

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
again you can use the mp3 I've given you

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.430 
again you can use the mp3 I've given you
in<00:02:50.440> all<00:02:50.590> keys<00:02:50.890> start<00:02:51.700> with<00:02:51.819> the<00:02:51.910> C<00:02:52.090> minor<00:02:52.299> 7<00:02:52.540> put

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
in all keys start with the C minor 7 put

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.979 
in all keys start with the C minor 7 put
it<00:02:53.530> on<00:02:53.650> a<00:02:53.680> loop<00:02:54.010> or<00:02:54.400> sustain<00:02:55.329> a<00:02:55.360> chord<00:02:55.660> like<00:02:55.750> I'm

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
it on a loop or sustain a chord like I'm

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.360 
it on a loop or sustain a chord like I'm
doing<00:02:56.290> here<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.989> just<00:02:59.320> free<00:02:59.709> yourself<00:03:00.070> up<00:03:00.250> so

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
doing here and just free yourself up so

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.280 
doing here and just free yourself up so
you<00:03:00.459> can<00:03:00.579> be<00:03:00.700> more<00:03:00.850> melodic<00:03:03.810> we<00:03:04.810> might<00:03:05.019> start

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
you can be more melodic we might start

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:14.580 
you can be more melodic we might start
with<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.650> whole<00:03:06.010> range<00:03:06.250> pan

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:23.190 

understand<00:03:15.590> with<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.459> whole<00:03:16.639> Turing

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.630 

and<00:03:24.200> then<00:03:24.380> the<00:03:24.530> best<00:03:24.709> way<00:03:24.890> to<00:03:24.920> do<00:03:25.160> this<00:03:25.310> is<00:03:25.520> if

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
and then the best way to do this is if

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.760 
and then the best way to do this is if
you<00:03:25.730> put<00:03:25.940> on<00:03:26.060> some<00:03:26.239> kind<00:03:26.450> of<00:03:26.599> drum<00:03:27.170> machine<00:03:27.530> or

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
you put on some kind of drum machine or

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.160 
you put on some kind of drum machine or
metronome<00:03:28.340> and<00:03:28.910> start<00:03:29.209> at<00:03:29.360> a<00:03:29.450> very<00:03:29.480> slow<00:03:29.930> tempo

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
metronome and start at a very slow tempo

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.320 
metronome and start at a very slow tempo
just<00:03:30.770> for<00:03:31.340> a<00:03:31.400> couple<00:03:31.670> of<00:03:31.730> minutes<00:03:32.030> for<00:03:32.300> each

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
just for a couple of minutes for each

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.050 
just for a couple of minutes for each
tempo<00:03:33.020> again<00:03:33.800> you<00:03:33.920> can<00:03:34.099> use<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.459> mp3<00:03:34.940> as<00:03:35.030> a

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
tempo again you can use the mp3 as a

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.390 
tempo again you can use the mp3 as a
references<00:03:35.750> couple<00:03:36.290> of<00:03:36.349> minutes<00:03:36.590> long<00:03:36.830> you

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
references couple of minutes long you

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.589 
references couple of minutes long you
can<00:03:37.550> improvise<00:03:37.819> a<00:03:38.000> one<00:03:38.390> tempo<00:03:40.480> you<00:03:41.480> can

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
can improvise a one tempo you can

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:45.070 
can improvise a one tempo you can
improvise<00:03:41.780> a<00:03:41.959> one<00:03:42.260> tempo<00:03:43.569> make<00:03:44.569> sure<00:03:44.750> you<00:03:44.870> read

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
improvise a one tempo make sure you read

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.530 
improvise a one tempo make sure you read
fluent<00:03:45.860> and<00:03:46.010> melodic<00:03:46.459> and<00:03:46.489> able<00:03:47.120> to<00:03:47.150> play<00:03:47.420> all

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
fluent and melodic and able to play all

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.509 
fluent and melodic and able to play all
over<00:03:47.569> the<00:03:47.870> instrument<00:03:48.410> combine<00:03:49.099> scale

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
over the instrument combine scale

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.880 
over the instrument combine scale
degrees<00:03:50.349> anything<00:03:51.349> you<00:03:51.470> like

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
degrees anything you like

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.920 
degrees anything you like
along<00:03:52.190> with<00:03:52.310> these<00:03:52.519> patterns<00:03:52.819> kind<00:03:53.660> of<00:03:53.780> keep

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
along with these patterns kind of keep

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.660 
along with these patterns kind of keep
all<00:03:54.110> the<00:03:54.260> other<00:03:54.410> stuff<00:03:54.620> organic<00:03:55.040> so<00:03:55.400> it<00:03:55.489> just

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
all the other stuff organic so it just

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.309 
all the other stuff organic so it just
kind<00:03:55.850> of<00:03:55.910> basically<00:03:56.269> happens<00:03:56.690> but<00:03:56.930> just<00:03:57.140> make

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
kind of basically happens but just make

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.710 
kind of basically happens but just make
sure<00:03:57.470> that<00:03:58.130> this<00:03:58.280> is<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:58.549> focus<00:03:58.940> point<00:03:59.209> and

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
sure that this is the focus point and

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.020 
sure that this is the focus point and
again<00:04:00.080> you<00:04:00.260> know<00:04:00.410> say<00:04:01.280> for<00:04:01.430> example<00:04:01.819> if<00:04:01.910> you

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
again you know say for example if you

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.180 
again you know say for example if you
start<00:04:02.090> at<00:04:02.390> 40<00:04:02.720> beats<00:04:02.930> per<00:04:03.140> minute<00:04:03.470> you<00:04:03.950> can<00:04:04.100> do

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
start at 40 beats per minute you can do

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.180 
start at 40 beats per minute you can do
a<00:04:04.220> couple<00:04:04.459> of<00:04:04.730> minutes<00:04:05.450> at<00:04:05.840> that<00:04:06.019> tempo<00:04:06.530> if<00:04:06.980> you

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
a couple of minutes at that tempo if you

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.800 
a couple of minutes at that tempo if you
feel<00:04:07.400> like<00:04:07.640> you're<00:04:07.819> ready<00:04:08.030> and<00:04:08.269> comfortable

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
feel like you're ready and comfortable

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.620 
feel like you're ready and comfortable
then<00:04:09.290> you<00:04:09.319> could<00:04:09.560> raise<00:04:09.739> the<00:04:10.010> tempo<00:04:10.700> three<00:04:11.540> to

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
then you could raise the tempo three to

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.839 
then you could raise the tempo three to
five<00:04:11.840> degrees<00:04:12.290> and<00:04:12.319> repeat<00:04:12.650> and<00:04:13.280> keep<00:04:13.640> going

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
five degrees and repeat and keep going

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.000 
five degrees and repeat and keep going
until<00:04:14.120> you<00:04:14.390> reach<00:04:14.540> a<00:04:14.870> really<00:04:15.290> challenging

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
until you reach a really challenging

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.610 
until you reach a really challenging
target<00:04:16.970> tempo<00:04:17.389> now<00:04:17.959> again<00:04:18.260> it's<00:04:18.440> really

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
target tempo now again it's really

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.890 
target tempo now again it's really
important<00:04:19.190> and<00:04:19.669> it's<00:04:19.880> up<00:04:20.030> to<00:04:20.060> you<00:04:20.329> you<00:04:20.660> know

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
important and it's up to you you know

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.390 
important and it's up to you you know
don't<00:04:21.139> be<00:04:21.200> in<00:04:21.350> such<00:04:21.380> a<00:04:21.560> hurry<00:04:21.680> to<00:04:21.889> move<00:04:22.160> on

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
don't be in such a hurry to move on

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.159 
don't be in such a hurry to move on
until<00:04:23.120> you've<00:04:23.300> mastered<00:04:23.540> what<00:04:24.050> you're

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
until you've mastered what you're

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:25.330 
until you've mastered what you're
working<00:04:24.560> on<00:04:24.680> this<00:04:24.800> gonna<00:04:24.979> be<00:04:25.160> really

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
working on this gonna be really

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.540 
working on this gonna be really
beneficial<00:04:25.580> for<00:04:26.090> you<00:04:26.180> down<00:04:26.390> the<00:04:26.539> line<00:04:26.720> and<00:04:27.550> you

beneficial for you down the line and you
know<00:04:28.669> I<00:04:28.910> really<00:04:29.330> don't<00:04:29.539> like<00:04:29.750> it<00:04:29.960> and<00:04:30.110> I<00:04:30.530> used

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
know I really don't like it and I used

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.560 
know I really don't like it and I used
to<00:04:30.919> be<00:04:31.039> a<00:04:31.070> to<00:04:31.550> do<00:04:31.669> this<00:04:31.820> all<00:04:31.970> the<00:04:32.000> time<00:04:32.090> you<00:04:32.479> know

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
to be a to do this all the time you know

to be a to do this all the time you know
and<00:04:32.600> I<00:04:32.750> practice<00:04:33.260> I'll<00:04:34.220> be<00:04:34.340> so<00:04:34.610> anxious<00:04:35.150> to

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
and I practice I'll be so anxious to

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.360 
and I practice I'll be so anxious to
move<00:04:35.780> on<00:04:35.960> and<00:04:36.080> be<00:04:36.229> so<00:04:36.530> great<00:04:36.919> that<00:04:36.950> I<00:04:37.190> would

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
move on and be so great that I would

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.210 
move on and be so great that I would
just<00:04:37.550> not<00:04:38.270> give<00:04:39.080> the<00:04:39.260> lesson<00:04:39.470> the<00:04:39.650> respect<00:04:40.100> it

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
just not give the lesson the respect it

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.120 
just not give the lesson the respect it
deserved<00:04:40.580> kind<00:04:41.419> of<00:04:41.510> skate<00:04:41.810> through<00:04:42.110> it<00:04:42.289> move
