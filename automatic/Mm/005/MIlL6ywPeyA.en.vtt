00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.779
 Hail salve, people showed the tip. 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.330
 of the Saturn sega that she needs to 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.170
 you a brand new cable means not 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.260
 take a so new so high car 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.869
 definition of our sega saturn saab and the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:26.910
 which was invented in 1994 by 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:29.939
 sega and they made this cable that car 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.489
 here in brazil it almost does not exist 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.230
 very few people have this cable and 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.590
 I have the privilege to show you 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.980
 this cable called rgb scart the car 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.960
 saturn sega high definition that without 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.989
 delongas will present is precisely 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.989
 this one has many pins 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.969
 he has many thorns and you can you 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.390
 you can see that it has a good format 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.640
 different format here is the format 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.960
 it's like a component video 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.950
 by the way is the standard component video in 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.740
 Europe 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:15.509
 in case our component video here is 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:18.530
 that rule in blue rgb and this one is 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:23.610
 quite different here transfers so much 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:28.350
 It's both image and sound you can even 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:36.450
 that the numbering of the numbering 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:41.729
 that we can see 18 pins while 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:45.180
 that no rg be prb is normal only has 3 three 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:49.970
 pins in 33 cases we also noticed that 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.439
 the entry pilots is much more than 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.520
 much more than the entrance to the entrances 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.469
 pins of the audio and video cable 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.159
 here already enters all the holes that 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:05.009
 There are Sega Saturn's Christmas 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:09.629
 then that's it I want to show 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:13.739
 You to all the whole this quality. 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:17.280
 he has and no waves start 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:20.610
 install here and just to remind this rgb 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.840
 skateboard like how the tv is not western 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.480
 european 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:30.330
 so it's the following I had to buy 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:34.200
 a rgb converter scart to adm and it 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:38.790
 converts to 1080p in 1080p picture 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:43.620
 the definition is defined and without 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:46.319
 Later on, I'm going to present that the 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.160
 right definition of it is already 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:54.930
 set to 1080p is a device that 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:57.629
 it is already set to 1080p 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.590
 resolution taques card for debbie no 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.870
 does not leave 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.840
 ready then without delay they will present 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:09.060
 here for you and my 42 screen 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:12.230
 inches per 120 traces of frequency 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.090
 image or the movement is 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.970
 perfect is perfect the movement 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.310
 of objects in 3d and not in it 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.430
 definition then let's go and introduce 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.400
 first the normal car version 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.620
 the audio and video car here with you 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.110
 can see this is the audio and video cable 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.950
 of the site this group here you can 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:38.190
 realize that there are only three pins 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.870
 split the other audio and other stereo 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.780
 I do not know the video or I know which one. 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.129
 stereo is more the standard that everyone 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.790
 use sega saturn 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:50.849
 so I'll start showing the show the 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.610
 evolution of it than the resolution of the 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:56.430
 of this audio cable via 240p 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.950
 is a very small resolution for 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.280
 a 42-inch TV itself to 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:05.790
 tvs crt as tvs by xuxa is best known 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.860
 with tubes to tube tubes save salve 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.019
 the tube tvs and then sit where 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.060
 The boy begins the accounts I said that without 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:13.650
 We'll have more time and we'll send it now. 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.889
 Definitely without further ado. 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.560
 start to show this joÃ§a that is 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:22.770
 This is it. 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.580
 sag saturn to 1080p picture on tv 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.970
 42 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:33.900
 carlos at 120 raps well I'll show you 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:37.650
 You now how is he at 240p as well? 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:40.319
 resolution of asking for an image of the 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:44.629
 audio and video cable of the blind atom 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:44.629
 the definition sucks 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:51.710
 so it sucks the image of the audio and 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.689
 video defense cedar 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.680
 Good people, I'll show you first. 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:58.919
 you 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.000
 audio cable image and video 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.550
 sega saturn 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.710
 you will see that quality is a 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.419
 filth 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.870
 you can see the definition of the lines 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:11.280
 How are they not good? 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:18.900
 show the origin here looks only at 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:21.719
 resolution of the tree our friend jack 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:25.710
 Look how the lines are. 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:28.529
 You can see the ghosts in the 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:31.830
 lines at the edges of the lines you can 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:35.340
 realize if the ghost there is ok then 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:40.849
 show me now how it's going to be 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.849
 Same thing an image I'll freeze to 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:51.360
 1080p in the blind series and look how it looks 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.580
 our image to 1080p image poxa 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.980
 life 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:06:03.750
 look how it looks 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:03.750
 super party in 1080p image supper brain 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:12.910
 the lines well resolved the colors well 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:16.060
 more defined things here on this tv 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:18.940
 from 42 inches to 120 image subtraction 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:22.360
 they are very strong here live from 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:26.260
 camera does not close a tint of 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:31.900
 color or very precise but you can 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:35.650
 realize that how you are doing very well 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:38.770
 although there are those 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.660
 here I am sending with 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:44.950
 32-bit videogame nÃ© 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:47.860
 but it's about image resolution 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:55.360
 he is practically perfect 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:57.070
 indeed it is perfectly perfect then 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:02.770
 how about we have a bunch that 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:05.440
 now be in the part where just to 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:08.230
 relax a little I want to win

 gave some balls to zero 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:18.810
 I will hit him if he catches

 Be happy and the drive is 

00:07:29.229 --> 00:07:36.189
 perfect for average gimme until it's until 

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.530
 better than those arcades that the 

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:41.020
 People see there in the malls out there. 

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:44.020
