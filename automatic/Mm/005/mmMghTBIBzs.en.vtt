stick<00:00:32.399> work<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.790> pretty<00:00:33.000> bleak<00:00:33.270> on<00:00:33.450> this<00:00:33.660> play

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
stick work is pretty bleak on this play

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.200 
stick work is pretty bleak on this play
gave<00:00:34.829> up<00:00:35.070> pretty<00:00:35.370> much<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.700> should<00:00:35.910> have<00:00:36.000> scored

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
gave up pretty much I should have scored

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.200 
gave up pretty much I should have scored
a<00:00:36.300> touchdown<00:00:37.010> but<00:00:38.010> our<00:00:38.190> margin<00:00:38.790> see<00:00:39.000> we're

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
a touchdown but our margin see we're

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.970 
a touchdown but our margin see we're
doing<00:00:39.239> pretty<00:00:39.690> good<00:00:39.930> picking<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.440> deep<00:00:40.649> are

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
doing pretty good picking the deep are

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.760 
doing pretty good picking the deep are
taking<00:00:41.940> what<00:00:42.090> they<00:00:42.210> give<00:00:42.420> us<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.620> good

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
taking what they give us so it's a good

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.520 
taking what they give us so it's a good
start<00:00:44.600> kind<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.719> fearful<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.260> red<00:00:46.500> zone

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
start kind of fearful of the red zone

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.069 
start kind of fearful of the red zone
because<00:00:47.219> it's<00:00:47.910> when<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.210> field<00:00:48.450> shrinks<00:00:48.899> down

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
because it's when the field shrinks down

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.060 
because it's when the field shrinks down
and<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.440> defense<00:00:49.980> it's<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.460> lot<00:00:50.610> tougher<00:00:50.879> and

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
and that defense it's a lot tougher and

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.860 
and that defense it's a lot tougher and
as<00:00:53.070> you'll<00:00:53.399> see<00:00:53.610> here<00:00:53.879> we<00:00:54.090> have<00:00:54.120> our<00:00:54.300> troubles

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
as you'll see here we have our troubles

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.340 
as you'll see here we have our troubles
in<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.620> red<00:00:55.800> zone<00:00:55.829> tobago<00:00:56.840> would<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.020> see<00:00:58.230> how

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
in the red zone tobago would you see how

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.920 
in the red zone tobago would you see how
come<00:00:58.710> an<00:00:59.340> inch<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.789> it<00:01:01.579> but<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:03.000> know<00:01:03.239> he's<00:01:03.719> in

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
come an inch of it but you know he's in

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.859 
come an inch of it but you know he's in
the<00:01:03.989> old<00:01:04.199> man<00:01:04.470> 11<00:01:04.799> tendencies<00:01:05.630> making<00:01:06.630> errors

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
the old man 11 tendencies making errors

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.580 
the old man 11 tendencies making errors
so<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:08.220> hold<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.610> 23<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.450> his<00:01:10.080> deepest

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
so you hold this 23 and his deepest

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.010 
so you hold this 23 and his deepest
should<00:01:10.740> be<00:01:10.830> feeling<00:01:11.100> pretty<00:01:11.220> good<00:01:11.840> all<00:01:12.840> right

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
should be feeling pretty good all right

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.609 
should be feeling pretty good all right

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
ground

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.420 
ground
and<00:01:50.759> he's<00:01:51.119> basically<00:01:51.750> creating<00:01:52.259> our<00:01:52.380> deeds<00:01:52.649> it

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
and he's basically creating our deeds it

and he's basically creating our deeds it
goes<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.850> play<00:01:54.149> action<00:01:54.560> when<00:01:55.560> I'm<00:01:55.680> expecting

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
goes to a play action when I'm expecting

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.429 
goes to a play action when I'm expecting
run<00:01:56.520> which<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.909> great<00:01:57.180> idea<00:01:57.329> but<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.320> only

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
run which is a great idea but the only

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.039 
run which is a great idea but the only
problem<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:59.009> he's<00:01:59.430> rolling<00:01:59.939> out<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.420> he<00:02:00.810> get

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
problem is he's rolling out and he get
