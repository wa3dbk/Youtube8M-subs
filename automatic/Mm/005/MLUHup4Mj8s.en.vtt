00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.259 

in<00:00:05.009> my<00:00:05.660> Kindle<00:00:06.660> book<00:00:06.870> on<00:00:07.049> how<00:00:07.529> to<00:00:07.589> make<00:00:07.890> videos

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:08.269 
in my Kindle book on how to make videos

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.080 
in my Kindle book on how to make videos
with<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.360> DSLR<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:10.460> talked<00:00:11.460> about<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.759> couple<00:00:11.880> of

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
with the DSLR I talked about a couple of

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.240 
with the DSLR I talked about a couple of
useful<00:00:12.240> accessories<00:00:12.960> one<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.710> them<00:00:13.860> is<00:00:14.099> the

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
useful accessories one of them is the

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.849 
useful accessories one of them is the
video<00:00:14.490> which<00:00:14.730> was<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.450> tripod<00:00:16.410> which<00:00:16.590> can't

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
video which was the tripod which can't

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.130 
video which was the tripod which can't
really<00:00:17.190> do<00:00:17.400> without<00:00:17.520> but<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.300> next<00:00:18.630> accessory

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
really do without but the next accessory

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.859 
really do without but the next accessory
that<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:20.160> find<00:00:20.460> most<00:00:20.609> useful<00:00:21.090> is<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.420> loop<00:00:21.630> and

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
that I find most useful is the loop and

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.080 
that I find most useful is the loop and
I<00:00:22.289> thought<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.500> would<00:00:22.650> make<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.460> video<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.789> go

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
I thought I would make the video to go

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.670 
I thought I would make the video to go
with<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.600> book<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.109> people<00:00:25.350> can<00:00:25.500> see

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
with the book so that people can see

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.980 
with the book so that people can see
exactly<00:00:26.189> how<00:00:26.460> useful<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.090> now<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.750> worst

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
exactly how useful it is now the worst

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.370 
exactly how useful it is now the worst
thing<00:00:28.349> about<00:00:28.500> using<00:00:29.010> this<00:00:29.160> DSLR<00:00:30.170> this<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.289> the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
thing about using this DSLR this is the

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.770 
thing about using this DSLR this is the
canon<00:00:31.679> 600d<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.520> worst<00:00:32.730> thing<00:00:33.059> about<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.450> is

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
canon 600d the worst thing about it is

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.870 
canon 600d the worst thing about it is
when<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.320> make<00:00:34.350> video<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.860> have<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.250> use<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
when you make video you have to use the

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.150 
when you make video you have to use the
back<00:00:36.030> screen<00:00:36.530> so<00:00:37.530> obviously<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.860> can<00:00:37.950> have<00:00:38.040> it

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
back screen so obviously you can have it

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.709 
back screen so obviously you can have it
on<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.280> tripod<00:00:38.520> but<00:00:39.030> it's<00:00:39.149> got<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.300> lot<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.450> glare

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
on a tripod but it's got a lot of glare

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.290 
on a tripod but it's got a lot of glare
on<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.350> it's<00:00:40.680> very<00:00:41.010> very<00:00:41.250> difficult<00:00:41.579> to

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
on it and it's very very difficult to

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.299 
on it and it's very very difficult to
focus<00:00:42.480> at<00:00:42.930> least<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.290> find<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.770> very<00:00:43.950> difficult

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
focus at least I find it very difficult

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.270 
focus at least I find it very difficult
if<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.210> use<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.510> autofocus<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.379> one<00:00:46.559> thing<00:00:46.860> if

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
if you use the autofocus is one thing if

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.069 
if you use the autofocus is one thing if
you<00:00:47.489> use<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.820> on<00:00:47.879> manual<00:00:48.390> focus<00:00:48.420> it's<00:00:49.020> an

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
you use it on manual focus it's an

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.660 
you use it on manual focus it's an
absolute<00:00:49.500> nightmare<00:00:49.680> because<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.219> can't<00:00:50.460> see

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
absolute nightmare because you can't see

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.860 
absolute nightmare because you can't see
the<00:00:50.789> picture<00:00:51.120> really<00:00:51.270> well<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.600> keep<00:00:51.780> getting

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
the picture really well you keep getting

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.290 
the picture really well you keep getting
shadows<00:00:52.440> like<00:00:53.280> on<00:00:53.460> here<00:00:53.640> now<00:00:53.820> I'm<00:00:53.969> looking<00:00:54.239> at

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
shadows like on here now I'm looking at

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.610 
shadows like on here now I'm looking at
it<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.480> can<00:00:54.539> see<00:00:54.660> reflection<00:00:55.260> on<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.410> trees

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
it I can see reflection on the trees

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.459 
it I can see reflection on the trees
behind<00:00:56.070> me<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.399> all<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.640> kind<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:56.910> thing<00:00:57.469> so

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
behind me and all that kind of thing so

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.950 
behind me and all that kind of thing so
this<00:00:58.680> loop<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.280> one<00:00:59.489> was<00:00:59.699> about<00:01:00.420> 20<00:01:00.780> pounds

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
this loop this one was about 20 pounds

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.009 
this loop this one was about 20 pounds
on<00:01:01.289> Amazon<00:01:01.949> literally<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:03.390> put<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.660> on<00:01:03.780> there

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
on Amazon literally you put it on there

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.950 
on Amazon literally you put it on there
holds<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:04.559> magnetically<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.670> then<00:01:06.420> when<00:01:06.840> you

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
holds on magnetically and then when you

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.620 
holds on magnetically and then when you
go<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.700> make<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.850> video<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.210> can<00:01:09.510> actually

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
go to make the video you can actually

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.899 
go to make the video you can actually
put<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.260> manual<00:01:10.619> focus<00:01:10.860> which<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.490> rid<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.850> a

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
put it on manual focus which is rid of a

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.940 
put it on manual focus which is rid of a
revelation<00:01:12.270> because<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.840> means<00:01:12.990> manual<00:01:13.500> focus

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
revelation because it means manual focus

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.100 
revelation because it means manual focus
is<00:01:14.310> then<00:01:14.820> nice<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.390> easy<00:01:15.540> you've<00:01:15.750> got<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.930> good

clear picture and you can actually a

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.630 
clear picture and you can actually a
manual<00:01:18.390> focus<00:01:18.810> which<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.650> brilliant<00:01:19.830> plus<00:01:20.490> you

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
manual focus which is brilliant plus you

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.190 
manual focus which is brilliant plus you
don't<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:20.909> any<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.270> hassle<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.750> trying
