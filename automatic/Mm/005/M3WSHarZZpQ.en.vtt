00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.479 
so you can see you can mount this plate
onto<00:03:42.519> a<00:03:42.880> surface<00:03:45.420> as<00:03:46.420> you<00:03:46.540> can<00:03:46.690> see<00:03:46.870> here<00:03:47.140> and

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
onto a surface as you can see here and

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:53.940 
onto a surface as you can see here and
then<00:03:48.489> you<00:03:48.609> can<00:03:48.760> screw<00:03:49.209> the<00:03:50.140> panel<00:03:50.500> into<00:03:52.950> the

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
then you can screw the panel into the

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.170 
then you can screw the panel into the
surface<00:03:54.220> now<00:03:54.310> you<00:03:54.370> can<00:03:54.549> see<00:03:54.670> this<00:03:54.760> is<00:03:54.880> upside

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
surface now you can see this is upside

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.520 
surface now you can see this is upside
down<00:03:55.209> at<00:03:55.510> the<00:03:55.570> moment<00:03:55.870> but<00:03:55.930> you<00:03:55.989> can<00:03:56.140> simply

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
down at the moment but you can simply

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.440 
down at the moment but you can simply
turn<00:03:56.769> these<00:03:57.010> around<00:03:57.040> so<00:03:57.549> that's<00:03:58.000> a<00:03:58.060> great

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
turn these around so that's a great

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.330 
turn these around so that's a great
little<00:03:59.140> design<00:03:59.290> if<00:03:59.650> you<00:03:59.739> don't<00:03:59.920> want<00:04:00.069> to<00:04:00.160> flush

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
little design if you don't want to flush

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.009 
little design if you don't want to flush
mount<00:04:00.519> it<00:04:00.730> but<00:04:00.850> you<00:04:00.940> still<00:04:01.209> want<00:04:01.450> to<00:04:01.510> have<00:04:01.720> the
