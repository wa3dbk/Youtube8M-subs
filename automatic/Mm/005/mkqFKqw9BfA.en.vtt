well<00:03:09.650> anyway<00:03:10.010> using<00:03:10.340> two<00:03:10.670> players<00:03:11.000> is<00:03:11.330> much

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
well anyway using two players is much

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.800 
well anyway using two players is much
easier<00:03:12.049> but<00:03:12.349> it's<00:03:12.470> still<00:03:12.769> a<00:03:12.829> hard<00:03:13.130> game

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
easier but it's still a hard game

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.089 
easier but it's still a hard game
there's<00:03:14.810> so<00:03:15.079> many<00:03:15.230> enemies<00:03:15.680> on<00:03:15.829> the<00:03:15.950> screen

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
there's so many enemies on the screen

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.220 
there's so many enemies on the screen
and<00:03:16.489> sometimes<00:03:17.060> it<00:03:17.239> just<00:03:17.390> gets<00:03:17.569> ridiculous

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
and sometimes it just gets ridiculous

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.470 
and sometimes it just gets ridiculous
and<00:03:18.590> all<00:03:19.099> the<00:03:19.220> characters<00:03:19.760> start<00:03:20.060> to<00:03:20.209> blink

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
and all the characters start to blink

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.360 
and all the characters start to blink
making<00:03:21.079> it<00:03:21.170> hard<00:03:21.380> to<00:03:21.440> see<00:03:21.709> what<00:03:21.860> you're<00:03:22.010> doing

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
making it hard to see what you're doing

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.729 
making it hard to see what you're doing
and<00:03:22.940> obviously<00:03:23.120> this<00:03:23.660> is<00:03:23.810> an<00:03:23.930> old<00:03:24.110> video<00:03:24.349> game

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
and obviously this is an old video game

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.319 
and obviously this is an old video game
flaw<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:25.340> it's<00:03:25.459> common<00:03:25.880> when<00:03:26.030> there's<00:03:26.180> so

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
flaw and it's common when there's so

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.250 
flaw and it's common when there's so
much<00:03:26.480> shit<00:03:26.750> on<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:26.989> screen<00:03:28.780> so<00:03:29.780> even<00:03:30.079> though

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
much shit on the screen so even though

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.199 
much shit on the screen so even though
you<00:03:30.319> never<00:03:30.620> get<00:03:30.980> another<00:03:31.250> life<00:03:31.549> the<00:03:32.000> game

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
you never get another life the game

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.360 
you never get another life the game

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
designers at least had the courtesy to

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.160 
designers at least had the courtesy to
refill<00:03:34.940> your<00:03:35.120> energy<00:03:35.540> after<00:03:35.870> you<00:03:35.989> beat<00:03:36.140> a
