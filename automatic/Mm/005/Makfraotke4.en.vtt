familiar with his work I skip the

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.230 
familiar with his work I skip the
divergent<00:03:01.250> series<00:03:01.310> but<00:03:01.820> that's<00:03:02.000> like<00:03:02.150> the

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
divergent series but that's like the

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.460 
divergent series but that's like the
biggest<00:03:02.570> thing<00:03:02.630> that<00:03:02.720> he's<00:03:02.900> been<00:03:03.050> a<00:03:03.080> part<00:03:03.350> of

he the last big thing was insurgent I

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.030 
he the last big thing was insurgent I
think<00:03:06.230> we'll<00:03:06.350> actually<00:03:06.500> be<00:03:06.680> getting<00:03:06.830> our

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
think we'll actually be getting our

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.980 
think we'll actually be getting our
first<00:03:07.280> proper<00:03:07.820> season<00:03:08.270> 2<00:03:08.420> trailer<00:03:08.600> in<00:03:08.959> the

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
first proper season 2 trailer in the

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.500 
first proper season 2 trailer in the
next<00:03:09.320> week<00:03:09.560> or<00:03:09.740> two<00:03:09.920> maybe<00:03:10.459> three<00:03:10.820> weeks<00:03:10.850> it'll

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
next week or two maybe three weeks it'll

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.449 
next week or two maybe three weeks it'll
either<00:03:11.750> premiere<00:03:12.410> whenever<00:03:13.010> they<00:03:13.160> do<00:03:13.220> their

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
either premiere whenever they do their

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.850 
either premiere whenever they do their
TCA<00:03:13.880> panel<00:03:14.390> or<00:03:14.690> it'll<00:03:15.260> be<00:03:15.380> whenever<00:03:15.620> they

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
TCA panel or it'll be whenever they

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.920 
TCA panel or it'll be whenever they
premiere<00:03:16.220> vixen<00:03:16.670> logically<00:03:17.570> I<00:03:17.600> think<00:03:17.840> it'd

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
premiere vixen logically I think it'd

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.449 
premiere vixen logically I think it'd
make<00:03:18.200> more<00:03:18.380> sense<00:03:18.650> for<00:03:18.769> them<00:03:18.950> to<00:03:19.070> use<00:03:19.220> it<00:03:19.340> to

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
make more sense for them to use it to

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:20.770 
make more sense for them to use it to
promote<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:19.880> vixen<00:03:20.239> premiere<00:03:20.510> because<00:03:20.630> I

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
promote the vixen premiere because I

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:21.970 
promote the vixen premiere because I
think<00:03:21.050> there's<00:03:21.200> still<00:03:21.320> a<00:03:21.470> lot<00:03:21.560> of<00:03:21.590> people<00:03:21.709> that

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
think there's still a lot of people that

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.710 
think there's still a lot of people that
don't<00:03:22.100> know<00:03:22.250> about<00:03:22.280> that<00:03:22.580> show<00:03:22.850> but<00:03:23.630> they

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
don't know about that show but they

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.150 
don't know about that show but they
might<00:03:23.900> have<00:03:23.930> enough<00:03:24.290> time<00:03:24.530> to<00:03:24.680> shoot<00:03:24.950> some

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
might have enough time to shoot some

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.680 
might have enough time to shoot some
scenes<00:03:25.190> with<00:03:25.640> him<00:03:25.760> to<00:03:25.910> get<00:03:26.030> into<00:03:26.209> that<00:03:26.300> trailer

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
scenes with him to get into that trailer

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.360 
scenes with him to get into that trailer
so<00:03:26.900> we<00:03:26.989> can<00:03:27.110> actually<00:03:27.230> see<00:03:27.560> Wally<00:03:27.890> West<00:03:28.190> on

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
so we can actually see Wally West on

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.280 
so we can actually see Wally West on
screen<00:03:28.760> because<00:03:29.570> if<00:03:29.690> there's<00:03:29.840> anything<00:03:30.110> that

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
screen because if there's anything that

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.330 
screen because if there's anything that
they<00:03:30.500> could<00:03:30.650> put<00:03:30.800> in<00:03:30.890> that<00:03:31.010> trailer<00:03:31.220> that

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
they could put in that trailer that

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.890 
they could put in that trailer that
would<00:03:31.550> make<00:03:31.700> people<00:03:31.970> crap<00:03:32.300> their<00:03:32.510> pants<00:03:32.750> with

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
would be to bring him on the show and he

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.690 
would be to bring him on the show and he
already<00:04:44.690> has<00:04:45.140> powers<00:04:45.620> there's<00:04:46.340> something

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
on Netflix usually that happens a little

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.050 
on Netflix usually that happens a little
bit<00:05:26.960> after<00:05:27.440> the<00:05:27.470> DVD<00:05:28.070> comes<00:05:28.340> out<00:05:28.520> like<00:05:28.910> they

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
bit after the DVD comes out like they

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.030 
bit after the DVD comes out like they
don't<00:05:29.360> want<00:05:29.480> to<00:05:29.570> dilute<00:05:29.870> DVD<00:05:30.470> sales<00:05:30.740> by

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
don't want to dilute DVD sales by

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.590 
don't want to dilute DVD sales by
releasing<00:05:31.460> the<00:05:31.640> episodes<00:05:32.000> for<00:05:32.240> free<00:05:32.450> on

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
releasing the episodes for free on

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.970 
releasing the episodes for free on
Netflix<00:05:33.020> or<00:05:33.230> oh<00:05:33.260> you<00:05:33.380> know<00:05:33.560> technically<00:05:33.920> it's

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
Netflix or oh you know technically it's

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.250 
Netflix or oh you know technically it's
not<00:05:34.130> free<00:05:34.490> but<00:05:35.150> I<00:05:35.180> believe<00:05:35.510> the<00:05:35.660> DVD<00:05:36.140> is

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 
not free but I believe the DVD is

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.500 
not free but I believe the DVD is
dropping<00:05:36.680> sometime<00:05:37.250> in<00:05:37.460> September<00:05:37.730> so<00:05:38.330> that's

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
dropping sometime in September so that's

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.970 
dropping sometime in September so that's
probably<00:05:38.720> when<00:05:38.990> Netflix<00:05:39.200> is<00:05:39.530> gonna<00:05:39.710> get<00:05:39.860> all

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:39.980

probably when Netflix is gonna get all
the<00:05:40.100> episodes<00:05:40.480> next<00:05:41.480> week<00:05:41.600> is<00:05:41.720> going<00:05:41.900> to<00:05:41.960> be
