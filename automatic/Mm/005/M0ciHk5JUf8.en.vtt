 where is my 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.330
 good evening 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.210
 so you could not help but notice the incredible competitors 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.220
 that I have in my hands 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.460

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.600
 huge predicts a big normal so 24 carats 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.180
 and then say 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.620
 everything that makes this tare 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.190
 ask yourself magnitude 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.540
 of human genius on this possibility 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.750
 and then to put to the end since it would be necessary to appear 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.200
 since this absolute potter

 who was the owner of vox amps at the time 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.810
 which explains the extreme resemblance with her vox amps except that there 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.770
 it's hard 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.220
 england ferrand 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.220
 with loans for authentic housing 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.500
 with a credible drill 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.390
 which also explains 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.380
 to scare some people a lot 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.060
 but beat son listen 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.290
 he would understand quickly enough that eventually 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.290
 he did not necessarily need this agreement 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.970
 so it's called fishing 30 countries 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.090
 country m and yet optimistic 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.590
 it's a replica of a model from the mid-sixties 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.749
 and so we find lacroix Devil tremolos vibrato of that time 

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:13.989
 this publication in the end the little touches and then 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.799

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.299
 one moment 

00:02:47.699 --> 00:03:01.899
