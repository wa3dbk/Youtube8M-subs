00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 then they surely have the mold of 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.390
 the base shirts that I already gave them with 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.080
 all his progressions then of the 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.260
 workshop 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.690
 today I chose the size 2 or the size you 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.400
 You can do the one you have at home 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.529
 yes because I left the projection so much 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.330
 of children as adults so you 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.420
 have jumps in your house to perform 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.760
 this shirt then this is a m 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.849
 I repeat again or two like you 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.099
 can see the backside yes and the front 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.230
 has the same shoulder and shoulder drop 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.649
 in this case it has a length of 70 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.079
 double width and an obvious double cloth 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.110
 and it's folded to the middle of 25 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.629
 centimeters would be 50 the good width is 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.170
 a shirt just a shirt but 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.570
 here we go to the forward if he once decides 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.120
 15 centimeters and here with a small 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.399
 one centimeter inlet to make 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.010
 that neckline that I 'm going to show you now 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.710
 how is it left in terms of the manga they have 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.829
 a sleeve 24 centimeters wide common 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.080
 for 23 d 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.730
 that is 24 long by 23 wide 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.190
 excuse me 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.260
 common manga this is here with a 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.270
 dotted line is because this little piquito 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.880
 remember the hem gives us the 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.680
 capacity of fabrics when it was if we go 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:22.320
 to work if it's not difficult but it has 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.570
 several steps then good attentive well 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.580
 we achieve this at home you 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.410
 agree that is what I did in this 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.290
 case let's work with pieces of 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:34.380
 fabric if this one we could say that it is a 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.930
 kart that's if we're going to cut out if 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.960
 test if we get this job the same 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.000
 cut the exact measurement then now 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.810
 we do some that we have this way 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.210
 let's fold in half and again 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.450
 this neckline instead of half because there 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.060
 we will conduct a picket and more 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.390
 ahead, you will see what this 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:01.920
 picket if this was not taken or the 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.870
 neckline in the middle and there we made 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.240
 this picket 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.720
 as the work goes on we're going to have to 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:15.570
 cut out two rectangles of 12 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:18.090
 centimeters long by 7 wide to 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:22.140
 We bend these rectangles 2 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.330
 we fold in half we put them like this and 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.120
 now let's make a cut or a 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.670
 piquitos and a quarter diagonally of a 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.010
 centimeter let's go in a centimeter 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.890
 nothing more there 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.950
 once we did this we're going to 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.550
 do let's superimpose a centimeter 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.590
 nothing else 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:48.590
 so one of another yes we superimpose one of 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.930
 another one centimeter and there we carry this 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.890
 in this order we place it right with 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.050
 right there if in that centimeter that 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.930
 we had left at the entrance to the neckline 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.240
 there we made a straight seam but 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.330
 listen well in these where I am here 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.990
 listen well this is going to leave a 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.110
 sewing free centimeter now I'll 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.900
 placed a pin 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.810
 and I explain, let's leave this 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.970
 centimeter free we begin to sew a 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.640
 straight seam and again one centimeter 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.910
 free with berth from here to here and 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.430
 now I show you how we are staying 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.210
 once we did this I already carlos 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.410
 I have in a thread you found 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.960
 and there you can see 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.930
 once we do that we 're going to 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:40.080
 make some cuts in angles yes but no 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:43.290
 to the strips to the rectangles but to the 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.170
 gender then I get comfortable and 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:51.200
 you can see we cut like this until 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:55.340
 get to the seam there and we stop 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:58.340
 if we go again with the other end 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.340
 we cut 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.080
 yes 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:08.720
 without touching the seam made of this 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.750
 way once we did that remember 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.790
 cuts in angles to the genre so 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.970
 let's do let's continue the 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.630
 sewing yes but from highest to lowest we go 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.320
 upside down 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.960
 so I show you we continue we put this 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.290
 shiver like that up and then there 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.990
 there not to confuse we are going to sew them 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:33.140
 from major to minor and we are going to retire 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.850
 just in the picket we do is 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.120
 that's why piquito serves us 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:41.660
 piquete of the half of the neckline we met 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.810
 I put a pin here if a seam 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.300
 Straight they follow you do not worry 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.239
 segÃ³ is not very clear about everything 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:55.020
 in the data bank 

00:04:50.239 --> 00:04:59.339
 then to this we met more than 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:02.089
 minor if then the right is already going 

00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:05.729
 to stay as you can see 

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:07.559
 that way do not worry I now 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:09.330
 I show you a more advanced step see how 

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:12.689
 we will be our good way 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:15.239
 now we are going to spend more advanced and 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:18.659
 it will be like this 

00:05:15.239 --> 00:05:22.349
 then we cut the surplus if of the 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:24.959
 strips not there is a centimeter like 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:27.179
 continue the work we are going to cut 

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:28.559
 hexagon type is not exactly a 

00:05:27.179 --> 00:05:31.139
 hexagon when they have the three sides 

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:33.269
 same but we cut this are the 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.129
 measures in the production bank but 

00:05:33.269 --> 00:05:39.389
 in case they want to write it down they have 11 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:44.149
 centimeters wide 8 high and 7 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:47.009
 base we fold in half yes and we sew 

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:49.169
 just for that seam made of this 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:52.199
 super way we put 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:54.599
 and there we sew I put him to tell us in 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:56.819
 the subjects with pins for that 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:06:00.090
 posture if you want to turn 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:01.289
 this way and sew all that 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.650
 outline that seam 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:07.080
 done good then now as 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.419
 continue the work there you can 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.870
 see how we are doing, I already have 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:15.270
 another step and there you can give as 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:18.180
 we were left with this as if the work 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:20.039
 like all the t-shirts all the fabric of 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.770
 point we join front back by the 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:25.349
 shoulders placing the reinforcement strip not 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:28.169
 forget about that things the sleeves at 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:30.539
 appointments close the lower sleeves and by 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:32.969
 last we will miss performing the 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:37.919
 The neck is a simple rectangle 

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:42.360
 of 42 centimeters if here is how 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:44.789
 can give wide yes by 10 or 20 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:48.539
 from high we double it to half we sew 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:51.659
 the ends we turn and stitching 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:53.879
 masters all around this is a simple 

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:55.770
 rectangle as we met the 

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:56.669
 shirt and we're done with this 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.190
 work 

00:06:56.669 --> 00:07:03.000
 in this way we place 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:06.410
 right on the reverse there on the tip of 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.020
 that hexagon yes and from there upwards 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:12.450
 we begin to sew a straight seam 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:15.720
 simple then we passed a zig zag and 

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:19.230
 we match half of the picket 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:22.350
 of the neck with half the neckline 

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:25.980
 back like this in this way we're going to 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:28.260
 go sticking your neck last 

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:32.670
 points out that what we do fold we throw 

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:34.470
 the sleeves and the base and encourage our 

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:36.060
 selection was looking at another camera 

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:38.610
 but for this to be even more 

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.440
 full let's buy some numbers 

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:43.230
 thermos we say that they stick with the 

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:46.260
 iron and I did not want to stop remembering 

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:47.970
 to diego then there is the lord 

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.680
 you are going to put if you want 9 to 

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:51.120
 mati I'm sure you guys are going 

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.400
 to choose 

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.900
 we will continue in this way encouraging 

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.220
 our selection 

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:58.740
 then I hope you liked the 

00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:01.280
 proposal I hope that your 

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.280
 happy ending
