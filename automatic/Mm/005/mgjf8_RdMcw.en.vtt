00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.390
 from your medical experience 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.460
 veterinary 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.590
 can you tell us what 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.990
 any night the night 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:17.100
 year and the first days 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:20.160
 no for my outpatient experience 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.710
 I can say that already a month before the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.310
 Christmas holiday period 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.610
 last year 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.289
 we witness significant increase 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.619
 regarding the requests of 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.160
 help and prevention tips 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.220
 precisely because of the fear and stress caused 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.809
 to animals and for example many people 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.940
 come to ask us for recipes 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.339
 tranquilizers of anxiolytics or 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.320
 simply a vademecum of advice 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:51.290
 on how to deal with to cause 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.360
 as little disturbance as possible to their animals 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:58.129
 on days where it is more massive 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.129
 the use of fireworks 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.040
 I also witnessed serious diseases that 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.500
 occurred in the animals due 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.369
 to this continuous bombardment of 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.950
 stimuli that cause stress and fear 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.189
 I have witnessed shocks several times then 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.289
 I had to intervene urgently 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:23.189
 the shock sometimes resolved in the arc 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:25.770
 a few hours or the next day 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.130
 in other cases, however, animals 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.799
 subjected to this huge event 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.390
 traumatic then developed of the 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.909
 invalidating pathologies such as 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.579
 heart disease because the animals are 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.740
 particularly sensitive to noise and 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.960
 why the exposure to barrels 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.659
 could cause them serious damage 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.369
 animals have super senses 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:53.219
 compared to man I am particularly 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:55.439
 sensitive to noisy events 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:58.439
 enough to think that the dog 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.200
 cat do not have a hearing approximately 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.420
 seven times higher than that of man 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.179
 while wild animals in 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.580
 especially night birds 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:12.360
 they have a hearing that hundreds of times 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.670
 more developed than man's 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.520
 animals react for defenses for 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:22.440
 natural selection and you survival 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.360
 and very effective way to stimuli 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.630
 which can be dangerous 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.720
 so a fire is a bang 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:34.170
 an event that generates a sudden fear 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.250
 in the animal the sudden fear unleashes 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.650
 at the physical level 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.300
 a process that is mediated by 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.650
 mine categories that are mediators 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.240
 chemicals trigger a process in which 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.270
 there is a noticeable increase 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.920
 cardiac activity 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.040
 Cardiovascular for example if these 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.530
 these simulations are repeated stimuli 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.640
 can lead to a state of shock 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.489
 what is the shock the shock is a state of 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.620
 circulatory failure that can 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:08.700
 lead to serious consequences such as the 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.350
 collapse and up to even a 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.620
 fatal outcome or death 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.480
 of the animal as we can recognize 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.540
 in the animal a state of suffering 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.870
 caused by the barrels what we can do in 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.520
 concrete to secure it i 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.350
 fireworks we said that 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.840
 cause this fear in the animal 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:32.750
 fear can cause a shock first 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:36.470
 symptoms of discomfort in the animal are 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.470
 a state of weakness 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.060
 we can for example verify that 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.640
 the ends in this case of the animal 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.000
 therefore the ears are cold 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:52.190
 legs and therefore the state of the sensor 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.750
 altered when blood pressure e 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.790
 begins to fall and we can also 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.590
 easily see for example that 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.760
 our animal's gums tend to 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.739
 become white all these signs 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.350
 may already be warning of a 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.120
 collapse or a serious show then 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.400
 you should always keep them close at hand 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.570
 in those days the telephone number of the 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.090
 own veterinarian 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:19.549
 when there are these symptoms one must 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:23.240
 calling it in prevention consists of 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.760
 always remain calm in front of ours 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.250
 animal so that it does not feel the 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.580
 our state of agitation and therefore 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.900
 don't go further and get scared 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.090
 stay calm try to 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.880
 reassure him with a quiet voice 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.940
 it should not be looked directly into the eyes 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.890
 they should not be excessively pampered 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.880
 because otherwise we are going to increase 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.880
 their anxiety 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.900
 if for example we have a cat there 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.960
 comes home super frightened because 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.360
 he fired a nearby firecracker 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.130
 we don't have to immediately 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.110
 force him to grab it you need to 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.630
 wait for it to remain still 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.720
 calm down so the ideal would be 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.270
 wrap it in a blanket in a cloth 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.420
 a room maybe with a dark light in it 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.080
 so that it can return a state of 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.650
 tranquility 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.510
 an extremely useful advice of the 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:22.560
 well-being of our four friends 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.600
 paws is to keep them in the 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.720
 quieter room in the house 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:30.180
 so that they are less exposed to these 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.280
 stimulations can also be useful 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.740
 increase the sound level of the 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.740
 television so that they come to all 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.720
 these external noises can also be 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.030
 very useful to arrange a kennel 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.950
 inside this room in a manner 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.890
 that is the animal despite all the 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.960
 our precautions, however, are frightening 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:52.530
 to a refuge where to feel more 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.600
 quiet the animals do not go 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.420
 absolutely left outside 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.970
 during these free days why 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.650
 may run away may suffer 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.150
 accidents 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.990
 if in these days we will take them to 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:10.320
 I recommend walking the leash is 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.870
 useful to know that in this period i 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:17.030
 dogs receive them a lot of stray dogs 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:20.130
 that escape from the houses and therefore 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:22.110
 remember to fulfill the obligations of 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.920
 reads what the microcutting e 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.640
 the registrar 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:30.000
 an appeal that I would like to make about it 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:33.750
 New Year is to not use 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.230
 just the fireworks because 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:39.240
 cause accidents in humans 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:41.660
 they cause distress, discomfort and illness 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.890
 in animals it is everyone's right 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.900
 celebrate but we can do it without 

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:48.140
 harm the rights of the 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.140
 animals
