00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
you got it kind of pull it on hard

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.679 
you got it kind of pull it on hard
enough<00:01:30.140> to<00:01:30.290> get<00:01:30.409> those<00:01:30.530> tabs<00:01:30.860> out<00:01:31.450> now<00:01:32.450> that<00:01:32.600> we

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
enough to get those tabs out now that we

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.570 
enough to get those tabs out now that we
have<00:01:32.780> the<00:01:32.869> back<00:01:32.990> panel<00:01:33.380> off<00:01:33.500> we<00:01:34.070> can<00:01:34.250> take<00:01:34.280> this

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
have the back panel off we can take this

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.460 
have the back panel off we can take this
smaller<00:01:34.880> panel<00:01:35.270> off<00:01:35.420> so<00:01:35.869> we<00:01:35.990> have<00:01:36.110> more<00:01:36.259> room

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
smaller panel off so we have more room

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:43.539 
smaller panel off so we have more room
to<00:01:36.500> work<00:01:36.740> on<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:37.009> spark<00:01:37.280> module<00:01:42.310> the<00:01:43.310> spark

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.289 
them next to each other and transfer the
wires<00:02:22.310> over<00:02:22.519> one<00:02:22.760> at<00:02:22.880> a<00:02:22.940> time

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
wires over one at a time

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.870 
wires over one at a time
so<00:02:23.570> they<00:02:23.690> don't<00:02:23.840> get<00:02:23.930> confused<00:02:24.640> so<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.730> white

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
so they don't get confused so the white

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.860 
so they don't get confused so the white
one<00:02:25.910> goes<00:02:26.660> back<00:02:26.870> here<00:02:31.209> the<00:02:32.209> red<00:02:32.390> ones<00:02:32.570> go<00:02:32.720> on

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
one goes back here the red ones go on

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:46.790 
one goes back here the red ones go on
these<00:02:32.989> four<00:02:33.200> over<00:02:33.410> here

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.910 

then<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.760> red<00:02:47.910> one<00:02:48.350> comes<00:02:49.350> off<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.740> goes

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
then the red one comes off and goes

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.700 
then the red one comes off and goes
right<00:02:50.370> here

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
right here

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.490 
right here
and<00:02:52.710> the<00:02:53.040> white<00:02:53.190> one<00:02:53.370> on<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.850> other<00:02:53.940> terminal

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
and the white one on the other terminal

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.300 
and the white one on the other terminal
now<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.680> we<00:02:55.770> have<00:02:55.890> all<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.130> wires

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
now that we have all the wires

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.890 
now that we have all the wires
transferred<00:02:56.760> over<00:02:56.970> we<00:02:57.330> can<00:02:57.450> go<00:02:57.540> ahead<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:57.780> put

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
transferred over we can go ahead and put

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.990 
transferred over we can go ahead and put
the<00:02:57.990> spark<00:02:58.230> module<00:02:58.530> back<00:02:58.650> in<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.580> slide<00:02:59.880> it

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
the spark module back in and slide it

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.350 
the spark module back in and slide it
back<00:03:00.090> into<00:03:00.300> its<00:03:00.450> place<00:03:00.630> line<00:03:00.930> up<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.140> holes

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
back into its place line up the holes

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:12.200 
back into its place line up the holes
and<00:03:03.360> put<00:03:03.810> in<00:03:03.930> all<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.170> screws<00:03:11.000> now<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.060> way

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
and put in all the screws now the way

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.390 
and put in all the screws now the way
the<00:03:12.360> spark<00:03:12.600> module<00:03:12.930> back<00:03:13.050> in<00:03:13.260> we<00:03:13.950> can<00:03:14.070> put<00:03:14.250> the

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
the spark module back in we can put the

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:22.940 
the spark module back in we can put the
cover<00:03:14.670> back<00:03:14.910> on<00:03:21.380> now<00:03:22.380> we<00:03:22.440> can<00:03:22.650> replace<00:03:22.860> the

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
cover back on now we can replace the

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.490 
cover back on now we can replace the
main<00:03:23.250> back<00:03:23.460> panel<00:03:25.340> don't<00:03:26.340> lose<00:03:26.460> this<00:03:26.610> case<00:03:27.500> so

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
main back panel don't lose this case so

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.620 
main back panel don't lose this case so
we<00:03:28.590> need<00:03:28.710> to<00:03:28.890> stick<00:03:29.610> this<00:03:29.760> up<00:03:30.000> in<00:03:30.150> here<00:03:30.360> above

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
we need to stick this up in here above

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.810 
we need to stick this up in here above
the<00:03:30.810> insulation<00:03:31.470> in<00:03:31.590> between<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.950> clock<00:03:32.130> make

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
the insulation in between the clock make

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.070 
the insulation in between the clock make
sure<00:03:32.970> you<00:03:33.060> don't<00:03:33.150> hit<00:03:33.300> the<00:03:33.360> clock<00:03:33.600> and<00:03:33.810> damage

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
sure you don't hit the clock and damage

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.300 
sure you don't hit the clock and damage
it<00:03:36.470> once<00:03:37.470> you<00:03:37.560> have<00:03:37.680> that<00:03:37.800> in<00:03:37.920> place<00:03:37.950> you're

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
it once you have that in place you're

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.040 
it once you have that in place you're
going<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.490> have<00:03:38.580> to<00:03:38.760> push<00:03:39.540> it<00:03:39.690> down<00:03:39.840> a<00:03:39.870> little

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
going to have to push it down a little

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.800 
going to have to push it down a little
bit<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.560> get<00:03:40.650> these<00:03:40.830> tabs<00:03:41.070> underneath<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:42.180> let

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810

it slide up into place and then we can

00:03:52.650 --> 00:04:06.130 
it slide up into place and then we can
put<00:03:52.770> the<00:03:52.860> screws<00:03:53.040> back<00:03:53.130> in
