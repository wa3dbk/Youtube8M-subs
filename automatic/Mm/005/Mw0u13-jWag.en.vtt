00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:27.619
 start by applying on the eyelid a 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:28.940
 eyeshadow similar to my complexion for 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.890
 stand out dark eyes 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.530
 I decided to make a make up of 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.449
 green actions so I use a green 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:41.809
 clear very shimmer in the inner corner 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:43.460
 of the eye I want to create on your own 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.489
 gr a color gradation 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.979
 so I go to apply a green of 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.460
 medium color from half to end 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:51.460
 mobile eyelid 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.590
 to give more depth new make up I go 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.199
 to apply a mag brown with a 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.400
 gradient brush and discover the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.400
 all in a homogeneous way 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.890
 now I am going to complete the gradation of 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.830
 color so beautiful penthouse this 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.200
 blue pigment oil that has sub-tone 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.450
 green and apply it at the end of mine 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.550
 eye blending towards the fold then 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.619
 towards the inside change brush e 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.880
 use a gradient brush in 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.750
 way to have an application 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.070
 eyeshadow much more homogeneous 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.229
 then always with a brush 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.840
 from nuance clean and a little bit of 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.500
 brown matt eyeshadow I'm going to blend 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.750
 towards the eyeshadow eyebrows now 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.640
 I realize the light points above the arch 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.880
 eyebrows and inside corner 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.880
 eye 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.379
 I apply one in the feeding of the eye 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.379
 blue oil pencil 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.120
 to give more intensity to the eye while 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.599
 desco marel eye shadow blue oil under 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.599
 the lower rhyme 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.260
 to really make New York more intense 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.040
 and defined I am going to make a thin one 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.040
 line of lagers 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.780
 before applying the mascara use 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.630
 eyelash curler giving basic tripod 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.820
 at the base at the center and at the tips so 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.340
 such as to have a natural curvature e 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:16.410
 subsequently I apply mascara with gods 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.410
 zig zag movements asking for the eyelid 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.349
 and to make the look really 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.829
 magnetic I go to apply the lashes 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.079
 false 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:29.640
 remember to let it dry for a few 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.640
 according to the glue before application 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.740
 to minimize the gap between 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.150
 false and natural eyelashes I go to 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.150
 apply another layer of mascara 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.290
 if you want to define yours properly 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.350
 make up and then give it a line 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.520
 perfect in upward orientation 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.110
 used a flat brush with a little 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:04:02.340
 of concealer and subsequently 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:04:04.500
 amalgamate you with incarnate having a 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.300
 make up so intense on the eyes 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.180
 I chose a color for my lips 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.190
 news so with a pencil I go to 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.820
 define the outline and those also 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.820
 the interior 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.490
 subsequently I apply a lipstick from the 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.520
 slightly more clear news tones than the 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.750
 pencil and to give a light touch I apply 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.940
 a lipgloss only in the center of the lips 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.250
 and finally a touch of color to the face 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:45.320
 I apply a blush pinkish mat with 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:47.300
 circular movements smiling that 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.440
