00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 and so as to this 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.389
 quadrocopter remote from X box for 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.309
 flights I would recommend these things 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.349
 general withdrawal would pull away 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.599
 because they they are suitable more for 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.150
 rooms than for the street 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.800
 that is, on the street is better to fly here in 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:26.189
 like this all this do take off here 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.710
 I'll start with opens after we do 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:33.620
 little battery right here we have 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:37.219
 battery level as 350 milliamps and 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.219
 it all closes 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:45.820
 the maximum load which he can 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:48.010
 raise it to about 15 grams 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.430
 more you did not advise him in a man 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.960
 take off so look how it was done 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.770
 Typu here of course the remote requires 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.890
 addictive 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.680
 joystick both on xbox and sense here 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.770
 round element usually acute shock 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.290
 stick in the finger but here it requires 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.180
 get used this button is responsible for 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.800
 360 degree flips 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:14.619
 This button how to say well, ordinary 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.040
 mode that is for beginners and mode 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:16.720
 profi 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.330
 but there is a difference but not so much 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.680
 that is, it still does not tilt him 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.090
 very strong points 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.869
 but let's see how he will take 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.869
 crashes at least 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:48.440
 I loved 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:50.890
 calculate risks at 4 with a minus with 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.890
 stretch 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:58.430
 and so what kind of conclusion do we do 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.710
 so the copter , well, let him sit his hands 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.009
 comfortable if you didn't like it here 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.860
 There are no sharp sticks that stick in 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:07.520
 finger to clearly control it was but 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.930
 her entrance 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:18.110
 I think here is less than normal 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:21.740
 glass so well remote and principle in this 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:24.320
 small but not very familiar 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:27.830
 as for the copter 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:30.169
 but I recommend using this protection. 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:33.949
 just get home to crash 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:36.430
 fall in all and did not suffer screws for 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:40.430
 streets and I recommend to completely remove 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:42.410
 because with her obviously fly worse but 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.260
 I recommend, of course, completely 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:47.449
 make out with those things I do 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:52.400
 We do not understand well, and so you can fly 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:55.220
 principle, that means on the street vitamin 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.840
 the only way is the flight characteristics but 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:01.070
 i put it somewhere 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:03.979
 4 minus very slow control 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:07.130
 rudra tilt and not very strong go 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:10.610
 so some sudden movements on it 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:13.909
 hard to do well here is standard 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:16.360
 battery that is, flies in time 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:19.510
 usually there are about five to seven minutes 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:22.890
 not charging for very long 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:28.510
 gt well, the same standard 40 minutes 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:31.090
 plus minus here is a good copter worth 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:32.860
 inexpensive razmerchik he has a normal 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.110
 there is such for you 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.750
 far fly away it will be clear where he is 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.790
 before and behind this problem of small 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:43.240
 copter 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:47.050
 so but for training for both 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:50.290
 the first copter can be recommended well 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.860
 plus 3 propellers 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.910
 noticed 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:56.740
 and also I donâ€™t like it here 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:58.990
 there is no direct rotation of the screws 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:01.470
 comes from the engine comes through 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.520
 gears but this is optional 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:07.870
 additional costs will go and 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:10.990
 when landing in some sand here in 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:13.180
 the gears are clogged pebbles therefore 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.520
 have to blow clean it too 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:20.140
 negative good 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:26.310
 from a good kopter for 40 tone with what 

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:29.890
 throw bucks wearable Sim tried 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:32.560
 so I can recommend for primary 

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:37.950
 flight if you want something more 

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.950
 sizes but that's all for now
