a prediction trick and I hope you will
enjoy<00:00:21.289> it<00:00:21.320> but<00:00:21.560> now<00:00:21.740> let's<00:00:22.010> get<00:00:22.100> started<00:00:22.490> with

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
enjoy it but now let's get started with

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.760 
enjoy it but now let's get started with
the<00:00:22.789> performance<00:00:23.270> of<00:00:23.359> the<00:00:23.449> trick<00:00:23.720> now<00:00:24.500> as<00:00:24.650> I

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
the performance of the trick now as I

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.200 
the performance of the trick now as I
said<00:00:24.980> before<00:00:25.130> I<00:00:25.340> will<00:00:25.580> need<00:00:25.730> a<00:00:25.789> shuffled<00:00:26.150> pack

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
said before I will need a shuffled pack

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.840 
said before I will need a shuffled pack
of<00:00:26.480> playing<00:00:26.779> cards<00:00:26.869> and<00:00:27.350> for<00:00:28.160> this<00:00:28.279> trick<00:00:28.670> I

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:28.850 
of playing cards and for this trick I

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.870 
of playing cards and for this trick I
will<00:00:28.939> need<00:00:29.180> several<00:00:30.019> predictions<00:00:30.650> now<00:00:31.160> my

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
will need several predictions now my

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.930 
will need several predictions now my
first<00:00:32.149> prediction<00:00:32.509> is<00:00:33.140> going<00:00:33.350> to<00:00:33.710> be<00:00:33.859> in<00:00:34.309> this

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
first prediction is going to be in this

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.250 
first prediction is going to be in this
case<00:00:35.179> just<00:00:35.659> use<00:00:35.929> I<00:00:37.120> think<00:00:38.120> that<00:00:38.719> one<00:00:38.929> is<00:00:38.960> fine<00:00:39.229> I

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
case just use I think that one is fine I

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.099 
case just use I think that one is fine I
can't<00:00:39.530> put<00:00:39.739> it<00:00:39.829> right<00:00:39.979> -<00:00:40.190> and<00:00:41.149> I<00:00:41.269> have<00:00:41.539> to<00:00:41.870> take

00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:42.109 
can't put it right - and I have to take

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:44.590 
can't put it right - and I have to take
an<00:00:42.260> older<00:00:42.499> prediction<00:00:43.010> in<00:00:43.429> this<00:00:44.030> case<00:00:44.299> just

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
an older prediction in this case just

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.479 
an older prediction in this case just
use<00:00:45.760> discount<00:00:46.760> or<00:00:47.389> no<00:00:47.749> just<00:00:48.109> take<00:00:48.289> this<00:00:49.249> one

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
use discount or no just take this one

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.009 
use discount or no just take this one
okay<00:00:49.760> I<00:00:49.789> think<00:00:49.940> that's<00:00:50.209> what<00:00:50.449> that<00:00:50.719> one<00:00:50.899> is

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:51.019 
okay I think that's what that one is

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:53.709 
okay I think that's what that one is
better<00:00:51.229> I<00:00:51.589> can't<00:00:52.249> take<00:00:52.699> an<00:00:52.850> order<00:00:53.119> prediction

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
better I can't take an order prediction

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.489 
better I can't take an order prediction
in<00:00:53.899> this<00:00:54.049> case<00:00:54.319> just<00:00:54.619> use<00:00:54.889> I<00:00:55.989> think<00:00:56.989> that<00:00:57.319> one

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:57.499 
in this case just use I think that one

00:00:57.499 --> 00:00:58.840 
in this case just use I think that one
is<00:00:57.530> fine<00:00:57.889> okay

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
is fine okay

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.689 
is fine okay
and<00:00:58.940> maybe<00:00:59.839> you<00:01:00.049> can<00:01:00.229> take<00:01:00.469> one<00:01:01.429> more

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
and maybe you can take one more

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:07.020 
and maybe you can take one more
prediction<00:01:01.969> in<00:01:02.600> this<00:01:03.170> case<00:01:03.409> just<00:01:03.679> use<00:01:03.949> I<00:01:05.890> think

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
prediction in this case just use I think

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.249 
prediction in this case just use I think
that<00:01:08.030> one<00:01:08.240> is<00:01:08.270> fun<00:01:08.570> okay

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
that one is fun okay

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:14.980 
that one is fun okay
so<00:01:09.770> we<00:01:09.979> have<00:01:10.189> here<00:01:10.490> now<00:01:10.630> for<00:01:12.310> predictions<00:01:13.990> now

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
so we have here now for predictions now

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.800 
so we have here now for predictions now
at<00:01:15.530> this<00:01:15.740> point<00:01:16.009> I<00:01:16.369> want<00:01:17.090> this<00:01:17.179> pack<00:01:17.450> today<00:01:17.659> to

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
at this point I want this pack today to

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.620 
at this point I want this pack today to
take<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:18.079> pack<00:01:18.439> and<00:01:18.740> he<00:01:19.130> should<00:01:19.450> cut<00:01:20.450> the

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
take the pack and he should cut the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.090 
take the pack and he should cut the
cards<00:01:20.990> into<00:01:21.409> four<00:01:21.829> equal<00:01:22.280> piles<00:01:22.520> like<00:01:23.500> so<00:01:24.500> okay

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
cards into four equal piles like so okay

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.980

so we have four four piles and four

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.130 
so we have four four piles and four
predictions<00:01:27.609> now<00:01:28.609> I<00:01:28.880> wanted<00:01:29.329> for<00:01:29.539> inspector

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
predictions now I wanted for inspector

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.230 
predictions now I wanted for inspector
let's<00:01:30.289> take<00:01:30.439> the<00:01:30.560> first<00:01:30.770> pack<00:01:31.130> should<00:01:32.030> take

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
let's take the first pack should take

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.090 
let's take the first pack should take
the<00:01:32.390> top<00:01:32.630> three<00:01:32.899> cards<00:01:33.170> put<00:01:33.770> them<00:01:33.920> on<00:01:34.039> the

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
the top three cards put them on the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.980 
the top three cards put them on the
table<00:01:34.429> like<00:01:34.579> so<00:01:34.640> and<00:01:35.090> then<00:01:35.539> he<00:01:35.630> should<00:01:35.810> deal

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
table like so and then he should deal

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.289 
table like so and then he should deal
the<00:01:36.140> next<00:01:36.469> three<00:01:36.649> cards<00:01:37.070> from<00:01:37.520> left<00:01:37.850> to<00:01:38.030> right

on top of two older packs like so I can

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:42.700 
on top of two older packs like so I can
after<00:01:41.479> that<00:01:41.600> he<00:01:41.689> should<00:01:42.140> put<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.439> remaining

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
after that he should put the remaining

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.819 
after that he should put the remaining
cards<00:01:43.240> right<00:01:44.240> through<00:01:44.450> again<00:01:44.689> now<00:01:45.259> he's<00:01:45.679> done

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
cards right through again now he's done

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:47.260 
cards right through again now he's done
the<00:01:45.920> same<00:01:46.130> thing<00:01:46.310> with<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:46.579> second<00:01:46.909> pack<00:01:47.060> so

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270
