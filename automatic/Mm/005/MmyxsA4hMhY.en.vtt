00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.410 
standing next to it and it's made out of
stones<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.610> there's<00:02:08.940> actually<00:02:09.479> resonance<00:02:09.989> I

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
stones and there's actually resonance I

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.870 
stones and there's actually resonance I
which<00:02:10.810> gives<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:11.680> illusion<00:02:11.890> of<00:02:12.280> water<00:02:12.580> as<00:02:12.849> you

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
which gives the illusion of water as you

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.600 
which gives the illusion of water as you
can<00:02:13.180> see<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.810> then<00:02:14.620> next<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:15.099> it<00:02:15.130> are<00:02:15.370> two

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
can see and then next to it are two

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.280 
can see and then next to it are two
little<00:02:15.760> buckets<00:02:16.270> which<00:02:16.450> are<00:02:16.599> also<00:02:16.780> filled

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
little buckets which are also filled

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.100 
little buckets which are also filled
with<00:02:17.440> water<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:19.180> dad<00:02:19.390> is<00:02:19.569> standing<00:02:19.959> next

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
with water and the dad is standing next

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.830 
with water and the dad is standing next
to<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.410> picnic<00:02:20.709> table<00:02:21.220> on<00:02:21.430> which<00:02:21.819> there<00:02:22.569> is

out just to show you and I put a lot of

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.509 
out just to show you and I put a lot of
detail<00:02:38.230> into<00:02:38.500> each<00:02:38.830> one<00:02:39.959> there<00:02:40.959> you<00:02:41.050> go<00:02:41.230> and

a<00:03:38.410> bit<00:03:38.709> about<00:03:38.859> the<00:03:39.190> house<00:03:39.370> itself<00:03:39.670> is<00:03:40.150> a<00:03:40.390> little

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
a bit about the house itself is a little

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.949 
a bit about the house itself is a little
pathway<00:03:41.590> of<00:03:42.070> stone<00:03:42.549> that<00:03:42.910> leads<00:03:43.209> up<00:03:43.480> to<00:03:43.540> the

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
pathway of stone that leads up to the

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.960 
pathway of stone that leads up to the
main<00:03:44.140> house<00:03:44.440> and<00:03:44.799> I<00:03:45.010> make<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.250> stones<00:03:45.609> out<00:03:45.850> of

main house and I make the stones out of
polymer<00:03:46.299> clay<00:03:47.820> as<00:03:48.820> you<00:03:49.090> can<00:03:49.269> see<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:49.690> house

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
polymer clay as you can see the house

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.740 
polymer clay as you can see the house
consists<00:03:50.530> of<00:03:50.590> two<00:03:50.950> levels<00:03:51.400> so<00:03:51.910> here<00:03:52.180> is<00:03:52.209> the

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
consists of two levels so here is the

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.440 
consists of two levels so here is the
first<00:03:52.959> level<00:03:53.410> it<00:03:53.739> has<00:03:53.769> the<00:03:54.400> main<00:03:54.609> and<00:03:54.880> trends

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
first level it has the main and trends

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.640 
first level it has the main and trends
and<00:03:55.980> two<00:03:56.980> windows<00:03:57.519> and<00:03:57.819> I<00:03:58.120> textured<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:59.410> house

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.250 
and two windows and I textured the house
to<00:04:00.040> make<00:04:00.190> it<00:04:00.250> look<00:04:00.519> like<00:04:00.579> a<00:04:00.790> tree<00:04:01.180> and<00:04:01.420> my<00:04:01.870> main

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
to make it look like a tree and my main

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.849 
to make it look like a tree and my main
idea<00:04:02.650> was<00:04:02.739> that<00:04:03.040> this<00:04:03.970> was<00:04:04.359> a<00:04:04.720> tree<00:04:05.079> stumps<00:04:05.620> of

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
idea was that this was a tree stumps of

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.430 
idea was that this was a tree stumps of
humans<00:04:06.370> could<00:04:06.730> have<00:04:06.850> cut<00:04:07.420> down<00:04:07.690> a<00:04:07.720> big<00:04:08.079> tree

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
humans could have cut down a big tree

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.850 
humans could have cut down a big tree
for<00:04:08.889> their<00:04:09.100> only

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
for their only

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.620 
for their only
and<00:04:09.980> then<00:04:10.160> the<00:04:10.550> animals<00:04:11.060> would<00:04:11.420> take

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
and then the animals would take

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.960 
and then the animals would take
advantage<00:04:12.140> of<00:04:12.260> that<00:04:12.320> and<00:04:12.740> make<00:04:13.550> the<00:04:13.760> home

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
advantage of that and make the home

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.050 
advantage of that and make the home
there<00:04:14.270> and<00:04:14.510> that<00:04:14.930> I<00:04:14.960> put<00:04:15.320> some<00:04:15.560> vines<00:04:15.890> here<00:04:16.880> and

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
there and that I put some vines here and

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.390 
there and that I put some vines here and
there<00:04:17.239> as<00:04:17.510> well<00:04:17.870> and<00:04:18.200> a<00:04:18.380> textured<00:04:18.709> it<00:04:18.980> to<00:04:19.160> make

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
there as well and a textured it to make

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.260 
there as well and a textured it to make
it<00:04:19.430> look<00:04:19.609> like<00:04:19.970> a<00:04:20.030> true<00:04:20.329> Trump<00:04:22.120> and<00:04:23.120> then

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
it look like a true Trump and then

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.180 
it look like a true Trump and then
