00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:06.960
 a simple and fast recipe ideal for 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.490
 week nights we bring you in 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.690
 italy with 12 france with a same 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.030
 enough turkey Italian 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.500
 so we'll start with objects from 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.759
 small turkey cutlets 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.699
 you see they are well portioned who 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.330
 are impeccable and we will put them on 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.260
 the board to season them well 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.320
 Its very important 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.689
 and actually laden like poultry 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.890
 do not support the overpowered to the you 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.599
 will you really see that you are 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.820
 very precise about cooking we're going 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.430
 season it on both sides very 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.850
 important to properly isolate the meat before 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.649
 the cooking 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.079
 so we always say we have to do it 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.879
 must do it after and I'm advocating 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.410
 really is really really about the 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.600
 to do before because otherwise when you 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.360
 do it on the stove and fix a driver 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.079
 was less accurate you to put a little 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.760
 oil yarn in the pan and there it takes 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.550
 a pan that is very hot with 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.340
 it becomes hot then you 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.230
 go ask your cutlets gently 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.149
 in a hot frying pan and see 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.710
 his for that is really very very fast 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.689
 look at least from the stopover to the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:12.150
 heap then this is going to be roughly 30 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.450
 seconds by really make it super 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.450
 grab 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.080
 your cutlets are seized on both 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.540
 sides we lower the fire 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.100
 a super important will lower the fire and 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.520
 we will rid the cutlets a 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.520
 small plate 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.670
 we are at a low heat you will take a 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:46.160
 little onion you 're going to chop it up menu 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:49.520
 menu you put it in your stove and 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.280
 the very important we will stir the 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.110
 onions for 4 to 5 minutes over low heat 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.510
 we will let them come back so that he 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.180
 become translucent our onions are 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.700
 candied 5 5 minutes cooking over a heat 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.460
 sweet and now we will add the 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:10.780
 tomato sauce a tomato sauce nature is 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:14.090
 very simple we will add our olives 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:21.470
 to infuse I will add a small 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:23.090
 little garlic then I learned how we go 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.410
 add the herbs from the garden 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.090
 which is important for the side 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.640
 Italian is the sage 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.040
 if you have savory with goblins and 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.690
 there we will postpone to boiling and we will 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.569
 simmer for two to three 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.310
 minutes that's all and everything 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.030
 here is the sauce is ready so what 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.170
 is important is that we did it 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.480
 reduce a little bit until 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.430
 it has a nap 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.239
 month listen I add pepper not so 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.099
 it's really in Italian cuisine 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.069
 the weight really very very important a 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:52.739
 little trick of pepper a little bit of 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.569

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.099
 really to you noticed that the basic 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.730
 we do not boil it just go 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:03.329
 the master in infusion and we will add 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.250
 turkey cutlets in the skin m6 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.659
 just could warm them up so especially 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.579
 you do not get wet again 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:09.900
 scallops and in fact it's going to allow 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.219
 we'll go roll a little bit of 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.319
 Italian resources with ap 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:15.719
