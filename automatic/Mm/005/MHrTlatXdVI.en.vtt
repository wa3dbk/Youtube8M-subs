00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
there this early I actually think the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.970 
there this early I actually think the
Bosnian<00:00:27.990> game<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.230> lot<00:00:28.410> more<00:00:28.529> important<00:00:28.890> for

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
Eddie Johnson look we saw what he can do

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.080

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
get the start up top the question is can

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.660

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
he pair up with Jozy Altidore in that

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.940 
he pair up with Jozy Altidore in that
case<00:00:44.879> maybe<00:00:45.120> Johnson<00:00:45.899> has<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.079> play<00:00:46.469> out<00:00:46.710> on

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
case maybe Johnson has to play out on

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.220 
case maybe Johnson has to play out on
the<00:00:47.100> wing<00:00:47.280> which<00:00:47.730> sets<00:00:47.940> itself<00:00:48.210> up<00:00:48.390> for<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> 4<00:00:49.020> to

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
the wing which sets itself up for a 4 to

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.920 
the wing which sets itself up for a 4 to
3<00:00:49.260> 1<00:00:49.860> formation<00:00:50.670> for<00:00:51.149> Jurgen<00:00:51.480> Klinsmann<00:00:51.809> which

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
3 1 formation for Jurgen Klinsmann which

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.150 
3 1 formation for Jurgen Klinsmann which
against<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.289> tough<00:00:52.440> opposition<00:00:52.559> like<00:00:52.949> Bosnia

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
against the tough opposition like Bosnia

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.790 
against the tough opposition like Bosnia
it's<00:00:53.820> not<00:00:54.120> out<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.690> realm<00:00:54.840> but<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.320> the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
it's not out of the realm but of the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.560 
it's not out of the realm but of the
debutantes<00:00:56.129> though<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.579> think<00:00:56.730> John<00:00:57.149> Anthony

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
debutantes though I think John Anthony

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.569 
debutantes though I think John Anthony
Brooks<00:00:57.840> has<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.170> best<00:00:58.379> shot<00:00:58.530> at<00:00:58.859> starting<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
Brooks has the best shot at starting the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.010 
Brooks has the best shot at starting the
u.s.<00:00:59.820> right<00:01:00.030> now<00:01:00.059> our<00:01:00.270> thin<00:01:00.480> at<00:01:00.600> center<00:01:00.870> back

after<00:01:01.379> Michael<00:01:01.680> Orozco<00:01:01.829> freestyle<00:01:02.399> had<00:01:02.879> to

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
after Michael Orozco freestyle had to

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.509 
after Michael Orozco freestyle had to
pull<00:01:03.329> out<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.690> it's<00:01:04.080> fairly<00:01:04.379> easy<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:05.070> put<00:01:05.430> in

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
pull out and it's fairly easy to put in

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.460 
pull out and it's fairly easy to put in
a<00:01:05.640> central<00:01:05.909> defender<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.630> slot<00:01:06.930> him<00:01:07.110> into<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
a central defender and slot him into the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.399 
a central defender and slot him into the
system<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.250> US<00:01:08.640> has<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.510> think<00:01:09.780> Brooks<00:01:10.140> get

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
system the US has so I think Brooks get

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.109 
system the US has so I think Brooks get
to<00:01:10.560> start<00:01:10.830> your<00:01:11.040> Hanson<00:01:11.490> potentially<00:01:12.000> off<00:01:12.090> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
to start your Hanson potentially off the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.450 
to start your Hanson potentially off the
bench<00:01:12.299> but<00:01:12.930> we'd<00:01:13.170> like<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.619> see<00:01:13.860> how<00:01:14.040> he<00:01:14.100> pairs

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
bench but we'd like to see how he pairs

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.100

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909 
definitely play in MLS he was basically

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.599 
definitely play in MLS he was basically
saying<00:02:48.329> MLS<00:02:48.870> come<00:02:49.200> get<00:02:49.440> me<00:02:49.620> my<00:02:49.769> contracts<00:02:50.459> up

saying MLS come get me my contracts up

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.849 
saying MLS come get me my contracts up
and<00:02:50.849> I<00:02:51.209> believe<00:02:51.359> he<00:02:51.840> will<00:02:51.870> be<00:02:52.200> an<00:02:52.290> mls<00:02:52.620> player

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
and I believe he will be an mls player

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.270 
and I believe he will be an mls player
next<00:02:53.370> summer<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:53.970> look<00:02:54.450> he'll<00:02:54.659> only<00:02:54.870> be<00:02:55.109> 32<00:02:55.769> so

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
next summer and look he'll only be 32 so

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.490 
next summer and look he'll only be 32 so
I<00:02:56.579> think<00:02:56.819> he<00:02:57.150> could<00:02:57.299> be<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.450> real<00:02:57.989> valuable

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
I think he could be a real valuable

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.129 
I think he could be a real valuable
asset<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.129> any<00:02:59.280> team<00:02:59.370> look<00:03:00.120> LA<00:03:00.450> Galaxy<00:03:00.959> New

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139 
asset to any team look LA Galaxy New

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.690 
asset to any team look LA Galaxy New
York<00:03:01.290> Red<00:03:01.439> Bulls<00:03:01.470> even<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.069> Chicago<00:03:02.489> Fire<00:03:02.639> I

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
York Red Bulls even the Chicago Fire I

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.879 
York Red Bulls even the Chicago Fire I
think<00:03:03.060> might<00:03:03.420> be<00:03:03.659> in<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.319> running<00:03:04.500> and<00:03:04.650> could

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
think might be in the running and could

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.099 
think might be in the running and could
use<00:03:05.099> a<00:03:05.310> player<00:03:05.639> of<00:03:05.939> his<00:03:06.090> ilk<00:03:06.269> in<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.720> central

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
use a player of his ilk in the central

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:08.720 
use a player of his ilk in the central
midfield<00:03:07.500> these<00:03:07.709> really<00:03:08.010> great<00:03:08.189> pass<00:03:08.519> or

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
midfield these really great pass or

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.809 
midfield these really great pass or
under<00:03:09.000> rated<00:03:09.269> passer<00:03:09.349> so<00:03:10.349> I<00:03:10.590> think<00:03:10.859> him<00:03:11.489> his

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
under rated passer so I think him his

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.879 
under rated passer so I think him his
arrival<00:03:12.030> though<00:03:12.359> could<00:03:12.840> continue<00:03:13.470> this<00:03:13.620> push

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
arrival though could continue this push

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:16.520 
arrival though could continue this push
after<00:03:14.310> Dempsey<00:03:14.819> then<00:03:15.239> Jermaine<00:03:15.720> Jones<00:03:15.989> you

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
after Dempsey then Jermaine Jones you

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.839 
after Dempsey then Jermaine Jones you
