00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.170
 I'm sure you've already dreamed of 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.410
 to achieve a magnificent liver terrine 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.109
 fat 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.770
 I give you the solution then you 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.380
 take your foie gras so loeb de 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.510
 500 grams for a terrine of one kilo 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.680
 it's very important because if you 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.420
 put too little foie gras in your 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.740
 terrine know to line the bottom and 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.490
 you are going to have small slices 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.710
 tiny 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.719
 you really need your terrine is very 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.489
 very very advanced so you see me 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.420
 I already started working but I 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.180
 shows you how 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.640
 to your foie gras it 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.160
 So you need the foie gras you need 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.370
 a little bit of aluminum foil 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.360
 salt pepper you need an alcohol 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:55.199
 then alcohol armagnac cognac porto white 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.129
 red door monbazillac for me it's 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.960
 a blend of cognac and monbazillac 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.699
 same amount 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.129
 if you like his fleur de sel 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.010
 no problem, I prefer to serve him 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.720
 with the slice of foie gras 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.430
 I put a little fleur de sel on 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.189
 the side and the sons-in-law add 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.909
 we attack I show you you take 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.189
 so your loeb it opens in two and 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.070
 you will pass your finger along 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.810
 very slowly to get by to see 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.509
 in fact it's both as well and we 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.430

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.590
 there are two layers of snow a 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.470
 first on the surface and a second is 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.579
 leather in motion but that can hop 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.590
 help you with a small tweezers 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.869
 if you do not have nails this is 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.430
 important and we will look for the second
