 in direct collecting blood after 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.100
 the concerts I learned to be the bad guy 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.900
 Sometimes I am a bad person but at least I am 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.850
 real I did not start writing by fashions 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.040
 critical texts from critics who know 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.290
 criticize you are the typical guy who 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.540
 insults the real rap nothing more without 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.700
 think I'm going to go from imagining pages 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.070
 what will be of you is a pity without 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.200
 valuing reality will break and you will fall 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.000
 you have to prove it with words not with 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.190
 tears if you want to compete with the 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.410

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.660

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.430
 syllables that triggers these people pilla 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.500
 if you can five payments grams of 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.990
 powerful phrases with what I have me 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.300
 leftover food is hot enough 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.100
