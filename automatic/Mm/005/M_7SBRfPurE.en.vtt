like high schools clearly because it

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.170 
like high schools clearly because it

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
get it done so yeah I didn't yeah it

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.069 
get it done so yeah I didn't yeah it
wasn't<00:03:26.799> even<00:03:27.130> a<00:03:27.280> effect<00:03:27.880> just<00:03:28.420> something<00:03:29.019> I

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
wasn't even a effect just something I

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:30.410

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
and I think the guys are playing with a

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.059 
and I think the guys are playing with a
lot<00:03:33.610> of<00:03:33.670> confidence<00:03:34.150> i<00:03:34.540> think<00:03:34.840> we<00:03:35.769> so

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
lot of confidence i think we so

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.530 
lot of confidence i think we so
everything's<00:03:36.489> we<00:03:36.670> know<00:03:36.819> what<00:03:36.970> we<00:03:37.090> keep<00:03:37.299> off

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
everything's we know what we keep off

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.630 
everything's we know what we keep off
and<00:03:37.750> i<00:03:37.810> can<00:03:37.989> play<00:03:38.170> a<00:03:38.200> very<00:03:38.560> physical<00:03:38.829> game<00:03:39.159> that

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
and i can play a very physical game that

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.630 
and i can play a very physical game that
no<00:03:40.269> other<00:03:40.420> teams<00:03:41.200> in<00:03:41.439> the<00:03:41.530> world<00:03:41.680> can<00:03:42.010> live

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
no other teams in the world can live

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.100 
no other teams in the world can live
with<00:03:42.819> us<00:03:42.939> so<00:03:43.180> i<00:03:43.209> think<00:03:43.390> the<00:03:43.629> guys<00:03:43.810> have<00:03:43.989> been

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
with us so i think the guys have been

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.380 
with us so i think the guys have been
playing<00:03:44.170> to<00:03:44.590> their<00:03:44.709> strengths<00:03:45.099> and<00:03:45.220> I<00:03:45.970> have

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
playing to their strengths and I have

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.449 
playing to their strengths and I have
been<00:03:46.540> really<00:03:46.750> doing<00:03:47.409> for<00:03:47.680> a<00:03:47.739> while<00:03:47.950> so<00:03:48.280> I<00:03:48.310> think

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
been really doing for a while so I think

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:49.979 
been really doing for a while so I think
of<00:03:48.790> these<00:03:49.000> two<00:03:49.180> early<00:03:49.390> stages<00:03:49.689> in<00:03:49.900> the

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
of these two early stages in the

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.800 
of these two early stages in the
complaint<00:03:50.319> so<00:03:50.620> I<00:03:50.859> think<00:03:51.370> I<00:03:51.670> we<00:03:52.000> carry<00:03:52.450> on<00:03:52.599> that

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
complaint so I think I we carry on that

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.750 
complaint so I think I we carry on that
way<00:03:52.840> it<00:03:53.170> is<00:03:53.290> going<00:03:53.439> to<00:03:53.650> be<00:03:53.769> a<00:03:54.040> lot<00:03:54.250> of<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.519> South

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
way it is going to be a lot of the South
