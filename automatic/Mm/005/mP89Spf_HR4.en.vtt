00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.120
 you thought your apple juice was 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.179
 lovingly made by hand after 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.099
 how the apples left the garden and that's not how 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.690
 and all modern food products 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.150
 apple juice produced in industrial 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.300
 scale and this is necessary because 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:25.019
 one plant turns juice 40 thousand tons 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:26.609
 apples every year quebec in canada 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.179
 apple juice is made 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.830
 predominantly mac apples 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.510
 90 percent of production comes from 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.610
 october at harvest time 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.790
 the process begins with the fact that the pipeline 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.530
 takes apples to the control zone apples 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.360
 roll against the conveyor movement 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.170
 tapes so wet leaves and others 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:51.600
 items 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:54.660
 customer stick a few hours apples 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.850
 poured into the tank so that the apples do not 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.100
 get too crushed their fall slow down 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.270
 Now you can start cooking 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.400
 juices apples washed during the first wash 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.860
 removed to me because the drop 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.860
 used on a par with torn apples 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.499
 flow of cold water and completes the wash 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.350
 This machine cuts apples into small 

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:20.369
 pieces to make gruel 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.649
 then add enzymes which 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.240
 destroy the cellular structure of the fruit 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:28.649
 to get the maximum amount 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.020
 the juice then seems placed in tanks 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.349
 for soaking where they are left for an hour 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.810
 or one and a half 

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:39.810
 juice stands out seems pumped 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.789
 powerful hydraulic press inside 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:48.209
 press sleeves with filters collected 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:50.640
 peel the seeds and cuttings of apples control 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:52.200
 quality must be strict on each 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.670
 stage take samples of juice to 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.989
 make sure that it is respected 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.989
 necessary hygiene 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:12.780
 the juice is filtered and the smallest particles 

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:15.349
 sifted out juice flows from one stage to 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:22.650
 other through these huge reservoirs 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:24.359
 the next stage is pasteurization juice 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.720
 gets into the heat exchanger where is it 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:30.150
 heated to 88 degrees and then 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.060
 cooled to 50 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.720
 add enzymes to hydrated 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.159
 then this is an ultra filtration process. 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.290
 during which filters with 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:44.430
 microscopic pores delay 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:47.340
 the smallest particles are now apple juice 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.319
 its transparency is perfectly filtered 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.879
 check as well as the taste color and 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.569
 natural fruit content 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:56.159
 Sahara 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:59.640
 since the juice was made in october it 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:01.230
 need to keep the whole year part of the juice 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.209
 sent to the warehouse where it will be 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.209
 bottled throughout the year 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:11.459
 each tank fits 110 thousand 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:19.349
 liters filtered you 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:21.450
 juice is not added preservative now 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.819
 juice is poured into packets that 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.849
 filled at a rate of 100 liters per 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.849
 a minute 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.370
 then the package and hermetically sealed 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:45.659
 two small sprayers with hot 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.659
 glue glue to the sides of the straw 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.000
 another automatic line releases 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:03.380
 juice bottled they drive in a circle on this 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:06.060
 the bottle conveyor is washed and disinfected 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:10.560
 hydrogen peroxide in this sterile 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.450
 the premises are washed sterile 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.960
 clean water before you lead on 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.960
 breakdown 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:34.740
 every minute 120 pounds filled with juice 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:37.650
 and sealed with a bottle cap 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.440
 label and surround this 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:44.030
 the plant processes juice from 20 to 40 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.030
 thousand tons of apples per year
