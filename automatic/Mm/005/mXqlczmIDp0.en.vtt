00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
vehicles all right here's the car and

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.440 
vehicles all right here's the car and
Caravan<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:40.020> get<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> car<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:41.729> blue<00:01:41.909> part

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
Caravan you get a car the blue part

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.760 
Caravan you get a car the blue part
caravan<00:01:43.430> like<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> camper<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.530> they<00:01:46.530> didn't

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
caravan like a camper and they didn't

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.300 
caravan like a camper and they didn't
have<00:01:46.860> as<00:01:47.040> many<00:01:47.159> unique<00:01:47.610> elements<00:01:48.210> back<00:01:48.570> then

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
have as many unique elements back then

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.240 
have as many unique elements back then
basically<00:01:50.310> your<00:01:50.820> special<00:01:51.570> elements<00:01:52.049> were

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
basically your special elements were

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.090 
basically your special elements were
windshields<00:01:53.250> wheels<00:01:54.140> windows<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.950> things

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
windshields wheels windows and things

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.899 
windshields wheels windows and things
like<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:57.140> so<00:01:58.159> just<00:01:59.159> pretty<00:01:59.310> much<00:01:59.490> basic

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
like that so just pretty much basic

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.510 
like that so just pretty much basic
blocks<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.840> can<00:02:00.899> build<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.350> very<00:02:02.280> easily

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
blocks you can build this very easily

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.399 
blocks you can build this very easily
from<00:02:03.500> parts<00:02:04.500> from<00:02:04.740> today<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:06.170> little<00:02:07.170> bit<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.350> a

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
from parts from today a little bit of a

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.720 
from parts from today a little bit of a
variation<00:02:08.599> and<00:02:09.599> then<00:02:09.869> these<00:02:10.020> couplers<00:02:10.730> that's

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
variation and then these couplers that's

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.760 
variation and then these couplers that's
pretty<00:02:12.060> neat<00:02:12.270> now<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.080> thing<00:02:13.379> about<00:02:13.620> these

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
pretty neat now the thing about these

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.770 
pretty neat now the thing about these
couplers<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.700> they<00:02:14.910> break<00:02:15.180> really<00:02:15.599> easy

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
couplers is they break really easy

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.510 
couplers is they break really easy
especially<00:02:16.140> over<00:02:17.420> 39<00:02:18.420> years<00:02:18.810> they'll<00:02:19.739> they

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
especially over 39 years they'll they

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.830 
especially over 39 years they'll they
get<00:02:20.730> real<00:02:20.910> brittle<00:02:21.239> so<00:02:21.360> when<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.540> take<00:02:21.690> them

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
get real brittle so when you take them

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.350 
get real brittle so when you take them
apart<00:02:21.930> I<00:02:22.590> hope<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.489> don't<00:02:23.580> break<00:02:23.819> on<00:02:24.060> me<00:02:24.090> while

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
apart I hope it don't break on me while

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:37.430 
apart I hope it don't break on me while
I'm<00:02:24.480> doing<00:02:24.599> this<00:02:35.360> but<00:02:36.360> it's<00:02:36.780> very<00:02:36.930> common<00:02:37.410> for

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
I'm doing this but it's very common for

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.479 
I'm doing this but it's very common for
one<00:02:38.250> of<00:02:38.370> these<00:02:38.489> parts<00:02:39.209> to<00:02:39.690> break<00:02:39.840> on<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.709> top

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
one of these parts to break on the top

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:41.960 
one of these parts to break on the top
floor

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
floor

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.350 
floor
so<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:42.900> usually<00:02:43.110> leave<00:02:43.500> them<00:02:43.650> together<00:02:44.180> as<00:02:45.180> much

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
so I usually leave them together as much

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.640 
so I usually leave them together as much
as<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.599> can<00:02:46.430> I'll<00:02:47.430> just<00:02:47.580> ease<00:02:47.819> it<00:02:48.150> in<00:02:48.269> there

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
as I can I'll just ease it in there

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.410 
as I can I'll just ease it in there
didn't<00:02:49.650> break<00:02:49.800> it<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.730> it's<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:51.030> mini<00:02:51.239> will

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
didn't break it and it's a mini will

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.190 
didn't break it and it's a mini will
vehicle<00:02:52.970> as<00:02:53.970> these<00:02:54.300> mini<00:02:54.569> wheels<00:02:56.300> not<00:02:57.300> always

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
vehicle as these mini wheels not always

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.880 
vehicle as these mini wheels not always
the<00:02:58.440> parts<00:02:58.830> will<00:02:59.220> say<00:02:59.430> tech<00:02:59.640> ending<00:03:00.090> like<00:03:00.269> my

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
the parts will say tech ending like my

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.589 
the parts will say tech ending like my
wheels<00:03:01.890> I<00:03:02.220> did<00:03:02.400> not<00:03:02.550> necessarily<00:03:02.760> use<00:03:03.360> all

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599

vintage<00:03:04.409> parts<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.760> one<00:03:05.970> part<00:03:06.239> on<00:03:06.390> here<00:03:06.569> that

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
vintage parts the one part on here that

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.470 
vintage parts the one part on here that
is<00:03:07.400> relatively<00:03:08.400> unique<00:03:08.670> maybe<00:03:09.180> there's<00:03:09.330> two

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
is relatively unique maybe there's two

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.360 
is relatively unique maybe there's two
parts<00:03:09.870> is<00:03:10.080> this<00:03:10.349> windshield<00:03:10.709> it's<00:03:11.040> got<00:03:11.190> this

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
parts is this windshield it's got this

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.440 
parts is this windshield it's got this
curve<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:12.120> it

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
curve to it

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.600 
curve to it
I<00:03:12.950> like<00:03:13.950> that<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:14.400> then<00:03:14.670> you<00:03:14.849> got<00:03:15.000> your<00:03:15.030> 1<00:03:15.810> by<00:03:15.930> 4

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
I like that and then you got your 1 by 4

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.729 
I like that and then you got your 1 by 4
headlight<00:03:17.610> piece<00:03:17.849> with<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.300> chrome<00:03:18.870> finish<00:03:19.620> I

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:20.690 
headlight piece with the chrome finish I
like<00:03:19.890> don't<00:03:20.099> be<00:03:20.250> stupid

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
like don't be stupid

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.390 
like don't be stupid
those<00:03:21.540> are<00:03:21.720> kind<00:03:21.900> of<00:03:22.019> special<00:03:22.440> elements<00:03:23.099> and

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
those are kind of special elements and

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.180 
those are kind of special elements and
but<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.760> caravan<00:03:24.090> is<00:03:24.390> just<00:03:24.720> basically<00:03:25.190> some

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
but the caravan is just basically some

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.720 
but the caravan is just basically some
windows<00:03:27.440> not<00:03:28.440> sure<00:03:28.680> how<00:03:28.920> they<00:03:29.069> actually<00:03:29.310> get

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
windows not sure how they actually get

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.729 
windows not sure how they actually get
in<00:03:29.849> this<00:03:30.060> I<00:03:30.330> guess<00:03:30.629> one<00:03:31.019> of<00:03:31.049> those<00:03:31.200> windows<00:03:31.560> is

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
in this I guess one of those windows is

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:37.460 
in this I guess one of those windows is
typically<00:03:32.159> a<00:03:32.250> door<00:03:36.019> put<00:03:37.019> all<00:03:37.110> this<00:03:37.260> together

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
typically a door put all this together

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.509 
typically a door put all this together
real<00:03:37.920> good<00:03:39.019> it's<00:03:40.019> really<00:03:40.260> simple<00:03:40.650> on<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.340> top

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
real good it's really simple on the top

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.039 
real good it's really simple on the top
you<00:03:41.700> got<00:03:41.849> this<00:03:41.970> 2<00:03:42.180> by<00:03:42.330> 2<00:03:43.159> trans<00:03:44.159> clear<00:03:44.489> plate

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
you got this 2 by 2 trans clear plate

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.009 
you got this 2 by 2 trans clear plate
oddly<00:03:46.049> enough<00:03:46.280> it's<00:03:47.280> hard<00:03:47.659> those<00:03:48.659> things<00:03:48.900> are

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
oddly enough it's hard those things are

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.140 
oddly enough it's hard those things are
hard<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.230> come<00:03:49.440> by<00:03:49.500> sometimes<00:03:50.099> these<00:03:50.310> are<00:03:50.519> 2<00:03:51.030> by

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
hard to come by sometimes these are 2 by

it we're going to show team right this
is<00:04:14.140> the<00:04:14.260> car<00:04:14.470> and<00:04:14.620> Caravan<00:04:15.069> set<00:04:15.370> the<00:04:15.790> modern

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
is the car and Caravan set the modern

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.949 
is the car and Caravan set the modern
one<00:04:17.130> you<00:04:18.130> see<00:04:18.310> the<00:04:18.459> car<00:04:18.730> it's<00:04:19.570> a<00:04:19.630> different

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
one you see the car it's a different

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.970 
one you see the car it's a different
color<00:04:21.090> but<00:04:22.090> it's<00:04:22.540> got<00:04:22.720> a<00:04:22.750> similar<00:04:23.020> style<00:04:23.740> to<00:04:23.950> it

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
color but it's got a similar style to it

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.159 
color but it's got a similar style to it
and<00:04:26.980> in<00:04:27.430> the<00:04:27.520> caravan<00:04:27.820> it<00:04:28.270> has<00:04:28.450> similar<00:04:28.870> style

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
and in the caravan it has similar style

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.170 
and in the caravan it has similar style
to<00:04:29.320> it<00:04:29.350> you<00:04:29.560> got<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:29.860> windows<00:04:30.220> and<00:04:30.940> you<00:04:31.030> got

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
to it you got the windows and you got

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.010 
to it you got the windows and you got
the<00:04:31.300> piece<00:04:31.510> on<00:04:31.720> the<00:04:31.750> top<00:04:32.070> that<00:04:33.840> corresponds<00:04:34.840> to

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
the piece on the top that corresponds to

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.340 
the piece on the top that corresponds to
the<00:04:35.580> event<00:04:36.580> I<00:04:36.880> guess<00:04:37.120> it<00:04:37.990> just<00:04:38.200> has<00:04:38.320> more

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
the event I guess it just has more

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.190 
the event I guess it just has more
wheels<00:04:38.910> and<00:04:39.910> you<00:04:40.030> get<00:04:40.210> minifigures<00:04:40.900> of<00:04:41.020> course

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
wheels and you get minifigures of course

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.080 
wheels and you get minifigures of course
this<00:04:41.290> was<00:04:41.500> made<00:04:41.710> before<00:04:41.950> the<00:04:42.550> minifig<00:04:42.910> so

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
this was made before the minifig so

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.820 
this was made before the minifig so
we're<00:04:43.240> gonna<00:04:43.389> build<00:04:43.540> this<00:04:43.780> set<00:04:44.320> which<00:04:44.500> is<00:04:44.650> also

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
we're gonna build this set which is also

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.010 
we're gonna build this set which is also
called<00:04:45.610> car<00:04:46.180> and<00:04:46.479> care<00:04:46.660> of<00:04:46.750> it

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
called car and care of it

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.350 
called car and care of it
44:35<00:04:48.270> okay<00:04:49.270> so<00:04:50.100> shows<00:04:51.100> you<00:04:51.280> how<00:04:51.639> far<00:04:51.910> Legos

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
44:35 okay so shows you how far Legos

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.860 
44:35 okay so shows you how far Legos
come<00:04:52.660> in<00:04:53.220> 38<00:04:54.220> or<00:04:54.760> so<00:04:54.910> years<00:04:55.180> I<00:04:55.330> think<00:04:55.510> this<00:04:55.630> is

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
come in 38 or so years I think this is
