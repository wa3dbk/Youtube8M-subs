Hi dears, welcome to the next episode of "5 questions to...". I know that it's your favorite series so I'm trying to

00:00:19.295 --> 00:00:26.200
answer the questions I get from you. Now we've decided to change it a little bit. If you could leave your questions on instagram

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:33.000
by hashtagging #QAMacademianGirl. Let's move to the questions, I'm gonna tell you the details at the end.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Question #1, from Mariusz: What do you think of subdued looks, dark colors or regular outfits? 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
As weird as it seems, I'm not a hater and Spanish Inquisition to be able to account you for having a sufficient number of 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
rings, bracelets and if your outfit fits the Macademian standards. Relax. I don't have anything against

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.000
someone wearing a grey sack. Go on! You're having a bad day, or it's just your style... There's room for everyone.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And of course, I encourage you to wear colors, but please, let it be up to you.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
As you can see, men are really popular in this episode - question #2 is from another gentleman, Szymon asked me:

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.000
"Do a lot of men visit your blog? have you ever considered creating looks for men as well?"

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.000
To be honest, I think it would be a hard task, as I don't have a model to dress up. Although I think that a few of my friends

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:45.000
would love to get such a makeover. For now I focus on being ZEN, doing one thing but in a very good way, so I dress myself, as 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I know myself the most. I understand my style and that's what I'm tring to show you. Do a lot of men visit my blog? You would  be surprised!

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:06.000
As on FB these numbers are really clear, 90 % of my fans are female, 10 is men, on the blog it's 55 % of women and 45 % of men!

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.500
Is a Macademian gentleman here as well?

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:19.500
Question #3, a culinary one: Do you have your favorite restaurant? If so, where is it, and is one of them in Szczecin?

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:27.500
I definitely have some favorite places in Warsaw, but excuse me, I'm not gonna tell you about them, as they're quite crowded

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:35.500
already, wheras in Szczecin it was Columbus, which is a chain coffee shop, but I had a short story with it, as I was its Szczecin  

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:48.500
ambassador and I think of it very warmly. That's where I was spending most of my afternoons... Ssss... yes, I use a lot of so called onomatopoeia.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:59.500
Eee, question #4, no, without 'eee'. Question #4, eeee. Eeee, one two three.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.500
I'm kind and charming!

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:12.500
Question #4 is a bit more complex: Your every blog, Instagram post in mega optimistic, it immediatedly gives good energy.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:20.500
I wonder if Macademian has bad days, when she hides under a blanket, and thinks "leave me alone", kiss my... trunk ;) 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:28.500
I really like the end of the sentence, especially that one could use an 'a-word' here ;)

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:35.500
I do have those days. I am human, really, believe me. I sometimes watch 8 movies in a row and have cocoa.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:43.500
Well, I'm gonna film a vlog about my ways of dealing with a bad mood. 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:50.500
I sometimes really feel like looking in the mirror and saying: "No, it's not your day, go and hide!" :) And I sometimes do.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:57.500
There's no help when it comes to such days. Make yourself some tea, watch a nice movie, and just go to sleep. 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:08.000
It really helps for everything and it's a golden Macademian tip. Sleep cures every fuck-up!

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000
We've only got question #5 left, and I think it's a matter that only girls would find interesting, let's not cheat ourselves ;)

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Do you do your own make-up when you go out? Or do you have it done? I hope you answer my question. I really like

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
you, you're incredibly colorful! I'm going to answer with pleasure. As you know, I do my own everyday make-up, for the blog photoshoots

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and so on. But when I have to focus on going somewhere and not tripping :), which happened to me once, fortunally not on such

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:49.000
a public event, thanks God, I think that the tabloids would be very happy about such a situation.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:59.000
All in all, my so called good fairy, and the gotmother of all of my make-ups is the Atelier Stylissimo Team, namely Marta Iwańska

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:10.000
and Marta Zawiślańska. You know Marta Iwańska as Doktor Make Up, and she actually is like a doktor make up.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:19.000
When I have a bad day, I don't feel like doing anything and Iook like, well, let's say not like a Hollywood star, she has the 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
ability to make me a person that I would actually like to meet and admire in magazines.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Dears, it's the end of today's episode, the last question always comes with nostalgy, but I hope that it  

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.500
boosts your apetite. Remember that we've decided to change the way of collecting questions; 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:45.500
from now on, I'd like to meet you some more, namely: please leave your questions on Instagram with a #QAMacademianGirl hashtag. 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:54.500
And hashtag your question with a selfie. Show me your faces! I want to know who's asking and who I'm talking to.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:02.500
I thinkt that it would be a cool way of livening up the blog community a bit more. I hope you like it! And what? I'm waiting

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.500
for your Instagram hashtags! Ask me whatever you want! See you!

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.500
