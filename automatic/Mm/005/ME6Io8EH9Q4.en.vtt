00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.730 
fast then they didn't have to worry
about<00:02:05.880> image<00:02:06.329> sensors<00:02:06.689> in<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.380> computer

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
about image sensors in the computer

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.139 
about image sensors in the computer
technology<00:02:07.860> getting<00:02:08.459> better<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.910> better

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
technology getting better and better

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.150 
technology getting better and better
when<00:02:09.660> something<00:02:09.989> got<00:02:10.110> better<00:02:10.379> they

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
when something got better they

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.120 
when something got better they
introduced<00:02:11.610> the

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
introduced the

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.710 
introduced the
years<00:02:12.250> down<00:02:12.460> the<00:02:12.640> road<00:02:12.670> they<00:02:12.940> started<00:02:13.300> working

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
years down the road they started working

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.810 
years down the road they started working
on<00:02:13.810> these<00:02:13.990> things<00:02:14.050> really<00:02:14.710> quick<00:02:14.980> so<00:02:15.490> a<00:02:15.520> new

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
on these things really quick so a new

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.520 
on these things really quick so a new
body<00:02:16.060> would<00:02:16.330> come<00:02:16.540> out<00:02:16.720> then<00:02:17.170> they<00:02:17.290> would<00:02:17.410> be

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
body would come out then they would be

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.200 
body would come out then they would be
like<00:02:17.560> oh<00:02:17.800> we've<00:02:18.010> got<00:02:18.190> this<00:02:18.400> technology<00:02:19.030> so

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
like oh we've got this technology so

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.450 
like oh we've got this technology so
we're<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.750> f3<00:02:20.110> didn't<00:02:20.380> have<00:02:20.500> autofocus<00:02:21.160> the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
we're the f3 didn't have autofocus the

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.460 
we're the f3 didn't have autofocus the
f4<00:02:21.850> started<00:02:22.270> to<00:02:22.330> have<00:02:22.450> autofocus<00:02:23.140> the

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
f4 started to have autofocus the

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.580 
f4 started to have autofocus the
metering<00:02:23.980> systems<00:02:24.520> got<00:02:24.730> better<00:02:25.060> the

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
metering systems got better the

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.930 
metering systems got better the
mechanisms<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:27.250> don't<00:02:27.490> know<00:02:27.550> if<00:02:27.640> they<00:02:27.760> got

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
mechanisms I don't know if they got

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.420 
mechanisms I don't know if they got
better<00:02:28.150> but<00:02:28.390> this<00:02:28.540> f5<00:02:29.110> is<00:02:29.380> almost<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.160> perfect

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
better but this f5 is almost the perfect

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.530 
better but this f5 is almost the perfect
film<00:02:31.060> camera<00:02:31.510> one<00:02:31.930> of<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:32.290> best<00:02:33.300> one<00:02:34.300> of<00:02:34.330> the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
it is such a brick s house it is so

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.380 
it is such a brick s house it is so
heavy<00:02:41.290> there<00:02:41.920> are<00:02:42.100> some<00:02:42.310> issues<00:02:42.460> with<00:02:42.730> it<00:02:43.060> not

aperture up here and your shutter down
here<00:02:48.400> when<00:02:48.550> you<00:02:48.640> went<00:02:48.820> vertical<00:02:49.300> you<00:02:49.780> didn't

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
here when you went vertical you didn't

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.720 
here when you went vertical you didn't
have<00:02:50.230> those<00:02:50.410> controls<00:02:50.860> for<00:02:51.280> some<00:02:51.490> odd<00:02:51.700> reason

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
have those controls for some odd reason

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.030 
have those controls for some odd reason
they<00:02:52.210> didn't<00:02:52.450> put<00:02:52.630> them<00:02:52.720> in<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.080> body<00:02:53.320> I<00:02:53.590> don't

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
they didn't put them in the body I don't

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.230 
they didn't put them in the body I don't
know<00:02:54.190> why<00:02:54.370> but<00:02:54.610> that's<00:02:54.700> not<00:02:54.940> what<00:02:55.060> this<00:02:55.180> is

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
know why but that's not what this is

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.210 
know why but that's not what this is
about<00:02:55.390> it's<00:02:56.020> just<00:02:56.260> telling<00:02:56.470> you<00:02:56.710> that<00:02:56.740> the

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
about it's just telling you that the

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.340 
about it's just telling you that the
difference<00:02:57.670> between<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:58.240> film<00:02:58.540> days<00:02:58.810> when

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
difference between the film days when

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.320 
difference between the film days when
the<00:02:59.470> cameras<00:02:59.860> every<00:03:00.430> eight<00:03:00.640> years<00:03:00.970> we<00:03:01.180> would

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
the cameras every eight years we would

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.270 
the cameras every eight years we would
get<00:03:01.450> a<00:03:01.510> new<00:03:01.690> one<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:01.990> now<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:02.440> digital<00:03:02.800> days

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
get a new one and now the digital days

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.980 
get a new one and now the digital days
where<00:03:03.460> every<00:03:03.640> two<00:03:03.880> years<00:03:03.910> they're<00:03:04.450> replacing

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
where every two years they're replacing

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.780 
where every two years they're replacing
the<00:03:05.080> pro<00:03:05.290> bodies<00:03:05.680> with<00:03:06.070> a<00:03:06.100> next<00:03:06.580> generation

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
the pro bodies with a next generation

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.340 
the pro bodies with a next generation
just<00:03:07.270> a<00:03:07.330> little<00:03:07.630> bit<00:03:07.720> of<00:03:07.840> a<00:03:07.900> checkup

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
just a little bit of a checkup

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.470 
just a little bit of a checkup
I<00:03:08.500> think<00:03:08.830> they<00:03:08.950> did<00:03:09.100> that<00:03:09.130> with<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.490> f4<00:03:09.910> right

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
I think they did that with the f4 right

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.510 
I think they did that with the f4 right
they<00:03:10.630> had<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:10.840> f4<00:03:11.200> then<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.470> f-4s<00:03:11.920> that's

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
they had the f4 then the f-4s that's

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.230 
they had the f4 then the f-4s that's
possible

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
possible

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.090 
possible
I<00:03:13.270> didn't<00:03:14.050> look<00:03:14.110> that<00:03:14.290> one<00:03:14.440> up<00:03:14.590> but<00:03:14.740> anyway

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
I didn't look that one up but anyway

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.480 
I didn't look that one up but anyway
eight<00:03:16.090> years<00:03:16.480> you<00:03:16.600> never<00:03:16.720> had<00:03:16.930> an<00:03:17.020> f5<00:03:17.380> s<00:03:17.620> that<00:03:18.460> I

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
eight years you never had an f5 s that I

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.700 
eight years you never had an f5 s that I
know<00:03:18.610> of<00:03:18.850> so<00:03:19.030> so<00:03:19.510> you've<00:03:19.660> had<00:03:19.780> four<00:03:20.200> cameras

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.710 
know of so so you've had four cameras

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.060 
know of so so you've had four cameras
since<00:03:21.090> 1980<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.480> F<00:03:22.630> three<00:03:23.050> four<00:03:23.380> five<00:03:23.770> and
