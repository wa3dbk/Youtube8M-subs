00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 Hey guys, how are you ? 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.890
 and today I wanted a little one 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.089
 update to the winter patch of 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.099
 battlefield 4 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.540
 which has only recently been leased 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.230
 many have asked me recently 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.620
 in the live stream 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.570
 like that with the downside age elements 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.430
 as part of the reticule setting 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.660
 now is and how the heli physics 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.160
 works now and there I am 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.619
 thought that now shows us just yet 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.180
 in this little video in the frame of the 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.550
 Winter patches were also made adjustments 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.560
 in the helicopter physics that did 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.810
 whole was already known from the city 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.000
 is now in live gameplay and have there 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.680
 now the possibility with the attack job 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.489
 So this refers only to the e 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.649
 tec job was 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.030
 various maneuvers to fly in advance 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.010
 were not possible and for the 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.690
 but hey have asked in real life 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.960
 is that possible as well as you could 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.059
 Here you see, for example, make a barrel around it 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.160
 also dodge enemy fire and 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.170
 We also have other funny art pieces here 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.390
 Looks that were not possible before 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.120
 and you would have crashed 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.500
 So he could do it now, for example 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.840
 various situations if you are under 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.090
 fire since just too if you 're from tv 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.330
 Rockets will fire better 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.830
 Dodge or combat helicopter 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.869
 dodging differently with those acting differently 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.250
 and so in the air slaughter completely new 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.990
 and bring it in a different way for him 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.880
 and if you have a helicopter 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.280
 Even I do not really squat 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.840
 diehard helicopter pilot he remembers 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.659
 but the difference that the control 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.430
 yes, a little bit buttery reacts 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:29.900
 and you're more in control of that 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:32.520
 two-wheeled okay people we come to the end 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.619
 So it has the attitude to the people 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.000
 can do now if you on one 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.729
 opponents full and different 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.560
 Colors of a crosshair and the hit 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.110
 Create markers can find the whole thing 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.030
 then under options then gameplay and 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.649
 if you have under their scrooge 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.630
 different possibilities the first 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.390
 interesting are soldier air fire 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.920
 target image so you put your hip fire 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.570
 is when the shoots from the hip 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.070
 by default I know that 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.180
 have the time now to know you then 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.189
 to show you what types of agp 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.880
 elements with the respective color 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.310
 effect 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.299
 The next aspect is down on must 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.069
 a little scroll down here 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.360
 whole vehicle things but I go there 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.640
 Of course here only on the infantry 1 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.250
 is the hit indicator that is the 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.590
 default hit display if you 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.020
 the hit on an opponent 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.510
 player does it except it's on 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.800
 header hits all other hits 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.960
 processed hereby 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.190
 right now I have it on green here 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.080
 have the whole thing on green so if I have 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.360
 a hit on the opponent except for one 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.730
 hit the head 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.380
 then the hit is displayed in green 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.390
 below, of course, we have here 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.950
 the color, the set I could have 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.990
 the whole as I said on green if we 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.670
 we have to go down a bit 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.620
 here color match for 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.900
 head hit that is an exception that 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.890
 I put this on yellow here 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.440
 is called every time I do one 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.450
 header hits churches yellow hit 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.840
 Brand on the player and if we still have one 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.030
 a little further down we have 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.600
 Here color match for perfect 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.950
 shots 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.660
 there was always a bit like that now 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.830
 crux you do not have to know exactly what is 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.750
 perfect shot and what one 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.810
 head shot perfect shot I have 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.640
 put on red is the shot of the 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.620
 that means killing that means if I am now 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.780
 For example, opponent under shoots 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.400
 the and then the shots in the belly 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.800
 then that's more normal 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.019
 a green market because I'm just the 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.370
 belly hit and not the head but then 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.660
 the last shot is a red one 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.850
 market I will show you now but still 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.709
 an example very good moore lot 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.150
 has been a crash test in a nice way 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.320
 dummy have made available me 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.000
 a little bit can shoot at him and 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.860
 as you can see I have the white one 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.870
 crosshair in Hofweier and if I as 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.070
 shots on the body gives the see 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.360
 I hit the green hit mark before 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.890
 when I set it all up 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.540
 the head makes you see the yellow holds 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.220
 brand that did not stop that 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.900
 whole is a combination of money 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.970
 Heidmarker any other body parts 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.290
 Green and the last shot I 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.940
 Killed opponent to kill is 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.170
 red no matter which body zones 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.640
 whether head of the breast or something else yes 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.930
 and that was it again 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.850
 this video i hope it has you 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.440
 We liked a bit far helped or 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.120
 also enlightened write it and the 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.040
 comments what you think of the changes 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.680
 So far, keep patch in winter 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.269
 has played and what colors you in 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.480
 your crosshair uses in this sense 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.480
 was
