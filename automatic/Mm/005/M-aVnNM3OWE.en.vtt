00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.799
 John 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:16.910
 7 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:20.240
 Today I am Mayan I tried to beat the 10th apostle Zelle El ass 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.830
 Brief explanation to those who do not know the original 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:27.720
 10th apostle Zerueru is to 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:31.680
 It is the strongest enemy in Evangelion 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.580
 You're doing a lot of trouble with Evangelion 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.930
 In it has the strength to not be outdone in the original 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.930
 ss Let's take a look 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:52.410
 Yes it is about 690,000 damage 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:57.840
 I think it's a bit subtle, but this one failed to beat 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:00.620
 So when you hit straight to the weak point, the tentacles come to Japan 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.620
 Because it hits 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:09.880
 It is such a feeling It extends damage to such a feeling 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.880
 Let's look at one more pattern 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:20.970
 Yes please hit the weakness straight and clean 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.970
 Clean against the weakness 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:31.680
 It is Kimgon if you control it, yes from 9th place about 1450,000 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:36.210
 Yes I'm silent when I'm hygienic but I'm a little lonely 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.740
 Yes I like this a Consider status 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.810
 I 'm thinking differently but I'm analyzing 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.690
 It's about Odin- 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:52.780
 It is about the same status as Osiris 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:55.940
 So I think if it's a damaged ball, it seems that I can not adjust it a little 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:59.000
 The following is my personal forecast 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:03.670
 It is a typographical error before 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.190
 Izanami Kushinada mountain bamboo Izanagi Tsukuyomi 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.479
 Gravity barriers are available except for Izanagi 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:13.769
 This time I met Schuler 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:19.170
 We've been able to point of view filled me Bishamon Although all 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:20.780
 It has been done with damage goals , so from now on damage balls 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.900
 Transcendence 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:31.650
 It 's my personal impression that it isn't going to happen 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:34.350
 I think I will overthrow, so I want to make it without waiting for luck . 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.770
 At the strength of the stable satellite states and 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:43.040
 Good balance of status White explosion l 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:46.879
 I wonder which one is a very first class product 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:52.599
 Yes it was an introduction to the 10th apostle Zeruel 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:52.599
 Thank you for watching still so I 'm happy I
