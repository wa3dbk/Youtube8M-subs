00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360
 all right 

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.360
 Y 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:17.070
 7 654 thanks 321 we go there 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.320
 very good how much you do not play 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.110
 sabotage 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.860
 the boot that you can do in the black ops 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:31.349
 many many years many years ago 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.790
 that comes out a game to the best that I 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.290
 starting questions yes but I think that 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.730
 it was also your fault because digital 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.950
 they are something different 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.420
 it's always my fault but when it's a 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.270
 movie of a video and that kind of thing 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.890
 how do you know him 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.180
 it's the fastest game in history 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.180
 it's a three hour video 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:59.710
 really what they will give us for 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.200
 to vary 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.049
 in the pump if you have the pump but you have 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.270
 eaten eaten crumbs and then there is one 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.740
 behind 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.220
 pegas 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.180
 but what can kill him I leave here 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:20.970
 nothing nothing the bomb is restless 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:20.970
 quiet do not put the bomb 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.970
 and it was up saving good there's 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:32.210
 I know, but I think I 'm inside 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.630
 I have the pump 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.159
 the welcome is to come with me 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.520
 It abounded at the end and I entered by the 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.170
 window the fastest game run 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.399
 I think that we are 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.600
 waiting for willis look more 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.720
 effectively 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:53.640
 let's get out of there come on going to do 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.479
 your things do not put them I put it 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.159
 opening 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.990
 and now if you have a little rachet it would be 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.869
 ideal if we go on a death streak 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.450
 I have because another stream what is 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.460
 is changing in the background there is a desire where 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.130
 he is dead 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.780
 and disable 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.210
 I have also put a clinic so that 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.120
 we deliver here and I put another 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.370
 burn someone you know it I know 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.959
 and his team disappeared more 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.959
 It hurts the bomb has killed 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:33.099
 in the area 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:35.530
 this next no shit I steal after 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.889
 mistake no one can make you miss 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.889
 failed 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.500
 the day 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:50.740
 sabotage is the best way to play 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.740
 and attics 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.709
 behind 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:05.440
 Hey, now I have the bomb 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.440
 help me help me 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:14.330

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.220

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.080
