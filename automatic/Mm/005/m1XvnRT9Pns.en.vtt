00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
let's get started I'm using Ruby ink and

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.180 
let's get started I'm using Ruby ink and
I'm<00:00:38.579> going<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.790> go<00:00:38.910> ahead<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.770> stamp<00:00:40.770> my<00:00:40.980> merry

I'm going to go ahead and stamp my merry
and<00:00:41.340> bright<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.579> again<00:00:42.059> on<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.140> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
and bright and again on this on the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.440 
and bright and again on this on the
stamp<00:00:43.770> set<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.160> tells<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.670> what<00:00:44.700> size<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.270> cut

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
stamp set it tells you what size to cut

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.910 
stamp set it tells you what size to cut
that<00:00:45.570> ticket<00:00:45.960> out<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.559> will<00:00:46.680> match

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
that ticket out so that it will match

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.770 
that ticket out so that it will match
perfectly<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.789> think<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:48.270> two<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.629> half

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
perfectly I think it's two and a half

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.139 
perfectly I think it's two and a half
actually<00:00:49.050> this<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> long<00:00:50.430> stamp<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:51.000> mean

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
actually this is a long stamp I mean

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.880 
actually this is a long stamp I mean
it's<00:00:51.300> like<00:00:51.480> five<00:00:51.660> inches<00:00:51.840> long<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.620> went

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
it's like five inches long so I went

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.590 
it's like five inches long so I went
ahead<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.160> did<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.430> four-by-eight<00:00:53.879> card<00:00:54.329> so

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600

going to see took a look said I need

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.609 
going to see took a look said I need
some<00:01:04.470> more<00:01:04.880> so<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.750> decide<00:01:07.310> how<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.340> do<00:01:08.970> that

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
some more so to decide how to do that

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.440 
some more so to decide how to do that
now<00:01:10.619> at<00:01:11.100> first<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.549> was<00:01:11.670> very<00:01:11.700> happy<00:01:12.030> with<00:01:12.299> how

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
now at first I was very happy with how

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.109 
now at first I was very happy with how
this<00:01:12.600> turned<00:01:12.659> out<00:01:13.310> and<00:01:14.310> then<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.580> noticed<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:15.000> had

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
this turned out and then I noticed I had

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.120 
this turned out and then I noticed I had
a<00:01:15.150> little<00:01:15.390> glop<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.810> ink<00:01:16.229> on<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.770> right<00:01:16.890> hand

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
a little glop of ink on the right hand

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.770 
a little glop of ink on the right hand
side<00:01:17.280> which<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.909> probably<00:01:18.150> can't<00:01:18.450> even<00:01:18.509> see

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
side which you probably can't even see

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.020 
side which you probably can't even see
in<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:18.990> video<00:01:19.140> but<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.799> didn't<00:01:20.580> like<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.700> so

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
in this video but I didn't like that so

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.179 
in this video but I didn't like that so
I<00:01:21.270> went<00:01:21.479> ahead<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.689> we<00:01:22.530> stamp<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.040> you'll

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
I went ahead and we stamp that so you'll

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.289 
I went ahead and we stamp that so you'll
see<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.490> later<00:01:24.619> in<00:01:25.619> case<00:01:25.860> you're<00:01:26.159> wondering

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
see that later in case you're wondering

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.330 
see that later in case you're wondering
all<00:01:27.299> right<00:01:27.689> now<00:01:28.200> just<00:01:28.799> going<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.009> go<00:01:29.130> ahead<00:01:29.220> and

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
all right now just going to go ahead and

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.219 
all right now just going to go ahead and
put<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.640> card<00:01:29.850> together<00:01:30.030> as<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.810> showed<00:01:31.049> at<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
put the card together as I showed at the

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.350 
put the card together as I showed at the
beginning<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.920> cut<00:01:32.250> these<00:01:32.490> tickets<00:01:32.820> shapes<00:01:33.119> and

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
beginning I cut these tickets shapes and

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.880 
beginning I cut these tickets shapes and
a<00:01:33.390> number<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.840> sizes<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.320> i<00:01:34.350> could<00:01:34.590> just<00:01:34.710> go

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
a number of sizes so i could just go

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.399 
a number of sizes so i could just go
ahead<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.189> layer<00:01:35.640> them<00:01:35.670> on<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.930> front<00:01:37.079> of

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
ahead and layer them on the front of

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.940 
ahead and layer them on the front of
this<00:01:37.560> ticket<00:01:37.740> shape<00:01:38.100> card<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:39.409> pretty<00:01:40.409> simple

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
this ticket shape card so pretty simple

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.980 
this ticket shape card so pretty simple
and<00:01:41.130> again<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.909> card<00:01:42.150> measures<00:01:42.659> when<00:01:42.899> you

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
and again the card measures when you

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.660 
and again the card measures when you
fold<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.320> four<00:01:43.560> by<00:01:43.740> eight<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.189> it's<00:01:44.220> going<00:01:44.579> to

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
fold it four by eight so it's going to

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.190 
fold it four by eight so it's going to
fit<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.119> standard<00:01:45.630> business<00:01:45.840> size

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
fit in the standard business size

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
through the button and then make a

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.940 
through the button and then make a
