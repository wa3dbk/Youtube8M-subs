black<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.710> what<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.920> company<00:00:32.189> um

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460

sort of promotes this product as it's a

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.819 
sort of promotes this product as it's a
healthier<00:00:36.120> water<00:00:36.390> because<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.930> pH<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.559> more

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
healthier water because the pH is more

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.830 
healthier water because the pH is more
alkaline<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.550> it's<00:00:38.940> alkaline<00:00:39.390> because<00:00:39.690> of

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
alkaline and it's alkaline because of

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.940 
alkaline and it's alkaline because of
the<00:00:39.960> folic<00:00:40.890> acid<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.570> in<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.350> infused

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
the folic acid and in it that is infused

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.350 
the folic acid and in it that is infused
with<00:00:44.100> some<00:00:44.309> more<00:00:44.430> trace<00:00:44.640> minerals<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.210> things

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
with some more trace minerals and things

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.740 
with some more trace minerals and things
like<00:00:45.510> that

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
like that

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.060 
like that
and<00:00:45.960> it's<00:00:46.289> supposed<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.530> give<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.890> much

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
and it's supposed to give you a much

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.619 
and it's supposed to give you a much
better<00:00:47.430> hydration<00:00:48.030> that's<00:00:48.300> what<00:00:48.420> they<00:00:48.510> claim

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
better hydration that's what they claim

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.770 
better hydration that's what they claim
I<00:00:48.899> don't<00:00:49.559> really<00:00:49.800> think<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.780> that's

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
I don't really think that that's

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.139 
I don't really think that that's
necessarily<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.289> case<00:00:52.350> while<00:00:52.850> it's<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.940> little

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
necessarily the case while it's a little

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.369 
necessarily the case while it's a little
bit<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.329> hype<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.690> think<00:00:54.930> with<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.199> fall<00:00:55.350> of

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
bit of hype I think with the fall of

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.200 
bit of hype I think with the fall of
guests<00:00:55.620> because<00:00:55.800> we<00:00:55.949> don't<00:00:56.129> as<00:00:56.309> humans<00:00:56.670> we

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
guests because we don't as humans we

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.439 
guests because we don't as humans we
don't<00:00:57.239> really<00:00:57.570> require<00:00:57.949> phobic<00:00:58.949> acid<00:00:59.309> in<00:01:00.239> our

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
don't really require phobic acid in our

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.420 
don't really require phobic acid in our
diet<00:01:00.690> but<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.739> something<00:01:02.010> that's<00:01:02.129> been

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
diet but it is something that's been

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.549 
diet but it is something that's been
that<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.120> infused<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.930> here<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.229> give<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.409> and

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
that is infused to here to give it and

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.780 
that is infused to here to give it and
that's<00:01:04.710> what<00:01:04.830> gives<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.189> sort<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.489> strange

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
that's what gives this sort of strange

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.920 
that's what gives this sort of strange
color<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:06.900> um<00:01:07.760> excuse<00:01:08.760> me<00:01:08.790> but<00:01:08.909> uh<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.689> general

color but um excuse me but uh in general
if<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.729> product<00:01:12.060> itself<00:01:12.299> tastes<00:01:12.689> just

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
if the so the product itself tastes just

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.330 
if the so the product itself tastes just
like<00:01:12.930> water<00:01:13.049> doesn't<00:01:13.680> taste<00:01:13.799> like<00:01:13.950> this

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
like water doesn't taste like this

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.700 
like water doesn't taste like this
actually<00:01:14.790> even<00:01:15.270> though<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.390> looks<00:01:15.509> gross<00:01:15.750> it

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
actually even though it looks gross it

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.530 
actually even though it looks gross it
tastes<00:01:17.009> just<00:01:17.070> like<00:01:17.220> water<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.820> can't<00:01:18.330> taste

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
tastes just like water you can't taste

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.760 
tastes just like water you can't taste
the<00:01:18.720> foam<00:01:18.840> again<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.259> can't<00:01:19.470> taste<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
the foam again so you can't taste the

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.490 
the foam again so you can't taste the
minerals<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.700> at<00:01:20.850> all<00:01:20.970> actually<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.990> liked

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
minerals in it at all actually I liked

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.070 
minerals in it at all actually I liked
it<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.600> anything<00:01:24.600> that's<00:01:24.720> going<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.930> raise

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
it and anything that's going to raise

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.719 
it and anything that's going to raise
Phe<00:01:25.530> things<00:01:25.770> going<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.040> any<00:01:26.310> kind<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.520> water

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
Phe things going to any kind of water

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.730 
Phe things going to any kind of water
that's<00:01:26.880> going<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.090> have<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.479> more<00:01:28.049> alkaline<00:01:28.229> pH

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
that's going to have a more alkaline pH

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.200 
that's going to have a more alkaline pH
is<00:01:28.890> going<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.100> be<00:01:29.189> healthy<00:01:29.490> for<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.790> healthier

water as everybody knows is a critical
point<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:49.020> health<00:01:49.290> we<00:01:50.100> need<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.430> do<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.700> to

point of health we need to do that to

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.149

like<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.860> those<00:01:56.009> things<00:01:56.130> are<00:01:56.310> critical

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
like that and those things are critical

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.780 
like that and those things are critical
but<00:01:57.710> doing<00:01:58.710> using<00:01:59.040> products<00:01:59.369> like<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.640> I

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
but doing using products like this I

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.030 
but doing using products like this I
think<00:01:59.850> is<00:02:00.119> as<00:02:00.570> an<00:02:00.780> additive<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.590> don't<00:02:01.920> know<00:02:01.979> if

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
think is as an additive I don't know if

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.130 
think is as an additive I don't know if
you<00:02:02.159> necessarily<00:02:02.579> have<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.939> use<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.390> ton<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:03.960> it

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
you necessarily have to use a ton of it

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.010 
you necessarily have to use a ton of it
but<00:02:05.009> it's<00:02:05.310> something<00:02:05.659> products<00:02:06.659> like<00:02:06.840> this

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
but it's something products like this

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.130 
but it's something products like this
that<00:02:07.469> include<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.099> help<00:02:08.280> encourage

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
that include that help encourage

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.170 
that include that help encourage
increasing<00:02:10.140> pH<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:11.099> slightly<00:02:11.430> alkaline<00:02:11.760> level

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
increasing pH to slightly alkaline level

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.270 
increasing pH to slightly alkaline level
would<00:02:12.269> be<00:02:12.299> is<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:13.170> think<00:02:13.230> ideal<00:02:13.680> for<00:02:13.920> optimal

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
would be is I think ideal for optimal

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.490 
would be is I think ideal for optimal
health<00:02:14.310> so<00:02:14.689> the<00:02:15.689> overall<00:02:15.989> review<00:02:16.140> for<00:02:16.409> this

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
health so the overall review for this

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.720 
health so the overall review for this
particular<00:02:16.709> product<00:02:17.069> I<00:02:17.250> think<00:02:17.430> it's<00:02:17.549> a<00:02:17.609> little

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
particular product I think it's a little

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:18.860 
particular product I think it's a little
bit<00:02:17.939> of<00:02:18.000> hype<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.329> was<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.510> little<00:02:18.719> expensive

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
bit of hype it was a little expensive

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.140 
bit of hype it was a little expensive
for<00:02:19.439> this<00:02:19.560> for<00:02:19.890> just<00:02:20.099> a<00:02:20.189> couple<00:02:20.310> of<00:02:20.489> gosh<00:02:21.000> I

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
for this for just a couple of gosh I

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.209 
for this for just a couple of gosh I
think<00:02:21.209> it<00:02:21.359> was<00:02:21.450> like<00:02:21.540> 16.9<00:02:22.530> ounces<00:02:22.560> which<00:02:23.069> is<00:02:23.189> a

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:23.219 
think it was like 16.9 ounces which is a

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:24.770 
think it was like 16.9 ounces which is a
pretty<00:02:23.430> good<00:02:23.489> size<00:02:23.760> I<00:02:23.939> guess<00:02:23.969> a<00:02:24.150> normal<00:02:24.569> size

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
pretty good size I guess a normal size

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.449 
pretty good size I guess a normal size
of<00:02:24.989> bottled<00:02:25.260> water<00:02:25.290> but<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:25.980> thought<00:02:26.219> it<00:02:26.340> was<00:02:26.400> a

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
of bottled water but I thought it was a

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.130 
of bottled water but I thought it was a
slightly<00:02:26.819> over<00:02:27.150> price<00:02:27.359> for<00:02:27.659> what<00:02:27.840> what<00:02:28.049> you

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
slightly over price for what what you

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.390 
slightly over price for what what you
guys<00:02:28.319> and<00:02:28.500> I<00:02:28.560> think<00:02:28.650> it's<00:02:28.920> a<00:02:28.980> little<00:02:29.069> bit<00:02:29.280> high

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
guys and I think it's a little bit high

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.729 
guys and I think it's a little bit high
but<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.480> product<00:02:30.810> itself<00:02:31.049> I<00:02:31.170> think<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.439> a<00:02:31.500> good

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
but the product itself I think is a good

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.699 
but the product itself I think is a good
product<00:02:31.950> from<00:02:32.189> the<00:02:32.310> standpoint<00:02:32.670> that<00:02:32.819> it's<00:02:33.150> a

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
product from the standpoint that it's a

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.099 
product from the standpoint that it's a
high<00:02:34.709> grade<00:02:35.010> premium<00:02:35.879> water<00:02:36.090> product<00:02:36.480> that

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:37.109 
high grade premium water product that

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:40.280 
high grade premium water product that
gives<00:02:37.409> you<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:38.069> health<00:02:39.060> benefit<00:02:39.450> with<00:02:39.689> with

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
gives you a health benefit with with

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.949 
gives you a health benefit with with
alkaline<00:02:40.769> pH<00:02:41.069> so<00:02:41.549> at<00:02:41.909> the<00:02:42.180> very<00:02:42.359> least<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:42.810> get

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
alkaline pH so at the very least you get

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.300 
alkaline pH so at the very least you get
that<00:02:43.109> I<00:02:43.349> don't<00:02:43.799> know<00:02:43.859> about<00:02:43.950> some<00:02:44.129> of<00:02:44.250> the

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
that I don't know about some of the

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.860 
that I don't know about some of the
other<00:02:44.400> claims<00:02:44.669> that<00:02:44.819> there<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.239> company<00:02:45.389> that

other claims that there the company that

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.159 
other claims that there the company that
the<00:02:45.989> company<00:02:46.019> offers<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:46.859> could<00:02:47.579> cure<00:02:47.849> they<00:02:48.810> say

the company offers I could cure they say

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.470 
the company offers I could cure they say
cures<00:02:49.500> or<00:02:50.159> not<00:02:50.310> cures<00:02:50.579> but<00:02:50.879> it<00:02:51.000> does<00:02:51.120> can<00:02:51.299> it

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
cures or not cures but it does can it

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.210 
cures or not cures but it does can it
can<00:02:51.599> help<00:02:51.720> with<00:02:51.780> like<00:02:52.079> hangovers<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.099> things

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
can help with like hangovers and things

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.619 
can help with like hangovers and things
like<00:02:53.340> that<00:02:53.400> but<00:02:53.639> I'm<00:02:54.060> not<00:02:54.180> convinced<00:02:54.599> that

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
like that but I'm not convinced that

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:56.089 
like that but I'm not convinced that
that's<00:02:54.810> really<00:02:55.049> the<00:02:55.139> case<00:02:55.200> I've<00:02:55.500> never<00:02:55.769> seen

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
that's really the case I've never seen

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.289 
that's really the case I've never seen
any<00:02:56.280> products<00:02:56.549> that<00:02:56.639> really<00:02:56.790> do<00:02:57.000> this<00:02:57.180> they

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
any products that really do this they

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:58.699 
any products that really do this they
claim<00:02:57.510> it

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
claim it

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.940 
claim it
so<00:02:59.129> anyways<00:02:59.430> um<00:02:59.700> blk<00:03:00.659> or<00:03:00.780> Blackwater<00:03:01.230> it's

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
so anyways um blk or Blackwater it's

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.399 
so anyways um blk or Blackwater it's
definitely<00:03:02.700> out<00:03:03.480> there<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:04.019> definitely<00:03:04.290> been

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
definitely out there and definitely been

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:05.479 
definitely out there and definitely been
promoted<00:03:04.739> by<00:03:04.799> a<00:03:04.829> lot<00:03:04.980> of<00:03:05.069> celebrities<00:03:05.459> and

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
promoted by a lot of celebrities and

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.250 
promoted by a lot of celebrities and
things<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:05.939> I<00:03:06.000> think<00:03:06.209> it's<00:03:06.299> a<00:03:06.540> reasonable

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
things and I think it's a reasonable
