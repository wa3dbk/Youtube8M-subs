one<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.799> Dalton's<00:01:26.189> big<00:01:26.369> strategies

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
one of Dalton's big strategies

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.580 
one of Dalton's big strategies
throughout<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.450> fireball<00:01:27.869> on<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.049> screen<00:01:28.320> and

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
throughout a fireball on the screen and

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.140 
throughout a fireball on the screen and
then<00:01:28.680> uses<00:01:29.040> aerial<00:01:29.310> teleport<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.850> get<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
then uses aerial teleport to get to the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.530 
then uses aerial teleport to get to the
other<00:01:30.240> side<00:01:30.479> now<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.500> changes<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.479> sort<00:01:33.479> of

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
other side now this changes a sort of

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.700 
other side now this changes a sort of
threat<00:01:33.840> level<00:01:34.490> much<00:01:35.490> higher<00:01:36.290> so<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.350> can<00:01:37.530> throw

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
threat level much higher so I can throw

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.310 
threat level much higher so I can throw
a<00:01:37.740> fireball<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.549> usually<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.930> know<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.170> best

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
a fireball and usually you know the best

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.399 
a fireball and usually you know the best
you<00:01:40.470> can<00:01:40.560> do<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.860> like<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.280> little<00:01:41.610> combo<00:01:42.409> once

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
you can do is like a little combo once

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.899 
you can do is like a little combo once
you<00:01:43.500> go<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.799> other<00:01:43.920> side

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:53.990 

but<00:01:48.619> now<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.649> can<00:01:50.450> bust<00:01:51.450> out<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:52.340> lot<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.609> I'm<00:01:53.850> just

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
but now I can bust out a lot so I'm just

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.639 
but now I can bust out a lot so I'm just
beat<00:01:54.179> me<00:01:54.210> up<00:01:54.390> here<00:01:54.569> a<00:01:54.600> little<00:01:54.780> bit<00:01:54.929> and<00:01:55.500> i'll

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
beat me up here a little bit and i'll

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.999 
beat me up here a little bit and i'll
see<00:01:55.799> if<00:01:55.920> i<00:01:56.009> can<00:01:56.189> avoid<00:01:56.490> scrubbing<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.210> out

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
see if i can avoid scrubbing this out

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:06.410 
see if i can avoid scrubbing this out
more<00:02:00.079> there<00:02:01.079> we<00:02:01.200> go<00:02:01.319> so<00:02:02.959> I<00:02:04.909> drilled<00:02:05.909> away<00:02:06.090> so
