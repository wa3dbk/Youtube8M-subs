00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.850
 get to a tutorial as judge 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.350
 I mean a desk 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.929
 standard is on the desk 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:14.250
 nothing to see and that's exactly what we want 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.440
 Changing the desk is part of the 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.630
 Wine 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.980
 That's why we need to be in the settings 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.640
 from the enemy 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.599
 it's just about that 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:32.450
 menu on fine and then settings 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.829
 or the key combination command comma 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.770
 It's always the same on the apple 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.200
 in all settings always with command 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.360
 komma gets that can be so 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:48.180
 if necessary, otherwise easy 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.739
 fine adjustments then appears 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.559
 new window 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.690
 these are our enemies attitudes and 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.230
 on the rider in general one sees the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.230
 spot these objects on the desk 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.530
 By default, external displays are 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.340
 to see hard disks eg a usb stick 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.439
 and of course connected ipods 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.890
 iphones or ipads or of course 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:18.180
 cds and dvds we want ours 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.430
 Hard disks see tick in and there 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.990
 is something already happening more weeks 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.390
 here we have nothing to do 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:29.840
 Close the enemies settings 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:33.290
 again with the ex or with command w 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.420
 so now we can still here 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.310
 make a few more settings 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.740
 we have to go to the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.229
 presentation options that goes all the way 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.159
 just hit the right mouse button 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.340
 the desk and then 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:54.149
 show presentation options 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:58.020
 there they are already these 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:01.219
 Settings are only valid now 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.719
 for my desk 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.570
 what can we do here in the upper 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:09.119
 third we can first the symbol 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.289
 I change size would now so 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.469
 a little bit 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.739
 pull up maybe 100 is good 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:18.989
 and then we are missing my opinion 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.939
 after a few more information 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.340
 and we can do this here below 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:27.209
 third under object info show 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:30.450
 activate tick in and see 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:33.209
 give some more details 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.900
 I do not wonder about these hard disks 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:40.909
 have three hard drives installed in this way 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:43.709
 with him could be the default 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:47.519
 macintosh hd is and should only be 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:50.609
 as a single object to be seen here 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.909
 So do not be surprised that happens when you 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:56.700
 has different hard drives 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:58.530
 Now we see under the hard drive how 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.139
 she is tall and how much I actually am 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.629
 still free but by point point 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:05.220
 point is the whole replaced because of 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.470
 space just is not enough 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.970
 can you here under grid distance the 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.439
 pull the regulator to the right and thus 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.250
 then you get the complete text 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:18.720
 See what I find very helpful 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.479
 Of course we can also change the text size 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.199
 Let's screw it up 

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:25.079
 13 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:28.650
 yes that's good enough from the place 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:31.260
 The name is always under the 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.030
 but how can you symbolize that? 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.889
 from the symbol let us know that 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.989
 is a matter of taste 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:39.690
 I'll just leave that up for a moment 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.310
 down because it has always been so 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.370
 had 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:47.000
 then there is one more 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.260
 sorting function by default you can 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.359
 let that on without 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.970
 There are the following options name 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:56.549
 Change date of manufacture last 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:00.329
 open added to the size art and 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:05.040
 Label I always prefer added 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:07.620
 in the day because if I now a new one 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.659
 add element for example a 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.000
 empty folder I'll do it now 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:15.120
 Right mouse button on the desk 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.389
 new folder that does not call me now 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.370
 now 1 times this always ends up 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:23.130
 right under the hard drives when i am 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:26.550
 now a second new folder 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.850
 because then this would be automatic 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.640
 between the second external hard disk 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.550
 and the first folder because it is 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:39.660
 yes current than my folder 1 I do 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:42.480
 now new folder 2 and you see 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.730
 that always the last one last 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.550
 added element always among the 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.530
 hard disks is so you need it 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.750
 never look for objects 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.990
 So that means if you have his 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:58.470
 desk used as a storage location 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.870
 then you have the opportunity here something 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.920
 better to sort but that is one 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.740
 pure matter of taste 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.920
 I personally treat mine 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.080
 desk not as a storage location 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.870
 at least not in the long run but only 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.120
 temporarily because files in my opinion 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.140
 not on here on the desk 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.750
 have searched 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:21.440
 These should be somewhere on the 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.860
 hard disk under own files with us 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.270
 lie or just somewhere else all the more 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.910
 Content them here on the desk 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:33.780
 are have the longer need the 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:36.240
 calculator to boot because why this 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.730
 elements on the desk first 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.620
 so be told visually 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.510
 and they have to be summoned first 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.950
 all other elements will be the 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.020
 somewhere on the hard disk are the 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.270
 of course, when you start up after 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.650
 and after added but as I said 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:54.270
 that it's a matter of taste 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:57.090
 as you like, that's it 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:01.490
 I close my window again thank you 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.490
 me and goodbye
