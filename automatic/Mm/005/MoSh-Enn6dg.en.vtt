reviews<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.530> internet<00:01:07.860> after<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.490> fact

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.270 

on<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:19.360> way<00:01:19.450> back<00:01:19.600> from<00:01:19.840> downtown<00:01:20.410> the<00:01:20.980> name<00:01:21.130> I

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
on the way back from downtown the name I

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.800 
on the way back from downtown the name I
could<00:01:21.430> not<00:01:21.550> remember<00:01:21.670> before<00:01:22.180> us<00:01:22.270> sea<00:01:22.540> plane

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
could not remember before us sea plane

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.710 
could not remember before us sea plane
basin<00:01:23.400> it's<00:01:24.400> at<00:01:24.610> the<00:01:24.700> end<00:01:24.790> of<00:01:24.910> Davis<00:01:25.300> Island<00:01:25.630> in

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
basin it's at the end of Davis Island in

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.520 
basin it's at the end of Davis Island in
Tampa<00:01:26.400> you'll<00:01:27.400> see<00:01:27.610> downtown<00:01:27.850> back<00:01:28.300> there<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
Tampa you'll see downtown back there the

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.320 
Tampa you'll see downtown back there the
way<00:01:29.650> back<00:01:29.860> is<00:01:30.070> much<00:01:30.280> faster<00:01:30.520> I'm<00:01:30.910> assuming

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
way back is much faster I'm assuming

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.420 
way back is much faster I'm assuming
because<00:01:31.480> the<00:01:32.260> Hillsborough<00:01:32.590> River<00:01:32.650> drains

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
because the Hillsborough River drains

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.050 
because the Hillsborough River drains
out<00:01:33.640> this<00:01:33.850> way<00:01:34.000> into<00:01:34.180> the<00:01:34.270> bay<00:01:38.730> was<00:01:39.730> really

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
out this way into the bay was really

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.650 
out this way into the bay was really
nice<00:01:40.980> and<00:01:41.980> really<00:01:42.850> happy<00:01:42.970> with<00:01:43.180> it<00:01:43.300> so<00:01:43.330> far

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
nice and really happy with it so far

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.940 
nice and really happy with it so far

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
anywhere so I found equivalent about the

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.380 
anywhere so I found equivalent about the
same<00:02:34.180> size<00:02:34.440> it's<00:02:35.440> pretty<00:02:35.650> solid<00:02:36.130> pretty<00:02:37.120> firm

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
same size it's pretty solid pretty firm

foam forcing that in there and they

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.430 
foam forcing that in there and they
don't<00:02:39.700> leak<00:02:39.880> at<00:02:40.000> all<00:02:40.150> but<00:02:40.870> all<00:02:40.989> the<00:02:41.110> water<00:02:41.260> is

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440
