00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:06.040
 hello in this video I'm going to make some nails 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.580
 for snow is very fast very simple 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.469
 and the only thing we're going to need is going to be 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.660
 a white enamel although in 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.160
 reality would be worth any other color 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.950
 but good I recommend you white 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.570
 although in theory it should not be seen 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.450
 we will also need a top coat 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.150
 for the end a transparent enamel 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.320
 we are going to need also what is the most 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.920
 important 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.820
 salt is worth me for example because this same 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.520
 which is the one I had at home and it's salt 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.440
 fine vouchers at the normal end but we can 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.800
 use then the one we have at home 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:45.730
 either fat or flake salt or whatever 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.550
 the effect is going to be a nail because of 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.400
 snow or frost or whatever it is very 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.460
 suitable for to combine with 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.780
 with this with the snow let's say but the 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.970
 the only difference is that salt depends 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.100
 that we use fine flakes already 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.750
 I say whatever it is going to give a feeling u 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.370
 another one is worth it but neither will it vary so much 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.650
 in all of them I advise you to use 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.619
 just the one you have at home good 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.660
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.490
 paint the nail with white enamel like 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.290
 we are going to do good what we are going to do 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.300
 painting what we would normally do that 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.210
 It would be giving a relatively thin layer 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.830
 and then another layer if necessary 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.840
 we're not going to give a layer but we're going to 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.940
 give quite dense so that to be able to 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.310
 paste the salt we could do it with 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.750
 nail glue too but I think 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.440
 which is better with this because it hurts less 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.330
 The nail 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.730
 and it does not hurt the nail while a 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.710
 glue even if little will damage it 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.570
 quite more then well I have 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.550
 decided to stick it with a glaze 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.520
 then as I tell you I do not drain nor 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.710
 the brush but directly applied 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.990
 a quantity because it is very very generous 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.470
 very big with little is needed 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.240
 simply go that is not a one 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.670
 capita fine what is good 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.119
 quite thick so that it takes longer to 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.369
 dry and to be able to paste is salt that you 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.140
 I say good and once we have done 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.280
 this the only thing we have to do is 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.330
 throw salt over 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.039
 we have to be careful to see where 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.360
 we do it because we are going to spread the 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.200
 salt then you have to have a little bit of 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.030
 watch out 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.660
 we just take it like that we miss it 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.150
 over is worth as if it were glitter or 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.690
 glitter or whatever we throw it like that 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.690
 from above 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.970
 and that covers all the bottom of all 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.370
 ways and that's why I told you that the base 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.380
 I'm going to put it white because that's the way 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.960
 it leaves me some space, it does not show so much 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.670
 so good once I already have all 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.350
 the covered nail that we can throw it like this 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.660
 with your hands if you want for more 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.890
 comfort with a spoon too 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.160
 would be worth soy as you like it 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.349
 and well, what I have is something like 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.340
 this 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:56.930
 Now what I have to do is go 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.930
 pressing a little with your finger 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:04.140
 so that the salt sticks inside 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.750
 of enamel and stay that way more 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.430
 stuck and is more subject to hold though the 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.170
 effect is the same 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.700
 then if you want with some brochita 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.370
 or something like that or for example that I have to 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.200
 I have this if you want to be able to give it 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.840
 some last to be some grain 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.550
 loose et cetera etcetera then fall 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.200
 thing that does not need much either because 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.540
 now is when we are going to put the top 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.390
 coat and with that we are going to prevent the 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.190
 salt take off or leave us 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.080
 falling pimples out there then nothing 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.640
 simply with the top coat 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.830
 We are going to give you a capita 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.350
 if you want you can also use this 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.760
 type of enamel that you have to carry 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.330
 it is transparent as if it were a top 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.280
 coat but it has some shine or 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.750
 glitter or whatever it is good if 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.570
 you want however, well, good to me 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.100
 like it so that you can clearly notice the 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.190
 come out since we 've done it and that's something 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.750
 quite original then good what 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:02.120
 have at the end is something like this worth 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:05.510
 that looks in relief and gives that feeling 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.610
 frost winter frost 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.310
 good and then at the time of touching it the 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.260
 true that as he carries he touched over 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.910
 because it does not get hooked it does not have peaks like 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.280
 if we leave the jump to which it is worth 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.840
 it would stay rough and we could go 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.570
 hooking anything this way 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.600
 with the top coat, the salt is not ready 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.970
 it falls to us besides it is bright and good 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.590
 Well, the truth is that what I say is not 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.780
 comfortable because he is not hooked by 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.350
 there are no peaks or remains but neither 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:36.470
 nothing so nothing this is my idea of 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.750
 manicure that we can combine with the 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.580
 snow and nothing I hope you liked 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.480
 put into practice that sure is left 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.480
 super super good
