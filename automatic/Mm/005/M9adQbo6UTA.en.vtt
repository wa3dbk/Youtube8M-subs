killed him anyway so basically when you
burn<00:04:37.020> someone<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:38.729> flames<00:04:39.030> stick<00:04:39.449> on<00:04:39.660> them

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
burn someone the flames stick on them

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.080 
burn someone the flames stick on them
for<00:04:40.320> about<00:04:40.380> like<00:04:40.650> ten<00:04:40.889> seconds<00:04:41.370> so<00:04:41.580> if<00:04:41.789> someone

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
for about like ten seconds so if someone

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.870 
for about like ten seconds so if someone
else<00:04:42.210> kills<00:04:42.599> them<00:04:42.780> and<00:04:42.900> they're<00:04:43.500> on<00:04:43.770> fire<00:04:44.400> from

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
else kills them and they're on fire from

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.060 
else kills them and they're on fire from
your<00:04:45.030> flames<00:04:45.389> you<00:04:45.990> will<00:04:46.139> get<00:04:46.289> an<00:04:46.410> assist<00:04:46.800> I

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
your flames you will get an assist I

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.830 
your flames you will get an assist I
don't<00:04:47.580> know<00:04:47.669> if<00:04:47.760> that<00:04:47.910> makes<00:04:48.030> sense<00:04:48.360> but<00:04:48.660> I

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
don't know game terms because I know

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.190 
don't know game terms because I know
chemistry<00:04:52.139> terms<00:04:52.620> like<00:04:53.010> h2o<00:04:53.580> hydrogen<00:04:54.510> and

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
chemistry terms like h2o hydrogen and

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.029 
chemistry terms like h2o hydrogen and
two<00:04:55.590> oxygens<00:04:56.160> are<00:04:56.460> way<00:04:56.580> that<00:04:56.789> to<00:04:57.240> hide<00:04:57.539> you
