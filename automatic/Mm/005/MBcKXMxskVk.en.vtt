Hi, my name's Pasqualino Rossi

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
we are in Alvignano, near Caserta, in my pizzeria "Elite Rossi"

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and now I'm going to make a Margherita with mother yeast

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This is the first step: let's make the dough, with one liter of water...

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Put 35 gr of salt in the water

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
then add the mother yeast

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Let's use a starter that could be grape juice, honey or something sweet that makes the fermentation with water to start

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
then add some flour and start to work slowly it in this way

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
because the dough requires two kinds of rising: the chemical one, produced by the yeast put inside

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and the mechanical one

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
that  I'm just doing now with my hands or that could be done with the pasta maker

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
in order to blow some air inside

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and to get finally a smooth dough that must rise

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and then we can taste an excellent pizza!

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
This is the second step, where we cut the dough

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Now, let's proceed with cutting the loaves

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
for a second rising.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
You can already see the first bubbles

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
that is the mechanical rising, thanks to our manual process of kneading

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Now the dough starts slowly to rise

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Here we can see the mechanical rising

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
just because we have blown some air inside

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and so we can notice all those small holes and a good texture

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
After cutting, let's rise the loaves on a wood board

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
in order to let it absorb some moisture

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and after a couple of hours we'll have, I would say, a perfect dough

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
This is the third step: pizza stuffing and baking

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
After six hours rising here the dough we have worked before

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I'm going to spread it out

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Let's stuff it with San Marzano "Antico di Napoli" tomatoes

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
fiordilatte with buffalo milk produced in Alvignano, near Caserta

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
some fresh basil

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Some  extra virgin olive oil made in Italy

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Gosh! It tastes so good!
