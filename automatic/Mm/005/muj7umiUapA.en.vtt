with it no matter what ship you have my

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.430 
with it no matter what ship you have my
best<00:00:52.890> advice<00:00:53.159> is<00:00:53.400> for<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.239> just<00:00:54.269> get<00:00:55.199> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
best advice is for you to just get the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.170 
best advice is for you to just get the
strongest<00:00:55.920> cans<00:00:56.159> you<00:00:56.309> have<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.760> just<00:00:56.909> keep

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
strongest cans you have and just keep

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.299 
strongest cans you have and just keep
firing<00:00:57.420> at<00:00:57.659> it<00:00:57.839> if<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.559> drives<00:00:58.769> away<00:00:58.890> just

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
firing at it if it drives away just

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.500 
firing at it if it drives away just
stick<00:00:59.640> around<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.089> I'll<00:01:00.180> come<00:01:00.360> back

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
stick around and I'll come back

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.469 
stick around and I'll come back
eventually<00:01:00.629> but<00:01:01.970> otherwise<00:01:02.970> it's<00:01:03.330> pretty

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
eventually but otherwise it's pretty

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:05.230 
eventually but otherwise it's pretty
straightforward<00:01:03.839> battleship<00:01:04.530> battle

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240 
straightforward battleship battle

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.060 
straightforward battleship battle
there's<00:01:06.240> also<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.510> second<00:01:07.020> objective<00:01:07.740> that

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
there's also a second objective that

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.920 
there's also a second objective that
most<00:01:08.340> people<00:01:08.580> usually<00:01:08.700> don't<00:01:08.909> catch<00:01:09.150> there's

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
most people usually don't catch there's

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.480 
most people usually don't catch there's
a<00:01:10.020> battleship<00:01:10.440> on<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.710> map<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.250> have<00:01:11.370> to

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
a battleship on the map that you have to

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.670 
a battleship on the map that you have to
rescue<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.880> crew<00:01:12.000> from<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:13.200> only<00:01:13.290> happens

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
rescue the crew from and it only happens

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.859 
rescue the crew from and it only happens
if<00:01:13.770> you're<00:01:13.920> near<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.970> I'm<00:01:15.270> just<00:01:15.299> gonna<00:01:15.600> show

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
if you're near it so I'm just gonna show

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.450 
if you're near it so I'm just gonna show
up<00:01:15.900> these<00:01:16.140> most<00:01:16.380> people<00:01:16.590> don't<00:01:16.740> have<00:01:17.100> any<00:01:17.159> idea

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
up these most people don't have any idea

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.660 
up these most people don't have any idea
where<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:17.940> is

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.789 

secondary<00:01:23.670> objective<00:01:23.760> added<00:01:27.619> they've<00:01:28.619> also

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
secondary objective added they've also

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.520 
secondary objective added they've also
added<00:01:29.040> um<00:01:29.600> side<00:01:30.600> thrusters<00:01:31.080> and<00:01:31.290> four

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
added um side thrusters and four

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.920 
added um side thrusters and four
thrusters<00:01:32.119> so<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.180> can<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:33.420> see<00:01:33.570> how<00:01:33.690> many

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
thrusters so you can just see how many

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.510 
thrusters so you can just see how many
will<00:01:34.259> get<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.619> ship<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.920> being<00:01:35.130> stopped<00:01:37.520> here

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
will get the ship to being stopped here

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.240 
will get the ship to being stopped here
that<00:01:38.700> um<00:01:38.960> that<00:01:39.960> engine<00:01:40.440> whine<00:01:40.649> sound<00:01:41.040> it's

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
that um that engine whine sound it's

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.399 
that um that engine whine sound it's
usually<00:01:41.430> me<00:01:42.270> find<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.780> emergency<00:01:43.140> boosters

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
usually me find the emergency boosters

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.630 
usually me find the emergency boosters
basically<00:01:46.409> all<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.649> do<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:46.830> sit<00:01:47.159> here<00:01:47.399> and

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
basically all you do is sit here and

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:56.350 
basically all you do is sit here and
wait<00:01:47.940> firm<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.360> order<00:01:49.049> ship<00:01:51.710> twenty<00:01:52.710> seconds

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.570 

lay<00:01:56.990> out<00:01:57.020> -<00:01:57.380> this<00:01:57.890> is<00:01:58.010> probably<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.400> first

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
lay out - this is probably the first

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.400 
lay out - this is probably the first
boss<00:01:58.880> battle<00:01:58.910> you'll<00:01:59.330> have<00:01:59.510> where<00:01:59.810> enemy

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
boss battle you'll have where enemy

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.270 
boss battle you'll have where enemy
fleet<00:02:00.710> actually<00:02:01.130> has<00:02:01.280> lasers<00:02:02.950> it's<00:02:03.950> kind<00:02:04.220> of

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
fleet actually has lasers it's kind of

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.540 
fleet actually has lasers it's kind of
creepy<00:02:04.700> because<00:02:05.390> it<00:02:05.930> pretty<00:02:06.200> much<00:02:06.460> shoot<00:02:07.460> at

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
creepy because it pretty much shoot at

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.100 
creepy because it pretty much shoot at
you<00:02:07.700> all<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:08.119> time<00:02:08.330> you<00:02:08.509> know<00:02:08.570> destroy<00:02:08.929> them

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
you all the time you know destroy them

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.850 
you all the time you know destroy them
for<00:02:09.289> your<00:02:09.380> s-rank<00:02:09.710> drive<00:02:10.160> as<00:02:10.340> well<00:02:10.520> so<00:02:11.860> you

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
for your s-rank drive as well so you

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.590 
for your s-rank drive as well so you
have<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:13.070> be<00:02:13.190> really<00:02:13.550> careful<00:02:13.940> not<00:02:13.970> hitting<00:02:14.450> me

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
have to be really careful not hitting me

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.530 
have to be really careful not hitting me
I<00:02:14.870> was<00:02:15.020> amazed<00:02:15.320> I<00:02:15.500> did<00:02:15.650> not<00:02:15.770> hit<00:02:16.580> any<00:02:16.910> ship<00:02:17.270> here

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
I was amazed I did not hit any ship here

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.199 
I was amazed I did not hit any ship here
just<00:02:18.350> beating<00:02:19.100> through

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
just beating through

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.920 
just beating through
basically<00:02:23.060> strategy<00:02:24.060> would<00:02:24.120> be<00:02:24.299> probably<00:02:24.599> to

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
basically strategy would be probably to

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.390 
basically strategy would be probably to
pee<00:02:25.379> on<00:02:25.409> the<00:02:25.709> enemy<00:02:25.920> ship<00:02:26.159> with<00:02:26.280> their

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
pee on the enemy ship with their

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.179 
pee on the enemy ship with their
strongest<00:02:26.700> engines<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:29.930> if<00:02:30.930> you're<00:02:31.189> the

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:32.189 
strongest engines and if you're the

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:33.679 
strongest engines and if you're the
person<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:32.549> Scorpios<00:02:33.120> who<00:02:33.269> use<00:02:33.420> those<00:02:33.569> as

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:33.689 
person you Scorpios who use those as

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:37.510 
person you Scorpios who use those as
well

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.940 

that's<00:02:38.520> pretty<00:02:38.730> much<00:02:38.850> it

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
that's pretty much it

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.830 
that's pretty much it
usually<00:02:41.610> you<00:02:41.670> won't<00:02:41.760> be<00:02:41.940> this<00:02:42.060> fast<00:02:42.599> so<00:02:42.690> all

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 
time limit or basically you use the

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:13.300 
time limit or basically you use the
mission<00:06:11.330> automatically<00:06:11.960> it's<00:06:12.949> a<00:06:13.009> crazy

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:18.099 
hatch I'm not sure if it actually helps

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:21.279

that just withdraw because you probably

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:47.510
