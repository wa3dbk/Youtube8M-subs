00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:15.370
 and for me 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:33.050
 this layer that will not take our there 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:36.050
 where I go although in the end it is 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.050
 customized 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.489
 it's worth what you have to do now 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.489
 to submit or be in lincoln vale 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.390
 Here you have 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:58.870
 jz 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:01:01.440
 and good 4.6 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.440
 but now 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.989
 if you have another version it does not matter 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.670
 advertising 

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:16.609
 We go over the desk, here I have 

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:18.880
 another that senate before so good gives 

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.880
 same 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.860
 what to do here 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.530
 open let's go to minecraft point to 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.530
 minecraft we open it with windows 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.299
 and here 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.570
 we take everything and have a better time here 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.680
 the bottom part because maybe the 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.890
 part of above gets inside a 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.929
 intentional folder 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.730
 Now that you have installed we are going to have 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.410
 to do phases of production too 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.480
 what you have to do easily 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.620
 or trolling that I'm going to leave 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.620
 bottom of the page 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.970
 it was a name and the password 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.350
 of my name I put it here goes because 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.710
 password 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.710
 and we enter 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:44.450
 and let's go here 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.450
 where to put gallery we press here 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.230
 and here we have all the layers 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.210
 what's in the gallery that also 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.210
 we can use them for later personal 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.480
 he stays here a lot 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.659
 and the night 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.620
 since we give him here where he puts six 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:10.960
 options we give here 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.830
 you see that you have done this 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.830
 we have to give him 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.370
 we give him 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.190
 and it is already be 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.780
 as we were germanies 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.650
 the forgiveness will be going to manipulate it 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.530
 coats 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.530
 we hope let's go here for example here 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.320
 and as you can see that after the final stage 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.000
