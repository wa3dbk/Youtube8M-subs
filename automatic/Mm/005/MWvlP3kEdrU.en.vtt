00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 are friends of youtube today we are going to 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.779
 draw actress and tobey of pancake and pasta 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.910
 then let's start by drawing your 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.750
 soft top 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.750
 let's do 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:18.820
 more or less something like that and then we're going to 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.820
 review but already a little bigger 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:26.509
 thus 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:30.289
 and then now let's draw the 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:33.420
 hair in a pretty look we know 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.980
 so to speak 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.530
 here we will do 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.560
 or hair of this fringe that falls on 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.960
 the face does not 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.320
 let's make another one 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.079
 and now let's draw the face 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.700
 then let's go from here is a 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.700
 pretty thin face 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:59.090
 then we will paint this part is because 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.060
 is the inner part the hood would be 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.340
 black 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.150
 already here we are going to make the eyes that 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.150
 They are quite big 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.200
 I do not know the truth this is an agile 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.600
 of terror or something like that but pretty 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.280
 Strange I find it quite strange here 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:23.030
 let's draw the nose 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:26.229
 making a jack and then a bigger one 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.229
 but we are going to paint it 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.890
 and now let's draw it ok we're going to 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.890
 make smiling so to speak 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.159
 something like that and then the teeth would be like 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.159
 pretty thin so it is 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.000
 and well we have here the face and the 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.450
 layer of this part we're going to go through the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.700
 half we will see here a small ruth 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.110
 around here then we will start doing the 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.900
 shoulder 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.950
 and the arm 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.770
 here 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.640
 and affliction we would do the arm 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.280
 thus 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.569
 and here 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:13.270
 we will continue to do so 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:17.460
 this part then a line 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.460
 and here we will get our hands 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.040
 we will begin to draw here 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.710
 4 them 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:31.410
 thus 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:33.970
 doing as well as letters yes and then here 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.800
 I would close 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.800
 we're going to do it by taking an ax not 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:48.100
 and we are going to close his shirt 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.100
 and here we call the line that your body 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.780
 over here then we will continue doing 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.780
 the ax 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.380
 and then we would have to leave here 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.340
 let's make two lines we 're going to 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.700
 link 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:10.780
 let's make the ax blade then 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:14.110
 let's make a line up and 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:18.750
 then a curve of this part we're going to 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.750
 make the other curved line 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:26.010
 in this way and here is another corner 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.870
 we will join here 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.110
 As you can see, it is quite easy to make a 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.110
 ax 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.490
 here we will leave a peak 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.829
 of joining these two lines 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:45.290
 let's make this part of the sheet 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:48.500
 our ax and then here would come the 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:52.359
 because the stick that holds the cha we're going to 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.359
 draw here the shoulder the arm 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:59.880
 over here on this side 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:03.560
 let's make the division of where the arm 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.560
 Well now to work and arm 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.780
 well this character also uses well 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:13.170
 like a clothes 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.100
 quite particular as well as in hairline 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.590
 Frei type 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.160
 I thought but then the one in the movie 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.480
 terror not 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.550
 of nightmares 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.360
 only that this one uses as colors 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.270
 green 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.979
 so I'm fine 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.979
 then we are going to make several lines 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.970
 and here the same in this part of here 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.970
 down the bus 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.680
 and on this side 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.410
 good friends, I hope you liked the 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.060
