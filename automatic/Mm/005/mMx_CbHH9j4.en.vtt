00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
okay well tonight I'm going to be

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.889 
okay well tonight I'm going to be
working<00:00:05.009> on<00:00:05.279> putting<00:00:05.790> some<00:00:06.210> lines<00:00:06.450> in<00:00:06.779> the

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
working on putting some lines in the

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.930 
working on putting some lines in the
road<00:00:06.930> here<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:09.050> came<00:00:10.050> up<00:00:10.200> with<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.940> fairly

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
road here and came up with a fairly

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.460 
road here and came up with a fairly
simple<00:00:12.150> method<00:00:13.049> for<00:00:13.559> doing<00:00:13.710> so<00:00:14.040> I'm<00:00:14.639> sure

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:15.470 
simple method for doing so I'm sure

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.390 
simple method for doing so I'm sure
somebody<00:00:16.470> else<00:00:16.590> probably<00:00:16.830> thought<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.310> it

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
somebody else probably thought of it

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.010 
somebody else probably thought of it
first<00:00:18.619> so<00:00:19.670> but<00:00:20.670> at<00:00:21.300> least<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.810> what<00:00:21.840> I'm

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
first so but at least this is what I'm

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.390 
first so but at least this is what I'm
going<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.230> use<00:00:22.410> for<00:00:22.560> drawing<00:00:22.859> these<00:00:22.949> n<00:00:23.160> scale

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
going to use for drawing these n scale

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.609 
going to use for drawing these n scale
lines<00:00:23.850> because<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.449> just<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.140> first<00:00:25.410> thought<00:00:25.560> I

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
lines because I just I first thought I

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.259 
lines because I just I first thought I
was<00:00:25.800> going<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.330> do<00:00:27.800> stenciling<00:00:28.849> you<00:00:29.849> know<00:00:29.939> make

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
was going to do stenciling you know make

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.030 
was going to do stenciling you know make
a<00:00:30.300> stencil<00:00:30.599> will<00:00:30.929> cut<00:00:31.109> these<00:00:31.230> little<00:00:31.710> thin

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
a stencil will cut these little thin

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.310 
a stencil will cut these little thin
strips<00:00:32.369> out<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.149> try<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.390> airbrush<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.260> I

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
strips out and try to airbrush it and I

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.100 
strips out and try to airbrush it and I
just<00:00:34.500> decided<00:00:35.540> that's<00:00:36.540> going<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.809> be<00:00:36.870> too<00:00:37.020> much

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
just decided that's going to be too much

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.280 
just decided that's going to be too much
of<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.320> hassle<00:00:37.500> too<00:00:38.250> much<00:00:38.399> too<00:00:38.879> much<00:00:38.910> work<00:00:39.290> too

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
of a hassle too much too much work too

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.810 
of a hassle too much too much work too
much<00:00:40.379> chances<00:00:40.860> for<00:00:41.040> screwing<00:00:41.430> up<00:00:41.520> we're

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
much chances for screwing up we're

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.220 
much chances for screwing up we're
getting<00:00:42.030> over<00:00:42.270> spray<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.660> everything<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.200> I

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
getting over spray and everything so I

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.160 
getting over spray and everything so I
just<00:00:43.500> decided<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:44.100> do<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.399> combination<00:00:44.820> of

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.910

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
from hobby lobby tonight and if you do

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.220 
from hobby lobby tonight and if you do
things<00:00:59.579> this<00:00:59.760> way<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.930> want<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.140> make

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
things this way and you want to make

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.080 
things this way and you want to make
sure<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.469> got<00:01:01.620> he<00:01:02.160> keeps<00:01:02.370> your<00:01:02.520> points<00:01:02.789> fairly

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
sure you got he keeps your points fairly

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.750 
sure you got he keeps your points fairly
sharp<00:01:03.799> while<00:01:04.799> you're<00:01:04.949> doing<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.640> reason

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
sharp while you're doing this the reason

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.450 
sharp while you're doing this the reason
why<00:01:05.939> I'm<00:01:06.060> doing<00:01:06.150> two<00:01:06.479> colors<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.280> put

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
why I'm doing two colors is that I put

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.780 
why I'm doing two colors is that I put
the<00:01:08.549> white<00:01:08.760> down<00:01:09.030> first<00:01:09.420> because<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.860> seems

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
the white down first because that seems

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.840 
the white down first because that seems
to<00:01:12.119> show<00:01:12.710> up<00:01:13.710> better<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.250> road<00:01:14.280> than<00:01:14.460> just

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
to show up better on the road than just

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.310 
to show up better on the road than just
doing<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.150> yellow<00:01:15.360> when<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.840> tried<00:01:16.080> doing<00:01:16.200> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
doing the yellow when I tried doing the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.469 
doing the yellow when I tried doing the
yellow<00:01:16.530> alone<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.070> was<00:01:17.130> pretty<00:01:17.479> translucent

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
yellow alone it was pretty translucent

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.710 
yellow alone it was pretty translucent
didn't<00:01:18.689> look<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:18.990> good<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:20.700> decided<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.630> do

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
didn't look that good so I decided to do

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.080 
didn't look that good so I decided to do
a<00:01:21.750> line<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.229> white<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.130> then<00:01:23.250> do<00:01:23.460> yellow<00:01:23.759> over

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
a line of white and then do yellow over

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.840 
a line of white and then do yellow over
it<00:01:24.210> now<00:01:24.360> looks<00:01:24.780> fairly<00:01:25.020> decent<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.850> it's

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
it now looks fairly decent and it's

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.929 
it now looks fairly decent and it's
about<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:28.020> right<00:01:28.200> scale<00:01:29.100> width<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.700> mean<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
about the right scale width I mean the

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.060 
about the right scale width I mean the
road<00:01:32.939> line<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.360> usually<00:01:33.720> about<00:01:34.229> four<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.040> six

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
road line is usually about four to six

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.700 
road line is usually about four to six
inches<00:01:35.369> wide<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.750> comes<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.170> about<00:01:37.259> a

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
inches wide and that comes to about a

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.520 
inches wide and that comes to about a
32nd<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.729> an<00:01:38.820> inch<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.270> n<00:01:39.600> scale<00:01:40.430> so<00:01:42.530> that's

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
32nd of an inch in n scale so that's

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.050 
32nd of an inch in n scale so that's
what<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.009> decided<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.430> go<00:01:44.520> with<00:01:44.610> at<00:01:44.759> least<00:01:44.850> for

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
what I decided to go with at least for

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.969 
what I decided to go with at least for
the<00:01:45.119> lines<00:01:45.329> down<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.630> center<00:01:46.020> here<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.500> decided

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
the lines down the center here I decided

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.889 
the lines down the center here I decided
to<00:01:47.100> figure<00:01:47.340> out<00:01:47.490> what<00:01:48.329> I'm<00:01:48.420> going<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.570> do<00:01:48.750> about

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
to figure out what I'm going to do about

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.510 
to figure out what I'm going to do about
the<00:01:49.170> curves<00:01:49.439> here<00:01:49.770> or<00:01:49.950> I'm<00:01:50.130> going<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.340> get

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
the curves here or I'm going to get

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.969 
the curves here or I'm going to get
those<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.780> curve<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.020> look<00:01:52.200> symmetrical<00:01:52.770> and

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
those a curve and look symmetrical and

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.560 
those a curve and look symmetrical and
look<00:01:53.070> good<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.399> I'll<00:01:54.090> cross<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.360> bridge

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
look good and I'll cross that bridge

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.709 
look good and I'll cross that bridge
when<00:01:54.750> i'll<00:01:55.020> get<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.700> i<00:01:57.360> also<00:01:57.509> made

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
when i'll get to it so and i also made

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.600 
when i'll get to it so and i also made

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.910 
had a hard time finding exact
measurements<00:02:06.250> on<00:02:06.550> line<00:02:07.150> of<00:02:07.510> the<00:02:08.290> length<00:02:08.770> of

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
measurements on line of the length of

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.460 
measurements on line of the length of
lines<00:02:09.250> and<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.760> distance<00:02:10.180> between<00:02:10.300> the<00:02:10.600> lines

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
lines and the distance between the lines

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.380 
lines and the distance between the lines
when<00:02:11.740> they're<00:02:11.860> drawn<00:02:12.070> in<00:02:12.250> a<00:02:12.310> road<00:02:12.520> so<00:02:12.940> I<00:02:12.970> just

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
when they're drawn in a road so I just

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.990 
when they're drawn in a road so I just
kind<00:02:13.570> of<00:02:13.630> got<00:02:13.930> a<00:02:14.170> picture<00:02:14.410> of<00:02:14.590> a<00:02:14.680> highway<00:02:15.610> and

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
kind of got a picture of a highway and

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.180 
kind of got a picture of a highway and
kind<00:02:16.210> of<00:02:16.240> eyeball<00:02:16.690> that<00:02:17.020> based<00:02:17.290> on<00:02:17.530> what<00:02:18.160> I

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
kind of eyeball that based on what I

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.470 
kind of eyeball that based on what I
could<00:02:18.430> see<00:02:18.580> on<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.820> length<00:02:19.000> of<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.270> cars

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
could see on the length of the cars

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.100 
could see on the length of the cars
taking<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.200> average<00:02:20.320> length<00:02:20.710> of<00:02:20.890> a<00:02:20.980> car<00:02:21.250> and

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
taking the average length of a car and

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.570 
taking the average length of a car and
you<00:02:24.390> know<00:02:25.470> just<00:02:26.470> basically<00:02:26.830> guesstimating

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
you know just basically guesstimating

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.520 
you know just basically guesstimating
how<00:02:27.790> far<00:02:28.300> apart<00:02:28.420> these<00:02:28.720> lines<00:02:28.990> are<00:02:29.200> and<00:02:29.410> so

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
how far apart these lines are and so

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.110 
how far apart these lines are and so
with<00:02:29.710> friends<00:02:30.010> Gail<00:02:30.190> I<00:02:30.220> came<00:02:30.490> out<00:02:30.610> to<00:02:30.640> be<00:02:30.880> that

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
with friends Gail I came out to be that

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.250 
with friends Gail I came out to be that
these<00:02:31.240> are<00:02:31.420> about<00:02:31.480> three<00:02:31.750> quarters<00:02:31.960> of<00:02:32.140> an

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
these are about three quarters of an

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.870 
these are about three quarters of an
inch<00:02:32.350> apart<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:35.470> lines<00:02:35.710> are<00:02:35.950> about<00:02:36.130> half

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
inch apart and the lines are about half

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.230 
inch apart and the lines are about half
an<00:02:37.090> inch<00:02:37.180> so<00:02:38.080> I<00:02:38.560> guess<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:39.070> would<00:02:39.220> I<00:02:39.580> don't

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
an inch so I guess that would I don't

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.210 
an inch so I guess that would I don't
know<00:02:40.330> come<00:02:40.570> out<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.900> about<00:02:41.020> the<00:02:41.740> painted<00:02:42.040> lines

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
know come out to about the painted lines

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.730 
know come out to about the painted lines
would<00:02:42.400> be<00:02:42.460> about<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:43.000> five<00:02:43.750> or<00:02:43.780> six<00:02:44.110> feet<00:02:44.350> and

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.490 

exit<00:02:47.740> 87<00:02:48.100> feet<00:02:48.400> or<00:02:48.550> something<00:02:48.790> like<00:02:48.880> that<00:02:48.940> and

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
exit 87 feet or something like that and

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.010 
exit 87 feet or something like that and
the<00:02:50.500> distance<00:02:51.070> between<00:02:51.130> was<00:02:51.550> about<00:02:51.730> 12<00:02:52.030> scale

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
the distance between was about 12 scale

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.530 
the distance between was about 12 scale
fee<00:02:53.260> I<00:02:53.500> mean<00:02:54.160> it's<00:02:54.310> not<00:02:54.540> prototypically

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
fee I mean it's not prototypically

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.180 
fee I mean it's not prototypically
accurate<00:02:56.020> but<00:02:56.200> I'm<00:02:56.290> just<00:02:56.440> looking<00:02:56.740> for<00:02:56.980> an

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
accurate but I'm just looking for an

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.430 
accurate but I'm just looking for an
overall<00:02:57.490> effect<00:02:57.940> so<00:02:58.209> anyway<00:02:59.050> I<00:02:59.080> made<00:02:59.320> this

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
overall effect so anyway I made this

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.460 
overall effect so anyway I made this
little<00:02:59.620> jig<00:03:00.280> out<00:03:00.550> of<00:03:00.790> a<00:03:01.709> strip<00:03:02.709> of<00:03:02.740> cardstock

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
little jig out of a strip of cardstock

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.110 
little jig out of a strip of cardstock
measured<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.560> width<00:03:05.709> of<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:05.980> road<00:03:06.130> from<00:03:06.880> side

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
measured the width of the road from side

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.940 
measured the width of the road from side
to<00:03:07.239> side<00:03:07.270> it's<00:03:07.630> about<00:03:07.810> one<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:08.560> a<00:03:08.620> half<00:03:08.650> inches

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
to side it's about one and a half inches

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.310 
to side it's about one and a half inches
so<00:03:09.940> I<00:03:09.970> cut<00:03:10.270> this<00:03:10.390> to<00:03:10.540> about<00:03:10.720> three<00:03:10.989> quarters<00:03:11.170> of

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
so I cut this to about three quarters of

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.680 
so I cut this to about three quarters of
an<00:03:11.440> inch<00:03:11.500> wide<00:03:11.770> and<00:03:12.040> so<00:03:12.700> what<00:03:12.820> I<00:03:12.850> do<00:03:12.940> is<00:03:13.060> I<00:03:13.330> take

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
an inch wide and so what I do is I take

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.300 
an inch wide and so what I do is I take
the<00:03:13.900> edge<00:03:14.050> and<00:03:15.360> put<00:03:16.360> it<00:03:16.480> up<00:03:16.630> against<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.530> edge

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
the edge and put it up against the edge

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.449 
the edge and put it up against the edge
of<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.550> road<00:03:18.760> like<00:03:19.239> that<00:03:19.269> okay<00:03:20.170> you<00:03:21.100> can<00:03:21.280> see

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
of the road like that okay you can see

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.910 
of the road like that okay you can see
here<00:03:21.910> let<00:03:22.780> me<00:03:22.870> zoom<00:03:23.080> the<00:03:23.200> camera<00:03:23.230> in<00:03:23.650> a<00:03:23.709> little

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
here let me zoom the camera in a little

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.070 
here let me zoom the camera in a little
bit<00:03:24.959> oops<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:27.730> can<00:03:27.910> see<00:03:28.090> here<00:03:28.330> I<00:03:28.570> just<00:03:28.870> kind<00:03:29.050> of

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
bit oops you can see here I just kind of

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.710 
bit oops you can see here I just kind of
drew<00:03:29.290> these<00:03:29.410> little<00:03:29.680> squiggly<00:03:30.100> lines<00:03:30.720> just

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
drew these little squiggly lines just

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.600 
drew these little squiggly lines just
the<00:03:31.810> kind<00:03:32.019> of<00:03:32.110> as<00:03:32.290> an<00:03:32.410> indication<00:03:32.800> to<00:03:33.010> let<00:03:33.489> me

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
the kind of as an indication to let me

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.300 
the kind of as an indication to let me
know<00:03:33.760> that<00:03:34.150> this<00:03:34.510> is<00:03:34.900> where<00:03:35.560> I<00:03:35.590> actually<00:03:35.860> want

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
know that this is where I actually want

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.180 
know that this is where I actually want
to<00:03:36.430> draw<00:03:36.700> a<00:03:37.050> line<00:03:38.050> on<00:03:38.080> the<00:03:38.290> Rope<00:03:38.440> between<00:03:38.620> here

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
to draw a line on the Rope between here

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.320 
to draw a line on the Rope between here
and<00:03:39.400> here<00:03:39.700> because<00:03:39.940> I<00:03:39.970> don't<00:03:40.120> want<00:03:40.150> to

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
and here because I don't want to

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.930 
and here because I don't want to
accidentally<00:03:40.690> draw<00:03:40.959> a<00:03:41.200> line<00:03:41.470> in<00:03:41.739> the<00:03:41.940> wrong

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
accidentally draw a line in the wrong

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.810 
accidentally draw a line in the wrong
location<00:03:43.300> so<00:03:44.220> that's<00:03:45.220> kind<00:03:45.400> of<00:03:45.430> like<00:03:45.550> that's

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
location so that's kind of like that's

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.220 
location so that's kind of like that's
what<00:03:45.940> I'm<00:03:46.030> kind<00:03:46.209> of<00:03:46.269> using<00:03:46.540> as<00:03:46.630> a<00:03:46.660> template<00:03:47.080> and

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
what I'm kind of using as a template and

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.590 
what I'm kind of using as a template and
so<00:03:47.800> I<00:03:47.830> started<00:03:48.010> off<00:03:48.489> three-quarters<00:03:49.360> an<00:03:49.450> inch

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
so I started off three-quarters an inch

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.840 
so I started off three-quarters an inch
from<00:03:49.810> here<00:03:50.200> to<00:03:50.320> here<00:03:50.650> so<00:03:50.830> all<00:03:50.950> I<00:03:50.980> have<00:03:51.190> to<00:03:51.280> do<00:03:51.519> to

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
from here to here so all I have to do to

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.650 
from here to here so all I have to do to
draw<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.540> next<00:03:52.930> line<00:03:53.880> just<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:55.060> old<00:03:55.180> camera

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
draw the next line just the old camera

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.360 
draw the next line just the old camera
here<00:03:55.900> a<00:03:55.930> little<00:03:56.110> bit<00:03:56.850> okay<00:03:57.989> is<00:03:58.989> to<00:03:59.230> start<00:03:59.500> from

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
here a little bit okay is to start from

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.050 
here a little bit okay is to start from
this<00:04:00.550> end<00:04:00.880> right<00:04:01.150> here<00:04:03.330> put<00:04:04.330> the<00:04:04.450> edge<00:04:04.630> of<00:04:05.530> this

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
this end right here put the edge of this

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.130 
this end right here put the edge of this
cardstock<00:04:07.060> right<00:04:07.480> up<00:04:07.600> against<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:07.930> end<00:04:08.080> of

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
cardstock right up against the end of

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.699 
cardstock right up against the end of
that<00:04:08.230> line<00:04:08.440> and<00:04:08.709> then<00:04:09.160> start<00:04:09.430> drawing<00:04:10.000> in<00:04:10.269> the

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
that line and then start drawing in the

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.199 
that line and then start drawing in the
lines<00:04:11.709> after<00:04:11.920> that<00:04:12.070> up<00:04:12.430> and<00:04:12.549> up<00:04:12.730> through<00:04:12.970> here

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
lines after that up and up through here

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.530 
lines after that up and up through here
so

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
so

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.099 
so
me<00:04:16.940> measure<00:04:17.940> this<00:04:18.209> put<00:04:18.449> this<00:04:18.539> up<00:04:18.720> against<00:04:18.959> the

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
me measure this put this up against the

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:28.640 
me measure this put this up against the
road<00:04:19.320> like<00:04:20.250> that<00:04:26.330> okay<00:04:27.330> hold<00:04:27.630> it<00:04:27.780> down<00:04:27.990> I'm

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
road like that okay hold it down I'm

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:38.890 
road like that okay hold it down I'm
going<00:04:28.770> to<00:04:28.860> go<00:04:30.680> draw<00:04:31.680> the<00:04:32.250> white<00:04:32.430> line<00:04:33.120> first<00:04:34.490> ok

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:49.119 

just<00:04:39.900> like<00:04:40.080> that

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:49.129 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:51.100 

we<00:04:49.729> do<00:04:49.879> all<00:04:49.999> the<00:04:50.119> white<00:04:50.300> lines<00:04:50.509> first<00:04:50.779> like

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
we do all the white lines first like

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.850 
we do all the white lines first like
this<00:04:51.639> I'm<00:04:52.639> going<00:04:52.759> to<00:04:52.819> go<00:04:52.969> over<00:04:52.999> it<00:04:53.649> what's<00:04:54.649> the

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
this I'm going to go over it what's the

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.009 
this I'm going to go over it what's the
old<00:04:55.129> pencil<00:04:56.589> just<00:04:57.589> color<00:04:57.800> a<00:04:57.889> little<00:04:58.099> yellow

00:04:59.009 --> 00:04:59.019 
old pencil just color a little yellow

00:04:59.019 --> 00:05:00.969 
old pencil just color a little yellow
and<00:05:00.019> it<00:05:00.110> gives<00:05:00.259> it<00:05:00.349> just<00:05:00.379> enough<00:05:00.739> yellow

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
and it gives it just enough yellow

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.519 
and it gives it just enough yellow
colored<00:05:01.339> well<00:05:01.929> basically<00:05:02.929> make<00:05:03.169> it<00:05:03.319> look

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:03.529 
colored well basically make it look

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:05.679 
colored well basically make it look
yellow<00:05:03.769> like<00:05:04.309> I<00:05:04.429> said<00:05:04.489> when<00:05:04.759> I<00:05:04.789> tried<00:05:05.059> putting

00:05:05.679 --> 00:05:05.689 
yellow like I said when I tried putting

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:07.570 
yellow like I said when I tried putting
me<00:05:05.899> yellow<00:05:06.080> directly<00:05:06.559> down<00:05:06.769> on<00:05:07.009> the<00:05:07.099> road<00:05:07.309> I

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
me yellow directly down on the road I

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.979 
me yellow directly down on the road I
don't<00:05:07.879> know<00:05:07.939> whether<00:05:08.089> it<00:05:08.269> spends<00:05:08.599> just<00:05:08.689> too

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:08.989 
don't know whether it spends just too

00:05:08.989 --> 00:05:11.469 
don't know whether it spends just too
soft<00:05:09.229> or<00:05:09.559> what<00:05:09.769> but<00:05:10.099> it<00:05:10.909> just<00:05:11.089> didn't<00:05:11.300> show<00:05:11.360> up

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
soft or what but it just didn't show up

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:17.049 
soft or what but it just didn't show up
well<00:05:11.779> so<00:05:15.039> let's<00:05:16.039> go<00:05:16.339> over<00:05:16.550> a<00:05:16.610> little<00:05:16.669> bit<00:05:16.849> more

00:05:17.049 --> 00:05:17.059 
well so let's go over a little bit more

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:18.939 
well so let's go over a little bit more
like<00:05:17.929> I<00:05:18.019> need<00:05:18.169> to<00:05:18.199> sharpen<00:05:18.469> these<00:05:18.739> and<00:05:18.919> I

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
like I need to sharpen these and I

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:22.509 
like I need to sharpen these and I
probably<00:05:20.289> sharpen<00:05:21.289> these<00:05:21.349> up<00:05:21.559> yeah<00:05:22.279> it's

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:22.519 
probably sharpen these up yeah it's

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:24.009 
probably sharpen these up yeah it's
probably<00:05:22.789> a<00:05:22.849> good<00:05:22.909> rule<00:05:23.179> of<00:05:23.209> thumb<00:05:23.330> to<00:05:23.509> sharpen

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:24.019 
probably a good rule of thumb to sharpen

00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:27.699 
probably a good rule of thumb to sharpen
them<00:05:24.229> and<00:05:24.499> your<00:05:25.009> sharpener<00:05:25.550> about<00:05:26.709> basically

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:27.709 
them and your sharpener about basically

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:30.009 
them and your sharpener about basically
every<00:05:27.949> length<00:05:28.159> of<00:05:28.429> every<00:05:29.419> length<00:05:29.569> of<00:05:29.749> the<00:05:29.839> jig

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:30.019 
every length of every length of the jig

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:31.600 
every length of every length of the jig
you<00:05:30.139> go<00:05:30.289> make<00:05:30.589> sure<00:05:30.709> that<00:05:30.919> points<00:05:31.279> are<00:05:31.399> pretty

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
you go make sure that points are pretty

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:39.669 
you go make sure that points are pretty
sharp<00:05:32.589> just<00:05:33.589> to<00:05:33.649> be<00:05:33.769> safe<00:05:35.709> so<00:05:38.169> fairly<00:05:39.169> simple

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:39.679 
sharp just to be safe so fairly simple

00:05:39.679 --> 00:05:43.929 
sharp just to be safe so fairly simple
and<00:05:39.949> I<00:05:40.519> think<00:05:40.579> looks<00:05:41.029> fairly<00:05:42.519> convincing<00:05:43.519> you

00:05:43.929 --> 00:05:43.939 
and I think looks fairly convincing you

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:45.219 
and I think looks fairly convincing you
may<00:05:44.089> be<00:05:44.149> concerned<00:05:44.629> that<00:05:44.719> these<00:05:44.869> are<00:05:45.050> going<00:05:45.169> to

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229 
may be concerned that these are going to

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:49.169 
may be concerned that these are going to
wear<00:05:45.409> away<00:05:45.529> real<00:05:46.459> easily<00:05:46.789> or<00:05:47.300> get<00:05:47.719> smudged<00:05:48.050> and

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:49.179 
wear away real easily or get smudged and

00:05:49.179 --> 00:05:50.829 
wear away real easily or get smudged and
well<00:05:50.179> actually<00:05:50.269> they're<00:05:50.539> not<00:05:50.569> going<00:05:50.779> to

00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:50.839 
well actually they're not going to

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:57.159 
well actually they're not going to
smudge<00:05:51.999> now<00:05:55.149> if<00:05:56.149> they<00:05:56.269> wear<00:05:56.479> away<00:05:56.659> you<00:05:56.839> know

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169 
smudge now if they wear away you know

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:59.079 
smudge now if they wear away you know
rail<00:05:57.559> lines<00:05:57.800> where<00:05:58.039> away<00:05:58.279> in<00:05:58.459> the<00:05:58.550> road<00:05:58.729> so

00:05:59.079 --> 00:05:59.089 
rail lines where away in the road so

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:00.909 
rail lines where away in the road so
anyway<00:05:59.689> I<00:05:59.719> wanted<00:06:00.019> this<00:06:00.079> to<00:06:00.229> be<00:06:00.259> look<00:06:00.589> like<00:06:00.769> an

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:00.919 
anyway I wanted this to be look like an

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:03.999 
anyway I wanted this to be look like an
old<00:06:01.039> country<00:06:01.729> road<00:06:02.029> so<00:06:02.599> i<00:06:03.110> think<00:06:03.769> i'm<00:06:03.919> getting

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:04.009 
old country road so i think i'm getting

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:07.239 
old country road so i think i'm getting
the<00:06:04.219> right<00:06:04.339> effect<00:06:04.519> out<00:06:04.909> of<00:06:05.059> this<00:06:05.979> these<00:06:06.979> lines

00:06:07.239 --> 00:06:07.249 
the right effect out of this these lines

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:11.859 
the right effect out of this these lines
do<00:06:07.550> look<00:06:07.969> kind<00:06:08.179> of<00:06:08.240> a<00:06:08.449> bit<00:06:08.749> worn<00:06:09.879> so<00:06:10.879> that's<00:06:11.329> at

00:06:11.859 --> 00:06:11.869 
do look kind of a bit worn so that's at

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:15.699 
do look kind of a bit worn so that's at
least<00:06:11.929> how<00:06:12.139> I<00:06:12.229> do<00:06:12.349> quick<00:06:13.339> and<00:06:14.119> easy<00:06:15.079> quick<00:06:15.679> and

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:36.819 
do it but in order to get the N scale
lines<00:06:34.999> that<00:06:35.209> I<00:06:35.300> wanted<00:06:35.659> for<00:06:36.379> the<00:06:36.469> width<00:06:36.619> that<00:06:36.740> I

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:36.829 
lines that I wanted for the width that I

00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:39.249 
lines that I wanted for the width that I
wanted<00:06:37.219> this<00:06:37.429> is<00:06:37.699> a<00:06:37.729> what<00:06:38.599> I'm<00:06:38.689> going<00:06:38.869> to<00:06:38.899> do<00:06:39.019> so

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:39.259 
wanted this is a what I'm going to do so

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:42.429 
wanted this is a what I'm going to do so
I'm<00:06:39.919> going<00:06:40.099> to<00:06:40.129> go<00:06:40.279> and<00:06:40.519> do<00:06:41.509> the<00:06:41.719> lines<00:06:42.139> and<00:06:42.349> the

00:06:42.429 --> 00:06:42.439 
I'm going to go and do the lines and the

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:44.230 
I'm going to go and do the lines and the
rest<00:06:42.649> of<00:06:42.769> this<00:06:42.860> road<00:06:43.129> I'll<00:06:43.429> let<00:06:43.639> you<00:06:43.759> watch<00:06:43.789> and

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 
rest of this road I'll let you watch and

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.399 
rest of this road I'll let you watch and
I'll<00:06:44.300> probably<00:06:44.449> do<00:06:44.659> the<00:06:44.779> rest<00:06:44.959> of<00:06:45.139> this<00:06:45.229> in

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:45.409 
I'll probably do the rest of this in

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:48.639 
I'll probably do the rest of this in
time<00:06:45.619> lapse<00:06:45.919> so<00:06:47.259> when<00:06:48.259> I<00:06:48.289> get<00:06:48.439> down<00:06:48.589> there

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:48.649 
time lapse so when I get down there

00:06:48.649 --> 00:06:51.399 
time lapse so when I get down there
probably<00:06:49.249> i'm<00:06:49.459> actually<00:06:49.699> going<00:06:50.029> to<00:06:50.379> want<00:06:51.379> to

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:51.409 
probably i'm actually going to want to

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:53.739 
probably i'm actually going to want to
get<00:06:51.559> down<00:06:51.769> to<00:06:52.099> the<00:06:52.129> actual<00:06:52.579> grade<00:06:53.149> crossing

00:06:53.739 --> 00:06:53.749 
get down to the actual grade crossing

00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:54.959 
get down to the actual grade crossing
and<00:06:53.869> probably<00:06:54.110> i'm<00:06:54.259> going<00:06:54.439> to<00:06:54.499> do<00:06:54.589> a<00:06:54.619> little

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:54.969 
and probably i'm going to do a little

00:06:54.969 --> 00:07:00.279 
and probably i'm going to do a little
stenciling<00:06:55.969> and<00:06:56.899> do<00:06:57.649> some<00:06:57.829> airbrushing<00:06:59.289> down

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:00.289 
stenciling and do some airbrushing down

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:02.890 
stenciling and do some airbrushing down
there<00:07:00.649> some<00:07:01.550> more<00:07:01.699> the<00:07:01.849> bigger

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:02.900 
there some more the bigger

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.770 
there some more the bigger
usually<00:07:03.500> there's<00:07:03.680> a<00:07:03.740> big<00:07:03.979> white<00:07:04.250> fat<00:07:04.729> line<00:07:05.090> in

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:05.780 
usually there's a big white fat line in

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.340 
usually there's a big white fat line in
front<00:07:06.020> of<00:07:06.410> the<00:07:07.330> main<00:07:08.330> that's<00:07:08.600> about<00:07:08.840> building

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:09.350 
front of the main that's about building

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:13.510 
front of the main that's about building
across<00:07:09.590> the<00:07:11.199> track<00:07:12.199> here<00:07:12.560> so<00:07:12.860> I'll<00:07:13.310> probably

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 
across the track here so I'll probably

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.340 
across the track here so I'll probably
do<00:07:13.820> that<00:07:14.030> as<00:07:14.630> a<00:07:14.810> stencil<00:07:16.210> but<00:07:17.210> let<00:07:18.020> me<00:07:18.050> get<00:07:18.229> on

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:18.350 
do that as a stencil but let me get on

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.530 
do that as a stencil but let me get on
with<00:07:18.380> it
