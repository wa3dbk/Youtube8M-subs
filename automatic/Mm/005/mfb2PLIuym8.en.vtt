00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 Hello my dear, I would like to meet you 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.730
 show how you refresh this soya 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.069
 in the animal 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.080
 I do not know if her edge is there 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.910
 if you ordered for example sushi 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.490
 or sushi to go takes then it states 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.240
 So, this little soja is for that 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.920
 that has soy sauce in it and I wanted 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.140
 to do that for ages 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.250
 this project but now I am 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.949
 actually quite happy that they still have it 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.359
 did not do it because it can only 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.460
 I want to do his work together 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.710
 This soy sauces and little fish already 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.600
 views in Asia but there are around 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.850
 You can do little in all Asian shops 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.390
 but also order online 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.700
 but since i am a total sushi fan 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.920
 have with me about a certain 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.320
 some of these soy sauces 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.820
 Accumulated fish and I could do it 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.680
 Just never throw it away and I thought 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.570
 must make something out of it because they are so 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.270
 sweet and I want to be with you 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.789
 today this string of soy sauce 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.579
 tinker fish that goes completely 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.340
 easy and I think is really one 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.530
 super nice summery idea somehow 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.450
 the bright colors and the fish 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.750
 somehow it's easy for me 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.920
 summery and I think it's great and 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.689
 hope one or the other maybe 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.790
 knew that to do now gradually 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:19.560
 I wish you a lot of joy 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.180
 the instructions you need something you 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.940
 I can take you under it 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.340
 now just bank paper 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.010
 then a container of water for the 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.520
 brush and the kindle of course one 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.520
 light string 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.899
 and the soy sauce fish but not 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.219
 full but already finished playing 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.649
 and a whole lot of it 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:44.950
 then I have his styrofoam klop here 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.330
 you will still see where 15 need 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.940
 and such a chance 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.160
 then another cutter knife 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.130
 and I have porcelain now 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.720
 malfarben it certainly went on glass 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.090
 paint or other colors but 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.590
 this part is pretty transparent and you 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.460
 you can still do it for a lot of others 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.460
 use things 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.350
 Of course, that needs to understand so many 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.760
 how a string of lights has lit and 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.220
 yes then you can actually already 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.870
 I'm starting to do it for my sake 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.370
 me the brush are in very small 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.800
 damp but repaint the water again 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.510
 good off the fish better 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.290
 I can put them in my pocket 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.550
 Now just go to the bottom 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.680
 and that's the way it looks and so can 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.810
 you keep it awesome and then 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.660
 afterwards, if you want the fresh 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:46.580
 Just painted in the styrofoam glock 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:49.520
 I'm the fish 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.200
 now always a bit flat so 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.240
 that a bit more color to the 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.750
 dandruff gets stuck and then samsung 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:00.760
 looks and sheds that eye like that 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.760
 get along a little bit more 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.129
 the porcelain mean each other but 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.110
 pretty good , too 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:12.349
 frogs nadja I have different 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.610
 at my example in the other 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.340
 days with the tail 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.080
 I just said that 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.030
 left and somehow tries that 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.030
 shed a bit outside 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.470
 do 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.080
 if you painted all the fish then 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.690
 They can easily do so on the 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.380
 ski pistes dry that makes itself 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.380
 actually pretty good 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.730
 my fish is still a bit 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.130
 I have to make them more colorful 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.730
 simply dry again after drying 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.730
 color painted 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.430
 when the paint is completely dried it 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.190
 The fish could easily be from the 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:36.010
 revert and now 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.140
 you have to do the meander so this 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.030
 screw front as well cut off 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:43.230
 so that the fish later on the 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.730
 light bulbs can be plugged 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.860
 The best way to do it is to do one 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.660
 cutter knife but be nice 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.210
 Carefully and do not cut yourself in 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.880
 the fingers in the middle and cuts the best 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.040
 just a little hole and 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.810
 when you see okay this is now 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.670
 way too small then just imagine 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.650
 piece by piece always a bit 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:06.120
 bigger and try in between times 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.120
 it is also the light bulb casterin 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.380
 He serves the fish on the light bulb 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.960
 then he can be so quiet 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.550
 little bit heavier on the light bulb 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.500
 So you have to hold well 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.610
 That's why it should not be too big 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.610
 but not too small 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.590
 in the fresh it is now clear 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.330
 still too heavy but the light bulb 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.960
 so they cut again a 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.960
 pieces off 

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:22.070
 and that's how the fish look when 

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:22.070
 the fairy lights to have 

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.449
 I hope you liked the video 

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.580
 I am still 

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:41.139
 a change 

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.389
 and how they have not done so yet 

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:45.250
