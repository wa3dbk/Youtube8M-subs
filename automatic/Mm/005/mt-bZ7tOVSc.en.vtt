00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:33.200 
earrings so you have a chance of getting
what<00:04:25.380> you<00:04:25.560> call<00:04:25.830> potential<00:04:27.350> which<00:04:28.350> is<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:33.030> red

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
what you call potential which is the red

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.510 
what you call potential which is the red
thing<00:04:33.449> I<00:04:33.570> didn't<00:04:33.900> get<00:04:33.960> any<00:04:34.199> that<00:04:34.380> time<00:04:34.620> but

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
thing I didn't get any that time but

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.560 
thing I didn't get any that time but
that's<00:04:35.699> what<00:04:35.850> you're<00:04:35.970> going<00:04:36.120> for<00:04:36.419> is

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
that's what you're going for is

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.430 
that's what you're going for is
potential<00:04:37.110> and<00:04:37.350> really<00:04:38.010> I<00:04:38.190> did<00:04:38.430> not<00:04:38.460> get<00:04:38.699> any

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
potential and really I did not get any

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.170 
potential and really I did not get any
so<00:04:40.440> what<00:04:40.860> potential<00:04:41.310> is<00:04:41.460> is<00:04:41.699> it's<00:04:41.880> pretty<00:04:41.970> much

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
so what potential is is it's pretty much

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.740 
so what potential is is it's pretty much
at<00:04:42.389> the<00:04:42.479> very<00:04:42.660> bottom<00:04:43.020> it<00:04:43.110> says<00:04:43.260> potential<00:04:43.740> and

at the very bottom it says potential and

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.930 
at the very bottom it says potential and
