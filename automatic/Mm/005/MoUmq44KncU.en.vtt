blood<00:01:03.540> glucose<00:01:03.930> then<00:01:04.710> they<00:01:05.129> crash<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:06.240> your

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
blood glucose then they crash so your

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.179 
blood glucose then they crash so your
blood<00:01:06.630> Sugar's<00:01:06.899> up<00:01:07.079> close<00:01:07.259> up<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.619> then<00:01:08.039> it

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
blood Sugar's up close up and then it

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.630 
blood Sugar's up close up and then it
goes<00:01:08.399> boom<00:01:08.909> boom<00:01:09.719> it<00:01:10.140> goes<00:01:10.320> down<00:01:10.609> we<00:01:11.609> don't

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
goes boom boom it goes down we don't

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
with energy and that kind of goes back

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.280 
with energy and that kind of goes back
to<00:02:00.940> the<00:02:01.030> blood<00:02:01.180> sugar<00:02:01.450> this<00:02:01.600> regulation<00:02:02.050> the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
to the blood sugar this regulation the

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.440 
to the blood sugar this regulation the
number<00:02:02.530> one<00:02:02.680> reason<00:02:02.860> is<00:02:03.550> because<00:02:03.790> your<00:02:04.210> brain

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
number one reason is because your brain

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.860
