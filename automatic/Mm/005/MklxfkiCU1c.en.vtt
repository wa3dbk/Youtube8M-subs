00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
one of the pleasures of metal detecting

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.000 
one of the pleasures of metal detecting
I've<00:01:17.600> seen<00:01:17.810> it<00:01:17.900> in<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.020> distance<00:01:18.470> and<00:01:18.799> if<00:01:18.890> I

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
I've seen it in the distance and if I

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:34.380 
I've seen it in the distance and if I
can<00:01:19.189> zoom<00:01:19.220> in<00:01:19.580> that<00:01:19.820> far

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.200 

I<00:01:34.420> think<00:01:35.320> there<00:01:35.680> there's<00:01:36.430> normally<00:01:36.790> three<00:01:37.090> of

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
I think there there's normally three of

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.200 
I think there there's normally three of
them<00:01:37.360> round<00:01:37.600> it<00:01:37.870> so<00:01:38.610> I'll<00:01:39.610> imagine

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
them round it so I'll imagine

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:47.370 
them round it so I'll imagine
I<00:01:42.960> think<00:01:43.960> this<00:01:44.170> to<00:01:44.410> shut<00:01:44.740> down<00:01:44.770> your<00:01:46.380> Simran

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
I think this to shut down your Simran

00:01:47.380 --> 00:02:00.990 
I think this to shut down your Simran
offers<00:01:47.710> Macross<00:01:48.070> a<00:01:48.100> ditch<00:01:59.760> there's<00:02:00.760> more

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
offers Macross a ditch there's more

of this field since leaving well I'm

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:29.030 
of this field since leaving well I'm
just

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:41.670 

spin<00:04:30.040> the<00:04:30.220> world<00:04:40.260> it<00:04:41.260> just<00:04:41.440> shows<00:04:41.650> that

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
spin the world it just shows that

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.590 
spin the world it just shows that
there's<00:04:42.040> been<00:04:42.190> activity<00:04:42.340> here<00:04:43.030> it's

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
there's been activity here it's

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:51.270 
there's been activity here it's
something<00:04:44.020> a<00:04:44.320> bit<00:04:44.890> older<00:04:49.770> if<00:04:50.770> anybody<00:04:51.220> out

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
something a bit older if anybody out

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.330 
something a bit older if anybody out
there<00:04:51.400> knows<00:04:51.640> how<00:04:52.480> to<00:04:52.540> age<00:04:53.100> spindle<00:04:54.100> whirls

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
there knows how to age spindle whirls

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.570 
there knows how to age spindle whirls
I'd<00:04:54.820> be<00:04:55.030> interested<00:04:55.270> to<00:04:55.570> hear<00:04:55.750> what<00:04:56.590> AG<00:04:57.220> is

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
I'd be interested to hear what AG is

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.640 
I'd be interested to hear what AG is
because<00:04:57.880> I'm<00:04:58.240> not<00:04:58.330> medieval<00:04:58.960> once<00:04:59.200> but

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
because I'm not medieval once but

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.340 
because I'm not medieval once but
obviously<00:05:00.550> there's<00:05:01.090> a<00:05:01.450> variation<00:05:01.930> between

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
obviously there's a variation between

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.990 
obviously there's a variation between
the<00:05:02.970> Saxon<00:05:03.970> the<00:05:04.750> Roman<00:05:05.560> and<00:05:05.790> there<00:05:06.790> has<00:05:06.970> been
