ultimate metro loadout so the first

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.249 
ultimate metro loadout so the first

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
thing I chose and this should be

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.020 
thing I chose and this should be
brutally<00:01:16.830> obvious<00:01:17.189> for<00:01:17.369> anybody<00:01:17.790> who's

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
brutally obvious for anybody who's

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.670 
brutally obvious for anybody who's
flying<00:01:18.330> an<00:01:18.479> operation<00:01:18.960> Metro<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.409> want<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.619> be

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
flying an operation Metro you want to be

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.170 
flying an operation Metro you want to be
using<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.100> assault<00:01:20.430> class<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.000> have

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
using the assault class so you have

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.200 
using the assault class so you have
access<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.869> lvg<00:01:22.530> but<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.460> decided<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.060> whack

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
access to the lvg but I decided to whack

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.480 
access to the lvg but I decided to whack
the<00:01:24.360> ace23<00:01:24.689> on<00:01:25.170> there<00:01:25.350> because<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:25.920> by<00:01:26.220> far

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
the ace23 on there because it is by far

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.039 
the ace23 on there because it is by far
the<00:01:26.520> best<00:01:26.790> assault<00:01:27.180> rifle<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.900> pretty

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
the best assault rifle and it pretty

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.039 
the best assault rifle and it pretty
much<00:01:28.140> replaces<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.920> m16a3<00:01:29.729> from<00:01:30.630> battlefield

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
much replaces the m16a3 from battlefield

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.510 
much replaces the m16a3 from battlefield
3<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.380> think<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.619> fits<00:01:31.650> perfectly<00:01:32.340> with

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
3 and I think it fits perfectly with

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.080 
3 and I think it fits perfectly with
Metro<00:01:32.939> it's<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.630> old<00:01:33.810> style<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.560> m16a3<00:01:35.250> Metro

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
Metro it's that old style of m16a3 Metro

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.940 
Metro it's that old style of m16a3 Metro
you're<00:01:36.810> gonna<00:01:36.930> have<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> hundred<00:01:37.439> service

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
you're gonna have a hundred service

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.039 
you're gonna have a hundred service
stars<00:01:38.189> with<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.490> very<00:01:38.520> quickly<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.840> thought

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
stars with it very quickly so I thought

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.649 
stars with it very quickly so I thought
I'd<00:01:40.170> whack<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.530> ace23<00:01:40.860> on<00:01:41.400> there<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.850> stuck<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
I'd whack the ace23 on there I stuck the

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:43.789 
I'd whack the ace23 on there I stuck the
flash<00:01:42.869> hider<00:01:43.110> on<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.439> because<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.649> doesn't

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
flash hider on it because it doesn't

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.410 
flash hider on it because it doesn't
actually<00:01:43.979> change<00:01:44.130> anything<00:01:44.790> with<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.149> weapon

stick<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.090> coyote<00:01:54.450> site<00:01:54.780> on<00:01:54.960> there<00:01:55.170> gives<00:01:55.350> you

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
stick the coyote site on there gives you

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.530 
stick the coyote site on there gives you
a<00:01:55.500> really<00:01:55.740> nice<00:01:55.920> wide<00:01:56.340> field<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.939> view<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.390> you

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
a really nice wide field of view so you

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.120 
a really nice wide field of view so you
can<00:01:57.689> see<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.869> lot<00:01:58.140> through<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.530> site<00:01:58.829> and

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
can see a lot through that site and

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.910 
can see a lot through that site and
really<00:02:00.030> looking<00:02:00.810> at<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.960> camo<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.799> the

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
really looking at the camo this is the

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.830 
really looking at the camo this is the
new<00:02:02.070> premium<00:02:02.369> camo<00:02:02.759> it's<00:02:03.060> called<00:02:03.270> havoc<00:02:03.689> and

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
new premium camo it's called havoc and

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.160 
new premium camo it's called havoc and
it's<00:02:04.110> very<00:02:04.320> much<00:02:04.500> like<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:05.009> Bayeux<00:02:05.369> gam<00:02:06.170> camo

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
it's very much like the Bayeux gam camo

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.809 
it's very much like the Bayeux gam camo
I<00:02:07.530> think<00:02:07.920> that's<00:02:08.069> what<00:02:08.220> it's<00:02:08.340> called<00:02:08.399> it's<00:02:08.700> the

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
I think that's what it's called it's the

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.609 
I think that's what it's called it's the
purple<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.479> green<00:02:09.599> one<00:02:09.989> that's<00:02:10.200> got<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.379> same

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
purple and green one that's got the same

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.710 
purple and green one that's got the same
style<00:02:10.950> but<00:02:11.069> this<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.400> sort<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.730> red<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.690> white

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
style but this is sort of red and white

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.700 
style but this is sort of red and white
and<00:02:13.260> green

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
and green

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.350 
and green
mixed<00:02:13.950> together<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.760> think<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.030> just<00:02:15.150> looks

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
mixed together and I think it just looks

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.240 
mixed together and I think it just looks
much<00:02:15.540> better<00:02:15.720> but<00:02:15.990> it<00:02:16.200> is<00:02:16.380> pretty<00:02:16.710> much<00:02:16.890> still

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
much better but it is pretty much still

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.550 
much better but it is pretty much still
a<00:02:17.490> pretty<00:02:17.700> swag<00:02:18.210> camo<00:02:18.660> so<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.200> thought<00:02:19.440> I'd

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
a pretty swag camo so I thought I'd

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.590 
a pretty swag camo so I thought I'd
stick<00:02:19.740> that<00:02:19.920> on<00:02:20.070> there<00:02:20.100> I<00:02:20.490> also<00:02:21.270> made<00:02:21.570> sure

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
stick that on there I also made sure

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.680 
stick that on there I also made sure
that<00:02:21.840> I<00:02:22.290> had<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:23.100> grenade<00:02:23.520> perk<00:02:23.820> activated

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
that I had the grenade perk activated

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.900 
that I had the grenade perk activated
for<00:02:24.960> the<00:02:24.990> assault<00:02:25.470> class<00:02:25.740> which<00:02:26.100> allows<00:02:26.760> you

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
for the assault class which allows you

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.340 
for the assault class which allows you
to<00:02:26.940> have<00:02:27.120> more<00:02:27.330> grenades<00:02:27.810> than<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:28.200> would

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
to have more grenades than you would

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.770 
to have more grenades than you would
normally<00:02:28.560> carry<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:30.030> then<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.270> selected<00:02:30.660> the

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
normally carry and then I selected the

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.810 
normally carry and then I selected the
v40<00:02:31.170> minis<00:02:31.560> which<00:02:31.710> allows<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.160> carry<00:02:32.460> more

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
v40 minis which allows you to carry more

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.200 
v40 minis which allows you to carry more
grenades<00:02:33.330> than<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.900> m67<00:02:34.500> frag<00:02:34.830> grenade<00:02:35.400> so<00:02:35.940> I

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
grenades than the m67 frag grenade so I

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.880 
grenades than the m67 frag grenade so I
think<00:02:36.540> it<00:02:36.750> allowed<00:02:37.050> me<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:37.260> throw<00:02:37.560> four

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
think it allowed me to throw four

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.850 
think it allowed me to throw four
grenades<00:02:38.100> before<00:02:38.790> I<00:02:38.820> was<00:02:39.060> completely<00:02:39.570> empty

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
grenades before I was completely empty

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.590 
grenades before I was completely empty
and<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.130> then<00:02:41.460> if<00:02:41.580> you<00:02:41.670> stand<00:02:41.970> next<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.360> two

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
and and then if you stand next to two

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.630 
and and then if you stand next to two
ammo<00:02:42.960> boxes<00:02:43.320> it<00:02:43.470> replenishes<00:02:43.740> those<00:02:44.220> very

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
ammo boxes it replenishes those very

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.660 
ammo boxes it replenishes those very
quickly<00:02:44.970> as<00:02:45.360> well<00:02:45.630> it<00:02:46.440> still<00:02:46.920> baffles<00:02:47.100> me<00:02:47.520> that

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
quickly as well it still baffles me that

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.670 
quickly as well it still baffles me that
the<00:02:47.760> game<00:02:47.970> allows<00:02:48.270> you<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.570> do<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:48.990> I<00:02:49.200> just

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
the game allows you to do that I just

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.650 
the game allows you to do that I just
think<00:02:49.890> that<00:02:50.100> these<00:02:50.250> grenade<00:02:50.790> patches<00:02:51.480> that

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
think that these grenade patches that

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.000 
think that these grenade patches that
are<00:02:51.690> supposed<00:02:52.050> to<00:02:52.140> be<00:02:52.200> coming<00:02:52.440> in<00:02:52.680> is<00:02:52.800> going<00:02:52.860> to

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
are supposed to be coming in is going to

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.210 
are supposed to be coming in is going to
be<00:02:53.150> so<00:02:54.150> key<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.510> how<00:02:54.930> much<00:02:55.140> grenade<00:02:55.620> spam<00:02:55.950> there

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
be so key to how much grenade spam there

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.130 
be so key to how much grenade spam there
is<00:02:56.340> in<00:02:56.460> the<00:02:56.550> game<00:02:56.730> at<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:56.970> moment<00:02:57.020> Metro<00:02:58.020> is<00:02:58.080> a

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
is in the game at the moment Metro is a

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.300 
is in the game at the moment Metro is a
prime<00:02:58.500> example<00:02:58.530> of<00:02:59.070> that

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
prime example of that

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.750 
prime example of that
but<00:02:59.850> again<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:01.650> game<00:03:01.830> allows<00:03:02.160> you<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.460> do<00:03:02.610> it

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
but again the game allows you to do it

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.670 
but again the game allows you to do it
you<00:03:03.150> may<00:03:03.360> as<00:03:03.480> well<00:03:03.510> take<00:03:03.810> advantage<00:03:03.840> of<00:03:04.440> it<00:03:04.560> and

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
you may as well take advantage of it and

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.400 
you may as well take advantage of it and
the<00:03:05.430> final<00:03:05.790> thing<00:03:05.940> to<00:03:06.180> complete<00:03:06.510> any<00:03:06.720> metro

away out of the Crenn AIDS ban you will

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.470 
away out of the Crenn AIDS ban you will
see<00:03:22.380> that<00:03:22.560> it<00:03:22.680> appears<00:03:22.800> so<00:03:23.520> often<00:03:24.120> it<00:03:24.300> is

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
see that it appears so often it is

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.200 
see that it appears so often it is
pretty<00:03:24.780> much<00:03:24.840> one<00:03:25.710> weapon<00:03:26.190> after<00:03:26.400> another<00:03:26.910> and

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
pretty much one weapon after another and

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.780 
pretty much one weapon after another and
then<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:27.780> lvg<00:03:28.290> is<00:03:28.410> in<00:03:28.560> between<00:03:28.710> each<00:03:29.160> one<00:03:29.490> it

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790

of<00:03:59.880> gameplay<00:04:00.120> in<00:04:00.420> battlefield<00:04:00.900> because<00:04:01.320> it's

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
of gameplay in battlefield because it's

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.100

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.490 
really represents battlefield of how it
should<00:04:09.300> be<00:04:09.660> played<00:04:09.900> or<00:04:10.080> at<00:04:10.140> least<00:04:10.290> how<00:04:10.440> the

about an explosive span and it really

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.130 
about an explosive span and it really
does<00:04:17.790> I've<00:04:18.120> said<00:04:18.270> this<00:04:18.359> for<00:04:18.420> the<00:04:18.540> third<00:04:18.780> time

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
does I've said this for the third time

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.020 
does I've said this for the third time
in<00:04:19.320> this<00:04:19.410> video<00:04:19.680> it<00:04:19.859> really<00:04:20.220> does<00:04:20.400> baffle<00:04:20.880> me

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
in this video it really does baffle me

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.300 
in this video it really does baffle me
how<00:04:21.570> that<00:04:21.870> this<00:04:22.049> is<00:04:22.260> still<00:04:22.530> in<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:22.770> game<00:04:22.919> after

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
how that this is still in the game after

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.760 
how that this is still in the game after
five<00:04:23.700> months<00:04:23.970> of<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.300> game<00:04:24.450> being<00:04:24.660> out<00:04:24.930> surely

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
five months of the game being out surely

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.450 
five months of the game being out surely
this<00:04:26.010> should<00:04:26.220> have<00:04:26.310> been<00:04:26.430> noted<00:04:26.820> down<00:04:26.970> in<00:04:27.210> the

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
this should have been noted down in the

have<00:04:29.259> been<00:04:29.380> patched<00:04:29.650> extremely<00:04:30.280> quickly<00:04:30.550> but

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
have been patched extremely quickly but

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.719 
have been patched extremely quickly but
alas<00:04:31.870> it's<00:04:32.169> still<00:04:32.500> in<00:04:32.770> the<00:04:32.919> game<00:04:33.100> and<00:04:33.400> I<00:04:33.520> can

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
alas it's still in the game and I can

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.939 
alas it's still in the game and I can
see<00:04:33.910> why<00:04:34.090> people<00:04:34.300> get<00:04:34.569> so<00:04:34.630> frustrated<00:04:35.229> with<00:04:35.830> it

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949

I<00:05:44.560> can<00:05:45.280> still<00:05:45.520> understand<00:05:46.030> why<00:05:46.180> Metro<00:05:46.630> is<00:05:46.810> such

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080

a played map in battlefield 4 in this
game<00:05:49.030> alone<00:05:49.419> I<00:05:49.750> leveled<00:05:50.620> up<00:05:50.740> twice<00:05:51.340> and<00:05:51.699> then

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
game alone I leveled up twice and then

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.360 
game alone I leveled up twice and then
another<00:05:52.270> half<00:05:52.599> a<00:05:52.810> level<00:05:53.080> with<00:05:53.229> a<00:05:53.259> 200%<00:05:53.949> XP

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
another half a level with a 200% XP

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.820 
another half a level with a 200% XP
boost<00:05:54.639> on<00:05:54.849> that's<00:05:55.449> just<00:05:55.539> ridiculous<00:05:56.169> I<00:05:56.469> didn't

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
boost on that's just ridiculous I didn't

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.560 
boost on that's just ridiculous I didn't
even<00:05:56.979> get<00:05:57.159> that<00:05:57.219> in<00:05:57.400> operation<00:05:58.090> Locker<00:05:58.330> when

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
even get that in operation Locker when

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.290 
even get that in operation Locker when
the<00:05:58.690> game<00:05:58.870> first<00:05:59.199> came<00:05:59.349> out<00:05:59.590> and<00:06:00.099> it<00:06:00.430> really

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
the game first came out and it really

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.089 
the game first came out and it really
does<00:06:01.599> sort<00:06:01.900> of<00:06:01.990> make<00:06:02.199> me<00:06:02.349> wonder<00:06:02.560> as<00:06:02.800> to<00:06:02.919> how

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:03.099 
does sort of make me wonder as to how

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:04.890 
does sort of make me wonder as to how
you<00:06:03.159> can<00:06:03.400> get<00:06:03.610> that<00:06:03.820> many<00:06:04.060> points<00:06:04.539> in<00:06:04.690> one<00:06:04.870> game

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
you can get that many points in one game

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.140 
you can get that many points in one game
and<00:06:05.380> then<00:06:06.009> that<00:06:06.340> leads<00:06:06.520> me<00:06:06.639> on<00:06:06.729> to<00:06:06.759> see<00:06:06.969> why

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
and then that leads me on to see why

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.209 
and then that leads me on to see why
these<00:06:07.210> people<00:06:07.780> still<00:06:08.050> do<00:06:08.289> play<00:06:08.590> the<00:06:08.740> game<00:06:08.949> and

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:09.219 
these people still do play the game and

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:11.370 
these people still do play the game and
I<00:06:09.969> know<00:06:10.120> that<00:06:10.479> a<00:06:10.539> lot<00:06:10.630> of<00:06:10.780> people<00:06:11.169> would<00:06:11.349> have

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380 
I know that a lot of people would have

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.020 
I know that a lot of people would have
liked<00:06:11.710> to<00:06:11.860> have<00:06:11.979> seen<00:06:12.039> something<00:06:12.430> different

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
liked to have seen something different

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.999 
liked to have seen something different
in<00:06:13.180> operation<00:06:13.750> metros<00:06:14.169> placing<00:06:14.650> second

assault<00:06:15.280> but<00:06:15.580> you<00:06:16.300> really<00:06:16.659> can't<00:06:16.870> argue<00:06:17.139> with

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 
assault but you really can't argue with

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.709 
assault but you really can't argue with
the<00:06:17.469> decision<00:06:17.979> dice<00:06:18.159> made<00:06:18.550> because<00:06:19.000> there<00:06:19.539> are

00:06:19.709 --> 00:06:19.719 
the decision dice made because there are
