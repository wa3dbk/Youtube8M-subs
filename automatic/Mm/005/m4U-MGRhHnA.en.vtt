 installation of steering and dashboard 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:19.350
 using a fastening system which 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.350
 is in the spare parts kit 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.280

 after the front suspension is assembled 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.060
 install wheels with 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.060
 pre-tightening bolts 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.710
 then install in the rear 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.430
 wheels also with pre-tightening 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.430
 mounting bolts 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.979
 after the all- terrain vehicle is put on 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.590
 wheels 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:19.400
 front bumper is being installed 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:21.790
 on the product frame the next stage is 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.470
 assembly and installation of the right step 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.250
 together with the driverâ€™s rear foot protection 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.830
 motovezhodhoda similarly collect 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:38.150
 footboard protection located over the left 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:40.570
 all- terrain vehicle side we produce 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.830
 connecting wiring in pairs 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:46.840
 set the pair's body to the front 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.840
 the panel tighten the screws 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.100
 Next, go to the rear 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.260
 bumper on request 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.120
 Installation as a rear bumper and 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.560
 trunk 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.680
 design and equipment can of them 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.690
 An ode allows you to do both 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:15.019
 at the same time we make installation back 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:17.799
 direction indicators connection according to 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.799
 color scheme 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.840
 the next step is to install the protection circuit 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.840
 and brake disc 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:33.950
 then install the battery on 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:36.230
 This stage ends preliminary 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.120
 assembly of products and then necessary 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.200
 go to the next lot 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.209
 serve the installation 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.329
 wheel discrepancies it should be 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.980
 from zero to ten millimeters installation 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.540
 wheel discrepancies are produced in 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.090
 according to the scheme in position 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.840
 steering right wheel discrepancy 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.180
 is regulated 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.769
 the length of the steering gear is normal 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.790
 wheel misalignment should not be 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:03.769
 more than 10 millimeters further check 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.629
 tightening all threaded connections 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.109
 chassis engine mounts and 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:08.109
 wheels 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.290
 chain tension control is carried out 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:22.020
 loosen two bolts as follows 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.780
 mounting rear axle housing on the body 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.060
 below there is a place to capture key and 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.630
 whose care we crank the case 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.760
 rear axle in the rear suspension arms 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.740
 tension occurs due to 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:38.250
 eccentricity of the rear axle housing and 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.590
 leverage next step check the work 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.820
 gearboxes best fuzzy 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.160
 gear shifting 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.190
 it is necessary to adjust the lever 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.440
 With the help of traction further check 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.790
 reliability of fuel hose connections 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.410
 systems and the presence of fixing clamps 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.260
 check electric flanging 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.720
 harnesses fix them if necessary 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.360
 clamps further check the health 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.700
 braking system if necessary 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.020
 we pump the brakes 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.120
 brake fluid level checked 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.630
 visual tank in the window for the brake 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.630
 liquids 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:24.290
 completion we fill the fuel tank and 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.290
 we make control start of the engine 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.660
 and
