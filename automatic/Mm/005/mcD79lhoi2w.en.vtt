00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 Hello everyone and everyone welcome to the 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.250
 channel lately you are asking me 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.230
 a lot for the hair it seems that you like 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.940
 quite as I have the color and the 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.519
 cut the truth is that I have it enough 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.110
 In any case, I warn you that 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.400
 this is probably the last video 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.650
 where you see me with hair like that 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.600
 because I want to cut melo and I want it 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.250
 cut pretty like here I do not know if 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.350
 it will happen to more people but as for the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.210
 live hair in a kind of loop in the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.519
 that I spend my life cutting my hair and 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.010
 leaving me long and I think it's because 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.720
 I get bored right away with the appearance of the hair 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.149
 then it also happens to me that when 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.829
 I already have it for this long I started it 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.540
 to see very crushed from above because 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.610
 although I have enough quantity I have it 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.309
 very thin and that starts to see me super 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.840
 flat super licked and I do not start to 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.670
 see rare and the fact is that right now 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.680
 I am in that phase where he has given me 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.570
 the neura of wanting me to cut it if I 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.670
 you follow by facebook you will have seen the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.920
 style that I want to do I want it 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.780
 clarify a little color and cut me what 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.699
 pretty but good as many 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.350
 like how I have my hair right now and 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.180
 you have asked me many questions in the 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.340
 comments lately I wanted to make a 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.110
 specific video telling everything 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.790
 as I was probably telling you if you follow me 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.160
 by social networks even now 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.470
 you will have seen the new haircut that 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.330
 I have so if you want and still I do not 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.920
 you can go to install that almost 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.750
 sure to see a picture of the new cut of 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.160
 I'll leave the user here 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.600
 Well, if you do not know anyway 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.040
 you have all the social networks always 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.080
 in the information box and on the blog 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.880
 I'll start with the color the last time 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.590
 that I went to the hairdresser I asked my 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.390
 hairdresser who would explain exactly 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.369
 how do you get this hair color for 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.350
 to be able to tell the best of all 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.240
 forms told me to get this 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.770
 tone will depend on the base you have 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.600
 each person because it is not the same 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.430
 clarify this root that I have so 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.770
 dark to get to this color that a 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.200
 person who has a lighter chestnut or 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.910
 even a darker color then that 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.729
 you have to take it into account but in my 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.250
 What she does is get me some 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.800
 how many wicks I have colored wicks 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.890
 those wicks what she does is put a 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.350
 tone 9 but other than that so you do not 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.750
 I left the typical orange tone me the 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.880
 color with silver and then the 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.890
 base color that I wear sub-7 is a 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.170
 little unnatural to put a stain so 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.179
 clear in such a dark base is not left 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.770
 there are people who like it but I prefer 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.840
 that the color is a little bit more 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.340
 homogeneous and that the contrast is not so 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.520
 large between the wicks and the rest of the 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.440
 hair then that I'm wearing 217 and 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.569
 then the wicks are a 9 but in my 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.160
 case by my tone are nuanced with 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.110
 silver I always ask you not to do 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.840
 pretty finite wicks because I do not 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.940
 like the laces so very thick and in 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.220
 how much color do I think anything else and 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.590
 then the cut is a layered cut with 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.120
 pretty long layers this is the most 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.700
 short that I have reaches me as for the 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.540
 shoulder and then layers up to the 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.130
 final and also I have it paraded and 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.290
 this part of here that is part of the 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.019
 bangs I have quite downloaded 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.269
 because I have a lot of hair and 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.769
 I'm left here with a huge hair mazacote 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.170
 that if I want to put it behind the 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.730
 ear in a lot of volume then she with 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.739
 some scissors you expect they have for 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.420
 download I downloaded a lot this 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.069
 part and in that way also gives me a 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.959
 little more volume because those scissors 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.640
 they also use them all over their hair and 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.350
 I downloaded a little the top layer 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.730
 so that in that way it also helps 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.340
 that there is a little more volume in 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.670
 As for the hairdresser and that's all 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.050
 now 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.819
 I'm going to count the products that I'm 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.349
 using lately I think I've already 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.390
 taught all but just to 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:21.420
 remember you or if you did not know 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.060
 seen my favorite chamba is this is the 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.860
 Mobile de l'Oréal is the sporting shampoo 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.290
 and it's the soufflé because then there's another 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.569
 that is normal this is a little bit more 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.370
 light I love I'm super little 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.170
 and nothing when it's over I'm going to 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.840
 buy another and right now I am 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.989
 alternating with those who buy them in 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.330
 us that is the is very intense is supposed 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.280
 which is for a little manageable hair 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.590
 I really like the smell leaves the 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.300
 very clean hair and very hydrated if 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.319
 could get here of course what 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.019
 I would buy again when I was 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:54.630
 it will end but it is not the case so 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.660
 probably when it's over, I'll stick 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.220
 to 2005 today and another product that also 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.680
 I love it and I can not get here 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.150
 is this aussies mask I know that 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.590
 here is another one that is the three minute 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.350
 also but it has absolutely nothing 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.739
 what to do with this this is the first as 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.540
 it's supposed to give you three times more 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.240
 hydration in three minutes is a 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.250
 hydration treatment 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.780
 very very deep has nothing to do 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.250
 with what to come here because in fact I 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.930
 I recommended a friend this 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.030
 mask and she bought the one that 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.770
 sold here and told me that it did not appear 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.230
 nothing too special, so I do not think 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.910
 they are comparable me three times already 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.400
 us three times that I was loaded with 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.140
 Boats because it's my favorite and if you have 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.550
 the opportunity to try it I recommend a 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.410
 Lots of the last thing I 'm going to talk about 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.780
 it's something that has marked a great 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.640
 big difference I think that's what it does 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.600
 that my hair looks so bright and 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:47.060
 so smooth and so healthy is this brush is 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.460
 a ceramic brush is thermal and what 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.070
 what it does is that it deals much better 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.260
 heat and dryer air and leave but 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.760
 with this brilliant finish before 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.500
 to have this brush I did not have the 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.600
 hair that's why I tell you that it 's the 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.200
 things that make the most difference in terms of 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.910
 to the final hair finish and I'm 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.920
 delighted with him I think it's not very expensive 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.570
 They gave it to me as a present 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.120
 mother she bought it in a store 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.280
 hairdressing professional and if you have the 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.050
 smooth hair I recommend you to do 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.490
 with a brush like this to untangle 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.350
 when I get out of the shower it's still 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.860
 using the teaser tandem that now 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.240
 same 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.650
 I have here but well I will leave you 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.599
 here a picture and I think you're know 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.849
 how is it and I think I do not forget anything 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:28.069
 if you have any question or any 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:30.520
 doubt as always in the comments I 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:30.520
 you can do it 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.569
 Well this is the new haircut I've 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.310
 decided to put a clip because I still do not 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:43.220
 has finished editing the video so 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.080
 I wanted to show you how it was and what 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.900
 has been the change I know that many are going to 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.610
 be curious to know how europe and 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.440
 no and what product was used but 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.330
 I 'm still trying things because I 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.370
 I cut it yesterday new tomorrow so from 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.259
 moment I can not tell you exactly 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.210
 what are the things that work best 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:01.729
 but as I tell you, I was already beginning to try 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.710
 things and see what is the best way to 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:05.330
 make waves and all that when 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.400
 have still a little more controlled 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.229
 a video came out to tell you what the 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.060
 better way so if any of you 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:12.949
 is thinking about cutting a hair like that 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.590
 just cut what I can 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:17.599
 overtaking is that the most important thing for 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.909
 This type of cut to make it right 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:22.310
 is to get the right texture in the 

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:23.990
 hair and more or less that's what I'm 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.060
 investigating right now using 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.860
 different things and well I'm going to put 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.509
 to record another video that is going to be the 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.030
 video on Wednesday you want to advance that 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:32.870
 is going to be about gloss is my gloss is 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.670
 low range 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.770
 and nothing else with degrees again the 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:39.110
 Wednesday as always lay him
