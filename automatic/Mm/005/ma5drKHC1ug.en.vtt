so<00:03:31.480> let's<00:03:31.690> try<00:03:31.840> doing<00:03:31.870> NDK<00:03:32.380> this<00:03:32.590> is<00:03:32.850> you<00:03:33.850> can

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
so let's try doing NDK this is you can

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.810 
so let's try doing NDK this is you can
see<00:03:34.980> both<00:03:35.980> looks<00:03:36.220> in<00:03:36.370> from<00:03:36.580> the<00:03:36.670> inside

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
see both looks in from the inside

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.940 
see both looks in from the inside
there's<00:03:37.270> barely<00:03:37.630> any<00:03:37.900> difference<00:03:38.230> the<00:03:38.920> only

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
there's barely any difference the only

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.920 
there's barely any difference the only
difference<00:03:39.130> is<00:03:39.610> about<00:03:39.760> dry<00:03:40.090> spot<00:03:40.420> that's<00:03:40.840> in

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
difference is about dry spot that's in

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.380 
difference is about dry spot that's in
the<00:03:41.020> place<00:03:41.260> this<00:03:42.010> is<00:03:42.190> the<00:03:42.340> rubber<00:03:42.550> body<00:03:42.850> this

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
the place this is the rubber body this

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.540 
the place this is the rubber body this
is<00:03:43.420> hard<00:03:44.020> rubber<00:03:44.230> this<00:03:45.070> doesn't<00:03:45.430> have

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
is hard rubber this doesn't have

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.990 
is hard rubber this doesn't have
anything<00:03:45.790> I<00:03:46.210> can<00:03:47.110> keep<00:03:47.320> this<00:03:47.670> for<00:03:48.670> later<00:03:48.880> on

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
anything I can keep this for later on

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:57.449 
anything I can keep this for later on
