00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.910 

okay<00:00:00.630> so<00:00:00.690> now<00:00:00.960> I'm<00:00:01.140> actually<00:00:01.380> going<00:00:01.680> to<00:00:01.740> go

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
okay so now I'm actually going to go

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.730 
okay so now I'm actually going to go
through<00:00:02.280> and<00:00:02.520> separate<00:00:03.030> I'm<00:00:03.659> going<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.470> cut

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
through and separate I'm going to cut

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.730 
through and separate I'm going to cut
apart<00:00:05.420> the<00:00:06.420> weaker<00:00:06.810> lock<00:00:07.049> see<00:00:07.379> if<00:00:07.470> you<00:00:07.589> look

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
apart the weaker lock see if you look

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.040 
apart the weaker lock see if you look
along<00:00:08.069> here<00:00:08.099> this<00:00:08.760> one<00:00:08.970> is<00:00:09.000> definitely<00:00:09.360> weaker

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
along here this one is definitely weaker

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.950 
along here this one is definitely weaker
this<00:00:10.230> looks<00:00:10.500> like<00:00:10.679> one<00:00:10.889> consistent<00:00:11.400> lock<00:00:11.580> can

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 
this looks like one consistent lock can

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.959 
this looks like one consistent lock can
begin<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.170> end<00:00:13.349> so<00:00:13.559> I'm<00:00:13.679> going<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.860> cut<00:00:14.070> off<00:00:14.250> the

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
begin to end so I'm going to cut off the

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.820 
begin to end so I'm going to cut off the
weakest<00:00:15.269> link<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.719> this<00:00:16.320> is<00:00:16.470> what<00:00:16.619> I'm<00:00:16.710> going

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
weakest link and this is what I'm going

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.519 
weakest link and this is what I'm going
to<00:00:16.890> use<00:00:16.970> to<00:00:17.970> fuse<00:00:18.300> on<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.810> these<00:00:18.930> short<00:00:19.260> blocks

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
to use to fuse on to these short blocks

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:34.580 
to use to fuse on to these short blocks
in<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.580> top<00:00:23.060> this<00:00:24.060> one<00:00:32.930> okay<00:00:33.930> now<00:00:34.110> my<00:00:34.290> next

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
in the top this one okay now my next

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.959 
in the top this one okay now my next
step<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:35.510> to<00:00:36.510> separate<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.739> parts<00:00:38.280> in<00:00:38.910> the

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
step is to separate the parts in the

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.490 
step is to separate the parts in the
front<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.540> know<00:00:39.660> which<00:00:39.930> sections<00:00:40.350> I'm

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
front so I know which sections I'm

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.450 
front so I know which sections I'm
dealing<00:00:40.860> with<00:00:41.120> blocks<00:00:45.860> see<00:00:46.860> what's<00:00:47.129> better

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
dealing with blocks see what's better

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.459 
dealing with blocks see what's better
light<00:00:50.210> so<00:00:51.210> I'm<00:00:51.360> just<00:00:51.539> pulling<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:51.989> hair<00:00:52.170> apart

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
light so I'm just pulling the hair apart

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.650 
light so I'm just pulling the hair apart
and<00:00:53.190> separating<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.850> into<00:00:54.120> different

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
and separating it into different

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.310 
and separating it into different
sections<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.230> I'll<00:00:55.620> show<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.860> my<00:00:56.160> tools

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
sections and I'll show you my tools

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.849 
sections and I'll show you my tools
again<00:00:58.609> you<00:00:59.609> know<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.760> have<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.410> kinky<00:01:01.410> hair<00:01:01.620> I

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
again you know I have the kinky hair I

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.260 
again you know I have the kinky hair I
have<00:01:03.890> hair<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:04.920> I'll<00:01:05.220> cut<00:01:05.489> off<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.939> her<00:01:06.060> hair

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
have hair that I'll cut off of her hair

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.789 
have hair that I'll cut off of her hair
from<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.869> fused<00:01:07.170> locks<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:08.299> an<00:01:09.470> actual<00:01:10.470> batch

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
from the fused locks so an actual batch

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.310 
from the fused locks so an actual batch
of<00:01:11.159> locks<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.820> can<00:01:12.030> use<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.659> attach<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
of locks that I can use to attach to the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.080 
of locks that I can use to attach to the
short<00:01:13.530> ones<00:01:16.040> but<00:01:17.040> now<00:01:17.159> I'm<00:01:17.400> separating<00:01:17.970> I'm

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
short ones but now I'm separating I'm

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.289 
short ones but now I'm separating I'm
actually<00:01:18.299> pulling<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.960> hair<00:01:19.170> apart<00:01:20.150> from<00:01:21.150> the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
actually pulling the hair apart from the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.140 
actually pulling the hair apart from the
ends<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:22.500> see<00:01:22.710> where<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.220> parts<00:01:23.549> are<00:01:23.759> on<00:01:24.000> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
ends to see where the parts are on the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.999 
ends to see where the parts are on the
scalp<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.600> delete<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.409> some<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.770> this<00:01:25.860> hair

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
scalp and delete and some of this hair

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.070 
scalp and delete and some of this hair
because<00:01:26.460> it's<00:01:26.729> kind<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.000> short<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.540> can<00:01:27.659> just

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
because it's kind of short I can just

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.039 
because it's kind of short I can just
kind<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.350> separate<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.100> reform<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.299> part

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
kind of separate it and reform the part

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.429 
kind of separate it and reform the part
around<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.680> lock<00:01:32.810> because<00:01:33.810> we<00:01:33.990> still<00:01:34.200> have

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
around the lock because we still have

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.429 
around the lock because we still have
some<00:01:34.470> nice<00:01:34.979> viable<00:01:35.579> box<00:01:35.790> up<00:01:36.030> here<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.450> an<00:01:36.600> 8-3

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
some nice viable box up here is an 8-3

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.560 
some nice viable box up here is an 8-3
I'm<00:01:37.979> really<00:01:38.310> looking<00:01:38.640> for<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.119> loose<00:01:39.299> hair

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
I'm really looking for the loose hair

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.200 
I'm really looking for the loose hair
that<00:01:39.869> needs<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.350> lot<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.680> attach<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:41.939> I

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
that needs a lot of attach to it so I

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.510 
that needs a lot of attach to it so I
separate<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.140> hair<00:01:43.320> as<00:01:43.500> much<00:01:43.530> as<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.920> can<00:01:44.159> on

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
separate the hair as much as I can on

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.670 
separate the hair as much as I can on
the<00:01:45.360> ends<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.899> then<00:01:46.020> when<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.200> get<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.560> the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
the ends and then when I get to the

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.389 
the ends and then when I get to the
roots<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.159> try<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.430> gently<00:01:48.140> pull<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.290> apart<00:01:49.399> if

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
roots I try to gently pull it apart if

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.499 
roots I try to gently pull it apart if
you<00:01:50.579> see<00:01:50.759> here<00:01:52.820> pull<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:53.970> hair<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:54.240> hair

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
you see here pull this hair this hair

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.600 
you see here pull this hair this hair
he's<00:01:55.170> trying<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.740> look<00:01:55.829> like<00:01:56.040> lock<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.430> see

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
he's trying to look like lock to see

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.899 
he's trying to look like lock to see
where<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.270> hair<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.479> beginning<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:58.079> form<00:01:58.909> into

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
where the hair is beginning to form into

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.660 
where the hair is beginning to form into
one<00:02:00.090> unit<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:01.140> I'm<00:02:01.500> going<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:02.070> just<00:02:02.369> kind<00:02:02.520> of

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
one unit so I'm going to just kind of

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.490 
one unit so I'm going to just kind of
separate<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.090> with<00:02:03.299> my<00:02:03.420> finger<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:03.899> yock<00:02:04.200> put

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
separate it with my finger and yock put

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.030 
separate it with my finger and yock put
on<00:02:04.649> our<00:02:04.860> really<00:02:05.070> super<00:02:05.610> defined<00:02:06.000> part<00:02:06.329> there

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
to be able to make super precise parts

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.520 
to be able to make super precise parts
because<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.730> other<00:02:19.880> hair<00:02:20.150> is<00:02:20.870> already<00:02:21.140> locked

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
because the other hair is already locked

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.620 
because the other hair is already locked
around<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.670> i'm<00:02:23.030> just<00:02:23.180> gonna

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
around and i'm just gonna

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.510 
around and i'm just gonna
once<00:02:23.840> I<00:02:23.960> separated<00:02:24.470> I'm<00:02:24.920> just<00:02:25.220> putting<00:02:25.460> a

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
once I separated I'm just putting a

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.520 
once I separated I'm just putting a
partial<00:02:26.030> braid<00:02:26.270> there<00:02:26.570> so<00:02:27.050> that<00:02:27.200> it<00:02:27.320> stays

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
partial braid there so that it stays

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.800 
partial braid there so that it stays
separated<00:02:28.310> and<00:02:29.030> I'm<00:02:29.120> not<00:02:29.300> putting<00:02:29.480> braids

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
separated and I'm not putting braids

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.480 
separated and I'm not putting braids
close<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.320> scalp<00:02:30.590> I'm<00:02:30.830> leaving<00:02:31.130> it<00:02:31.250> loose

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
close to the scalp I'm leaving it loose

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.820 
close to the scalp I'm leaving it loose
so<00:02:32.120> that<00:02:32.270> when<00:02:32.420> I<00:02:32.450> palm<00:02:32.810> roll<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.320> hair<00:02:33.590> and

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
so that when I palm roll the hair and

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.250 
so that when I palm roll the hair and
the<00:02:33.980> end<00:02:34.540> it'll<00:02:35.540> all<00:02:35.780> still<00:02:36.050> have<00:02:36.230> a

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
the end it'll all still have a

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.900 
the end it'll all still have a
consistent<00:02:36.830> look<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.130> all<00:02:37.370> of<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.700> roots

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
consistent look and all of the roots

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.670 
consistent look and all of the roots
will<00:02:38.120> be<00:02:38.150> palm<00:02:38.480> rolled<00:02:38.810> so<00:02:39.140> I<00:02:39.170> wouldn't<00:02:39.500> want

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
will be palm rolled so I wouldn't want

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.740 
will be palm rolled so I wouldn't want
my<00:02:39.800> blade<00:02:40.040> to<00:02:40.220> be<00:02:40.310> close<00:02:40.550> to<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.820> roof<00:02:41.030> for

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
my blade to be close to the roof for

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.410 
my blade to be close to the roof for
that<00:02:41.930> reason<00:02:41.959> trees<00:02:42.940> see<00:02:43.940> I'm<00:02:44.030> going<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.240> pull

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
that reason trees see I'm going to pull

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.880 
that reason trees see I'm going to pull
this<00:02:44.540> apart<00:02:44.720> that<00:02:45.200> time<00:02:45.440> it<00:02:45.560> looks<00:02:45.709> like<00:02:45.770> a

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
this apart that time it looks like a

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.640 
this apart that time it looks like a
larger<00:02:46.370> and<00:02:47.060> then<00:02:47.240> I'll<00:02:47.420> separate<00:02:48.050> it<00:02:50.500> with<00:02:51.500> my

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
larger and then I'll separate it with my

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.230 
larger and then I'll separate it with my
finger<00:02:52.070> to<00:02:52.970> refine<00:02:53.330> the<00:02:53.600> part<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:55.430> then<00:02:55.640> I'll

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
finger to refine the part and then I'll

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.810 
finger to refine the part and then I'll
braid<00:02:56.690> just<00:02:57.530> a<00:02:57.709> little<00:02:57.980> bit<00:02:58.100> of<00:02:58.190> a<00:02:58.250> braid<00:02:58.489> so

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
braid just a little bit of a braid so

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.870 
braid just a little bit of a braid so
that<00:02:59.000> that<00:02:59.150> stays<00:02:59.450> separated<00:03:00.230> and<00:03:01.160> eventually

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
that that stays separated and eventually

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.560 
that that stays separated and eventually
you<00:03:02.000> know<00:03:02.090> after<00:03:02.390> I<00:03:02.420> shampoo<00:03:02.630> it<00:03:03.020> I'm<00:03:03.200> going<00:03:03.470> to
