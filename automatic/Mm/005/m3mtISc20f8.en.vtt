bottom of your thigh is parallel that's
what<00:00:33.989> we're<00:00:34.110> looking<00:00:34.320> at<00:00:34.469> because<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.550> is

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
what we're looking at because that is

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.819 
what we're looking at because that is
the<00:00:36.059> standard<00:00:36.570> squat<00:00:36.960> position<00:00:37.170> for<00:00:37.620> someone

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
the standard squat position for someone

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.970 
the standard squat position for someone
with<00:00:38.129> normal<00:00:38.489> healthy<00:00:39.120> joint<00:00:39.390> mobility

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
with normal healthy joint mobility

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.350 
with normal healthy joint mobility
irrespective<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.100> individual<00:00:41.670> genetics<00:00:42.180> and

irrespective of individual genetics and

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.450 
irrespective of individual genetics and
hip<00:00:42.510> structure<00:00:42.829> that<00:00:43.829> should<00:00:44.129> be<00:00:44.250> your

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
hip structure that should be your

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.850 
hip structure that should be your
baseline<00:00:44.969> now<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:46.260> doesn't<00:00:46.440> mean<00:00:46.710> that

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
baseline now that doesn't mean that

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.260 
baseline now that doesn't mean that
that's<00:00:47.010> exactly<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.730> where<00:00:47.850> everyone<00:00:48.120> should

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
that's exactly to where everyone should

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.810 
that's exactly to where everyone should
squat<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.800> just<00:00:50.039> means<00:00:50.280> that's<00:00:50.430> kind<00:00:50.760> of

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
squat that just means that's kind of

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.600 
squat that just means that's kind of
your<00:00:51.030> starting<00:00:51.510> point<00:00:51.829> for<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.219> assess

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
your starting point for you to assess

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.799 
your starting point for you to assess
and<00:00:53.850> now<00:00:53.910> some<00:00:54.180> people<00:00:54.300> when<00:00:54.510> they<00:00:54.629> first

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
and now some people when they first

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.299 
and now some people when they first
start<00:00:54.960> squatting<00:00:55.440> they<00:00:55.710> aren't<00:00:56.070> mobile

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
start squatting they aren't mobile

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.779 
start squatting they aren't mobile
enough<00:00:56.730> due<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.270> sedentary<00:00:57.930> lifestyle

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
enough due to the sedentary lifestyle

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:00.920 
enough due to the sedentary lifestyle
and<00:00:59.789> other<00:01:00.000> issues<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:00.600> contributed

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
and other issues that have contributed

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.979 
and other issues that have contributed
to<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.829> they<00:01:02.190> might<00:01:02.430> need<00:01:02.879> up<00:01:03.180> two<00:01:03.449> to

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
to that and they might need up two to

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.780 
to that and they might need up two to
three<00:01:04.350> weeks<00:01:04.589> maybe<00:01:04.890> even<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.189> full<00:01:05.369> month<00:01:05.670> of

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
three weeks maybe even a full month of

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.340 
three weeks maybe even a full month of
mobility<00:01:06.299> work<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.630> be<00:01:06.750> able<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.960> squat<00:01:07.320> to

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
mobility work to be able to squat to

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.010 
mobility work to be able to squat to
depth<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.189> that's<00:01:08.970> okay<00:01:09.360> but<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.750> should<00:01:09.990> be

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
depth and that's okay but that should be

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.330 
depth and that's okay but that should be
their<00:01:10.320> goal<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.740> where<00:01:10.920> they're<00:01:11.159> working

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
their goal of where they're working

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.640 
their goal of where they're working
towards<00:01:12.119> now<00:01:12.360> if<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.930> lot<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.290> times<00:01:13.470> you'll<00:01:13.619> see

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
towards now if a lot of times you'll see

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.710 
towards now if a lot of times you'll see
beginners<00:01:14.220> are<00:01:14.400> using<00:01:14.700> too<00:01:14.909> much<00:01:15.150> weight<00:01:15.450> and

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
beginners are using too much weight and

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.330 
beginners are using too much weight and
that's<00:01:15.900> why<00:01:16.140> they<00:01:16.320> can't<00:01:16.590> do<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.040> maybe<00:01:17.189> you

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
that's why they can't do it so maybe you

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.859 
that's why they can't do it so maybe you
go<00:01:17.490> back<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.759> just<00:01:17.909> bodyweight<00:01:18.299> squats<00:01:18.630> or<00:01:18.780> an

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
go back to just bodyweight squats or an

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.429 
go back to just bodyweight squats or an
empty<00:01:19.110> bar<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.759> practice<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.909> line<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.180> depth

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
empty bar and practice the line to depth

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.990 
empty bar and practice the line to depth
so<00:01:22.439> it's<00:01:22.560> not<00:01:22.680> always<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.130> mobility<00:01:23.759> issue

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
so it's not always a mobility issue

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.969 
so it's not always a mobility issue
there's<00:01:24.270> some<00:01:24.420> technique<00:01:24.780> issues<00:01:25.140> there<00:01:25.409> now

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
there's some technique issues there now

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.830 
there's some technique issues there now
the<00:01:26.040> other<00:01:26.580> issue<00:01:26.880> with<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.630> course

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
the other issue with that is of course

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.270 
the other issue with that is of course
some<00:01:28.140> people<00:01:28.350> say<00:01:28.500> well<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.680> bodybuilder

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
some people say well a bodybuilder

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.469 
some people say well a bodybuilder
whatever<00:01:29.549> doesn't<00:01:29.759> always<00:01:29.970> do<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.240> well

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
whatever doesn't always do that well

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.120 
whatever doesn't always do that well
that's<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.960> issue<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.380> go<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:31.950> they

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
that's the issue we go to is that they

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.850 
that's the issue we go to is that they
are<00:01:32.189> doing<00:01:32.430> heavy<00:01:32.820> work<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:34.200> not<00:01:34.409> working<00:01:34.650> the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
are doing heavy work and not working the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.710 
are doing heavy work and not working the
full<00:01:35.070> range<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.400> motion<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.970> joint<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.479> over

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
full range of motion the joint and over

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.039 
full range of motion the joint and over
time<00:01:37.049> that's<00:01:37.409> going<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.710> get<00:01:37.829> tribute<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:39.049> the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
time that's going to get tribute to the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.440 
time that's going to get tribute to the
generative<00:01:40.439> issues<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:41.040> their<00:01:41.189> joints<00:01:41.820> and

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
generative issues in their joints and
