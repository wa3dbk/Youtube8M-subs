Hi everyone!

00:00:19.588 --> 00:00:22.487
Today we're back on Final Fantasy XI for a new video

00:00:22.487 --> 00:00:25.877
In the Delve event, like i said in my previous video

00:00:25.877 --> 00:00:30.038
Against a Orobon Boss, which can be found in the Foret de Hennetiel

00:00:30.912 --> 00:00:33.313
This fight is special because it's a zerg fight

00:00:33.517 --> 00:00:35.731
Like the boss from legion

00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:38.508
That's why it's not a very long fight

00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:43.815
As you can see i'm using the 2 hour Tabula Rasa

00:00:43.815 --> 00:00:48.821
Not to give Embrava like i used to in some of my previous video

00:00:48.821 --> 00:00:50.474
But this time it's just for stun

00:00:50.474 --> 00:00:54.763
It's really nice because it allow me to have stun always available

00:00:55.732 --> 00:00:59.881
As you can see, his HP bar is hidden, but it wont be for the whole fight

00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:03.157
We can break his lantern, that's a special thing from this boss

00:01:03.157 --> 00:01:09.698
It can for first prevent him from using ability which would require his Lantern

00:01:09.698 --> 00:01:17.293
Now that they're broke, we can see his HP

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.092
I don't have much to says on him, it's a Zerg fight

00:01:24.092 --> 00:01:28.291
We need to stun all his ability because he has most of the Orobon ability

00:01:28.806 --> 00:01:33.343
Such as, an ability that'll reduce Hp to 1

00:01:33.597 --> 00:01:42.797
Or the one when he hit the ground with his tails

00:01:42.797 --> 00:01:43.546
Which does a lot of damage

00:01:44.218 --> 00:01:48.413
He can also use an ability that'll do a Charmga on everyone

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.927
And if it get through

00:01:52.422 --> 00:01:55.261
let's just say the fight is over

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.861
That's why we need to be really carefull with stun and having tabula rasa was awesome

00:02:02.173 --> 00:02:04.138
I don't have much else to say on him

00:02:04.388 --> 00:02:10.661
This fight is like many other fight from other event, it's a lot of buffs before the fight

00:02:10.661 --> 00:02:13.186
But the fight itself is just zerg

00:02:13.452 --> 00:02:17.102
I wanted to come back on what i said in my last video on the rage

00:02:17.102 --> 00:02:22.265
Because as i told you that boss after 20 min get in rage

00:02:22.265 --> 00:02:26.009
And they'd become much stronger, actually the Orobon would become invinsible

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:29.147
But it's not the case anymore because the update i was talking about last time

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:36.742
The one that make these boss depop after 20 min has happened yesterday, or this morning, i'm not sure

00:02:36.742 --> 00:02:41.032
But after 20 min, these boss will depop

00:02:41.032 --> 00:02:45.135
The boss is almost dead, so i hope you liked this video
