 one single package arrived to 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.460
 Unfortunately, only one is really sorry 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.109
 Only one parcel arrived due to 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.580
 I have a question for you but this 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.460
 will be the end of the release and now let's 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.000
 let's see the package itself went to 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.789
 China Post China Post 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.590
 sold it rated at one dollar 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:34.489
 weight 20 grams is generally 27 equal to the chronicle 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:39.960
 played and sold corolla that it is not 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:46.910

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.490
 just such 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:03.850
 you are another chain 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:06.850
 falling on yes I'm such a chain 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:13.450
 packaging but important to us is not visible on black 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:21.310
 background I do not know what kind of mashkov 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:23.649
 strange that such a piece of paper 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.140
 let's take a look at the chain itself 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:35.229
 in fact, she pretends to be a little 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:37.090
 sharkan it is made of iron and removable 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:41.679
 iron did not know you there they see that 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.990
 seen here on black remember black 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:47.979
 paint or how would such a scuff film 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:55.539
 silver this metal is here here 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:02:05.770
 here is darned very much of what could be 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:12.970
 such fires of all countries are normal that 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:20.800
 things to evaluate the goods by two points 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:25.120
 Well, a maximum of three should generally something like this 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.970
 dear friends look like a button is not 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:34.390
 I know, in principle, to save here 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:36.459
 this garbage but better light alcohol he 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.849
 Generally my dear friends to you 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.080
 the question is how do you look at the fact that well here 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.180
 yes let me send one parcel today 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.680
 show exactly one package or 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.680
 it's probably better to show 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.310
 several parcels to wait well, when 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.620
 so there are two parcels and then 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.239
 let's say one package doesn't come very 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.519
 wait for other parcels and already 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.140
 shows all together or all hands can 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.359
 show one that from see 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.939
 see if at all when one parcel 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:06.550
 very much, tell me about it 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:12.970
