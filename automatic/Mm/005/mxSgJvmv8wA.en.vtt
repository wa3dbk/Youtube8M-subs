00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
can see we're in the station area now so

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.439 
can see we're in the station area now so
you're<00:00:43.320> going<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.500> blast<00:00:43.770> off<00:00:44.040> here<00:00:44.449> go

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
thing now obviously still quite a bit of

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.030 
thing now obviously still quite a bit of
work<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.200> be<00:00:58.320> done<00:00:58.410> but<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.710> can<00:00:58.800> see<00:00:58.920> this

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
work to be done but you can see this

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.860 
work to be done but you can see this
sort<00:00:59.220> of<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.340> bridge<00:00:59.700> or<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.120> trench<00:01:00.360> over<00:01:00.480> here

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
sort of a bridge or the trench over here

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.249 
sort of a bridge or the trench over here
and<00:01:01.880> just<00:01:02.880> a<00:01:03.090> very<00:01:03.480> large<00:01:03.660> project<00:01:04.050> well<00:01:04.140> we

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
and just a very large project well we

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:05.450 
and just a very large project well we
have<00:01:04.380> no<00:01:04.500> idea<00:01:04.800> we're<00:01:04.920> trying<00:01:05.160> to<00:01:05.220> figure<00:01:05.309> it

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
have no idea we're trying to figure it

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.859 
have no idea we're trying to figure it
out<00:01:05.489> we're<00:01:05.790> like<00:01:05.940> the<00:01:06.060> animal<00:01:06.420> section<00:01:06.750> was

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
out we're like the animal section was

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.290 
out we're like the animal section was
going<00:01:07.080> we're<00:01:07.200> thinking<00:01:07.470> maybe<00:01:07.649> like<00:01:08.300> over

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
going we're thinking maybe like over

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.850 
going we're thinking maybe like over
there<00:01:09.450> somewhere<00:01:09.810> but<00:01:10.080> we<00:01:10.350> really<00:01:10.590> don't<00:01:10.680> know

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
there somewhere but we really don't know

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.210 
there somewhere but we really don't know
not<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> clue<00:01:12.090> but<00:01:13.050> I'm<00:01:13.110> practically<00:01:13.590> good<00:01:13.890> very

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
not a clue but I'm practically good very

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.620 
not a clue but I'm practically good very
very<00:01:14.490> big<00:01:14.759> we'll<00:01:14.970> probably<00:01:15.180> check<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.600> a

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
very big we'll probably check in a

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.420 
very big we'll probably check in a
little<00:01:15.899> bit<00:01:16.020> later<00:01:16.200> on<00:01:16.289> when<00:01:16.590> we're<00:01:16.740> close<00:01:17.310> to
