also<00:00:38.670> has<00:00:38.969> its<00:00:39.210> signature<00:00:39.540> move<00:00:39.780> geomancy

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
also has its signature move geomancy

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.889 
also has its signature move geomancy
which<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.860> super<00:00:41.309> super<00:00:41.340> busted<00:00:42.300> takes<00:00:42.719> two

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
which is super super busted takes two

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.540 
which is super super busted takes two
turns<00:00:43.140> first<00:00:43.469> term<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.800> charging<00:00:44.190> SEC's

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
turns first term is charging SEC's

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.549 
turns first term is charging SEC's
second<00:00:45.059> turn<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.329> gain<00:00:45.539> two<00:00:46.079> stages<00:00:46.379> of

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
second turn you gain two stages of

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.350 
second turn you gain two stages of
special<00:00:46.890> attack<00:00:47.070> two<00:00:47.340> stages<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.879> speed<00:00:48.120> in

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
special attack two stages of speed in

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.840 
special attack two stages of speed in
two<00:00:48.719> stages<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.559> special<00:00:49.890> offense<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.640> pretty

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
two stages of special offense so pretty

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.220 
two stages of special offense so pretty
much<00:00:50.969> it's<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.210> equivalent<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.719> using<00:00:51.989> quiver

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
much it's the equivalent of using quiver

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.680 
much it's the equivalent of using quiver
dance<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.739> bike<00:00:53.100> back-to-back<00:00:53.640> except<00:00:54.480> it

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
dance and bike back-to-back except it

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.200 
dance and bike back-to-back except it
counts<00:00:55.199> under<00:00:55.350> power<00:00:55.680> herb<00:00:55.980> two<00:00:56.730> term<00:00:56.940> moves

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
counts under power herb two term moves

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.299 
counts under power herb two term moves
complete<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.750> one<00:00:57.899> turn<00:00:58.109> including<00:00:58.829> G<00:00:59.010> oh<00:00:59.039> man

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
complete in one turn including G oh man

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.510 
complete in one turn including G oh man
see<00:00:59.550> that's<00:01:00.329> crazy<00:01:01.140> because<00:01:01.440> okay<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.309> have<00:01:02.489> a

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
see that's crazy because okay you have a

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.070 
see that's crazy because okay you have a
ton<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.820> bulk<00:01:03.090> you're<00:01:03.300> going<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.660> endure<00:01:03.899> that

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
ton of bulk you're going to endure that

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.170 
ton of bulk you're going to endure that
hit<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.530> now<00:01:04.680> you'd<00:01:04.860> go<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.280> just<00:01:05.519> sweep

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
hit and now you'd go and just sweep

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.060 
hit and now you'd go and just sweep
everything<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.840> your<00:01:06.960> way<00:01:07.110> now<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.770> was

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
everything in your way now I was

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.350 
everything in your way now I was
thinking<00:01:08.100> running<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.820> hip<00:01:08.939> points<00:01:09.270> is

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
thinking running the hip points is

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.370 
thinking running the hip points is
probably<00:01:09.600> just<00:01:09.720> gonna<00:01:09.810> be<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.020> best<00:01:10.200> option

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
probably just gonna be the best option

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.289 
probably just gonna be the best option
cuz<00:01:10.680> you're<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:10.830> fast<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.030> speed

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
cuz you're so fast that that speed

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.760 
cuz you're so fast that that speed
doubling<00:01:12.659> at<00:01:12.780> level<00:01:13.020> 50<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.409> going<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.680> make

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
doubling at level 50 is going to make

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.410 
doubling at level 50 is going to make
you<00:01:13.890> untouchable<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.820> I'm<00:01:15.090> going<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.270> just

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
you untouchable and I'm going to just

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.600 
you untouchable and I'm going to just
bump<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.689> up<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.810> level<00:01:16.560> 100<00:01:16.710> as<00:01:17.100> well<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.400> just

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
bump it up to level 100 as well and just

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.399 
bump it up to level 100 as well and just
show<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.909> numbers<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.780> you're<00:01:19.110> gonna<00:01:19.259> be

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
show the numbers you you're gonna be

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.350 
show the numbers you you're gonna be
fast<00:01:19.650> now<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.280> can<00:01:20.490> take<00:01:20.700> points<00:01:21.030> off<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
fast now you can take points off of the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.700 
fast now you can take points off of the
hit<00:01:21.509> points<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.840> put<00:01:22.020> them<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.290> speed<00:01:22.590> if

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
hit points and put them in to speed if

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.020
