this idea I should share on my unboxing
for<00:02:31.909> the<00:02:32.030> console<00:02:32.480> as<00:02:32.659> you<00:02:33.469> can<00:02:33.560> see<00:02:33.739> they're

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980

ridged a tool which is sad unlike the
lovely<00:02:39.290> I<00:02:39.500> guess<00:02:40.310> T<00:02:40.519> controller<00:02:40.849> where<00:02:41.239> they

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.359 
lovely I guess T controller where they

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:46.710 
lovely I guess T controller where they
are<00:02:41.480> and<00:02:43.000> it's<00:02:44.000> got<00:02:44.209> the<00:02:44.329> nice<00:02:44.480> new<00:02:44.750> chrome

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.080 
are and it's got the nice new chrome
button<00:02:48.579> and<00:02:50.200> yeah<00:02:51.200> it<00:02:52.099> certainly<00:02:52.579> has<00:02:52.819> a<00:02:52.849> black

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.750 
button and yeah it certainly has a black
battery<00:02:53.480> pack<00:02:54.310> but<00:02:55.310> they<00:02:55.400> didn't<00:02:55.609> make<00:02:55.700> a

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
battery pack but they didn't make a

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.190 
battery pack but they didn't make a
silver<00:02:56.060> one<00:02:56.180> so<00:02:56.359> they<00:02:56.450> just<00:02:56.480> bundle<00:02:57.079> it<00:02:57.169> with

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200
