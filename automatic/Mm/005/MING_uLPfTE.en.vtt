00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:17.490
 hello, how are you? we're back with more 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:22.529
 a video lesson and today we will talk about 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:26.279
 Perimetral leg exercise 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.580
 even the central perimeter is a 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.769
 very long jump training where 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.190
 You'll have to jump to the ball. 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.590
 when the opponent attacks you and takes out 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.410
 Do you want the table? 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.770
 mainly from the forum side renders 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.059
 It will get you off the table. What's done? 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.379
 This you're going to have to go and attack. 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.460
 and this training will cause 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.350
 You salt a lot and I have enough. 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.329
 move in this leg workout 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.559
 called perimeter 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:05.820
 Ok let's see how it works in theory 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.189
 note that you are swapping the ball where 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.710
 beckham rends entering the table leaving 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.220
 more to the left side of your black 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.710
 surrenders and suddenly the opponent leaves and 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.729
 attacks on his has been rendered 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.560
 Taking you down from the table playing well. 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.140
 Off the table. 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.850
 What are you going to do to hit 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.579
 this ball taking it away 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:34.079
 first you will spin your 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:36.960
 hip to the ball's position by turning the 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:42.570
 your hip to the position of the ball goes 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:46.590
 jump jump left leg will touch 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.790
 far you will jump and before you play 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.049
 left leg 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:56.820
 you will chirp goal the ball out of ok 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:59.750
 more or less like this, letting go and 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.310
 continuing the forehand movement 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.610
 important points of this training 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:09.509
 When you jump, throw your leg. 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.190
 left in front and before playing with 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.820
 the left leg on the floor 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.550
 the buff the ball in an unworthy way 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.880
 body and continue giving drive 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.270
 Let's see how this works in the 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.270
 practice 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.490
 I hope you have learned 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.370
