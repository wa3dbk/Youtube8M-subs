00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.000
 also talk to fleur willemsen for a moment 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.250
 because you are a press officer 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.750
 what happens today after what 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.369
 happened the regional 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.900
 youth fire brigade competitions are on 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.820
 played three lanes here at the back of the 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.529
 background you can see the juniors job it 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.180
 his youngest children design among the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.739
 12 and 16 years 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.710
 and on the other hand on 2 job i 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:33.899
 plays and design between 16 and 18 years 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.840
 how important is that the youth's along 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.309
 does something later with the fire department 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.950
 going to do well that is very important 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.329
 because the youth in this way everything 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.899
 learns about the fire department about working at 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.609
 the fire department 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.019
 maybe then also leave easy can 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:47.819
 move on to the real one 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.980
 fire brigade, but also because they like 

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:51.659
 learn everything about fire safety and about 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.460
 fireproof life how do you get it 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:55.260
 the fire comes and how do you act when there 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.089
 is a fire and that also gives all 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.949
 again to their parents and family 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:00.960
 and friends and so on 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.379
 that the fire brigade can also do prevention 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.750
 say more is a society because me 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.310
 I imagine that you say this 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.840
 there is a large group that is always with 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.610
 want the fire department if you are young then 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.000
 tell me I want to add that later 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.330
 but how much power we do of tino 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.920
 have not had one for a year or more 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.050
 Ten years we dress fireproof the pro 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.270
 welding for years you see that there is every batch 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.040
 say someone is moving on 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.990
 but those guys are antique 18 and not 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.070
 every boy or girl is eighteen 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.780
 really already suitable to where the 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.280
 youth fire brigade and as she feels 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.750
 If you want to study, you have to do that 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.280
 first and then they can always later 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.900
 still come back with the always 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.820
 of the youth fire department leadership one 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.140
 kind of report from ben 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.120
 we find them suitable for continuing 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.440
 flows and looks for spots 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.210
 and even if there is no place, they have it 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.840
 however priority to still be able to join 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.790
 and also limit you 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.340
 says of if you for example have glasses 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.470
 wear it then you can not add it 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.460
 no hear no no this is the few 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.270
 limitations especially for the 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.830
 youth fire brigade 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.180
 wearing glasses quickly is also common with the 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.500
 true fire we want all 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.760
 solutions for 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.170
 so a good condition that is 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.490
 important but often doesn't matter 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.080
 so much out 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.239
 I think it will be a beautiful day again 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.069
 so it is good and if she does a lot 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.959
 have fun then you still have 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.060
 a successful day yes certainly I see 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.470

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.510
 face was tense before them 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.560
 of course play the game and 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.489

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.050

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.430
 award ceremony and then we will see 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.940
