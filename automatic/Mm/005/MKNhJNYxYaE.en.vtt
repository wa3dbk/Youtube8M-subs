00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:08.730
 hello how about how well you are coming 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.830
 until my channel today I'm going to show you one 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.629
 little Russian turtle that has adopted 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.429
 for four months his name of 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.890
 wisdom and as you can see there has been a 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.990
 bunch of days here bundled up because neither 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.360
 I had a lot of idea about the issue of 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.010
 turtles have told me to see if the 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.660
 I could take care of these four months since 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.820
 like I have so many animals and they know 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.410
 I can quote them in quotes 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.840
 well giving them the care they do 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.980
 is missing because I said why not and what 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.929
 best way to share it with you 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.539
 to teach us how to eat 

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:39.149
 You already know that these turtles are 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:41.010
 100% vegetarian can give you salad 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.019
 you can give him canons even flowers 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.879
 not those of the field, do not go to catch 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:46.620
 flowers of these that there are those who have 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.600
 thrown crap and sulfates and stuff 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.090
 you can put these in your home and 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.010
 you can also give it to him 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.540
 and good if you have some advice 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.940
 something that you can help me too 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.380
 the theme so that it is even better 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.989
 these four months of what can already 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.030
 be happy then I will 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.190
 I would really appreciate it so you know 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.080
 If any one has turtles and you like them 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.210
 this kind of animals you can tell me 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.440
 more or less where do things go and 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.940
 Well I hope you liked the 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.530
 turtle so let's move on with another 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.360
 good people to have 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.979
 leave here a couple of photos that I have taken 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.660
 more or less so you can see what cure 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.460
 is and do not tell me you have a face 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.410
 beautiful the truth that is super 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.509
 fun and we 're having fun 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.220
 very well taking care of this little turtle 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.200
 what are we going to do with coral milk from a 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.970
 hour and here I am as you see with the 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.860
 little put on my leg taking the 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.180
 Sun as it is going to move and good 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.160
 I was looking forward to these days that you are doing 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.960
 very hot the truth that I love 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.190
 go out to the terrace to sit down and give 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.560
 these sun rings that at least are 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.060
 natural if you see it by the way the part 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.039
 below where the tail is not yet 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.360
 we are not going to move if you look at the 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.130
 part of the waist up is 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.520
 quite gray although it is a little bit the 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.930
 Sun what are you doing me mean with 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.450
 the recording but good I just 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.640
 I wanted to teach you dressed that sit down 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.570
 and do a little reflection on the 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.000
 channel 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.190
 to see how it goes and taking into account the 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.300
 rhythm of videos that I'm doing everything 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.520
 this was teaching a lot of things 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.500
 new ones that are going to come to the channel we 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.869
 like videos of this type that are not 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.009
 very very very edited but I'm going 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.690
 saying some of the little things that 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.510
 I think you can tell me in the 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.100
 comments and I do not know how to tell you that many 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.000

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.630

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.200
 He expected to grow both channel and 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.940
 I'm super happy and for those who 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.410
 maybe they do not like it as much as I am 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.690
 watching the videos or somehow 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.730

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.220

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.430

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.989
 around here in the house I want to tell you 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.580
 If anyone has a thing to leave 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.570

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.050

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.810

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:07.099
 like other people 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.569
