00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 watch this video being like him 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.690
 do you like this video and do you 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.900
 ten fingers 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.700
 then click on the green thumb thank you 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.049
 yo daily guests did whole 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.340
 good day all down and ask one 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.140
 adolescent a new facts video and this 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.580
 time I go there on some random shit ' 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.829
 and this time it's all food 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.270
 or drink related things and me 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:23.529
 I thought I'd let this one go 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.840
 going to do week last week i got in 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.130
 of course can hear French because he 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.570
 had you taken it for me and know it 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.949
 maybe all of you noticed it 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.990
 was uploaded on April 1 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.820
 and that there was of course a joke 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.030
 namely the very first fact video that 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.010
 I had made it myself 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.230
 checks what a bastard and individuality you 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.730
 that was a bit democratic 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.960
 together we decided we thought we were laughing 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.400
 if we would do that maybe for 1 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.930
 April or so see how many people pass through 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.119
 would have all of that very first 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.619
 in fact video was because of text and terms 

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:52.449
 how I pronounced it also has this exactly 

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:53.470
 same with this time so again 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.170
 a new facts video of myself 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.970
 completely original and this time we go 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.470
 so start eating and drinking again 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.549
 boys enjoy 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.769
 and very first person in this 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:05.470
 episode is chris cryer and that is one 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:08.290
 person who just 40 days up 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.890
 beer comes to life and how can you do that 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.920
 propose 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.670
 40 days and copy life and it's none 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.170
 schedule 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.300
 what do you mean he 's already twenty 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.610
 busy for about 35 days 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.810
 and from it still full and I have none 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.120
 idea why I do so 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.130
 he really only lives beer, he doesn't eat anything 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.960
 he drinks nothing but pier and 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.000
 that's it and takes one in the morning 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.159
 beer for breakfast and take in the afternoon 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.690
 a beer for lunch 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.190
 around four o'clock in the evening 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.550
 take another beer as a snack 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.080
 and then in the evening it takes 10th 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.540
 an extra large beer and that's it 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.000
 only thing that lives on how can you do that 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.680
 well for 25 days without eating with and 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.570
 compass that is not healthy 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.770
 take just one arrow at every meal 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.600
 for the rest nothing 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.970
 and work inwards in terms of food 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.650
 well you would think so anyway 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.630
 did not survive to some more and more 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.490
 why would he be that himself 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.750
 he with a brewmaster near Amsterdam 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.729
 brother company 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.890
 own paper namely the flower 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.810
 has developed assen striped 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.340
 and that beer has enough 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.280
 nutritional value to him all week long 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.019
 and even longer just to live 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.370
 and then you have nothing else 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.650
 then need a beer because there is 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.629
 enough for is were in to just one 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.769
 seems to come through all day and me 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.359
 do not know exactly how it works how that 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.069
 can have a beer, but it seems to me 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.960
 not healthier usually if you get one right 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.850
 empty cart got a go at it 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.260
 beer is the alcohol and then it goes 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.180
 not very good when you are very fast 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.740
 get drunk and you feel cunt very quickly 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.360
 but indeed it is not healthy because 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.650
 if you are going to ask how his body is on it 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.310
 responds then he says he is like 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.170
 lost weight 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.540
 He will probably be four inches 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.340
 fell in body circumference and he drove 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.320
 He must now wear our pants belt 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.070
 just be able to keep normal 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.560
 and in addition he probably has 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.150
 every day you mr ass well not 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.980
 He literally had diarrhea 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.520
 Every five minutes the place it 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.340
 diarrhea 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.630
 steadfastness and I know it 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.680
 it sounds very dirty but is very 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.020
 normal because if you are actually alone 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.060
 but drink water or simply pier 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.260
 In this case, you become a shit 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.730
 of course all thinner 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.070
 instead of your grandma eating meats 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.320
 one day but i personally like that 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.460
 man irresponsible because he drinks 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.590
 beer every day 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.150
 ok you know you can but all day long 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.350
 and he just keeps on going 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.120
 the daily life 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.530
 Sure that can't be wrong if you 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.930
 just all day you're sitting at home 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.120
 but he just goes to the car 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.860
 school they pick up child from school in one 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.480
 drunk condition not necessarily drunk 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.700
 he himself that who has a high tolerance 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.500
 level but in tipsy raid 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.790
 And he says he's not much of it 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.650
 notices that he can drive an ordinary man 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.660
 even though he has more on than legal 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.340
 is allowed but I still don't think so 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.020
 really super wise so as someone 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.300
 come across a beautiful couple you will ever come in 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.040
 accident and they always blame 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.720
 because he has been drinking but that 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.640
 story was not the only one there too 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.770
 Namely man who has been alive for 25 years 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.540
 just pizzas and how does that work 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.060
 well he just has about four 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.890
 piet even one day and that's it 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.260
 and that is certainly not healthy, but he is 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.610
 not fat and that sounds strange because you 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.930
 would think if the day was quiet 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.070
 sit just pizza all day 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.990
 that I 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.580
 becomes super deck and he says through me 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.860
 was born in america so i never have 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.740
 really eaten normally and has every day 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.050
 so since about 14 the a15 has 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.640
 he ate around 4 pizzas every day 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.260
 maybe occasionally on more if you are good 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.660
 day may occasionally have less 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.100
 if you have a bad day but I think 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.960
 it's not really normal what he says too 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.609
 I have diabetes and my blood sugar 

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.010
 mirror is very low and like the 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.720
 blood sugar is tremendously low, 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.400
 crawled get blackouts and that is certainly 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.720
 not healthy certainly not good imagine you go 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.580
 sit in traffic and you in one go 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.560
 have a place you can just go anywhere 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.810
 against driving and stuff and all crazy 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.820
 idea weird things that can happen 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.220
 but still compare the pizza with sex 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.490
 He says pizza is just like sex even if 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.789
 the 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.650
 it is really good what the box is but you 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:43.060
 can of course also eat of man and 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.550
 then you just eat for five years 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.410
 raw meat every day indeed 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.699
 raw meat no fried meat or anything 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.979
 and you would think it would be unhealthy 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:53.050
 its robbery food but it's late 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.460
 feeling him very well, namely five 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.449
 years ago derek hmmm got one 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.520
 serious condition 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.990
 He lost her appetite and everything 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.430
 he had come out right there he has 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.650
 then tried different things 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.330
 he has several different ones 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.520
 diets tried something with 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.349
 just fish something with vegetables or 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.919
 Access wheat and dairy he has 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:10.960
 from 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.150
 deleted from them list but nothing helped 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.650
 and it just kept the puke out 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.210
 pooping and all that 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.800
 and then someone spoke 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.780
 otherwise it suffered from the same 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.009
 symptoms and then it suddenly started 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.120
 eating raw meat from that he who 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:24.669
 other person also who is the same 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.169
 had symptoms and then he is raw meat 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:27.970
 and he never got better 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.530
 feeling says that retiro for 5 years 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.990
 flesh and it has now come to its point 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.580
 that is even brushing the teeth with meat 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.069
 the west does not really wind with meat but 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.800
 the fat from meat just the mourning fat 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:39.759
 of meat that is not healthy by me 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.620
 also do not know why I want them 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:43.060
 but apparently that's all he does 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.919
 get in and then you will think 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.599
 how cool are i the then look like 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:48.759
 its cooling is not really a cooling 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:49.900
 it's just a freezer and there 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:51.430
 you insert different things 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.810
 just somewhere to hook he 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.270
 just hang meat just has one 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.009
 carcass of it and somewhere here he 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.240
 the head of a goat also has somewhere 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:05:59.530
 lying in the cold store I don't know either 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.940
 why maybe it eats the brain there 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.979
 I also think that is all of them 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.110
 super tasty but I don't get it and me 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:06.789
 would never want it and I hope so 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.319
 really that i will never be like that or that i will 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:09.310
 know someone who gets that way I have nothing 

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:10.599
 against it 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.479
 well actually i just think it is 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:15.729
 super rancid to eat 11 meat every day 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:17.979
 eat and brush your teeth with just 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:19.240
 animal fat you do not do that
