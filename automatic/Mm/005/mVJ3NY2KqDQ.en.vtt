00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:20.180
 I did beautiful arts in Seville 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.340
 I am Sevillian and good in fine arts what 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.140
 What happens is that there are people who do not have 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.820
 innate of all life that has always 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.779
 drawn and then there are people who 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.029
 better has not drawn so much or does not have it 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.610
 so innate then I was one of those 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.380
 I had not drawn much I introduced myself to 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.930
 provide and good was a career that 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.969
 taught a lot it filled me very much and what 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.350
 I focused a bit more on the stimulus of the 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:47.390
 creativity and good and now it 's there how 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.899
 stimulate creativity but through 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.909
 of the arts not good children 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:56.329
 they need freedom with our time in 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:59.149
 the kids is that they bothered you know the 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.789
 children have to run falling create them 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.400
 it costs a lot but then one thing 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.740
 it takes them to the other one and they feel like 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.290
 there are facts, you know it's mine 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.909
 tomorrow my teacher taught it to me or 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.219
 tomorrow I put on the shirt or 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.189
 they love it is a satisfaction 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:22.229
 incredible and they convey to me the 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:22.229
 success is being happy with what you do 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.780
 because in the end your work is many 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.780
 hours in the day 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.700
 and it's compaginable you know life is not the 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.320
 weekend or free time and the 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.840
 life is all life 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.850
 I do not know is that it's very satisfying when 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.560
 you have one thing that is yours and that the 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.050
 people go appreciating and that suddenly 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.840
 Enter someone and tell you how beautiful I am 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.970
 love your idea what a beautiful project 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.500
 is that that's the answer I get 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.710
 always and then that 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.780
 that is that it fills some new salts at 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.850
 10 at night and I call my mother mom 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.660
 do not see how happy I am 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.960
 been two hours cleaning and I'm in a 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.590
 momentazo of my life but of course 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.590
 just getting started
