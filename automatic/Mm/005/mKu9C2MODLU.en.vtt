00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
general using After Effects so you'll

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.089 
general using After Effects so you'll
want<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.260> have<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.410> working<00:00:10.769> knowledge<00:00:10.800> of

want to have a working knowledge of

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.860 
want to have a working knowledge of
After<00:00:11.460> Effects<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:11.910> start<00:00:12.150> with<00:00:12.269> probably<00:00:12.630> but

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
After Effects to start with probably but

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.930 
After Effects to start with probably but
I'm<00:00:12.990> gonna<00:00:13.110> walk<00:00:13.259> you<00:00:13.380> through<00:00:13.410> how<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.340> make<00:00:14.730> my

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
I'm gonna walk you through how I make my

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.000 
I'm gonna walk you through how I make my
blaster<00:00:15.480> effects<00:00:15.750> so<00:00:16.289> I<00:00:16.350> use<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:16.650> trick<00:00:16.859> in

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
blaster effects so I use this trick in

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.740 
blaster effects so I use this trick in
my<00:00:17.160> most<00:00:17.400> recent<00:00:17.550> Star<00:00:17.970> Wars<00:00:18.000> video<00:00:18.449> where

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
my most recent Star Wars video where

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.450 
my most recent Star Wars video where
Leia<00:00:19.050> rescues<00:00:19.590> Luke<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.039> they<00:00:20.100> shoot<00:00:20.310> these

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
Leia rescues Luke and they shoot these

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.189 
Leia rescues Luke and they shoot these
red<00:00:20.730> blasters<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.510> stormtroopers<00:00:22.050> shoot

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
red blasters and the stormtroopers shoot

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.810 
red blasters and the stormtroopers shoot
them<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.560> also<00:00:22.680> use<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:23.130> same<00:00:23.400> technique

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
them and I also use this same technique

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.400 
them and I also use this same technique
for<00:00:24.060> my<00:00:24.240> laser<00:00:24.480> shades<00:00:24.840> video<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.170> while<00:00:25.350> back

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
for my laser shades video a while back

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.660 
for my laser shades video a while back
where<00:00:25.830> we<00:00:25.920> have<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.160> red<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.519> blue

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
where we have the red and the blue

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.910 
where we have the red and the blue
lasers<00:00:27.060> it's<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.779> same<00:00:28.019> trick<00:00:28.380> but<00:00:28.680> the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
lasers it's the same trick but the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.230 
lasers it's the same trick but the
coloring<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.400> just<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.670> little<00:00:29.849> bit<00:00:29.939> different

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
coloring is just a little bit different

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.279 
coloring is just a little bit different
all<00:00:30.359> right<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:30.539> you've<00:00:30.660> got<00:00:30.779> your<00:00:30.869> footage<00:00:31.140> of

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
all right so you've got your footage of

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.690 
all right so you've got your footage of
someone<00:00:31.650> pretending<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.099> shoot<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.309> blaster

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
someone pretending to shoot a blaster

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.920 
someone pretending to shoot a blaster
and<00:00:32.730> you've<00:00:32.910> thrown<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.390> into<00:00:33.630> After

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
and you've thrown that into After

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.049 
and you've thrown that into After
Effects<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.559> start<00:00:34.860> with<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.040> solid<00:00:35.430> layer

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
Effects so start with a solid layer

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.000 
Effects so start with a solid layer
we're<00:00:36.480> gonna<00:00:36.570> pick<00:00:36.809> red<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.440> just<00:00:37.710> go<00:00:37.890> ahead

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
we're gonna pick red and just go ahead

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.229 
we're gonna pick red and just go ahead
and<00:00:38.100> throw<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.399> on<00:00:38.430> there<00:00:38.640> it's<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.790> brand<00:00:39.059> new

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
and throw that on there it's a brand new

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.420 
and throw that on there it's a brand new
layer<00:00:39.510> then<00:00:40.020> we're<00:00:40.590> gonna<00:00:40.680> cut<00:00:41.100> out<00:00:41.250> the

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
layer then we're gonna cut out the

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.369 
layer then we're gonna cut out the
shapes<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.879> we<00:00:42.000> want<00:00:42.210> frame-by-frame<00:00:42.629> with

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
shapes that we want frame-by-frame with

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.590 
shapes that we want frame-by-frame with
a<00:00:43.410> mask<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.160> red<00:00:44.670> layer<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.210> it's<00:00:45.450> always

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
a mask on that red layer so it's always

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.940 
a mask on that red layer so it's always
gonna<00:00:45.750> be<00:00:45.870> on<00:00:45.960> top<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.260> your<00:00:46.379> footage<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:46.829> we're

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
gonna be on top of your footage so we're

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.110 
gonna be on top of your footage so we're
gonna<00:00:47.070> make<00:00:47.280> lots<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.640> different<00:00:47.940> rectangles

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
gonna make lots of different rectangles

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.240 
gonna make lots of different rectangles
now<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.809> cool<00:00:48.989> thing<00:00:49.020> about<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.680> using

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
now the cool thing about this and using

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.380 
now the cool thing about this and using
the<00:00:50.280> masks<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.879> can<00:00:51.000> draw<00:00:51.149> them<00:00:51.270> however

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
the masks is you can draw them however

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.939 
the masks is you can draw them however
you<00:00:51.570> want<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.170> not<00:00:52.469> only<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.920> a

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
you want is that not only is it a

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.040 
you want is that not only is it a
straight<00:00:53.219> line<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.850> could<00:00:54.149> just<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.719> come

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
straight line that could just you come

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.389 
straight line that could just you come
out<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.289> end<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.649> but<00:00:56.039> say<00:00:56.250> you're

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
out the end of it but say you're

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.680 
out the end of it but say you're
shooting<00:00:56.640> towards<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.940> camera<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.510> want

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
shooting towards the camera and you want

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.240 
shooting towards the camera and you want
it<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.840> have<00:00:57.960> some<00:00:57.989> perspective<00:00:58.649> as<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:58.859> shoots

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
it to have some perspective as it shoots

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.220 
it to have some perspective as it shoots
towards<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.579> camera<00:00:59.789> you<00:01:00.210> can<00:01:00.359> just<00:01:00.600> draw<00:01:01.079> it

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
towards the camera you can just draw it

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.990 
towards the camera you can just draw it
that<00:01:01.410> way<00:01:01.620> getting<00:01:02.100> bigger<00:01:02.430> as<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.730> goes

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
that way getting bigger as it goes

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.549 
that way getting bigger as it goes
towards<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.359> camera<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:03.899> using<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.290> masking

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
towards the camera so using the masking

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.810 
towards the camera so using the masking
tool<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.890> just<00:01:04.949> go<00:01:05.250> ahead<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.489> draw<00:01:05.640> those

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
tool you just go ahead and draw those

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.100 
tool you just go ahead and draw those
points<00:01:06.210> starting<00:01:06.510> with<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.689> tip<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.080> gun

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
points starting with the tip of the gun

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.140 
points starting with the tip of the gun
you<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:07.439> draw<00:01:07.979> two<00:01:08.040> points<00:01:08.549> here<00:01:08.820> draw<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
you just draw two points here draw the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.310 
you just draw two points here draw the
other<00:01:09.299> two<00:01:09.510> points<00:01:09.840> where<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.020> want<00:01:10.260> them

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
other two points where you want them

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.450 
other two points where you want them
once<00:01:10.590> you've<00:01:10.710> drawn<00:01:10.890> your<00:01:10.920> shape<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.369> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
once you've drawn your shape on the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.560 
once you've drawn your shape on the
first<00:01:11.640> frame<00:01:11.880> make<00:01:12.180> sure<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.390> have<00:01:12.479> your

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
first frame make sure you have your

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.179 
first frame make sure you have your
keyframes<00:01:12.990> turned<00:01:13.260> on<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.710> then<00:01:13.920> on<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.100> next

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
keyframes turned on and then on the next

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.710 
keyframes turned on and then on the next
frame<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.760> move<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.150> little<00:01:15.299> bit<00:01:15.479> further

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
frame you move it a little bit further

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.030 
frame you move it a little bit further
into<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.020> distance<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.710> just<00:01:16.890> keep

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
into the distance so you just keep

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.530 
into the distance so you just keep
adding<00:01:17.250> keyframes<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:17.909> just<00:01:18.090> moving<00:01:18.360> your

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
adding keyframes and just moving your

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.179 
adding keyframes and just moving your
keyframes<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.320> rectangle<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:20.040> that

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
keyframes of that rectangle of that

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.770 
keyframes of that rectangle of that
shape<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:21.180> gets<00:01:21.330> further<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.659> further

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
shape so it gets further and further

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.990 
shape so it gets further and further
away<00:01:22.200> typically<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:23.189> laser<00:01:23.460> like<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:23.850> is

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
away typically a laser like this is

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.789 
away typically a laser like this is
going<00:01:24.210> very<00:01:24.240> fast<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.080> want<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.409> go<00:01:25.560> by

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
going very fast so you want to go by

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.469 
going very fast so you want to go by
probably<00:01:26.310> coming<00:01:26.759> out<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.000> barrel<00:01:27.180> for

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
probably coming out of the barrel for

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.789 
probably coming out of the barrel for
one<00:01:27.600> frame<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:27.990> then<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.200> gone<00:01:28.350> if<00:01:28.590> it's<00:01:28.740> a

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
one frame and then it's gone if it's a

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.319 
one frame and then it's gone if it's a
wider<00:01:28.979> shot<00:01:29.070> you'll<00:01:29.460> see<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.700> for<00:01:29.850> two<00:01:30.000> frames

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
wider shot you'll see it for two frames

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.609 
wider shot you'll see it for two frames
if<00:01:30.540> it's<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.720> really<00:01:30.960> really<00:01:31.140> wide<00:01:31.259> shot<00:01:31.500> you're

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
if it's a really really wide shot you're

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.170 
if it's a really really wide shot you're
probably<00:01:31.799> one<00:01:32.100> two<00:01:32.310> three<00:01:32.579> four<00:01:32.820> maybe<00:01:33.060> you

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
probably one two three four maybe you

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.429 
probably one two three four maybe you
see<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.540> know<00:01:33.630> going<00:01:33.810> into<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.110> distance

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
see it you know going into the distance

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.929 
see it you know going into the distance
or<00:01:34.560> whatever<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.009> that's<00:01:35.159> your<00:01:35.310> basic<00:01:35.490> shape

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
or whatever so that's your basic shape

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.340 
or whatever so that's your basic shape
of<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.150> blaster<00:01:36.509> coming<00:01:36.780> out<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.049> matches

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
of the blaster coming out it matches

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.560 
of the blaster coming out it matches
your<00:01:37.470> footage<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:38.549> could<00:01:38.670> have<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:38.970> go<00:01:39.090> behind

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
your footage you could have it go behind

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.210 
your footage you could have it go behind
somebody<00:01:39.960> when<00:01:40.259> you're<00:01:40.350> drawing<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.860> just

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
somebody when you're drawing it just

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.340 
somebody when you're drawing it just
make<00:01:41.400> sure<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.640> ends<00:01:41.880> here<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.810> then<00:01:43.259> it

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
make sure it ends here and then it

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.219 
make sure it ends here and then it
continues<00:01:43.740> on<00:01:43.890> here<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:45.119> oh<00:01:45.390> one<00:01:45.810> behind<00:01:46.079> me

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
continues on here so oh one behind me

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.719 
continues on here so oh one behind me
because<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.710> didn't<00:01:46.920> draw<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.130> over<00:01:47.399> me

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
because you didn't draw it over me

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:48.770 
because you didn't draw it over me
simple<00:01:48.390> as<00:01:48.479> that

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
simple as that

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.999 
simple as that
so<00:01:48.899> you're<00:01:49.049> always<00:01:49.170> drawing<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.619> on<00:01:49.710> top<00:01:49.979> of

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
so you're always drawing it on top of

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.350 
so you're always drawing it on top of
the<00:01:50.220> footage<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.579> course<00:01:50.790> but<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.119> can<00:01:51.240> make

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
the footage of course but you can make

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.700 
the footage of course but you can make
it<00:01:51.509> look<00:01:51.630> like<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:51.930> interacting<00:01:52.409> with<00:01:52.439> stuff

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
it look like it's interacting with stuff

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.679 
it look like it's interacting with stuff
or<00:01:52.860> going<00:01:53.250> behind<00:01:53.369> stuff<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.030> for<00:01:54.270> these<00:01:54.390> red

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
or going behind stuff so for these red

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.090 
or going behind stuff so for these red
Star<00:01:54.930> Wars<00:01:55.110> blasters<00:01:55.530> we've<00:01:55.770> already<00:01:55.920> started

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
Star Wars blasters we've already started

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.069 
Star Wars blasters we've already started
with<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.430> red<00:01:56.640> color<00:01:56.939> but<00:01:57.450> go<00:01:57.689> ahead<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:57.869> add

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
with the red color but go ahead and add

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.990 
with the red color but go ahead and add
a<00:01:58.110> glow<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.100> just<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.310> basic<00:01:59.670> glow

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
a glow so this is just the basic glow

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.730 
a glow so this is just the basic glow
effect<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.600> just<00:02:00.750> drop<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.110> right<00:02:01.350> on<00:02:01.500> that

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
effect you just drop that right on that

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.679 
effect you just drop that right on that
color<00:02:02.009> layer<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.579> then<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.820> can<00:02:02.969> change<00:02:03.390> your

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
color layer and then you can change your

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.330 
color layer and then you can change your
settings<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.049> little<00:02:04.170> bit<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.619> make<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.219> the

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
settings a little bit to make it the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.039 
settings a little bit to make it the
type<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.670> glow<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:05.880> want<00:02:06.090> how<00:02:06.270> big<00:02:06.479> how<00:02:06.780> small

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
type of glow you want how big how small

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.180 
type of glow you want how big how small
whatever<00:02:07.320> now<00:02:07.619> this<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.950> Star<00:02:08.160> Wars

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
whatever now this is the Star Wars

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.639 
whatever now this is the Star Wars
blaster<00:02:08.819> with<00:02:09.000> red<00:02:09.330> on<00:02:09.360> red<00:02:09.509> but<00:02:10.080> for<00:02:10.349> my<00:02:10.440> laser

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
blaster with red on red but for my laser

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.680 
blaster with red on red but for my laser
shades<00:02:11.009> video<00:02:11.370> we're<00:02:11.790> wanted<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.300> be<00:02:12.480> more

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
shades video we're wanted to be more

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.150 
shades video we're wanted to be more
like<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.870> generic<00:02:13.230> laser<00:02:13.560> the

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
like a generic laser the

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.710 
like a generic laser the
inside<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.700> beam<00:02:14.880> is<00:02:15.060> actually<00:02:15.180> white

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
inside of the beam is actually white

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.660 
inside of the beam is actually white
it's<00:02:16.140> kind<00:02:16.320> of<00:02:16.380> a<00:02:16.440> trick<00:02:16.800> it<00:02:17.100> looks<00:02:17.340> like<00:02:17.520> oh

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
it's kind of a trick it looks like oh

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.400 
it's kind of a trick it looks like oh
it's<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:17.940> green<00:02:18.120> laser<00:02:18.270> it's<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.660> blue<00:02:18.810> laser<00:02:18.990> but

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
it's a green laser it's a blue laser but

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.200 
it's a green laser it's a blue laser but
actually<00:02:19.890> it's<00:02:20.010> just<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.310> solid<00:02:20.490> white<00:02:20.940> layer

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
actually it's just a solid white layer

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.120 
actually it's just a solid white layer
and<00:02:21.510> then<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.810> glow<00:02:22.050> is<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.290> color<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.860> the

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
and then the glow is the color and the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.440 
and then the glow is the color and the
reasoning<00:02:23.430> behind<00:02:23.490> that<00:02:23.670> is<00:02:23.790> like<00:02:24.090> if<00:02:24.270> you're

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
reasoning behind that is like if you're

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.000 
reasoning behind that is like if you're
shooting<00:02:24.690> this<00:02:24.870> footage<00:02:25.170> in<00:02:25.410> real<00:02:25.590> life<00:02:25.740> and

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
shooting this footage in real life and

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.320 
shooting this footage in real life and
someone<00:02:26.310> shoots<00:02:26.490> a<00:02:26.580> laser<00:02:26.670> like<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:27.060> you

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
someone shoots a laser like that you

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.970 
someone shoots a laser like that you
imagine<00:02:27.720> it's<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.050> bright<00:02:28.350> that<00:02:28.650> it's<00:02:28.860> going

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
imagine it's so bright that it's going

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.680 
imagine it's so bright that it's going
to<00:02:29.040> just<00:02:29.280> blast<00:02:29.580> out<00:02:29.820> to<00:02:30.000> totally<00:02:30.360> white<00:02:30.480> and

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
to just blast out to totally white and

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.540 
to just blast out to totally white and
then<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:30.870> see<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.170> color<00:02:31.380> as<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:32.160> light<00:02:32.340> kind

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
then you see the color as the light kind

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.770 
then you see the color as the light kind
of<00:02:32.610> dissipates<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.360> technique<00:02:33.660> is

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
of dissipates so the technique is

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.150 
of dissipates so the technique is
exactly<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.290> same<00:02:34.470> it's<00:02:34.710> just<00:02:34.740> a<00:02:34.950> matter<00:02:35.100> of

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
exactly the same it's just a matter of

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.230 
exactly the same it's just a matter of
picking<00:02:35.400> your<00:02:35.640> colors<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:35.970> little<00:02:36.090> bit

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
picking your colors a little bit

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.610 
picking your colors a little bit
differently<00:02:36.570> so<00:02:36.930> that's<00:02:37.170> pretty<00:02:37.320> much<00:02:37.380> it<00:02:37.530> for

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
differently so that's pretty much it for

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.590 
differently so that's pretty much it for
the<00:02:37.800> lasers<00:02:38.130> and<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.340> blasters<00:02:38.760> of<00:02:39.240> course<00:02:39.480> if

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
the lasers and the blasters of course if

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.520 
the lasers and the blasters of course if
you<00:02:39.660> want<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.870> have<00:02:39.960> them<00:02:40.050> hitting<00:02:40.320> something

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
you want to have them hitting something

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.080 
you want to have them hitting something
and<00:02:40.830> you<00:02:40.920> want<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.100> add<00:02:41.190> in<00:02:41.310> some<00:02:41.490> sparks<00:02:41.940> or

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
and you want to add in some sparks or

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.250 
and you want to add in some sparks or
explosions<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:42.720> know<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.900> can<00:02:43.020> do<00:02:43.140> that

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
explosions you know you can do that

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.050 
explosions you know you can do that
using<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.980> number<00:02:44.370> of<00:02:44.400> resources<00:02:44.700> out<00:02:45.030> there

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
using a number of resources out there

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.480 
using a number of resources out there

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
with all kinds of explosions and stuff

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.920 
with all kinds of explosions and stuff
those<00:02:50.880> are<00:02:50.970> already<00:02:51.150> pre<00:02:51.420> matted<00:02:51.840> and
