00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.130
 very good 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.640
 and what happens once again welcome to 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.860
 another chapter is but I will show how the 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.040
 impulse that we can take as exit from 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.470
 emergency or as a mere park 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.540
 attractions using only the tnt the 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.220
 tnt that with this pair of textures is 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.109
 extra here 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.180
 but using the tnt as it is possible 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.100
 that no block has been broken or 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.190
 Even the rest is pretty 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.010
 simple fact when I go when 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.420
 We stopped tnt in water 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.480
 for example here 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.510
 the water let's say it reduces or is made 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.609
 as an insulator of breaking power of the 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.680
 tnt and causes it to only produce the damage of 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:54.990
 momentum and this what makes it possible for 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.890
 we do not see it for example being active 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.890
 a little 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.329
 and it does not happen exactly anything you see me 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.530
 I was throwing a little back but what 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.239
 are the blocks and the material that 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.950
 used construction does not break 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:10.260
 absolutely nothing in return was used 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.260
 because I'm not going to use it here 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.250
 flying I'm flying see for example here 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.560
 obviously as there is no contact with water 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.990
 it will break everything 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.259
 and this is so and we can put 20 boxes 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.259
 of tnt 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.950
 that does not break even a 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.890
 for little 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.740
 all the same 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.340
 and now we go to construction the 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.450
 good construction there is something that is taken 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.700
 pretty fast for example 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.360
 we have to always leave for example 1 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.360
 2. 3 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.770
 it did not always come one is in the middle 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.770
 later because 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.760
 so we have to leave it so if 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.890
 if we want we can put more but 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.290
 let's say that this is the optimal 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.950
 all this here stone next to put 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.950
 then the rest 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.849
 reston rest rest for a tube 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.200
 when the circuit passes through here the 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.540
 rectum circuit when the 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.080
 tnt is to activate it's worth once it's 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.610
 done well we have to put what comes 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.890
 to be the water 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.720
 but the water has to be or has to 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.190
 be has to be placed below 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.990
 the tnt so that when it falls down because 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.170
 there is water and obviously we do not 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.610
 do nothing 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.610
 water here 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.220
 like water in abundance missing 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.220
 after 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.990
 we close 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:20.140
 for example if we want to put if 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.660
 we want we can put that adornment already 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.730
 example in plan lamp so to donate 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.910
 a little to light that always remains 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.910
 all right 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.170
 and already on top of the arrest we put a 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.890
 block the block stays like this if it's 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:40.030
 on top of the rest we take a stick button or 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.410
 be a lever we put it and this then 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.270
 when you activate teach the blocks of 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:48.030
 dynamite that was by how the 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.030
 gravity works and we fly 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.310
 but this in a survival mode has is 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.620
 possible latent takes away a lot of damage 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.670
 let's check it right now it's worth 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.710
 a model is built more or less 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.240
 similar so I'm going to try and take it off 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.980
 to the creative mode I have life and I'm going to 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.990
 use this invention so I take something away 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.180
 of life to see if at least it is 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.900
 feasible 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.900
 active and 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.160
 it does not take anything away from me now if the 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.160
 fall will be tremendous 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.880
 then where with studies works so 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.949
 for this to work this thing here 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.440
 work is necessary two indispensable 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:32.060
 things first there is water with the tnt and 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.860
 second fall into a place where there 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.540
 a lot of water because if we want the earth 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.889
 as we have seen before he hit me in 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.010
 15-m Austria as a sandwich 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:43.820
 earth and that's it for more so 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.590
 that water and water continent so in 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.380
 case of serious enemy or any type 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.960
 of advance guard who do not do the best 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.060
 do good better I do not say it better what 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.250
 I do not I'm on the island 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:59.250
 fast to the cave peaks 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.250
 carrey 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.550
 go Go 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.500
 uy 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.090
 LOL 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.650
 and I think that it is necessary to say then what 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.990
 same as always likes or liked 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:20.110
 favorite you have liked to subscribe 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.310
 if you want to keep watching my videos 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.130
 well I understand that you do not want to see them 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:27.360
 but I'll leave it there and it's a bit 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.360
