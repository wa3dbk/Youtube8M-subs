and<00:02:42.760> pry<00:02:43.760> up<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.180> edge<00:02:44.540> of<00:02:44.750> this<00:02:45.430> dash<00:02:46.430> panel

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
and pry up the edge of this dash panel

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.110 
and pry up the edge of this dash panel
to<00:02:47.150> help<00:02:48.130> release<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.160> clips<00:02:49.579> along<00:02:49.910> this

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
to help release the clips along this

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.069 
to help release the clips along this
panel<00:02:51.760> like<00:02:52.760> I<00:02:52.790> say<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.209> clips<00:02:53.480> release<00:02:53.840> with

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
panel like I say the clips release with

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.850 
panel like I say the clips release with
pride<00:02:54.320> pressure<00:02:55.959> this<00:02:56.959> panel<00:02:57.380> will<00:02:57.530> release

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
pride pressure this panel will release

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:06.320 
pride pressure this panel will release
out

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.920 

there<00:03:07.330> we<00:03:07.510> go<00:03:07.720> this<00:03:09.060> allows<00:03:10.060> this<00:03:10.330> panel<00:03:10.720> to

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
there we go this allows this panel to

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.860 
there we go this allows this panel to
pull<00:03:11.320> back<00:03:11.700> now<00:03:12.700> it<00:03:12.880> does<00:03:13.060> have<00:03:13.270> a<00:03:13.300> wire

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
pull back now it does have a wire

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.510 
pull back now it does have a wire
attached<00:03:14.320> to<00:03:14.350> it<00:03:14.680> that<00:03:14.830> goes<00:03:14.920> back<00:03:15.160> into<00:03:15.190> the

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
attached to it that goes back into the

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.340 
attached to it that goes back into the
dash<00:03:15.790> again<00:03:16.150> with<00:03:16.330> another<00:03:16.450> connector<00:03:17.200> right

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
dash again with another connector right

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.770 
dash again with another connector right
here<00:03:17.700> but<00:03:18.700> this<00:03:18.880> pulls<00:03:19.210> down<00:03:19.420> out<00:03:19.600> of<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.720> way

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
here but this pulls down out of the way

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.210 
here but this pulls down out of the way
we're<00:03:20.020> going<00:03:20.140> to<00:03:20.200> leave<00:03:20.320> this<00:03:20.470> attached<00:03:20.920> as
