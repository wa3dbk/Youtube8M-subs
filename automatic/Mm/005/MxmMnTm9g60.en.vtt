and<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.090> seat<00:01:03.329> area<00:01:03.510> now<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.379> tool<00:01:04.650> does<00:01:05.070> not

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
and the seat area now this tool does not

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.330 
and the seat area now this tool does not
remove<00:01:05.580> any<00:01:05.760> metal<00:01:05.939> like<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.540> tap<00:01:06.840> wood<00:01:07.140> if<00:01:07.439> we

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
remove any metal like a tap wood if we

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.219 
remove any metal like a tap wood if we
remove<00:01:08.670> too<00:01:08.820> much<00:01:08.850> metal<00:01:09.330> then<00:01:09.840> our<00:01:09.960> spark

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
remove too much metal then our spark

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.870 
remove too much metal then our spark
plug<00:01:10.439> could<00:01:10.650> get<00:01:10.830> loose<00:01:11.070> or<00:01:11.280> we<00:01:11.729> don't

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
plug could get loose or we don't

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.929 
plug could get loose or we don't
transfer<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.510> heat<00:01:12.659> necessary<00:01:13.130> so<00:01:14.130> all<00:01:14.610> we<00:01:14.790> do

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
transfer the heat necessary so all we do

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.270 
transfer the heat necessary so all we do
is<00:01:15.090> run<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.420> tool<00:01:15.689> down<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.200> there<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.590> not

is run this tool down in there and not

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.530 
is run this tool down in there and not
only<00:01:17.400> cleans<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.850> threads<00:01:18.090> but<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.360> cleans

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
only cleans the threads but it cleans

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.160 
only cleans the threads but it cleans
the<00:01:18.630> seat<00:01:18.840> area<00:01:19.020> as<00:01:19.229> well<00:01:20.869> when<00:01:21.869> we<00:01:21.900> go<00:01:22.110> to

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
the seat area as well when we go to

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.770 
the seat area as well when we go to
reinstall<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.040> spark<00:01:23.400> plug<00:01:23.729> we<00:01:24.509> need<00:01:24.689> to

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
reinstall the spark plug we need to

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.070

spark<00:01:55.950> plug<00:01:57.200> when<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.290> install<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:58.860> also

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
spark plug when you install it you also

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.319 
spark plug when you install it you also
want<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.340> make<00:01:59.490> sure<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.939> torque<00:02:00.210> it

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
want to make sure that you torque it

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.480 
want to make sure that you torque it
properly<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:01.409> run<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.710> down<00:02:01.799> by<00:02:02.009> hand<00:02:02.040> and

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
properly you run it down by hand and

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.130 
properly you run it down by hand and
then<00:02:02.850> use<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.210> torque<00:02:03.420> spec<00:02:03.659> found<00:02:03.930> in<00:02:04.049> the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
then use the torque spec found in the

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.889 
then use the torque spec found in the
service<00:02:04.500> manual<00:02:05.270> next<00:02:06.270> we<00:02:06.390> want<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.600> look<00:02:06.719> at

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
service manual next we want to look at

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.680 
service manual next we want to look at
the<00:02:06.990> transformer<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.399> extension<00:02:08.970> we

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
the transformer and the extension we

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.740 
the transformer and the extension we
need<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.929> make<00:02:10.080> sure<00:02:10.110> this<00:02:10.530> transformer<00:02:11.310> and

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
need to make sure this transformer and

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.460 
need to make sure this transformer and
extension<00:02:12.750> are

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
extension are

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.520 
extension are
just<00:02:13.950> hand<00:02:14.580> tight<00:02:14.880> together<00:02:15.150> if<00:02:15.600> they're<00:02:16.140> very

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
just hand tight together if they're very

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.140 
just hand tight together if they're very
loose<00:02:16.770> at<00:02:16.950> all<00:02:17.070> we<00:02:17.610> need<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.850> go<00:02:17.940> ahead<00:02:18.060> and

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
loose at all we need to go ahead and

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.270 
loose at all we need to go ahead and
disassemble<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:18.960> check<00:02:19.530> for<00:02:19.560> arcing<00:02:20.130> or

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
disassemble it and check for arcing or

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.040 
disassemble it and check for arcing or
other<00:02:20.760> problems<00:02:21.270> that<00:02:21.330> we<00:02:21.480> could<00:02:21.660> have<00:02:21.870> up

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
other problems that we could have up

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.630 
other problems that we could have up
there<00:02:22.320> the<00:02:22.980> other<00:02:23.010> thing<00:02:23.280> we<00:02:23.400> want<00:02:23.490> to<00:02:23.580> look

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
there the other thing we want to look

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.060 
there the other thing we want to look
for<00:02:23.940> on<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.060> extension<00:02:24.660> is<00:02:24.780> dark<00:02:25.050> spots<00:02:25.350> which

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
for on the extension is dark spots which

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.220 
for on the extension is dark spots which
would<00:02:26.280> indicate<00:02:26.460> a<00:02:26.670> voltage<00:02:27.090> leak<00:02:27.360> we<00:02:28.080> have<00:02:28.170> a

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
would indicate a voltage leak we have a

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.020 
would indicate a voltage leak we have a
voltage<00:02:28.440> leak<00:02:28.770> at<00:02:28.920> our<00:02:29.010> transformer<00:02:29.700> we're

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
voltage leak at our transformer we're

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.670 
voltage leak at our transformer we're
probably<00:02:30.300> not<00:02:30.630> getting<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:30.990> performance<00:02:31.200> out

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
probably not getting the performance out

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.920 
probably not getting the performance out
of<00:02:31.800> this<00:02:31.920> engine<00:02:32.310> that<00:02:32.460> we<00:02:32.550> could<00:02:32.820> for<00:02:33.750> more
