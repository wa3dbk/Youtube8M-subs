00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.060
 even when this lesson sounds repetitive 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.309
 for some 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.440
 there are some aspects that sometimes 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:14.889
 overlooked by teaching numbers 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.699
 from 0 to 10 in French that we are going to 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.699
 see in this video 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:24.460
 for 0 we simply change the cee 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:24.460
 by z 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:34.720
 for one let's remove the final side 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.720
 to 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:45.309
 for two let's just leave the initial and 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.309
 we add this 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.980
 d 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:57.460
 for three let's leave the first two 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:58.970
 initial letters and we add today s 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.600
 jua 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.600
 jua 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:10.090
 for 4 we change the ce for q 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.950
 and the final by 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.369
 cat 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.369
 cat 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:24.600
 for 5 let's remove the final side 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.600
 and then we change the final why 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:36.399
 the 6 is written like the 6 in English 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.399
 but it is pronounced 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.570
 when we are counting numbers always 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.920
 we will use this pronunciation 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.460
 but attention 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.290
 remember that 6 when it precedes 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:59.890
 a word that starts with a vowel 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.890
 his final x is heard as zeta 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.030
 for example six years 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.810
 I follow 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.810
 son 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:15.410
 and one more thing when the 6 precedes 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.620
 a word that starts with a consonant 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:22.120
 as here in this example the word month 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.650
 begins with a consonant m 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.580
 the final X 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.150
 is pronounced 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.910
 remember this only happens if the word 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.040
 that follows six starts with a 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.230
 consonant 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.900
 six months 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.590
 simó 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.590
 simó 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:52.450
 for 7 remove the iv and then the final 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.790
 that's how the number 7 is pronounced 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.790
 but in the writing an api is added 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:08.130
 for 8 we only stay with the h 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.130
 and then we add this 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.240
 for 8 the same thing happens as with 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.670
 on 6 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.800
 if the 8 precedes a word that 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:26.160
 start with a consonant 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:34.070
 Final latte is not pronounced 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:34.070
 for example eight days same floor 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:42.640
 for 9 let's just stay with the ny 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.640
 we add the following 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.190
 but when 9 precedes it to a 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:57.220
 word that starts with vowel sound 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:04:01.240
 the final f of 9 sounds like a short bird 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.930
 for example 9 hours 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.930
 I do not know 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.630
 or also nine years 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.170
 then 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.170
 then 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:22.290
 finally for 10 remove the n and then 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.290
 let's replace the z with x 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.000
 this number happens the same with 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.000
 on 6 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.560
 that we just saw earlier 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:41.120
 we already know by the iron rule 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:44.479
 that when 10 precedes a word that 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.810
 starts with the vocal the X sounds like 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:50.040
 zeta 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:54.260
 for example 10 years 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:58.010
 a stew said 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:01.760
 and like 6 if it precedes a 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:05.840
 word that starts with consonant the 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:09.420
 final equis not pronounced 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.129
 example 10 months 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.729
 draw 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:13.729
 lime 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:21.190
 remember that when you use 10 to 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.190
 tell always will listen 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:31.160
 Now let's review the numbers from 0 to 10 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.160
 leo 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.700
 I 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.700
 jua 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.770
 nothing
