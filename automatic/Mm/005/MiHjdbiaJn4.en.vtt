00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.870
 hoppmann fodder became full 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.490
 accepted 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.590
 this is a really nice player with 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.059
 21 kilos fell on my snowman 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.920
 trick over a carpet of hybrid 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.260
 when they were working properly 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.880
 Well 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.230
 hey people i am often asked what kind of 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.640
 kÃ¶hler for longer sessions with ans 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.199
 take water there is the choice 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.490
 between finished prey rolled itself 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.410
 and I myself actually getting the 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.939
 even rolled for three reasons to 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.800
 First I can determine what's in there 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.240
 is what is very important to me to another 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.230
 I can determine the size of the bait 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.960
 and I am restricted to that 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.640
 fixed size and third, I can 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.079
 influence the degree of hardness of the police 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.489
 and just on waters in the cancer 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.260
 or white fish problem are 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.960
 of course important very hard to Beulich 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.370
 have that you are mail unit with 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.140
 ball i got me from baic service 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.550
 Straubing unroll the world 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.600
 service works exclusively with men 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.640
 Of course, being together is a great one 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.520
 service so i have to roll myself as 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.660
 I'm lazy by the water, of course 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.070
 on the cows on fresh 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.840
 and how do we do that best 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.680
 when we say ten or 14 days 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.309
 on the way 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.379
 salt is the best option it is ideal 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.850
 Such dry sat dry nets 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.689
 to take from it the trekking fast 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.220
 up to five kilos 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.630
 when the sun is shining the wind is blowing 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.189
 It's perfect because the board is too 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.689
 but dry at night when it once 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.189
 gets wet and naturally in the rain 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.259
 belong the ball is in the bucket and then 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.119
 in salt normally it says on 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.830
 at least two parts of paulis at least 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.299
 a part salt man can do the whole thing too 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.580
 one to one mission but then one is 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.229
 I always needed a lot of salt 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.610
 quite like to do is two different 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.500
 to mix sizes here in the case 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.900
 it is constructional 24 and 20 millimeters 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.280
 size just a certain variable there 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.220
 at the feeding place to bring the 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.689
 not zero in on a fish bait 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.280
 anyway I have rolled it myself 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.780
 Finishing of the belong with me also 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.520
 in the luggage because namely from the high 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.829
 impact range of male the peaches in 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.689
 Krien start with two 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.399
 they also contain scott ex playoffs co 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.930
 I really liked changing 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.549
 i trust the other reason 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.530
 Knowing that these baits are white is easy 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.210
 are visually very well perceive 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.610
 the reason i would like to have a few 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.110
 maybe two kilos from my hybrid 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.850
 with a half to a kilo of the 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.710
 lure white and feed the mixed 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.479
 and angela on it and little snowman it 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.009
 of course then with white pop ups me 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.909
 has brought the good fish that should 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.350
 Let's try it 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.090
 Another tip for the warmer one 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.410
 season I am nets before feeding 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.390
 I really like my booty with hemsky 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.350
 New the oil spreads throughout 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.640
 water column 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.440
 is properly speaking the fish on 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.820
 whole level works on for me 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.230
 I always have it very well 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.230
 trust purely tried to the house
