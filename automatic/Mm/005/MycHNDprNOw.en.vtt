00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 if you get all of them, I'm a shoe 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.460
 states and this is minecraft this video 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.470
 here is going to be the shortest video of my 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.300
 channel is worth it because it is to teach you a 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.620
 very simple little trick that almost have 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.960
 already left in the last snapshot of 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.400
 agreement and good so that you know to put it 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.080
 is a secret command protection of 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.640
 way is what they have called the command like this 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.869
 secret but let's say it does not have 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.189
 nothing because I know him and if I 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.260
 I know there can be no secret in the 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.960
 agreement so good let's start 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.260
 let's start with we fall and good that 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.599
 is that is and here we are going to put some 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.450
 rabbits are worth good what are those media 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.890
 pulling here you will tell me and what kind of 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.870
 trick brings them I'm what kind of command 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.640
 what kind of weird stuff are you going to see if 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.280
 weird things are going to be but very rare 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.940
 come down very very very very rare let's put 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.940
 here are these berries 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:50.290
 and esque 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:55.410
 to see to see to see we are fools not 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:57.340
 it can be there is great there is 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.680
 there is a command 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.170
 there is that command that if I put it 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.350
 spamina thats a rabbit jumping says 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.760
 this is a white rabbit with red eyes 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.230
 that jumps more than the others because the 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.350
 others that do not move do not move 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.210
 jumping and jumping so high is worth a 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.590
 bit strange and if it's strange because it's 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.800
 strange for the simple fact that this 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:25.330
 what rabbit is going to do is 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.330
 kill you look is a murderous rabbit 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.670
 we change the difficulty 1 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.920
 2. 3 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.100
 he is not person also assassins we wait 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:45.159
 that we saw a hard difficulty worth and 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.229
 you will see that in maximum difficulty a 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.509
 see but nothing kills me I'm worth and killed 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.710
 in maximum difficulty of two strokes you 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:56.990
 bust the head 1 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.990
 and the vale is a rabbit totally 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.790
 one is totally murderous is the trick 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.649
 of the rabbit kill minecraft and you're 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.659
 in the videos information to leave the 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.030
 command is worth the command that is this 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.390
 they add rabbit rabbit and 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.090
 then the little clouds those in the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.090
 parentheses those rabbit type brackets 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.370
 two points 99 99 is the idea of â€‹â€‹the rabbit 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.340
 okay and it's old yes and you 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.660
 generates the killer rabbit is worth and it is already 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.040
 this has been all if you liked the video 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.819
 of the law subscribe and tomorrow more and
