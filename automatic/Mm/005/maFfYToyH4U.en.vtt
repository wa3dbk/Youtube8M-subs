00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
pressure plate which doesn't look too

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:03.869 
pressure plate which doesn't look too
bad<00:05:00.659> pressure<00:05:01.659> plate<00:05:02.280> which<00:05:03.280> doesn't<00:05:03.759> look

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:13.659 
look at some of those fingers they're

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:17.820 
look at some of those fingers they're
not<00:05:13.900> all<00:05:15.360> not<00:05:16.360> all<00:05:16.389> level<00:05:16.900> across<00:05:17.199> here<00:05:17.590> so

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
not all not all level across here so

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.740 
not all not all level across here so
this<00:05:17.979> is<00:05:18.870> one<00:05:21.060> and<00:05:22.060> then<00:05:22.240> here's<00:05:22.449> a<00:05:22.539> clutch

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
this is one and then here's a clutch

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.779 
this is one and then here's a clutch
disc<00:05:23.940> it's<00:05:24.940> a<00:05:25.029> little<00:05:25.270> worn<00:05:25.479> and<00:05:25.690> the<00:05:26.789> springs

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:27.789 
disc it's a little worn and the springs

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:32.399 
disc it's a little worn and the springs
are<00:05:27.969> also<00:05:28.300> this<00:05:28.479> in<00:05:28.750> here<00:05:31.080> but<00:05:32.080> that's<00:05:32.259> pretty

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:32.409 
are also this in here but that's pretty

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:35.149 
are also this in here but that's pretty
much<00:05:32.529> it

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:35.159 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:38.899 

time<00:05:36.159> to<00:05:36.310> get<00:05:36.400> the<00:05:36.520> flywheel<00:05:36.969> weights<00:05:37.300> and

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:38.909 
time to get the flywheel weights and

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:40.980 
time to get the flywheel weights and
match<00:05:39.909> them<00:05:40.150> up<00:05:40.210> to<00:05:40.270> the<00:05:40.449> spots<00:05:40.750> that<00:05:40.840> they

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
match them up to the spots that they

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.620 
match them up to the spots that they
were<00:05:41.050> in<00:05:41.199> in<00:05:41.319> this<00:05:41.469> one<00:05:41.650> on<00:05:41.740> the<00:05:41.860> new<00:05:41.979> one

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
were in in this one on the new one

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.510 
were in in this one on the new one
that's<00:05:43.630> the<00:05:43.840> old<00:05:43.990> slave<00:05:44.259> cylinder<00:05:44.590> and<00:05:45.190> throw

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
that's the old slave cylinder and throw

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.610 
that's the old slave cylinder and throw
out<00:05:46.500> I'll<00:05:47.500> be<00:05:47.740> installing<00:05:48.099> that<00:05:48.370> and<00:05:49.440> go<00:05:50.440> from

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
out I'll be installing that and go from

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.800 
out I'll be installing that and go from
there
