00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
go from for sensitivity when i came back

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.789 
go from for sensitivity when i came back
to<00:03:30.459> halo<00:03:30.760> i<00:03:31.090> had<00:03:31.329> to<00:03:31.449> turn<00:03:31.659> it<00:03:31.690> up<00:03:31.840> to<00:03:31.989> six<00:03:32.349> just
