00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
majority of it onto the lid and then

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.200 
majority of it onto the lid and then
soften<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.200> out<00:01:34.350> throughout<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.430> wing<00:01:35.759> shape

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.700 

so<00:01:39.210> I'm<00:01:39.299> just<00:01:39.479> taking<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.840> pencil<00:01:40.229> brush<00:01:40.409> and

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
so I'm just taking a pencil brush and

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.730 
so I'm just taking a pencil brush and
softening<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.549> edges<00:01:41.579> just<00:01:42.560> really<00:01:43.560> gently

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
softening the edges just really gently

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.660 
softening the edges just really gently
pulling<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.670> upwards<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.680> then<00:01:46.680> across<00:01:47.399> and

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
pulling it upwards and then across and

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.060 
pulling it upwards and then across and
back<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:48.060> because<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.079> has<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.290> metallic

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
back in because it has that metallic

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.389 
back in because it has that metallic
sheen<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.939> looks<00:01:51.210> quite<00:01:51.630> glossy<00:01:52.280> but<00:01:53.280> it

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
sheen to it it looks quite glossy but it

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.380 
sheen to it it looks quite glossy but it
means<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.790> don't<00:01:53.909> have<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.180> actually

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
means that you don't have to actually

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.600 
means that you don't have to actually
put<00:01:54.869> gloss<00:01:55.290> on<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.649> lids<00:01:55.860> which<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.250> think

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
put gloss on the lids which I think

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.039 
put gloss on the lids which I think
Rihanna<00:01:57.210> had<00:01:57.659> but<00:01:58.469> glosses<00:01:59.210> no<00:02:00.210> not<00:02:00.840> for

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
Rihanna had but glosses no not for

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.399
