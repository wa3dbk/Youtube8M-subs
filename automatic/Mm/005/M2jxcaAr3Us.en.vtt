well<00:01:19.020> in<00:01:19.200> my<00:01:19.229> opinion<00:01:19.439> because<00:01:19.770> it's<00:01:19.920> kind<00:01:20.100> of

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
well in my opinion because it's kind of

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.090

pointless um but the really important

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.300 
pointless um but the really important

be<00:04:05.689> another<00:04:05.750> one<00:04:06.110> the<00:04:06.739> fuck<00:04:06.950> why<00:04:07.519> can<00:04:07.700> I<00:04:07.730> see<00:04:07.790> it

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
be another one the fuck why can I see it

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.839 
be another one the fuck why can I see it
there<00:04:09.319> we<00:04:09.379> go<00:04:09.530> another<00:04:09.799> one<00:04:10.040> microphone<00:04:10.489> knobs

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
there we go another one microphone knobs

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.850 
there we go another one microphone knobs
and<00:04:11.390> it's<00:04:11.629> pretty<00:04:11.840> much<00:04:11.959> like<00:04:12.079> a<00:04:12.319> way<00:04:12.530> you<00:04:12.590> can

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
and it's pretty much like a way you can

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.130 
and it's pretty much like a way you can
sort<00:04:13.189> out<00:04:13.340> you<00:04:13.579> can<00:04:13.760> go<00:04:13.879> on<00:04:14.030> anyone<00:04:14.659> staying

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
sort out you can go on anyone staying

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.810 
sort out you can go on anyone staying
and<00:04:15.470> you<00:04:15.530> could<00:04:15.709> pretty<00:04:15.890> much<00:04:15.980> just<00:04:16.310> sort<00:04:16.639> out

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
and you could pretty much just sort out

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.849 
and you could pretty much just sort out
anything<00:04:17.810> and<00:04:17.959> see<00:04:18.109> what<00:04:18.229> everyone<00:04:18.680> is<00:04:18.829> doing

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
anything and see what everyone is doing

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.420 
anything and see what everyone is doing
so<00:04:19.630> it's<00:04:20.630> a<00:04:20.780> lot<00:04:21.019> better<00:04:21.199> in<00:04:21.739> that<00:04:21.949> respect

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
so it's a lot better in that respect

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.270 
so it's a lot better in that respect
it's<00:04:23.090> way<00:04:23.539> more<00:04:23.570> organized<00:04:24.380> it's<00:04:24.740> just<00:04:24.949> a<00:04:25.070> lot

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
it's way more organized it's just a lot

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.980 
it's way more organized it's just a lot
of<00:04:25.370> people<00:04:25.639> haven't<00:04:25.970> figured<00:04:26.210> out<00:04:26.300> how<00:04:26.930> to

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
of people haven't figured out how to

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.320 
of people haven't figured out how to
maintain<00:04:27.860> that<00:04:28.280> yet<00:04:28.490> and<00:04:28.520> how<00:04:28.759> to<00:04:28.820> sort<00:04:29.120> it<00:04:29.210> out

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
maintain that yet and how to sort it out

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.050 
maintain that yet and how to sort it out
so<00:04:29.870> what<00:04:30.620> you<00:04:30.740> want<00:04:30.919> to<00:04:30.979> make<00:04:31.130> sure<00:04:31.160> is<00:04:31.669> you<00:04:31.699> can
