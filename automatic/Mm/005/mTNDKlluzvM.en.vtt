and<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.850> can<00:01:39.000> learn<00:01:39.150> from<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.630> all<00:01:39.720> that

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
and I can learn from it and all that

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.260 
and I can learn from it and all that
stuff<00:01:40.049> she<00:01:40.619> points<00:01:40.979> out<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.400> almost

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
stuff she points out it almost

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.780 
stuff she points out it almost
invariably<00:01:42.810> evokes<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.590> inner<00:01:43.740> child<00:01:44.130> you

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
invariably evokes the inner child you

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.639 
invariably evokes the inner child you
know<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.390> feelings<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.200> we<00:01:46.439> had

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
know the the the feelings that we had

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:47.870 
know the the the feelings that we had
when<00:01:46.799> we<00:01:46.829> were<00:01:46.920> criticized<00:01:47.369> as<00:01:47.549> children

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
when we were criticized as children

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.090 
when we were criticized as children
sometimes<00:01:48.060> unfairly<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.960> all<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.920> stuff

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
sometimes unfairly and all that stuff

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.859 
sometimes unfairly and all that stuff
comes<00:01:50.280> back<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.030> makes<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.299> difficult<00:01:51.329> to

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
comes back and it makes it difficult to

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.929 
comes back and it makes it difficult to
deal<00:01:52.020> with<00:01:52.200> criticism<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:53.460> she<00:01:53.520> talks<00:01:53.850> about

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
deal with criticism so she talks about

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.899 
deal with criticism so she talks about
how<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.270> do<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.780> how<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.790> balance<00:01:56.790> the

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
how to do that how to balance the

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.359 
how to do that how to balance the
criticism<00:01:57.540> with<00:01:57.840> some<00:01:58.170> positive<00:01:59.040> comments

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
criticism with some positive comments

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.740 
criticism with some positive comments
that<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.790> may<00:01:59.880> have<00:02:00.000> about<00:02:00.210> your<00:02:00.270> work<00:02:00.540> in<00:02:00.689> the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
that you may have about your work in the

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.469 
that you may have about your work in the
past<00:02:01.159> to<00:02:02.159> write<00:02:02.340> down<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.790> comments<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.390> you

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
past to write down the comments that you

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.600 
past to write down the comments that you
hear<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.049> then<00:02:04.200> give<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.740> some<00:02:04.979> time<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.250> some

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
hear and then give it some time and some

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.609 
hear and then give it some time and some
distance<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.270> then<00:02:06.840> just<00:02:07.049> later<00:02:07.350> come<00:02:07.590> back

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
distance and then just later come back

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.620 
distance and then just later come back
to<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.039> when<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.250> feel<00:02:08.429> more<00:02:08.789> objective<00:02:09.270> about

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
to it when you feel more objective about

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.450 
to it when you feel more objective about
analyzing<00:02:10.470> what's<00:02:10.650> useful<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.160> what<00:02:11.310> isn't

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460
