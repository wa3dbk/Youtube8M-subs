00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.439 

I<00:00:00.179> think<00:00:00.900> this<00:00:01.079> has<00:00:01.770> got<00:00:01.979> a<00:00:02.179> rank<00:00:03.179> right<00:00:03.389> up

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
I think this has got a rank right up

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:04.519 
I think this has got a rank right up
there<00:00:03.570> with<00:00:03.780> some<00:00:03.929> of<00:00:04.020> the<00:00:04.080> craziest<00:00:04.410> things

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
i did a race against a cheetah that you

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.730 
i did a race against a cheetah that you
know<00:00:08.880> became<00:00:09.120> pretty<00:00:09.389> public<00:00:09.599> and<00:00:09.870> I'm

because<00:00:18.510> i<00:00:18.750> wanted<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.350> bus<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.650> on<00:00:19.710> full

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
because i wanted a bus is on full

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.740 
because i wanted a bus is on full
throttle<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.430> I'm<00:00:20.880> gonna<00:00:21.060> have<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.300> be<00:00:21.390> moving

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
throttle and I'm gonna have to be moving

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.840 
throttle and I'm gonna have to be moving
pretty<00:00:21.869> quickly<00:00:22.340> we've<00:00:23.340> got<00:00:23.519> four

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
pretty quickly we've got four

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.390 
pretty quickly we've got four
rolls-royce<00:00:24.480> trent<00:00:24.990> 900<00:00:25.170> engines<00:00:25.830> each<00:00:26.010> one

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
rolls-royce trent 900 engines each one

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.120 
rolls-royce trent 900 engines each one
produces<00:00:26.990> 70,000<00:00:27.990> pounds<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.410> thrust<00:00:28.500> so

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
produces 70,000 pounds of thrust so

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.560 
produces 70,000 pounds of thrust so
we're<00:00:29.279> going<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.460> accelerate<00:00:29.760> very<00:00:30.330> very

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
we're going to accelerate very very

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.389 
we're going to accelerate very very
quickly<00:00:30.810> indeed<00:00:31.050> we'll<00:00:31.769> get<00:00:31.859> airborne<00:00:32.009> about

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
quickly indeed we'll get airborne about

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.030 
quickly indeed we'll get airborne about
140<00:00:33.180> miles<00:00:33.329> an<00:00:33.480> hour<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.870> we<00:00:34.500> can<00:00:34.649> fly<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:34.920> up

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
140 miles an hour and we can fly it up

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.740 
140 miles an hour and we can fly it up
to<00:00:35.160> 600<00:00:35.670> miles<00:00:35.820> an<00:00:35.969> hour<00:00:36.059> one<00:00:36.270> more<00:00:36.390> airborne

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
to 600 miles an hour one more airborne

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.930 
to 600 miles an hour one more airborne
so<00:00:37.050> I'll<00:00:37.620> give<00:00:37.860> them<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.010> wave<00:00:38.190> as<00:00:38.370> we<00:00:38.460> go<00:00:38.579> party

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
so I'll give them a wave as we go party

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.560 
so I'll give them a wave as we go party
yeah<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:39.989> got<00:00:40.110> no<00:00:40.230> choice<00:00:41.390> I've<00:00:42.390> been

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
yeah it's got no choice I've been

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.000 
yeah it's got no choice I've been
playing<00:00:42.780> with<00:00:42.930> Brian<00:00:43.200> for<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.410> long<00:00:43.590> time<00:00:43.829> when

playing with Brian for a long time when
is<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.340> know<00:00:44.430> Brian's<00:00:44.760> very<00:00:44.910> quick<00:00:45.149> but<00:00:45.660> you

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
is you know Brian's very quick but you

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.420 
is you know Brian's very quick but you
know<00:00:46.140> it's<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.320> big<00:00:46.500> piece<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.800> machinery<00:00:47.100> that

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
know it's a big piece of machinery that

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.970 
know it's a big piece of machinery that
and<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.210> plays<00:00:48.420> very<00:00:48.600> far<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.110> yeah<00:00:49.649> good

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
and that plays very far so yeah good

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.279 
and that plays very far so yeah good
luck<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.309> Brian<00:00:50.550> but<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.420> think<00:00:51.750> it's<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.170> no

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
luck to Brian but I think it's a no

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.229 
luck to Brian but I think it's a no
contest<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.890> be<00:00:53.039> honest<00:00:53.309> when<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.850> guys<00:00:54.030> was

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
contest to be honest when the guys was

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.760 
contest to be honest when the guys was
informing<00:00:54.719> me<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.110> takes<00:00:55.260> about<00:00:55.440> three

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
informing me that it takes about three

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.170 
informing me that it takes about three
kilometers<00:00:56.190> or<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.430> for<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.670> plane<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.969> get<00:00:57.059> in

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
kilometers or so for the plane to get in

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.729 
kilometers or so for the plane to get in
the<00:00:57.239> air<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:58.020> I'm<00:00:58.109> thinking<00:00:58.140> full<00:00:58.559> from

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
the air so I'm thinking full from

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.049 
the air so I'm thinking full from
stationary<00:00:59.160> over<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.430> first<00:00:59.579> hundred<00:00:59.820> I

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
stationary over the first hundred I

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.209 
stationary over the first hundred I
think<00:01:00.270> he's<00:01:00.359> got<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.570> I'd<00:01:01.410> really<00:01:01.770> like<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.949> bet

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
think he's got it I'd really like to bet

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.070 
think he's got it I'd really like to bet
my<00:01:02.370> chances<00:01:02.820> but<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.239> think<00:01:03.660> it's<00:01:03.780> going<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.930> be

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
my chances but I think it's going to be

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.770 
my chances but I think it's going to be
a<00:01:04.229> real<00:01:04.559> real<00:01:04.799> close<00:01:04.949> finish<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.780> definitely

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
a real real close finish I definitely

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.570 
a real real close finish I definitely
say<00:01:07.080> I'm<00:01:07.200> up<00:01:07.320> for<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.530> challenge<00:01:07.580> hopefully

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
say I'm up for the challenge hopefully

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:36.010 
say I'm up for the challenge hopefully
and<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:09.240> can<00:01:09.390> makes<00:01:09.540> electrical<00:01:09.960> proud
