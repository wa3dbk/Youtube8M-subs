and got my trusty camera right here back
from<00:00:41.640> my<00:00:41.879> friend<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.300> basically<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.260> would

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
from my friend and basically you would

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.840 
from my friend and basically you would
just<00:00:43.410> screw<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.860> on<00:00:43.980> just<00:00:44.190> like<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.399> would<00:00:44.610> any

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
just screw it on just like you would any

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.250 
just screw it on just like you would any
other<00:00:46.129> tripod<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.600> if<00:00:48.600> you're<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:48.840> using<00:00:49.110> it

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
other tripod and if you're just using it

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.660 
other tripod and if you're just using it
like<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.440> normal<00:00:49.710> tripod<00:00:49.920> that's<00:00:50.190> fine<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.550> can

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
like a normal tripod that's fine you can

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.979 
like a normal tripod that's fine you can
just<00:00:50.700> position<00:00:50.910> however<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.690> want

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
just position however you want

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.720 
just position however you want
however<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.739> cool<00:00:52.980> thing<00:00:53.160> about<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.520> is

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
however the cool thing about this is

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.700 
however the cool thing about this is
it's<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.210> you're<00:00:54.629> shooting<00:00:55.050> on<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.170> hill<00:00:55.379> so

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
it's a you're shooting on a hill so

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.279 
it's a you're shooting on a hill so
pretend<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> slant<00:00:56.760> going<00:00:57.149> down<00:00:58.050> this

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
pretend this is a slant going down this

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.650 
pretend this is a slant going down this
way<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:59.219> could<00:00:59.340> actually<00:00:59.489> position<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.390> to

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
way you could actually position this to

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.100 
way you could actually position this to
compensate<00:01:01.789> for<00:01:02.789> different<00:01:03.149> heights<00:01:03.359> that's

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
compensate for different heights that's

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.469 
compensate for different heights that's
great<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.830> addition<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.150> that's<00:01:06.360> not

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
great in addition to that and that's not

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.820 
great in addition to that and that's not
the<00:01:06.630> most<00:01:06.780> impressive<00:01:06.990> thing<00:01:07.350> because<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.650> bet

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
the most impressive thing because I bet

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.230 
the most impressive thing because I bet
you<00:01:07.920> can<00:01:08.070> finagle<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.549> with<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:08.970> normal

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
you can finagle that with a normal

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.380 
you can finagle that with a normal
tripod<00:01:09.630> though<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.220> you<00:01:11.220> could<00:01:11.430> wrap<00:01:11.700> these

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
tripod though is you could wrap these

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.330 
tripod though is you could wrap these
legs<00:01:12.900> around<00:01:13.380> different<00:01:13.560> items<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.010> for

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
legs around different items so for

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.429 
legs around different items so for
example<00:01:14.729> say<00:01:14.909> my<00:01:15.090> arm<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.780> tree<00:01:16.259> branch

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
example say my arm is a tree branch

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.870 
example say my arm is a tree branch
that's<00:01:16.830> gonna<00:01:16.979> be<00:01:17.130> kind<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.310> hard<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:17.729> you'll

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
that's gonna be kind of hard so you'll

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.219 
that's gonna be kind of hard so you'll
forgive<00:01:18.060> me<00:01:18.360> if<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:18.450> takes<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.840> lot<00:01:18.960> it's<00:01:19.170> a

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
forgive me if this takes a lot it's a

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.560 
forgive me if this takes a lot it's a
little<00:01:19.409> bit<00:01:19.500> awkward<00:01:19.680> say<00:01:20.640> my<00:01:20.820> arm<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> tree

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
little bit awkward say my arm is a tree

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.260 
little bit awkward say my arm is a tree
branch<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:22.280> don't<00:01:23.280> have<00:01:23.430> time<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.790> really<00:01:23.939> wrap

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
branch I don't have time to really wrap

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.370 
branch I don't have time to really wrap
this<00:01:24.479> sucker<00:01:24.750> around<00:01:25.200> really<00:01:26.070> well<00:01:27.350> you<00:01:28.350> can

positioning flat surface so say you were
in<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.240> forest<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.720> only<00:01:36.930> had<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.140> tree<00:01:37.320> branch

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
in a forest you only had a tree branch

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.749 
in a forest you only had a tree branch
to<00:01:37.650> use<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.860> could<00:01:37.950> wrap<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.250> around<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.610> tree

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
to use you could wrap this around a tree

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.399 
to use you could wrap this around a tree
branch<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.600> fact<00:01:39.810> let<00:01:39.990> me<00:01:40.020> just<00:01:40.229> pull<00:01:40.380> up

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
branch and in fact let me just pull up

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.670 
branch and in fact let me just pull up
my<00:01:40.680> netbook<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.400> show<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.630> main<00:01:42.810> page<00:01:43.079> it

my netbook and show you the main page it

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.990 
my netbook and show you the main page it
has<00:01:43.860> pretty<00:01:44.100> good<00:01:44.220> pictures<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.759> give<00:01:44.880> you

has pretty good pictures that give you
an<00:01:45.090> idea<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.420> how<00:01:45.659> many<00:01:46.079> different<00:01:46.290> ways<00:01:46.560> you

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
an idea of how many different ways you

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.710 
an idea of how many different ways you
can<00:01:46.770> use<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.790> got<00:01:48.060> some<00:01:48.210> guys<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.360> put

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
can use this so you got some guys I put

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.420 
can use this so you got some guys I put
on<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.930> stairs<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.799> really<00:01:50.040> cool<00:01:50.220> shot

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
on the stairs this is a really cool shot

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.620 
on the stairs this is a really cool shot
you<00:01:50.610> could<00:01:50.700> just<00:01:50.850> put<00:01:50.970> on<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.090> railing<00:01:51.390> on<00:01:51.570> a

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
you could just put on a railing on a

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.359 
you could just put on a railing on a
bridge<00:01:52.909> tree<00:01:53.909> branch<00:01:54.149> like<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.479> said<00:01:54.659> before

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
bridge tree branch like I said before

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.039 
bridge tree branch like I said before
angled<00:01:56.369> at<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.520> different<00:01:56.909> level<00:01:57.049> different

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
angled at a different level different

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.359 
angled at a different level different
ways<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.409> this<00:01:58.619> one's<00:01:58.799> actually<00:01:59.100> pretty<00:01:59.130> cool

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
ways and this one's actually pretty cool

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.740 
ways and this one's actually pretty cool
and<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.579> actually<00:01:59.670> want<00:01:59.909> to<00:01:59.939> try<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.420> to

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
and I actually want to try this is to

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.450 
and I actually want to try this is to
put<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.049> on<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.200> handlebars<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.829> bike<00:02:02.009> which

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
put it on the handlebars of a bike which

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.100 
put it on the handlebars of a bike which
would<00:02:02.610> be<00:02:02.700> neat<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:03.000> could<00:02:03.299> actually<00:02:03.450> use<00:02:03.659> this

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
would be neat I could actually use this

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.380 
would be neat I could actually use this
turn<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:05.009> camera<00:02:05.399> function<00:02:05.729> on<00:02:05.850> my<00:02:05.880> camera

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
turn on the camera function on my camera

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.630 
turn on the camera function on my camera
and<00:02:06.509> then<00:02:07.110> just<00:02:07.439> give<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.039> guys<00:02:08.160> like<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.369> view

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
and then just give you guys like a view

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.460 
and then just give you guys like a view
as<00:02:08.819> I'm<00:02:08.970> riding<00:02:09.179> through<00:02:09.599> different

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
as I'm riding through different

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.960 
as I'm riding through different
neighborhoods<00:02:10.860> when<00:02:11.069> I'm<00:02:11.160> traveling<00:02:11.550> so<00:02:11.879> yeah

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
neighborhoods when I'm traveling so yeah

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.820 
neighborhoods when I'm traveling so yeah
nothing<00:02:13.690> super<00:02:13.840> complicated<00:02:14.560> about<00:02:14.680> this

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
nothing super complicated about this

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.920 
nothing super complicated about this
it's<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:15.460> pretty<00:02:15.580> simple<00:02:15.970> basically<00:02:16.600> it<00:02:16.780> works

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
it's a pretty simple basically it works

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.220 
it's a pretty simple basically it works
off<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:17.320> ball-and-socket<00:02:17.650> design<00:02:18.520> you<00:02:19.090> have

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
off a ball-and-socket design you have

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.020 
off a ball-and-socket design you have
the<00:02:20.230> ball<00:02:20.770> and<00:02:21.070> then<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.490> bottom<00:02:21.730> part<00:02:21.910> is<00:02:21.970> a

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
the ball and then the bottom part is a

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.580 
the ball and then the bottom part is a
socket<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:22.450> then<00:02:22.570> you<00:02:22.630> just<00:02:22.810> add<00:02:22.870> pieces

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
socket and then you just add pieces

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.140 
socket and then you just add pieces
pieces<00:02:23.770> pieces<00:02:23.950> and<00:02:24.400> then<00:02:24.490> it<00:02:24.580> comes<00:02:24.760> on<00:02:24.880> to

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
pieces pieces and then it comes on to

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.610 
pieces pieces and then it comes on to
these<00:02:25.300> rubber<00:02:25.570> tips<00:02:25.870> at<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.020> end<00:02:26.110> right<00:02:26.440> here

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
these rubber tips at the end right here

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.500 
these rubber tips at the end right here
to<00:02:26.800> give<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.100> little<00:02:27.220> bit<00:02:27.400> of<00:02:27.490> traction<00:02:27.670> the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
to give it a little bit of traction the

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.020 
to give it a little bit of traction the
top<00:02:28.930> section<00:02:29.380> right<00:02:29.650> here<00:02:29.920> can<00:02:30.430> also<00:02:30.520> swivel

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
top section right here can also swivel

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.700 
top section right here can also swivel
on<00:02:31.150> top<00:02:31.300> of<00:02:31.420> itself<00:02:31.720> so<00:02:31.990> you're<00:02:32.200> able<00:02:32.530> to

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
on top of itself so you're able to

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.160 
on top of itself so you're able to
rotate<00:02:33.190> and<00:02:33.700> move<00:02:34.240> the<00:02:34.420> camera<00:02:34.750> about<00:02:34.990> in

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
rotate and move the camera about in

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.130 
rotate and move the camera about in
various<00:02:36.160> positions<00:02:36.430> so<00:02:37.030> between<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.870> legs

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
various positions so between the legs

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.260 
various positions so between the legs
and<00:02:38.410> this<00:02:38.740> flexible<00:02:39.370> top<00:02:39.610> you<00:02:40.000> can<00:02:40.150> pretty

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
and this flexible top you can pretty

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.880 
and this flexible top you can pretty
much<00:02:40.360> position<00:02:40.900> your<00:02:41.020> camera<00:02:41.140> facing<00:02:41.500> any<00:02:41.710> way

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
much position your camera facing any way

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.730 
much position your camera facing any way
however<00:02:42.900> just<00:02:43.900> like<00:02:44.020> a<00:02:44.050> tripod<00:02:44.350> you're<00:02:44.620> gonna

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
however just like a tripod you're gonna

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.020 
however just like a tripod you're gonna
have<00:02:44.890> to<00:02:44.950> worry<00:02:45.100> about<00:02:45.220> balance<00:02:45.700> so<00:02:45.850> if<00:02:45.940> you

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
have to worry about balance so if you

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.340 
have to worry about balance so if you
have<00:02:46.180> it<00:02:46.300> leaning<00:02:46.570> too<00:02:46.690> much<00:02:46.810> one<00:02:46.990> way<00:02:47.140> it's

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
have it leaning too much one way it's

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.800 
have it leaning too much one way it's
gonna<00:02:47.470> fall<00:02:47.770> over<00:02:47.800> so<00:02:48.580> you're<00:02:49.390> gonna<00:02:49.480> have<00:02:49.690> to

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
gonna fall over so you're gonna have to

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.770 
gonna fall over so you're gonna have to
make<00:02:49.959> sure<00:02:49.990> that<00:02:51.120> everything<00:02:52.120> is<00:02:52.240> absolutely

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
make sure that everything is absolutely

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.660 
make sure that everything is absolutely
positioned<00:02:53.020> correctly<00:02:53.380> before<00:02:53.770> you<00:02:53.950> let<00:02:54.550> go

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
positioned correctly before you let go

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.580 
positioned correctly before you let go
of<00:02:54.790> this<00:02:54.880> thing<00:02:55.090> but<00:02:55.480> that's<00:02:56.140> pretty<00:02:56.380> obvious

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
of this thing but that's pretty obvious

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.500 
of this thing but that's pretty obvious
one<00:02:57.520> thing<00:02:57.760> you're<00:02:57.910> gonna<00:02:58.000> have<00:02:58.270> to<00:02:58.360> worry

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
one thing you're gonna have to worry

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.930 
one thing you're gonna have to worry
about<00:02:58.570> though<00:02:58.900> is<00:02:59.110> it<00:02:59.590> does<00:02:59.860> use<00:03:00.100> a<00:03:00.340> plastic

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
about though is it does use a plastic

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.330 
about though is it does use a plastic
design<00:03:01.090> so<00:03:02.020> you're<00:03:02.530> gonna<00:03:02.650> have<00:03:02.890> to<00:03:03.160> be<00:03:03.310> a

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
design so you're gonna have to be a

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.980 
design so you're gonna have to be a
little<00:03:03.670> bit<00:03:03.880> more<00:03:04.030> careful<00:03:04.450> with<00:03:04.570> this<00:03:04.720> thing

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
little bit more careful with this thing

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.330 
little bit more careful with this thing
than<00:03:05.290> you<00:03:05.320> would<00:03:05.650> with<00:03:05.800> a<00:03:05.860> standard<00:03:06.220> tripod

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
than you would with a standard tripod

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.870 
than you would with a standard tripod
that's<00:03:06.700> made<00:03:06.940> out<00:03:07.090> of<00:03:07.209> aluminum<00:03:07.690> or<00:03:07.810> metal

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
that's made out of aluminum or metal

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.300 
that's made out of aluminum or metal
holding<00:03:09.880> these<00:03:09.970> pieces<00:03:10.270> it<00:03:10.660> feels<00:03:11.170> okay<00:03:11.920> like

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
holding these pieces it feels okay like

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.280 
holding these pieces it feels okay like
I<00:03:12.490> feel<00:03:13.209> like<00:03:13.300> I<00:03:13.600> can<00:03:13.780> actually<00:03:14.050> put<00:03:14.170> this

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
I feel like I can actually put this

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.199 
I feel like I can actually put this
through<00:03:14.500> some<00:03:14.740> fair<00:03:15.070> amount<00:03:15.310> of<00:03:15.340> usage<00:03:15.670> but

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
through some fair amount of usage but

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.360 
through some fair amount of usage but
because<00:03:16.810> it<00:03:16.959> is<00:03:17.200> made<00:03:17.560> out<00:03:17.680> of<00:03:17.830> plastic<00:03:18.340> I

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
because it is made out of plastic I

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.220 
because it is made out of plastic I
wouldn't<00:03:18.880> put<00:03:19.030> this<00:03:19.120> at<00:03:19.300> the<00:03:19.330> bottom<00:03:19.420> of<00:03:20.200> my

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
wouldn't put this at the bottom of my

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.050 
wouldn't put this at the bottom of my
pack<00:03:20.650> and<00:03:20.950> I<00:03:21.160> wouldn't<00:03:21.400> put<00:03:21.459> anything<00:03:21.760> heavy

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
pack and I wouldn't put anything heavy

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.300 
pack and I wouldn't put anything heavy
on<00:03:22.150> top<00:03:22.420> of<00:03:22.570> it<00:03:22.690> also<00:03:23.080> I'd<00:03:23.620> be<00:03:23.800> very<00:03:24.040> careful

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
on top of it also I'd be very careful

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.310 
on top of it also I'd be very careful
about<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:25.090> ball<00:03:25.390> and<00:03:25.570> socket<00:03:25.900> joints<00:03:26.200> I

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
about the ball and socket joints I

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.960 
about the ball and socket joints I
forget<00:03:26.800> which<00:03:26.980> leg<00:03:27.220> it<00:03:27.370> is<00:03:27.459> but<00:03:27.670> I've<00:03:27.820> actually

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
forget which leg it is but I've actually

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.910 
forget which leg it is but I've actually
pulled<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:28.690> ball<00:03:28.930> out<00:03:29.170> of<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.380> socket<00:03:29.800> and

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
pulled the ball out of the socket and

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.590 
pulled the ball out of the socket and
there's<00:03:30.070> a<00:03:30.130> little<00:03:30.370> crack<00:03:30.519> not<00:03:31.120> a<00:03:31.180> big<00:03:31.390> deal

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
there's a little crack not a big deal

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.199 
there's a little crack not a big deal
you<00:03:31.750> just<00:03:31.870> put<00:03:32.110> a<00:03:32.140> little<00:03:32.380> bit<00:03:32.500> of<00:03:32.590> superglue

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
pop the ball back in the joint and it'll

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.860 
pop the ball back in the joint and it'll
be<00:03:35.980> good<00:03:36.130> as<00:03:36.220> new<00:03:36.250> however<00:03:36.850> it's<00:03:37.540> something<00:03:37.660> to

be good as new however it's something to

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.509 
be good as new however it's something to
pay<00:03:37.900> attention<00:03:38.200> to<00:03:38.560> so<00:03:38.769> don't<00:03:38.950> treat<00:03:39.160> this<00:03:39.340> too

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519
