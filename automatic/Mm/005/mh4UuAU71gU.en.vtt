00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.430
 and the very good ones to all kids that 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:14.430
 the master 1 commenting on this video 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.439
 informative of the new dlc of black ops 2 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.680
 and as you are seeing here some images 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:22.830
 of the map and it's going to be called vengance the 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.830
 dlc and we have a kobe author map 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:30.670
 rus and a clinic 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:33.670
 and well here the zombies during I do not know 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.830
 what's still called and this new weapon 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.160
 which is like the ray weapon and good the 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:42.910
 kobe ​​map the question is that it is a 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.460
 island is an island that is very well made 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:50.559
 has everything an island would have 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:53.050
 stones their their palmeritas 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.760
 that does not usually have one there is an island they are 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.010
 what are you going to see now some boxes there 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.750
 a medium that the island does not usually have 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:04.150
 but good thing is that I think so 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.930
 I think it's that an airplane crashed or 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:12.010
 something like that then there are those remnants of 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:14.409
 two doctor doctor then this is what 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.840
 basically what you are seeing is a 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.350
 bridge in which you can go up and 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.659
 down below 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.540
 but below there are fewer roads 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.299
 it's not all east but you do not see here 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.159
 is a path that you climb on the one hand and 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.409
 the other one on the other side but that 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.450
 it is quite good for you if you are 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.080
 rusair if you are one of those who will surround 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.810
 Well, this piece comes right for you 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.220
 it comes pretty good and see in my 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.420
 opinion for what is coming this 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.600
 map is for this for what I am 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.610
 seeing for this streak bad streak of the 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.880
 ico of the plane that comes great because it goes 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.369
 to kill a lot and here you see the rus 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.970
 that this name comes from the modern 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:02:01.700
 warfare2 but it's not the same is the other was 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:04.470
 rust this rush with h I think and it's a one 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.510
 there is a pinball park 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.280
 as you are seeing and this map does not 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.130
 I like it a lot so you can roam 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.080
 behind the boxes are these 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.730
 pinball of pinball mats or 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.380
 whatever you want to call it can be changed 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.550
 behind that and then I'm not cool 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:23.430
 much a click that is one as a base 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.050
 secret on the top of a mountain and 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:30.830
 Typical typical of a movie 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:34.020
 espionage or something like that that's always 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:37.350
 the secret base on top of the mountain or 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.050
 be the most typical people decide 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.700
 do and the map is pretty good to me 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.610
 I like I quite like what 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.310
 appeared here in the trailers or in 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.010
 the trailer of the dlc and here the one of zombies 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.760
 that as I'm seeing is in a mine and 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.280
 is they are zombies kind of like a map 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.580
 in the previous dlc in the prison 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.140
 that went as the watchers are those of 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.990
 the prison that go with thorns as is 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.060
 these go with cowboy hats and the 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.950
 handkerchief in the in the cowboy collar 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.959
 everything that is pretty handsome 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.200
 this is a zombie must be a zombie aito 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.420
 crabs of the species 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.019
 since the weapon that is like the weapon of 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.400
 rays but more cucumber you do not see here is 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.390
 as a ray weapon but someone plan 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:25.780
 cucumber billet there to power butt and here 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:29.680
 some images and good comes out on 7 of 2 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.510
 not the 2 17 or next month it comes out 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.269
 the 2 for xbox 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.040
 that's figure that's the way out for the 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.680
 xbox as always that comes out a month before 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:43.690
 that is for computer and for play 3 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.450
 will be on 2 of 8 and this dlc is very 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.750
 well because it comes in four little things 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:52.060
 very 4 you come 6 little things the maps the 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.760
 weapon and the zombies and I 'm good 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.040
 without a trailer I ran out of time 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.110
 of trailer but good to put here how 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.870
 is living an image of the weapon that I 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.489
 I like it a lot and I think that 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.769
 my part and nothing more to say I hope 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.049
 that you liked the trailer 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.540

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.829
