capsules<00:00:53.390> so<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.420> just<00:00:54.690> break<00:00:54.930> one<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.170> those

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
capsules so I just break one of those

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.160 
capsules so I just break one of those
open<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.890> I'll<00:00:56.190> show<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.579> that's<00:00:57.170> yep

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.790 
open and I'll show you that that's yep
there<00:00:58.500> they<00:00:58.530> are<00:00:58.680> those<00:00:59.100> are<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.430> ingredients

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
there they are those are the ingredients

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.979 
there they are those are the ingredients
okay<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:01.980> cut<00:01:02.250> up<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.520> beeswax<00:01:03.090> here<00:01:03.539> this

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
okay so I cut up this beeswax here this

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.649 
okay so I cut up this beeswax here this
was<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.739> half<00:01:05.070> pound<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.700> begin<00:01:05.970> with<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.510> that's

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
was a half pound to begin with so that's

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.289 
was a half pound to begin with so that's
eight<00:01:07.049> ounces<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.490> needed<00:01:08.820> two<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> half

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
eight ounces and I needed two and a half

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.899 
eight ounces and I needed two and a half
so<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.020> just<00:01:10.350> kind<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.740> guessed<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.430> broke<00:01:11.729> off

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
so I just kind of guessed and broke off

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.820 
so I just kind of guessed and broke off
a<00:01:11.939> chunk<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.570> then<00:01:12.840> since<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.380> don't<00:01:13.439> have<00:01:13.799> a

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
a chunk and then since I don't have a

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.450 
a chunk and then since I don't have a
scale<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.549> had<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.939> guess<00:01:15.330> with<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:16.460> coconut

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
scale I had to guess with the coconut

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.840 
scale I had to guess with the coconut
oil<00:01:17.640> as<00:01:17.880> well<00:01:18.259> but<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.290> was<00:01:20.250> supposed<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.700> have

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
oil as well but I was supposed to have

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.260 
oil as well but I was supposed to have
five<00:01:21.060> ounces<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.689> there<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:26.700> beeswax

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
five ounces in there so the the beeswax

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.679 
five ounces in there so the the beeswax
when<00:01:27.630> it's<00:01:27.810> cool<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.439> hardened<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.490> if<00:01:29.820> we<00:01:30.509> have

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
when it's cool is hardened so if we have

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.039 
when it's cool is hardened so if we have
too<00:01:30.900> much<00:01:31.049> beeswax<00:01:32.270> compared<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.360> coconut<00:01:33.780> oil

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
too much beeswax compared to coconut oil

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.200 
too much beeswax compared to coconut oil
it<00:01:34.619> won't<00:01:34.829> be<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.790> very<00:01:36.360> malleable<00:01:37.070> um<00:01:38.070> lip<00:01:39.000> balm

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
it won't be a very malleable um lip balm

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.450 
it won't be a very malleable um lip balm
but<00:01:39.869> here<00:01:40.409> we<00:01:40.500> go<00:01:40.530> I'm<00:01:40.829> just<00:01:40.890> going<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.280> put

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
but here we go I'm just going to put

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.840 
but here we go I'm just going to put
this<00:01:41.579> in<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.820> microwave<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:43.369> microwave<00:01:44.369> it

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
this in a microwave and microwave it

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.260 
this in a microwave and microwave it
just<00:01:45.060> for<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.240> little<00:01:45.450> bit<00:01:45.540> at<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:46.020> time<00:01:46.110> until<00:01:47.270> it

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
just for a little bit at a time until it

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:56.060 
just for a little bit at a time until it
gets<00:01:48.659> some<00:01:49.460> soft<00:01:50.600> there<00:01:51.600> we<00:01:51.689> go<00:01:54.439> so<00:01:55.439> here<00:01:55.470> that

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
gets some soft there we go so here that

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.249 
gets some soft there we go so here that
beeswax<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:58.219> coconut<00:01:59.219> oil<00:01:59.250> has<00:01:59.670> melted<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.509> I

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
beeswax and coconut oil has melted and I

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.350 
beeswax and coconut oil has melted and I
learned<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.770> beeswax<00:02:02.250> melt<00:02:02.399> at<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.880> very<00:02:03.149> high

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
learned that beeswax melt at a very high

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.510 
learned that beeswax melt at a very high
temperature<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.049> had<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.500> microwave<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.070> for

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
temperature so I had to microwave it for

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.520 
temperature so I had to microwave it for
a<00:02:05.909> couple<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.329> minutes<00:02:06.630> there<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:06.930> then<00:02:07.350> the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
a couple of minutes there and then the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.940 
a couple of minutes there and then the
glass<00:02:08.000> Pyrex<00:02:09.000> cup<00:02:09.539> there<00:02:09.810> got<00:02:10.020> really<00:02:10.590> hot<00:02:10.770> so

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
glass Pyrex cup there got really hot so

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.990 
glass Pyrex cup there got really hot so
be<00:02:11.069> careful<00:02:11.430> when<00:02:11.550> taking

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
be careful when taking

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.090 
be careful when taking
the<00:02:12.300> microwave<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:12.990> it<00:02:13.410> might<00:02:13.620> actually<00:02:13.830> work

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
the microwave and it might actually work

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.000 
the microwave and it might actually work
faster<00:02:14.760> just<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.060> use<00:02:15.390> hot<00:02:16.170> on<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.470> stove<00:02:16.710> but

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
faster just to use hot on the stove but

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.620 
faster just to use hot on the stove but
here<00:02:17.940> goes

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
here goes

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.990 
here goes
so<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.470> next<00:02:19.680> thing<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:19.950> says<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.310> do<00:02:20.460> is<00:02:20.700> take

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
so the next thing it says to do is take

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.220 
so the next thing it says to do is take
a<00:02:21.030> vitamin<00:02:21.240> E<00:02:21.630> capsule<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.320> squirt<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:24.230> into

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
a vitamin E capsule and squirt that into

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.470 
a vitamin E capsule and squirt that into
there<00:02:26.600> so<00:02:28.370> that's<00:02:29.370> what<00:02:29.490> I'm<00:02:29.670> doing<00:02:30.000> here

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
there so that's what I'm doing here

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.400 
there so that's what I'm doing here
I<00:02:31.430> just<00:02:32.430> thought<00:02:32.700> took<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.150> knife<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.660> made<00:02:34.380> a

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
I just thought took a knife and made a

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.620 
I just thought took a knife and made a
little<00:02:34.680> cut<00:02:35.010> in<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.250> top<00:02:35.460> of<00:02:35.820> that<00:02:36.030> gel<00:02:36.360> cap

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
little cut in the top of that gel cap

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.930 
little cut in the top of that gel cap
and<00:02:37.050> squirts<00:02:37.830> out<00:02:37.980> liquid<00:02:38.370> right<00:02:38.550> in<00:02:38.730> there

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
and squirts out liquid right in there

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.460 
and squirts out liquid right in there
and<00:02:39.360> then<00:02:41.000> it<00:02:42.000> says<00:02:42.240> six<00:02:42.510> or<00:02:42.660> seven<00:02:43.020> chocolate

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
and then it says six or seven chocolate

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.080 
and then it says six or seven chocolate
chips<00:02:44.390> so<00:02:45.530> that's<00:02:46.530> what<00:02:46.709> makes<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:47.250> yummy<00:02:47.550> for

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.699 
chips so that's what makes it yummy for
kids<00:02:48.360> because<00:02:48.690> you<00:02:48.840> know<00:02:48.870> how<00:02:49.140> kids<00:02:49.410> like<00:02:49.590> to
