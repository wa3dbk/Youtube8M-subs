00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.130
 People here are the oil and today I came to 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.730
 You a video for those who are starting 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.189
 with windows 10 does not know much if 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.199
 find on windows to show how 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.109
 customize bad teaching leave it with 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.990
 your face with a different look and feel 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.349
 everything else then let's go the first 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.840
 step and more basic is you click with the 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.570
 right click on the desktop and life 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.680
 here in customize and here we have 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:45.420
 is the customization of windows 10 before 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:48.210
 on windows 7 or 8 point 18 at last had 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.370
 a much simpler system much more 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.440
 basic I did not have much choice for 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.120
 you customize now in windows 10 to 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.489
 totally different thing 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.989
 you can actually leave windows with 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.660
 your face 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.910
 here is the background screen that you 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.670
 choose clearly the background ' your 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.080
 computer has solid color image 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.369
 slide show 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.220
 so you can choose solid color 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.090
 for example choose a background that you 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.460
 want to 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.770
 the image can choose an image that already 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.810
 comes pre defined in the in ten plus you 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.369
 either you can click search and 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.820
 search for an image on your computer 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.880
 You can also do this here. You have to 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:34.500
 option to adjust the fill image 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:39.000
 get full screen has to adjust that gets is 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.799
 that with this time from above and below 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.799
 remembering that here in fill 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:47.880
 he picks up and chica image is in case here 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.640
 I'd adjust it's size is woman 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.100
 so image ideal or size is 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.860
 original screen that more they have 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.710
 zoom in 2011 image looks like 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.829
 fill the places side by side image 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.009
 logical side of the center ee 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.469
 extend the action various forms and the legal 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.810
 even use the part here 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:13.500
 that really is interesting to be cool 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.410
 What are the colors if you can 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.550
 to choose the color of your windows in here 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.290
 gray blue yellow orange and so on 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.030
 up has the option to choose 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.920
 something is automatically here 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.110
 my background screen then post here 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.690
 and it automatically chooses a color 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:35.540
 for me it's ok I do not want it that 's limiting 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:38.280
 I want a little something that bin jassim 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.980
 discreet and down here has show with 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.110
 is with the initial taskbar and the 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.300
 action center is disabled and 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.959
 activate the colors are also applied 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:53.940
 here in downtown tasks in central 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:56.310
 actions and also in the menu and start 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.770
 ball and also let the menu start the 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.940
 tasks and without transparent projections and 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.400
 that's cool 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.709
 silval does not stay transparent stays with 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.500
 a solid color and this is good for 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.940
 you save memory and processing 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.600
 of computers if you do not have a team 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.760
 very good 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.620
 I recommend that you disable this, but 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.200
 you have no problem, this can be 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.120
 activated a legal resource is beautiful to 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.750
 transparency is nice something that 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.430
 I thought it was going to roll this 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.180
 Transparency is cool if you could 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.380
 adjust the transparency of each thing 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.940
 here's windows 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.790
 something else I missed I think 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.709
 should have a transparency here 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.470
 nuno up here on the chicken of the isotope 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.540
 here I have to close and extend such 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.730
 It would be legal if you had transparency 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.220
 if you could enable or disable 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.180
 sure transparently would be something 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.940
 interesting 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.160
 has also here lock screen is not 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.850
 I have a secret, you choose the screen that 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.410
 Do you want to have here highlighted windows 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:04:00.440
 has an image exposed to the image that you 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:04.950
 You want me to like this with the image 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:07.140
 Bring rain It could be this way. 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.209
 in the mountain is cool and also 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.370
 slideshows you can do 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.100
 an album of images and images of 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.720
 occupation then leave the image alone 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.370
 also the image you can also 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.130
 choose the image you want 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.979
 appear fund is whether the program 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.020
 computer is also receiving facts 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.160

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.440

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.360
 things here on this earth I do not 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.070
 I saw this in practice I do not know if it's good but 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.370
 de xativa about I see them here is if you 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.230

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.100

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.010
 this appears here on the lock screen 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:06.180
 and here are the conditions of time it is of 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:08.190
 screen on this now but only 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.940

 same interface the same menu and had 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.720
 windows 7 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.360
 come back here for the other option have here 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.370

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.170

 themes here on microsoft's website are 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.980
 several different themes we remember here 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.260
 does not change woman's appearance so 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:49.860
 windows in general in one of the windows 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:53.550
 icons changes only the color of each theme and 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.980
 the background pictures but it sure is worth 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:06:01.380
 Download a theme here has themes as well 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:03.990
 Legal and finally have the option to start and 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.790

 used apps show and active

 is to use the entire screen if it is 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:18.419
 legal initiative is what happens 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.669
 the start menu and is equal to bare what 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.169
 it was on windows 8, it's cool for who 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:24.419
 likes to practice because he is accustomed 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:27.270

 format is same as windows 7 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:33.990
