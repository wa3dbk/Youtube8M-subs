00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 the girl if this video works 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.140
 current with the red-haired classmates 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.700
 which are at the root lighter than the 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.519
 greeting or darker than the 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.750
 length and we will 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.240
 I'll explain to you how it is that 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.609
 You take my root there you can see 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.410
 that we walk is clearer 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.150
 but also because I had no light 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.189
 hits the first window here also in 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.539
 but if you look at the whole 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.920
 length 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:34.410
 the difference is not so glaring like that 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:38.399
 points out that O appeared yesterday was cut 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.140
 hair at home and I ended up doing the 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.390
 disaster in the hair because the scot 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.730
 flourishing the length was very 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.570
 dark and I wanted to do locks 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.280
 go there 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.379
 basically what we listen to all 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.140
 the ink does not lighten the right ink. 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.340
 this is a truth that is if you which 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.739
 clearer or you pull wicks or 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.760
 to cut all the 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.170
 or expose the root of the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.189
 three, you're just going to have to do some 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.869
 chemistry ne 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.450
 not to mention that also has the option to you 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.090
 To be fading, not to be more 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.920
 uniform faded account and analyze by 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.890
 this moment analyzing great ceremony 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.710
 - But we have to paint 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.799
 new process which includes again and 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.200
 health of your hair is at stake so it is 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.090
 First thing for you, my colleague, 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.490
 is desperate is getting clearer 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.340
 that hair bears a new chemistry 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.049
 Hold on to the heart, will not it be better? 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.240
 scenery and hydrated in it me powerless 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.890
 for about three days after painting 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.259
 again to see if it's running out 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.200
 while several step 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.369
 this is the first point second point I 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.560
 I just said that ink does not lighten. 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.380
 ink, but I was not going to roll on my 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.420
 root with ink and hydrogen peroxide only 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.430
 only did nothing too much 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.490
 Ah, I'll leave the photos of the hair 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.590
 ax I will not leave only the hair 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.640
 ax on the blog click here in the blog 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.990
 information that I have a farm with 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.569
 a school was and until now 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.280
 Guys, I look fine with snakes. 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.300
 very intense 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.989
 and it was the following my hair was 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:22.790
 17:34 is explained our face right life 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.810
 and from there I passed the cross 8.44 in the 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.180
 root 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.980
 I left 15 minutes and then I 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.110
 tips to leave another 20 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.670
 minutinhos there is only composed wings 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.890
 with wet hair a little 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.580
 shampoo to give that cuticle black and 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.950
 such 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.420
 the problem is that people we can 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.090
 do this when we use the same 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.069
 coloring as decoration 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.489
 I did not know that I could not do this 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.239
 then overcame the root and did not 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.760
 tips 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.660
 I still thought ah my hair is more 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.880
 thick is over and now the cross shines 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.630
 8.4 is a very very very very ink 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.280
 very much copper very potent to take 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.580
 care to know nothing is to be 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.310
 She's darned to open her head forever. 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:10.790
 You know once and then I was 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.620
 hotel with those rays spotted by 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.209
 knock in the hall of the night ask yourself 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.109
 to her that she could do she could not 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.450
 answer me 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.620
 I went to ask her what I do in 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.450
 house right 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.730
 She spoke the following English of yours. 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:28.100
 length is seven at its root is 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:30.920
 almost 90 river much more open not only is 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.600
 almost 9 what you can do is also 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.310
 to use the hair without ammonia with the color more 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:40.250
 dark in it all is to wait for boka Ã© 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.010
 spend a few seven does not fit into the root 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.680
 hair to avoid hitting the ends or 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.700
 make a mixture with hydrogen peroxide 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.120
 more potent 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.160
 only on beads with lighter ink 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:55.130
 milk is finding the lady the fruits 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.799
 your hair right there, it's not 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.750
 very difficult to open having passed a 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.030
 water that is nothing old then more 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.430
 Of course the ink does not lighten ink but it goes 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.160
 open a little milton for you alike 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.700
 to this stain made either the hair or 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.330
 I got home and I got it till Thursday 9.4 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.550
 as hydrogen peroxide 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.010
 thirty and mingled with copper from the cross 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.750
 because I was afraid of 9.4 not 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.430
 will be charged enough to match 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.230
 with root copper 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:26.300
 I threw the packs away only leftovers. 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:30.210
 a bit of the truss mix 5004 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:33.630
 I mixed it in ink 9.4 for who knows 9 is 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:37.170
 the clearer it has charged laurels 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.420
 I was mexico mexico again and I painted that 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.130
 only full compliance and I left half 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.620
 hour 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:46.680
 I washed and I did not even wait or wait 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.350
 see this certain fact and sunglasses moisturize and 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.290
 even record I used and hot yet 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.030
 he wants to rebuild more powerful hour 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.880
 I've seen it more powerful than it is more 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.430
 intense catharsis I used some other 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.500
 construction of the prolific left half 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.570
 time in the hair after I went to call 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.280
 the question of doing well because otherwise 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.740
 had worked was not going back to do 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.600
 forward today because it is dangerous to 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.700
 hair fall dangerous is serious thing but 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.840
 You can see that it has damaged people. 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.890
 here is june 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:19.410
 knows by leaving the dots more 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:22.800
 furious here but the rest of the hair 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:25.380
 It's very beautiful and healthy. 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:29.910
 just this fifth behind the team that finishes 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:34.140
 damaging hair and that's it girls look 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:36.930
 only when step by step with hair 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.940
 ax, friend, do the wick test 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.750
 can almost fool the wick test 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.480
 did not open 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:46.830
 but do the test straight by seeing a wick 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:49.410
 if at least one bleaching is given is a tip 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.510
 that they gave me and that they work I stayed 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.520
 ten minutes the sun also because the 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.650
 heat helps boost reaction 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.169
 chemistry so you can open a 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.300
 a little more layers care for 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:03.030
 do not pass this you can choose to be 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:06.780
 careful not to go to the root and so 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:08.370
 I hope he is running out of it 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.129
 as he puts it to see if the 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.219
 more student 

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:14.379
 and I can still use your love to mint 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:16.959
 I know camera covers others ends 

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:22.659
 before to help there but this color 

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:25.179
 but this friend accepted us only 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:33.159
 takes place here, which does not seem to 

00:06:25.179 --> 00:06:37.569
 I'll call you right here, but it's also where 

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:39.849
 reflexivity liking this thing a lot 

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:41.219
 more intense is charged so even 

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:44.409
 with that number in exchange 

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:46.599
 superintendents stay in it as 

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:49.839
 reference and then I hope you have 

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:52.659
 helped to not forget the health was born 

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:54.729
 was always more important with dengue and 

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:57.669
 your hair withstands a new chemistry 

00:06:54.729 --> 00:07:00.189
 take a new conciliation you will not 

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:01.689
 Cancer heart had I leave the 

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:03.459
 News phone down here to 

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:05.229
 anyone who wants more professional contact 

00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:07.719
 here in Brazil it also charges a lot 

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:09.069
 cheap on service so worth giving 

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:11.519
 A look for those who live near here. 

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:11.519
 of the droplet
