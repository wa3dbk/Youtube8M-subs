00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
trying to give the night effect with the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.889 
trying to give the night effect with the
illumination<00:00:29.220> from<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.820> sides<00:00:32.420> for<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.690> we

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
illumination from the sides for this we

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.850 
illumination from the sides for this we
will<00:00:34.050> use<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.350> white<00:00:34.739> pencil<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.489> black<00:00:35.910> paper

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
will use a white pencil of black paper

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.869 
will use a white pencil of black paper
first<00:00:37.860> we<00:00:38.309> are<00:00:38.370> going<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.670> play<00:00:38.850> some

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
first we are going to play some

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.580 
first we are going to play some
measurements<00:00:39.809> as<00:00:39.989> reference<00:00:40.710> points

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.860 

you

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.700 

and<00:00:48.560> we<00:00:49.280> start<00:00:49.580> giving<00:00:49.760> shape<00:00:53.440> because<00:00:54.440> of<00:00:54.590> the

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
and we start giving shape because of the

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.410 
and we start giving shape because of the
perspective<00:00:55.430> I<00:00:55.580> think<00:00:55.610> it<00:00:56.060> would<00:00:56.210> look

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
perspective I think it would look

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:16.010 
perspective I think it would look
something<00:00:56.870> like<00:00:57.110> this

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.750 

having<00:01:17.020> the<00:01:17.200> line<00:01:17.380> form<00:01:17.710> we<00:01:17.950> can<00:01:18.160> start<00:01:18.520> giving

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
having the line form we can start giving

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.230 
having the line form we can start giving
the<00:01:19.150> light<00:01:20.310> remember<00:01:21.310> that<00:01:21.700> we<00:01:21.880> are<00:01:21.970> drawing

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
the light remember that we are drawing

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.540 
the light remember that we are drawing
in<00:01:22.690> negative

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
in negative

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.730 
in negative
normally<00:01:24.550> we<00:01:24.760> draw<00:01:25.060> shadowing<00:01:25.690> but<00:01:26.320> in<00:01:26.560> this

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
normally we draw shadowing but in this

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.250 
normally we draw shadowing but in this
case<00:01:27.070> we<00:01:27.430> are<00:01:27.460> going<00:01:27.670> to<00:01:27.910> draw<00:01:28.180> placing<00:01:29.110> the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
case we are going to draw placing the

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.550 
case we are going to draw placing the
lights<00:01:29.760> this<00:01:30.760> gives<00:01:31.060> a<00:01:31.240> nice<00:01:31.540> effect<00:01:34.560> from

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
lights this gives a nice effect from

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.280 
lights this gives a nice effect from
this<00:01:35.740> particular<00:01:36.400> angle<00:01:36.580> that<00:01:37.030> I<00:01:37.240> chose<00:01:37.540> we

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
this particular angle that I chose we

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.740 
this particular angle that I chose we
can<00:01:38.500> see<00:01:38.830> it<00:01:39.060> illuminated<00:01:40.060> from<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.420> sides

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
can see it illuminated from the sides

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.070 
can see it illuminated from the sides
and<00:01:41.230> the<00:01:41.740> center<00:01:42.190> a<00:01:42.220> little<00:01:42.460> bit<00:01:42.640> darker<00:01:43.210> let's

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
and the center a little bit darker let's

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:55.720 
and the center a little bit darker let's
try<00:01:44.470> to<00:01:44.530> do<00:01:44.860> this<00:01:45.190> effect

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:17.739 

I<00:01:58.210> like<00:01:59.210> how<00:01:59.480> it<00:01:59.660> is<00:01:59.780> appearing

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:17.749 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:22.099 

let's<00:02:18.749> do<00:02:18.930> some<00:02:19.200> soft<00:02:19.530> clouds<00:02:20.689> I'll<00:02:21.689> collect

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.109 
let's do some soft clouds I'll collect

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:23.959 
let's do some soft clouds I'll collect
the<00:02:22.290> little<00:02:22.439> tower<00:02:22.739> on<00:02:23.010> top<00:02:23.249> because<00:02:23.549> the

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:23.969 
the little tower on top because the

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:25.759 
the little tower on top because the
perspective<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:24.870> looked<00:02:25.079> to<00:02:25.260> me<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.409> little<00:02:25.590> bit

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
perspective it looked to me a little bit

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:40.200 
perspective it looked to me a little bit
one<00:02:26.159> and<00:02:26.930> let's<00:02:27.930> continue<00:02:28.349> with<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.799> detail

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.210 

now<00:02:41.210> I<00:02:41.240> see<00:02:41.630> it<00:02:41.720> slightly<00:02:42.260> crooked<00:02:42.500> I'll<00:02:42.920> move

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
now I see it slightly crooked I'll move

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.870 
now I see it slightly crooked I'll move
it<00:02:43.370> just<00:02:43.700> a<00:02:43.910> little<00:02:44.030> bit<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.510> right<00:02:45.880> that's

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
it just a little bit to the right that's

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.940 
it just a little bit to the right that's
better

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.530 

now<00:02:52.950> what<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:53.250> see<00:02:53.610> is<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.940> columns<00:02:54.330> in

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
now what I see is that the columns in

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.960 
now what I see is that the columns in
the<00:02:54.660> center<00:02:55.080> have<00:02:55.320> too<00:02:55.590> much<00:02:55.800> light<00:02:56.070> I<00:02:56.370> will

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
the center have too much light I will

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.760 
the center have too much light I will
make<00:02:57.150> them<00:02:57.360> darker<00:02:57.750> with<00:02:57.990> the<00:02:58.020> eraser

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.540 

that<00:03:04.770> is<00:03:04.980> better<00:03:05.280> now<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.450> am<00:03:06.660> happy<00:03:06.959> if<00:03:07.920> you<00:03:08.310> two
