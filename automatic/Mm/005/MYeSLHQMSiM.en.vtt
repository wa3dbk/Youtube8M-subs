there are 400 skill points spread over

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.440 
there are 400 skill points spread over
the<00:01:43.170> levels<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.860> obviously<00:01:44.700> as<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:44.909> level<00:01:45.240> up

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
the levels and obviously as you level up

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.649 
the levels and obviously as you level up
you<00:01:45.720> get<00:01:45.960> more<00:01:46.470> recipes<00:01:47.210> better<00:01:48.210> equipment

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
you get more recipes better equipment

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.350 
you get more recipes better equipment
you<00:01:48.930> can<00:01:49.079> use<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.590> make<00:01:49.880> they've<00:01:50.880> got<00:01:51.060> quite<00:01:51.240> a

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
you can use and make they've got quite a

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.690 
you can use and make they've got quite a
nice<00:01:51.630> added<00:01:51.960> bit<00:01:52.409> for<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.770> recipes<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.640> the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
nice added bit for the recipes and the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.319 
nice added bit for the recipes and the
fact<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.380> you<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.590> create<00:01:56.119> components<00:01:57.119> and

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
fact that you can create components and

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.139 
fact that you can create components and
then<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.200> can<00:01:58.469> miss<00:01:59.310> mash<00:01:59.549> them<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.909> get<00:02:00.060> in

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
then you can miss mash them to get in

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.510 
then you can miss mash them to get in
the<00:02:00.210> hopes<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.600> discovering<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:01.290> recipe<00:02:01.740> as<00:02:02.070> you

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
the hopes of discovering a recipe as you

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.819 
the hopes of discovering a recipe as you
can<00:02:02.640> see<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.390> just<00:02:03.659> randomly<00:02:04.320> put<00:02:04.649> two

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
can see it just randomly put two

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.709 
can see it just randomly put two
together<00:02:05.009> in<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.490> hopes<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:06.000> finding

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
together in the hopes of finding

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.960 
together in the hopes of finding
something<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.500> do<00:02:07.950> it's<00:02:08.160> quite<00:02:08.429> nice<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.789> think

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
something you do it's quite nice I think

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.029 
something you do it's quite nice I think
it<00:02:09.060> adds<00:02:09.209> some<00:02:09.390> discovery<00:02:10.170> rather<00:02:10.619> than<00:02:10.800> just

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
it adds some discovery rather than just

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.570 
it adds some discovery rather than just
boring<00:02:12.030> level<00:02:12.450> up<00:02:12.599> to<00:02:13.110> it

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
boring level up to it

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.120 
boring level up to it
I<00:02:13.640> think<00:02:14.450> it<00:02:14.690> encourages<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.650> mess<00:02:16.010> around

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
I think it encourages you to mess around

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.770 
I think it encourages you to mess around
a<00:02:16.370> little<00:02:16.550> bit<00:02:16.700> with<00:02:16.850> the<00:02:16.940> crafting<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:17.690> the

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
a little bit with the crafting and the

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.330 
a little bit with the crafting and the
components<00:02:18.320> and<00:02:18.440> maybe<00:02:18.560> think<00:02:18.860> about<00:02:18.980> what

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
components and maybe think about what

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.880 
components and maybe think about what
could<00:02:19.520> go<00:02:19.700> together<00:02:19.880> to<00:02:20.270> make<00:02:20.480> something<00:02:20.890> you

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
could go together to make something you

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.650 
could go together to make something you
also<00:02:22.100> I<00:02:22.550> don't<00:02:22.760> know<00:02:22.880> if<00:02:22.940> you<00:02:23.060> saw<00:02:23.270> where<00:02:23.570> you

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
also I don't know if you saw where you

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.500 
also I don't know if you saw where you
get<00:02:23.840> 100<00:02:24.350> to<00:02:24.380> 150<00:02:25.280> percent<00:02:25.820> bonus<00:02:26.300> for

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
get 100 to 150 percent bonus for

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.900 
get 100 to 150 percent bonus for
discovering<00:02:26.990> a<00:02:27.110> recipe<00:02:27.530> on<00:02:27.620> your<00:02:27.770> XP<00:02:28.220> so<00:02:28.730> also

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
discovering a recipe on your XP so also

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.450 
discovering a recipe on your XP so also
pays<00:02:29.510> off<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:30.200> experiment<00:02:30.860> a<00:02:30.980> lot<00:02:31.100> with<00:02:31.340> the

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
pays off to experiment a lot with the

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.000 
pays off to experiment a lot with the
recipes<00:02:31.940> and<00:02:32.240> as<00:02:33.170> you<00:02:33.320> can<00:02:33.470> see<00:02:33.500> it<00:02:33.800> when<00:02:33.830> you

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
recipes and as you can see it when you

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.830 
recipes and as you can see it when you
add<00:02:34.160> a<00:02:34.190> component<00:02:34.460> it<00:02:35.090> tells<00:02:35.420> you<00:02:35.570> the<00:02:35.660> level

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
add a component it tells you the level

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.570 
add a component it tells you the level
you<00:02:35.960> need<00:02:36.110> to<00:02:36.260> be<00:02:36.470> to<00:02:36.680> make<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.040> recipe<00:02:37.190> and

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
you need to be to make the recipe and

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.520 
you need to be to make the recipe and
how<00:02:37.820> many<00:02:37.880> recipes<00:02:38.210> can<00:02:38.600> be<00:02:38.660> made<00:02:39.080> from<00:02:39.110> that

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
how many recipes can be made from that

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.170 
how many recipes can be made from that
component<00:02:39.980> so<00:02:40.490> you've<00:02:40.580> got<00:02:40.610> some<00:02:40.940> of<00:02:41.060> the

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
component so you've got some of the

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.480 
component so you've got some of the
stuff<00:02:41.420> another<00:02:42.170> quite<00:02:42.530> unique<00:02:42.950> but

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
stuff another quite unique but

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.660 
stuff another quite unique but
ultimately<00:02:44.450> really<00:02:45.020> useful<00:02:45.620> feature<00:02:46.220> and

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
ultimately really useful feature and

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.220 
ultimately really useful feature and
their<00:02:46.790> guild<00:02:47.000> wars<00:02:47.180> 2<00:02:47.330> crafting<00:02:47.780> system<00:02:47.900> is

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
their guild wars 2 crafting system is

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.570 
their guild wars 2 crafting system is
although<00:02:48.590> you<00:02:48.800> can<00:02:48.980> only<00:02:49.130> have<00:02:49.340> two

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
although you can only have two

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.180 
although you can only have two
disciplines<00:02:50.030> at<00:02:50.300> one<00:02:50.420> time<00:02:50.720> you<00:02:51.470> can<00:02:51.770> pay<00:02:52.160> to

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
disciplines at one time you can pay to

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.600 
disciplines at one time you can pay to
change<00:02:52.760> your<00:02:52.940> discipline<00:02:53.480> it<00:02:54.410> does<00:02:54.800> cost<00:02:55.160> tank

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
change your discipline it does cost tank

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.360 
change your discipline it does cost tank
offer<00:02:55.880> per<00:02:56.660> level<00:02:56.959> of<00:02:57.320> the<00:02:57.740> discipline<00:02:58.220> you're

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
offer per level of the discipline you're

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.640 
offer per level of the discipline you're
trying<00:02:58.610> to<00:02:58.670> change<00:02:58.910> from<00:02:59.360> which<00:03:00.230> I<00:03:00.350> think<00:03:00.560> will

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
trying to change from which I think will

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.500 
trying to change from which I think will
help<00:03:00.860> because<00:03:01.430> it<00:03:01.700> means<00:03:01.880> that<00:03:02.000> if<00:03:02.180> you<00:03:02.300> don't

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
help because it means that if you don't

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.270 
help because it means that if you don't
like<00:03:02.630> your<00:03:02.720> discipline<00:03:03.170> you<00:03:03.530> can<00:03:03.800> change

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
like your discipline you can change

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.600 
like your discipline you can change
you're<00:03:04.610> not<00:03:04.730> stuck<00:03:05.240> in<00:03:05.540> it<00:03:05.890> but<00:03:06.890> at<00:03:07.160> the<00:03:07.400> same

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
you're not stuck in it but at the same

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.280 
you're not stuck in it but at the same

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
time it doesn't ruin trade because

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.140 
time it doesn't ruin trade because
there's<00:03:09.470> not<00:03:09.620> a<00:03:09.650> single<00:03:09.860> character<00:03:10.490> that<00:03:10.940> can

something if you're a high level that's
