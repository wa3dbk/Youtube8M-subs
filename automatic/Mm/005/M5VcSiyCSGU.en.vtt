as<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:34.710> can<00:00:34.860> see<00:00:34.950> it's<00:00:35.160> raining<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:36.270> get<00:00:36.420> a

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
as you can see it's raining you get a

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.470 
as you can see it's raining you get a
full<00:00:36.809> weather<00:00:37.079> cycle<00:00:37.649> on<00:00:37.920> here<00:00:38.309> but<00:00:39.090> it

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
full weather cycle on here but it

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.729 
full weather cycle on here but it
doesn't<00:00:39.690> really<00:00:39.780> affect<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.140> game<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.559> much

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
doesn't really affect the game that much

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.530 
doesn't really affect the game that much
obviously<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.460> can't<00:00:41.730> go<00:00:41.850> combining<00:00:42.329> when

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
obviously you can't go combining when

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.049 
obviously you can't go combining when
it's<00:00:42.660> raining<00:00:42.840> but<00:00:43.460> apart<00:00:44.460> from<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.700> you

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
it's raining but apart from that you

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.260 
it's raining but apart from that you
can't<00:00:45.539> doesn't<00:00:45.989> really<00:00:46.110> change<00:00:46.200> much<00:00:46.590> and

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
can't doesn't really change much and

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.900 
can't doesn't really change much and
there<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.390> no<00:00:48.539> seasons<00:00:49.110> actually<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.219> crops

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
there is no seasons actually so a crops

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.029 
there is no seasons actually so a crops
growing<00:00:51.210> about<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.510> day<00:00:51.780> which<00:00:52.559> makes<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.890> lot

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
growing about a day which makes a lot

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.529 
growing about a day which makes a lot
easier<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.520> like<00:00:53.850> collect<00:00:54.210> money<00:00:54.390> and

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
easier to like collect money and

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.560 
easier to like collect money and
everything<00:00:54.719> but<00:00:55.110> makes<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.010> less<00:00:56.160> realistic

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
everything but makes it less realistic

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.760 
everything but makes it less realistic
the<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:58.079> day<00:00:58.949> lasts<00:00:59.460> about<00:00:59.550> two<00:01:00.329> hours<00:01:00.770> so

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
the a day lasts about two hours so

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.170 
the a day lasts about two hours so
that's<00:01:01.859> if<00:01:02.070> you've<00:01:02.219> got<00:01:02.309> our<00:01:02.430> normal<00:01:02.820> settings

that's if you've got our normal settings

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.929 
that's if you've got our normal settings

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
the tractors that you should get start

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.600 
the tractors that you should get start
with<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.000> game<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.890> these<00:01:19.890> only<00:01:20.100> seem<00:01:20.580> to

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
with in the game and these only seem to

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.469 
with in the game and these only seem to
include<00:01:21.240> fence<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.790> hot<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:23.939> your<00:01:24.060> equipment

include fence and hot and your equipment
I<00:01:24.720> think<00:01:25.080> that's<00:01:25.200> due<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.470> licensing<00:01:25.619> issues

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
I think that's due to licensing issues

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.830 
I think that's due to licensing issues
