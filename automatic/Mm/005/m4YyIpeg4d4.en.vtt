00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.500 
up and down like I said before you can't
turn<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.220> inside<00:02:42.670> of<00:02:42.820> rings<00:02:43.030> with<00:02:43.300> the

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510

noble I mean other ones may spin better

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.180 
noble I mean other ones may spin better
but<00:02:57.130> this<00:02:57.400> one<00:02:57.610> doesn't<00:02:57.790> spin<00:02:58.150> worth<00:02:59.190> that

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
but this one doesn't spin worth that

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.050 
but this one doesn't spin worth that
spends<00:03:00.490> a<00:03:00.550> little<00:03:00.760> bit<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:03.670> then<00:03:03.910> these

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
spends a little bit and then these

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.790 
spends a little bit and then these
things<00:03:04.300> will<00:03:05.040> turn<00:03:06.040> it<00:03:07.380> and<00:03:08.380> plus<00:03:08.620> you<00:03:08.709> get

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
things will turn it and plus you get

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.310 
things will turn it and plus you get
this<00:03:08.950> case<00:03:09.280> you<00:03:10.209> don't<00:03:10.360> get<00:03:10.450> then<00:03:10.989> this<00:03:11.170> is

that's<00:04:09.379> pretty<00:04:09.590> much<00:04:09.770> it<00:04:10.040> I<00:04:10.069> just<00:04:10.640> a<00:04:10.730> short

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
that's pretty much it I just a short

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.380 
that's pretty much it I just a short
video<00:04:11.739> show<00:04:12.739> you<00:04:12.800> about<00:04:12.980> it<00:04:13.250> people<00:04:13.910> asked<00:04:14.360> me

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
video show you about it people asked me

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.750 
video show you about it people asked me
to<00:04:14.560> does<00:04:15.560> this<00:04:15.709> turn<00:04:15.950> the<00:04:16.100> knowable<00:04:16.459> and<00:04:16.609> yes

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
to does this turn the knowable and yes

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.120 
to does this turn the knowable and yes
it<00:04:16.910> does<00:04:17.090> but<00:04:17.269> it<00:04:17.329> doesn't<00:04:17.630> turn<00:04:17.750> this<00:04:17.959> one<00:04:18.200> it

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
it does but it doesn't turn this one it

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.099 
it does but it doesn't turn this one it
does<00:04:19.370> spin<00:04:19.790> like<00:04:20.000> crazy<00:04:20.060> good

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
does spin like crazy good

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.770 
does spin like crazy good
I<00:04:21.139> don't<00:04:21.380> know<00:04:21.730> how<00:04:22.730> durable<00:04:23.210> it<00:04:23.419> is<00:04:23.540> I'm<00:04:23.750> sure

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
I don't know how durable it is I'm sure

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.940 
I don't know how durable it is I'm sure
that's<00:04:24.310> plastic<00:04:25.310> holding<00:04:26.090> it<00:04:26.650> I'm<00:04:27.650> sure<00:04:27.860> you

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
that's plastic holding it I'm sure you

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.370 
that's plastic holding it I'm sure you
could<00:04:28.100> probably<00:04:29.500> take<00:04:30.500> it<00:04:30.560> apart<00:04:32.320> if<00:04:33.320> you

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
could probably take it apart if you

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.640 
could probably take it apart if you
wanted<00:04:33.830> to<00:04:34.010> yeah<00:04:35.000> look<00:04:35.240> at<00:04:35.330> that<00:04:35.650> first

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
wanted to yeah look at that first

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.480 
wanted to yeah look at that first
disassembly<00:04:37.460> of<00:04:37.610> it<00:04:37.790> um

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
disassembly of it um

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:45.030 
disassembly of it um
imagine<00:04:40.490> these<00:04:40.610> plastic<00:04:42.610> nubs<00:04:43.630> could<00:04:44.630> break

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
imagine these plastic nubs could break

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.940 
imagine these plastic nubs could break
eventually<00:04:46.040> they<00:04:46.850> look<00:04:47.030> pretty<00:04:47.180> tough<00:04:47.950> you

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
eventually they look pretty tough you

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.270 
eventually they look pretty tough you
could<00:04:49.190> fix<00:04:49.580> that<00:04:50.770> looks<00:04:51.770> like<00:04:51.889> it's<00:04:52.100> easily

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
could fix that looks like it's easily

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.469 
could fix that looks like it's easily
easy<00:04:52.820> to<00:04:53.060> take<00:04:53.240> apart<00:04:54.160> you<00:04:55.160> just<00:04:55.370> pinch<00:04:56.270> the

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
easy to take apart you just pinch the

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.620 
easy to take apart you just pinch the
big<00:04:56.660> ring<00:04:56.979> spreads<00:04:57.979> it<00:04:58.210> puts<00:04:59.210> it<00:04:59.330> into<00:04:59.479> the

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
big ring spreads it puts it into the

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.890 
big ring spreads it puts it into the
little<00:04:59.810> hole<00:04:59.900> and<00:05:00.770> then<00:05:01.540> same<00:05:02.540> thing<00:05:02.750> with

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
little hole and then same thing with

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:09.159 
little hole and then same thing with
this<00:05:03.050> one<00:05:04.120> stick<00:05:05.120> it<00:05:05.270> in<00:05:05.360> the<00:05:05.450> hole<00:05:07.990> and<00:05:08.990> then

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
this one stick it in the hole and then

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.890 
this one stick it in the hole and then
pinch<00:05:09.500> it<00:05:09.710> and<00:05:10.580> it<00:05:10.760> goes<00:05:10.910> in<00:05:11.090> there<00:05:11.270> so<00:05:11.540> that's

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
pinch it and it goes in there so that's

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:12.580 
pinch it and it goes in there so that's
pretty<00:05:12.139> cool

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
pretty cool

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.890 
pretty cool
now<00:05:13.250> if<00:05:13.430> you<00:05:13.580> had<00:05:13.789> to<00:05:14.000> you<00:05:14.150> could<00:05:14.270> fix<00:05:14.630> that

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
now if you had to you could fix that

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.710 
now if you had to you could fix that
easily<00:05:15.190> with<00:05:16.190> a<00:05:16.220> soldering<00:05:17.000> iron<00:05:17.950> so<00:05:18.950> um<00:05:19.720> yeah

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
easily with a soldering iron so um yeah

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
although I'm pretty impressed with it

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.969 
although I'm pretty impressed with it
for<00:05:22.280> the<00:05:22.340> price<00:05:22.550> I<00:05:22.910> got<00:05:23.539> it<00:05:23.660> for<00:05:23.780> free<00:05:23.930> so<00:05:24.080> of

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
for the price I got it for free so of

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:27.159 
for the price I got it for free so of
course<00:05:25.160> I'm<00:05:25.340> impressed<00:05:25.820> with<00:05:26.030> it<00:05:26.150> but<00:05:26.690> you

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
spent five bucks on it I think you'd

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.650 
spent five bucks on it I think you'd
probably<00:05:30.350> like<00:05:30.680> it<00:05:31.030> if<00:05:32.030> you<00:05:32.240> didn't<00:05:32.479> want<00:05:32.630> to

00:05:59.379 --> 00:05:59.389 
have a jeweler as a friend then we could

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:00.219
