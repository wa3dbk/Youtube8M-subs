00:00:04.204 --> 00:00:09.204
Oh! It's time for "Is it a Good Idea 
 to Microwave This?" I'm your host, Jory Caron.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:18.310
We're microwaving a wristwatch today. And they say, "Time flies when you're 
 having fun." But does time FRY when you're having fun?

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:20.018
*theme song plays*

00:00:18.994 --> 00:00:20.994
Jory: Let's go roast some nuts!

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:21.953
Jory: And, as always, our Sharp microwave!

00:00:21.827 --> 00:00:23.827
Jory: It's never a good idea, unless you want an explosion!

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.790
Jory: Stopping, stopping!

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:27.058
Jory: Safety is our number-one concern.

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:28.493
Jon: Wow! That's a lotta smoke!

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.910
Jory: The masks- they do nothing!

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.730
Jory: We also hide behind this big tin foil shield. Nobody likes roasted nuts!

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:35.233
Ezra: Is it a good idea?

00:00:34.226 --> 00:00:36.226
Jory: (laughs) Absolutely!

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:37.769
Jory: Is it a good idea to microwave this?

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:45.939
Well, let's find out! Here at the Jory Caron Laboratory, safety 
is our number-one concern. That's why we have these masks.

00:00:45.312 --> 00:00:52.312
And we also have a giant tin foil shield. It's 
to protect our nuts, because nobody likes roasted nuts!

00:00:53.153 --> 00:01:00.153
Jory: Also, we have this fan here, it's just to circulate the air. It's 
 not gonna help us breathe easier. It's just to circulate the air.

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:13.761
We also have the Sharp carousel microwave. Sandra is beautiful! Sandra is amazing! Those are just 
some of the adjectives I could use to describe her! More later, I guess!

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:18.541
Jory: So, in goes the watch. What I'm gonna 
do is remove the plate this time.

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:21.279
Jon: It looks kinda dirty, anyway!

00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:22.781
Jory: It's actually pretty slippery, too!

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.050
Jon: Aw, you just cleaned your hands!

00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:26.351
Jory: Yeah, I know...

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:35.619
Jory: Okay, so in goes the watch, like this. We're gonna try and give you a shot of what it looks like 
 zoomed in. So, I put it on this thing of Vaseline so it stands up, so you can actually see it.

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:45.096
Jory: It was just a minor problem. So, now, I just have to figure out 
 how long to put it in there for. I'm thinking probably about a minute.

00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:47.610
Jon: Yeah, alright!

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:49.710
Jory: It actually just started!

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:51.940
Jory: Smoking already!

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:57.240
Ryan: Whoa! Oh, there's a battery in there!

00:01:59.304 --> 00:02:01.300
Jory: Uh, we should probably turn it off, then...

00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:03.560
Jon: No, no, no, no! Not yet, not yet!

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:12.190
Jory: Watches blow up in a hurry! They're conscious of time, they know that we're rushing this and we just wanna blow it up!

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.700
Jon: It's sparking, and it's still flaming!

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.770
Jon: I mean, Jory- the watch has places to be!

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.970
Jory: How old is this watch, Jon?

00:02:19.106 --> 00:02:21.110
Ryan: Whoa!

00:02:20.016 --> 00:02:25.020
Jon: It was my former wristwatch from, like, five years ago, 
so the battery is actually almost dead on it.

00:02:26.564 --> 00:02:28.560
Jory: Wanna kill it?

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:32.510
Jon: No! Not yet, not yet, not yet! No, I wanna 
see what happens! It's only a minute! It's almost done!

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:35.550
Ryan: It actually IS done!

00:02:35.222 --> 00:02:39.220
Jon: Jory, what's goin' on? Jory, are you getting something for fire safety? 

00:02:40.311 --> 00:02:42.310
Jory: Yeah...

00:02:44.212 --> 00:02:46.210
Jory: Okay... Oh, wait- I forgot to put on my mask!

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:47.700
Ryan: THERE'S that familiar smell!

00:02:47.668 --> 00:02:49.670
Jory: Okay, so let's open up this microwave.

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:53.900
Jon: Oh, my God!

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:55.310
Ryan: Ooh!

00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:56.880
Jon: Wow!

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.410
Ryan: That is nasty!

00:02:59.146 --> 00:03:01.150
*watch crackles and sizzles*

00:03:02.834 --> 00:03:06.830
Jon: Wow! That thing was still goin'! The wristwatch was really flammable, I guess!

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.150
Jon: Wow! That's the wristwatch! That thing was just cooked! There's 
nothing left! Where's the strap? Oh, there's the strap, okay...

00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:17.960
Jory: So, folks at home, this thing right here is a wristwatch.

00:03:18.345 --> 00:03:20.340
Jon: Don't do that!

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:27.030
Jory: I'm not sure what the battery acid will do, so I put it in tin foil! Just a 
 convenient tip from the fine people here you love at "Is it a Good Idea to Microwave This?"

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:40.540
Jory: Is it a good idea to microwave a watch? No, no! And I 
hope you're noticing a pattern that nothing here really IS good to microwave!

00:03:41.154 --> 00:03:51.150
Jory: Last season, we did a lot of fruit. It turned out to be good 
ideas. This season, we're doing a lot of bigger, badder, better, not-a-good-idea-to-microwave things.

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:59.500
Jory: So, that's it for "Is it a Good Idea to Microwave This?" I'm 
your host, Jory Caron. And let's... Well, I'm gonna breathe again, okay!

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:05.710
