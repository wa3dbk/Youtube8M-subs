00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
down here that you can see out there in

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.840 
down here that you can see out there in
the<00:00:45.269> distance<00:00:45.620> over<00:00:46.620> there<00:00:46.860> just<00:00:47.400> ahead<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.640> us

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
the distance over there just ahead of us

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.579

there<00:00:50.159> he's<00:00:51.150> down<00:00:51.330> there<00:00:51.510> once<00:00:51.720> you<00:00:51.839> drain<00:00:52.170> the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
there he's down there once you drain the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.990 
there he's down there once you drain the
lake<00:00:52.589> I<00:00:52.860> believe<00:00:53.220> that's<00:00:53.489> what<00:00:53.640> makes<00:00:53.820> him

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
lake I believe that's what makes him

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.350 
lake I believe that's what makes him
show<00:00:54.299> up<00:00:54.799> once<00:00:55.799> you<00:00:55.979> get<00:00:56.790> down<00:00:56.970> here<00:00:57.000> you

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
show up once you get down here you

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.910 
show up once you get down here you
absolutely<00:00:57.809> do<00:00:57.989> not<00:00:58.140> have<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.559> fight<00:00:58.739> that

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
absolutely do not have to fight that

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.979 
absolutely do not have to fight that
dragon<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.640> can<00:00:59.760> just<00:00:59.970> go<00:01:00.089> right<00:01:00.119> around<00:01:00.570> to

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
dragon you can just go right around to

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.229 
dragon you can just go right around to
the<00:01:01.170> left<00:01:01.409> of<00:01:01.559> him<00:01:01.739> because<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.189> cave<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.970> a

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
the left of him because the cave is a

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.759 
the left of him because the cave is a
little<00:01:03.570> ways<00:01:03.689> away<00:01:03.869> so<00:01:04.049> it's<00:01:04.470> not<00:01:04.559> going<00:01:04.680> to

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
little ways away so it's not going to

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.640 
little ways away so it's not going to
grow<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.309> dragon<00:01:05.900> when<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:06.960> get<00:01:07.080> down<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.410> the
