gems<00:00:17.100> now<00:00:17.340> have<00:00:17.609> our<00:00:17.880> own<00:00:18.090> lighting<00:00:18.480> effect

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
gems now have our own lighting effect

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.980 
gems now have our own lighting effect
which<00:00:19.230> is<00:00:19.439> well<00:00:19.859> really<00:00:20.310> damn<00:00:20.460> good<00:00:20.490> looking

new future in this image right here at I

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.120 
new future in this image right here at I
want<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.420> say<00:00:27.630> it's<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.199> lighting<00:00:28.859> the

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
want to say it's the lighting the

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.740 
want to say it's the lighting the
lighting<00:00:29.310> looks<00:00:29.699> somewhat<00:00:30.060> different<00:00:30.510> i<00:00:30.599> want

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
lighting looks somewhat different i want

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.030 
lighting looks somewhat different i want
to<00:00:30.810> say<00:00:30.900> it's<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.109> lighting<00:00:31.470> from<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.679> gems

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
to say it's the lighting from the gems

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.350 
to say it's the lighting from the gems
and<00:00:32.420> yeah<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.480> gems<00:00:34.230> are<00:00:34.380> really<00:00:34.680> cool<00:00:34.980> and

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
and yeah the gems are really cool and

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.150 
and yeah the gems are really cool and
encrusted<00:00:36.360> into<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.170> back<00:00:37.320> wall<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.590> also

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
encrusted into the back wall and also

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.310 
encrusted into the back wall and also
the<00:00:38.250> blocks<00:00:38.489> i<00:00:38.760> mean<00:00:38.969> i<00:00:39.120> like<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.360> lot<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.870> this

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
the blocks i mean i like a lot and this

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.660 
the blocks i mean i like a lot and this
is<00:00:40.469> what<00:00:40.620> we're<00:00:40.770> gonna<00:00:40.890> be<00:00:41.070> finding<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
is what we're gonna be finding in the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.510 
is what we're gonna be finding in the
lunar<00:00:42.000> base<00:00:42.210> mind's<00:00:42.870> eye<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.739> think<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.399> cool

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
lunar base mind's eye I think it's cool

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.639 
lunar base mind's eye I think it's cool
this<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.789> pretty<00:00:45.420> much<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.809> slice<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.530> lunar

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
this is pretty much a slice of the lunar

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.830 
this is pretty much a slice of the lunar
base<00:00:46.920> mission<00:00:47.370> because<00:00:48.059> we'll<00:00:48.210> be<00:00:48.239> going<00:00:48.690> on<00:00:48.780> a

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
base mission because we'll be going on a

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.150 
base mission because we'll be going on a
mission<00:00:49.020> where<00:00:49.590> we<00:00:49.680> actually<00:00:49.770> have<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.070> get

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
mission where we actually have to get

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.150 
mission where we actually have to get
moonstones<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.940> repair<00:00:51.270> FTL<00:00:51.690> Drive<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.170> over

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
moonstones to repair FTL Drive and over

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.340 
moonstones to repair FTL Drive and over
there<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.340> think<00:00:53.489> we<00:00:54.000> see<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.239> switch<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.629> might

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
there I think we see a switch that might

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.439 
there I think we see a switch that might
possibly<00:00:55.620> restart<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.730> whole<00:00:56.940> moon<00:00:57.210> base

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
possibly restart the whole moon base

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.900 
possibly restart the whole moon base
like<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.899> might<00:00:58.050> restart<00:00:59.039> your<00:00:59.219> operations<00:00:59.760> or

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
like it might restart your operations or

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.459 
like it might restart your operations or
something<00:01:00.329> anyway<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:00.899> want<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.199> know<00:01:01.260> from<00:01:01.379> you

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
something anyway I want to know from you

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.349 
something anyway I want to know from you
guys<00:01:01.680> like<00:01:01.949> what<00:01:02.460> do<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.640> think<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.180> new

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
guys like what do you think is the new

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.719 
guys like what do you think is the new
feature<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.350> shown<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.189> image<00:01:05.250> here

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
feature that is shown in this image here

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.460 
feature that is shown in this image here
because<00:01:06.180> i'm<00:01:06.360> looking<00:01:06.689> around<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.080> i<00:01:07.200> can't

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
because i'm looking around and i can't

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.960 
because i'm looking around and i can't
really<00:01:07.650> spot<00:01:07.920> anything<00:01:08.220> other<00:01:08.549> than<00:01:08.700> lighting

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
really spot anything other than lighting

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.420 
really spot anything other than lighting
and<00:01:09.390> it's<00:01:09.930> really<00:01:10.200> subtle<00:01:10.530> like<00:01:10.799> apparently

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
and it's really subtle like apparently

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.080 
and it's really subtle like apparently
it's<00:01:12.000> definitely<00:01:12.990> not<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.229> cloak<00:01:14.090> because

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
it's definitely not the cloak because

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.160 
it's definitely not the cloak because
that's<00:01:15.360> just<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.659> back<00:01:15.810> slot<00:01:16.020> item<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:18.170> iiii

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
that's just the back slot item and iiii

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.719 
that's just the back slot item and iiii
don't<00:01:19.650> know<00:01:19.860> i<00:01:20.009> don't<00:01:20.040> know<00:01:20.250> what<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.490> could<00:01:20.580> be

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
don't know i don't know what it could be

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.600 
don't know i don't know what it could be
but<00:01:21.350> yeah<00:01:22.350> look<00:01:22.650> at<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.280> big

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
but yeah look at this this is a big

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.179 
but yeah look at this this is a big
teaser<00:01:23.850> image<00:01:24.240> now<00:01:24.570> tomorrow<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.860> stuff<00:01:26.070> like

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
teaser image now tomorrow and stuff like

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.590 
teaser image now tomorrow and stuff like
that<00:01:26.250> when<00:01:26.580> there<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.880> new<00:01:27.060> post<00:01:27.299> on<00:01:27.509> the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
that when there is a new post on the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.240 
that when there is a new post on the
starboard<00:01:27.900> side<00:01:27.990> i<00:01:28.380> don't<00:01:28.740> think<00:01:28.829> i<00:01:29.189> can

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
starboard side i don't think i can

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.730 
starboard side i don't think i can
actually<00:01:29.549> make<00:01:29.640> an<00:01:29.729> update<00:01:29.970> video<00:01:30.150> i<00:01:30.740> might

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
actually make an update video i might

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.310 
actually make an update video i might
possibly<00:01:32.070> possibly<00:01:32.700> be<00:01:33.150> able<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.570> or<00:01:33.840> i<00:01:33.869> might

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
possibly possibly be able to or i might

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.350 
possibly possibly be able to or i might
