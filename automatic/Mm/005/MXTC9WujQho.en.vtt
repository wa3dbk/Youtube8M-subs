00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:02.920
 good morning they say tanks are not afraid of dirt 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.970
 I will reveal to you a military secret there 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.080
 tanks are not afraid of water and even kumische and 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.290
 swim central europe water 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.980
 obstacles occur every 40 50 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.880
 kilometers for high tactical 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.810
 mobility authorities need to have 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.019
 the ability to force explorer 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.140
 in general 1950 second year not for the sake of conquest 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.579
 under either drank from those guys in ussr 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:26.599
 built 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.310
 light tank only from 76 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.760
 amphibious tank of course in winter swim 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.010
 nowhere but the principle of action I have you now 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.210
 explain to not turn into 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.110
 submarine front rises 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.219
 special fully reflects the presence 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:41.829
 there are exits in the stern 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.999
 jet propulsion turns 

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:45.960
 steel float on water using 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.619
 opening closing per word 

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:49.850
 the freebie shut on the right turned 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:50.600
 vice versa 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.789
 both on water and on land all this steel 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:54.070
 the design sets in motion 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.339
 six-cylinder four-stroke without 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:59.210
 240 diesel engine v6 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.289
 horsepower around 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.589
 twenty liters to fail 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.519
 design and had to facilitate 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.680
 recently received only 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.330
 bulletproof armor thickness 10 15 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.250
 millimeters but here and 76 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.250
 millimeter cannon machine gun 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.619
 the bankâ€™s ammunition was 40 a shot 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.580
 with armor piercing and fragmentation shells 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.700
 thousands of rounds 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.800
 machine gun supply armor-piercing projectile on 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.690
 dance 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.980
 thousands of meters pierced the name 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.330
 60 degrees from vertical bronuk 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.460
 60 millimeters thick 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.330
 so the tank commander was 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.170
 it is time for the loaders to be loaded too 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.170
 try yourself 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.039
 success they are 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:42.760
 but not so easy 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.180
 ticket mechanic driver is 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.200
 little site he sits in the middle 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.230
 cars 1 space is a lot but throw universities but 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.970
 around a bunch of appliances and fixtures 1 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.750
 if which I can only guess 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.650
 russell tank control but then twice 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.940
 two leverage capital from a cow 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.940
 so arthur captures 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.829
 by the way as a result of hollow 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:10.070
 so they did 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.349
 to raise the bar 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.739
 this in no way affects the running 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:15.529
 qualities 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:17.779
 can see himself can Evgeny 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:19.209
 tutkevich ideal friends 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.489
 ask how 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.469
 often visits while managing such 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:23.959
 technique 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.439
 mixed with fear the delight of a grandfather 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:28.189
 fear of not stopping there 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:30.329
 where it would be logical to stay 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.009
 if you list geography 

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:34.159
 service relatives of our experimental 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.279
 there is also a floating tank poets 76 probably 

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:39.689
 only the monument remained though 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:42.010
 who knows today our six months of actors 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.959
 and works on a military technical base 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.549
 film company Mosfilm 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.299
 Look at our country, even tanks 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:49.999
 are swimming 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:51.769
 but why then domestic cars 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.019
 bad ride paradox
