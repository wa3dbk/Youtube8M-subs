00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 yo kees van loop and welcome to eb type 9 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.510
 from you requires ingo today and beyond 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.670
 I ran inside a bowl 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.880
 but they found that doing and going today 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.160
 we continue with where we left off 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.570
 the crane as you see left right 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.340
 and you put a fisherman 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:26.279
 and what I have to do now is kind here 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:30.510
 make port kind of platform 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:37.350
 so crates and things stored fats 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:38.850
 I'm going to train you, your stories are going 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.430
 we are kind of good here 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.530
 Quay make a lot of people really whole 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.309
 many people in the past and the attica de 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.930
 come 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.309
 fish come in everything I have in you in it 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.379
 want to go out in the single player 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.820
 so it's about this place this texture 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.480
 pack that will make it look slightly different 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.480
 if I had wanted 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.560
 because with this batch check my ex shoot 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.170
 what 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.869
 texture pack there you could have the 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.049
 texture are all those things with wild and 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.570
 so as you see you block that is also in 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.549
 Cities on this red beech bartender 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.450
 So we screenshare the schooner one 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.450
 text at conquest 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.920
 and with that you can have a quote box too 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.490
 deal with all of them 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.470
 fresher in one it's really greasy 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.759
 that's why I prefer this one to the 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.590
 john's door with 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.630
 because yes you just have more beautiful and nicer things 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.069
 all extra things it is just 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.950
 nice 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:46.799
 I have now filled in a bit and then 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.310
 is going to lower it slightly here 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.780
 since you have to be connected 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.099
 and also something else 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.070
 and this look is also something they 

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:57.740
 pregnant and a bone in the ground 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:04.780
 is just we little details that do that 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.780
 it just clean far well then goes here 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.070
 how to connect this 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:17.420
 as long as better yes and could still show 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.600
 more color in there because there is 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.600
 see how and what everything is coming 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.420
 yes well here can be the edge 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.660
 far prevail over the water of yours 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.660
 to make 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.300
 now those gas edges and if not me never 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:51.070
 that lets it merge a bit with 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:52.610
 the bare next to that we are so fond of this 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.440
 those things 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.650
 but i just want protrusion of the 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.650
 quay 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.190
 where then fish can lay angry 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.620
 and 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.810
 good drop the goods i don't know 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.250
 wanting to do all roads is also possible 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.959
 nice sitting on the seat of the sun 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.920
 he always shines very good breakfast 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.690
 the water public why that is but yes 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.220
 get a nice tan 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.200
 but there are not before we are to it 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.180
 build a gift 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.769
 so here is another show 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.440
 reinforcement pillar 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.440
 don't do so and here too I think 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.510
 Here comes the pink developments on this 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.510
 another color 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.030
 and we do that a bit here 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.690
 making it appear divide and rise 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.690
 to an in between 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.790
 thor goal 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.640
 shoe she has to do it your we we go 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.400
 connect the pillar a bit with 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.450
 the star behind it against the quay 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.709
 to place 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.450
 then it seems like that piece again 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.090
 higher up the draftsman sitting making it 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.500
 up locally 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.120
 He we might still above 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.500
 a kind of 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.340
 edge do different color making it 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.099
 a kind of 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.409
 but again I don't like fans either 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:18.709
 fat look like rose cs i like it and shit 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:20.340
 do you can not do something inside I think 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.699
 bid 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:29.880
 Do you green and pull it out by the 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:30.810
 is going to see if better than have this then 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.150
 we go the 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:37.630
 color the floor differently because a port 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.250
 some not all floor advice 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.850
 of a color 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.470
 it destroys and worn out port number 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.710
 by the way, what are boxes or 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.000
 retracted from everything done 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.110
 so we go a little antiquity and 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.460
 bring 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:56.940
 just like in the house that house there 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:00.550
 You can see the floor also differently 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.680
 it was not all parquet floor 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.870
 as we now all have different homes 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.370
 beautiful wooden floor is completely 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.740
 smoothed out 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.090
 then they didn't ask so yes it goes 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.250
 difficult 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.490
 You should also turn us light 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.490
 shoot 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:23.200
 and a little more stars here 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:27.220
 suits put a nice nod to 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:29.320
 making it nicely rounded you stoop 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.430
 and blogging 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.430
 something still needs to be lighted here 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:44.880
 also here and that 's how fat is 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.730
 I 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.520
 maybe you have a piece of gift that 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.860
 she said that this gondola to walk something 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:57.630
 otherwise so 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:06:01.470
 old name pillar up and the other 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:05.430
 also for that extra sturdy 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:09.480
 take from bottom to top and then go 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:16.550
 we both had expansion here 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:16.550
 sides do that by so 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:20.439
 We will create a paper here 

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:24.189
 i'm going to swim on going 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:32.990
 We are already back I think we are going now 

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:33.830
 put another picture here that do 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:40.009
 you here 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:41.419
 this is the place suitable for the label 

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:44.270
 this coming through because it's here 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:47.060
 narrower came to say 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:49.909
 we are going to use the pillars 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.870
 connect with star 

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:57.050
 just as we have with the others 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:58.550
 done and you can still sail on legs 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.319
 so you can take them away 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.830
 otherwise they can not beautiful park here 

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:02.830
 say longer 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:08.750
 and that was it for this time 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.430
 boys we have the tap 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.500
 we now have fish so that you will still be there 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.150
 fucked and avi she can next time 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.889
 you then put on some decoration and 

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.240
 maybe after that the boat will come again 

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:19.669
 then don't know for sure 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.990
 the according to above but you found 

00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:21.979
 this well a nice video shows a like 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.180
 behind 

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:24.800
 well the coming behind of what you are there 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.839
 next you want to see as a small thing 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:31.300
 for example another one 

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:31.300
 a bakery or storage house 

00:07:31.479 --> 00:07:35.740
 they still go to the German home and then see 

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:38.289
 I you the following application types 

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.960
 have kind of team then something goes fast 

00:07:38.289 --> 00:07:42.009
 special apps for nice and long time like me 

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.849
 thank you for looking 

00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:44.849
