00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
them on and that's why you got such a

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.590 
them on and that's why you got such a
great<00:04:38.910> result<00:04:39.270> no<00:04:39.960> I<00:04:39.990> don't<00:04:40.350> think<00:04:40.380> is<00:04:41.600> because

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600
