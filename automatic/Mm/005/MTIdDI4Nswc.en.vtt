00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
unboxing with you and I know kits aren't

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.999 
unboxing with you and I know kits aren't
super<00:01:18.090> duper<00:01:18.330> exciting<00:01:18.840> normally<00:01:19.680> will<00:01:19.830> show

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
super duper exciting normally will show

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.010 
super duper exciting normally will show
you<00:01:20.159> like<00:01:20.369> all<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:21.240> hops<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.750> we're<00:01:21.900> gonna

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
you like all the hops that we're gonna

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.359 
you like all the hops that we're gonna
put<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.650> stuff<00:01:22.830> like<00:01:22.950> that

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
put on it and stuff like that

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.670 
put on it and stuff like that
but<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.729> actually<00:01:23.909> think<00:01:24.299> with<00:01:25.200> these<00:01:25.350> Tamiya

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
but I actually think with these Tamiya

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.440 
but I actually think with these Tamiya
kits<00:01:26.040> because<00:01:26.250> we<00:01:26.520> have<00:01:26.670> like<00:01:26.939> six<00:01:27.270> or<00:01:27.420> seven

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
kits because we have like six or seven

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.420 
kits because we have like six or seven
of<00:01:27.810> them<00:01:27.930> we're<00:01:28.560> gonna<00:01:28.650> just<00:01:28.860> build<00:01:29.130> them<00:01:29.310> up

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
of them we're gonna just build them up

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.600 
of them we're gonna just build them up
box<00:01:30.030> stock<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.900> then<00:01:31.500> shoot<00:01:32.189> our<00:01:32.310> running

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
box stock and then shoot our running

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.240 
box stock and then shoot our running
videos<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.270> then<00:01:33.450> probably<00:01:34.350> sell<00:01:35.070> them

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
videos and then probably sell them

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.560 
videos and then probably sell them
unless<00:01:35.700> we<00:01:35.850> really<00:01:36.180> fall<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.509> love<00:01:36.570> with<00:01:36.840> them

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
unless we really fall in love with them

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.569 
unless we really fall in love with them
so<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.600> don't<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.170> didn't<00:01:40.350> want<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.590> quite
