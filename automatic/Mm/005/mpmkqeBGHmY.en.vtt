can see the band's come folded the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.360 
can see the band's come folded the
outside<00:00:42.360> which<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:43.469> forks<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.010> same<00:00:44.219> as

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
outside which the forks is the same as

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.590 
outside which the forks is the same as
the<00:00:44.399> pocket<00:00:44.730> rocket<00:00:44.850> one<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.450> pocket

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
the pocket rocket one and the pocket

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.319 
the pocket rocket one and the pocket
rocket<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:46.170> took<00:00:47.129> an<00:00:47.250> extra<00:00:47.430> five<00:00:47.670> millimeters

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
rocket to took an extra five millimeters

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.869 
rocket to took an extra five millimeters
out<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:49.110> inside<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.500> each<00:00:49.739> fork<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.579> there's<00:00:50.820> a

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
out the inside of each fork so there's a

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.850 
out the inside of each fork so there's a
bigger<00:00:51.059> gap<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.449> between<00:00:51.539> but<00:00:52.050> as<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.350> say<00:00:52.590> dat

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
bigger gap in between but as I say dat

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.590 
bigger gap in between but as I say dat
gap<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.309> still<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.610> same<00:00:53.640> swear<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.420> bands

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
gap is still the same swear the bands

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.900 
gap is still the same swear the bands
are<00:00:54.780> folded<00:00:55.340> there<00:00:56.340> it's<00:00:56.520> better<00:00:56.730> for

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
are folded there it's better for

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.529 
are folded there it's better for
accuracy<00:00:57.329> having<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.629> wider<00:00:57.809> gap<00:00:58.280> also<00:00:59.539> you

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
accuracy having the wider gap also you

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.180 
accuracy having the wider gap also you
less<00:01:00.930> likely<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.379> get<00:01:01.469> any<00:01:01.649> Forks<00:01:01.949> trucks

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
less likely to get any Forks trucks

original<00:01:50.130> demon<00:01:50.430> really<00:01:51.060> chunky<00:01:52.009> this<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.159> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
original demon really chunky this is the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.209 
original demon really chunky this is the
new<00:01:53.399> one<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.909> slimmer<00:01:54.180> version<00:01:55.070> this<00:01:56.070> was

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
new one it's a slimmer version this was

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.709 
new one it's a slimmer version this was
a<00:01:56.280> great<00:01:56.399> design<00:01:56.820> don't<00:01:57.090> get<00:01:57.240> me<00:01:57.360> wrong<00:01:57.479> but

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
a great design don't get me wrong but

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.350 
a great design don't get me wrong but
that<00:01:58.250> then<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.460> seemed<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.729> little<00:01:59.880> bit<00:02:00.090> why<00:02:00.299> to

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
that then the seemed a little bit why to

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.020 
that then the seemed a little bit why to
wrap<00:02:00.689> your<00:02:00.810> fingers<00:02:00.960> around<00:02:01.170> also<00:02:02.070> quite<00:02:03.000> a

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
wrap your fingers around also quite a

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.810 
wrap your fingers around also quite a
chunky<00:02:03.479> fork<00:02:03.950> so<00:02:04.950> we<00:02:05.189> just<00:02:05.369> lost<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.670> bit<00:02:05.790> of

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
chunky fork so we just lost a bit of

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.630 
chunky fork so we just lost a bit of
weight<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.360> it's<00:02:06.600> been<00:02:06.719> dieting<00:02:07.459> now<00:02:08.459> this

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
weight of it it's been dieting now this

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.680 
weight of it it's been dieting now this
is<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.789> new<00:02:09.030> one<00:02:10.009> add<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.760> Andals<00:02:12.090> about<00:02:12.330> five

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
is the new one add the Andals about five

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.970 
is the new one add the Andals about five
to<00:02:12.900> 10<00:02:13.080> mil<00:02:13.290> longer

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
to 10 mil longer

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.490 
to 10 mil longer
a<00:02:14.069> lot<00:02:15.030> slimmer<00:02:15.390> so<00:02:15.720> when<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:15.959> grip<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.349> can

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
a lot slimmer so when you grip you can

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.110 
a lot slimmer so when you grip you can
really<00:02:16.709> wrap<00:02:17.430> your<00:02:17.580> fingers<00:02:17.700> around<00:02:17.909> the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
really wrap your fingers around the

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.660 
really wrap your fingers around the
handle<00:02:18.420> like<00:02:18.450> so<00:02:19.069> it's<00:02:20.069> to<00:02:20.159> be<00:02:20.250> shot<00:02:20.430> in<00:02:20.580> the

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
handle like so it's to be shot in the

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.619 
handle like so it's to be shot in the
fork<00:02:20.909> and<00:02:21.090> fundraise<00:02:21.799> feels<00:02:22.799> great<00:02:23.129> a<00:02:23.629> lot

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
fork and fundraise feels great a lot

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.570 
fork and fundraise feels great a lot
lighter<00:02:24.870> than<00:02:25.049> the<00:02:25.260> other<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.680> lot<00:02:26.129> better<00:02:26.190> feel

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
lighter than the other a lot better feel

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.330 
lighter than the other a lot better feel
in<00:02:26.819> my<00:02:26.940> opinion<00:02:27.530> as<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.920> probably<00:02:29.129> noticed

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
in my opinion as you probably noticed

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.850 
in my opinion as you probably noticed
again<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.879> bands<00:02:30.090> have<00:02:30.209> come<00:02:30.420> folded<00:02:30.870> so

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
again the bands have come folded so

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.229 
again the bands have come folded so
therefore<00:02:32.250> rocking<00:02:32.489> out<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.730> gap<00:02:32.940> in<00:02:33.150> between

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
therefore rocking out the gap in between

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.390 
therefore rocking out the gap in between
the<00:02:33.540> forks<00:02:33.870> wider<00:02:34.110> while<00:02:34.799> still<00:02:35.040> having<00:02:35.129> the

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
the forks wider while still having the

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.809 
the forks wider while still having the
same<00:02:36.709> outside<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.890> outside<00:02:37.920> which<00:02:38.489> was<00:02:38.700> the

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
same outside to outside which was the

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.300 
same outside to outside which was the
old<00:02:38.970> demon<00:02:39.360> so<00:02:39.720> it's<00:02:40.019> no<00:02:40.170> bigger<00:02:40.470> except<00:02:41.220> you

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
old demon so it's no bigger except you

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.569 
old demon so it's no bigger except you
get<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.459> wider<00:02:41.730> gap<00:02:42.060> in<00:02:42.750> between<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.230> fork

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
get a wider gap in between the fork

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.789 
get a wider gap in between the fork
there<00:02:44.579> my<00:02:45.180> opinion<00:02:45.599> feels<00:02:45.959> better<00:02:46.230> I'm<00:02:46.530> sure

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
there my opinion feels better I'm sure

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.069 
there my opinion feels better I'm sure
once<00:02:47.069> you<00:02:47.160> try<00:02:47.370> it<00:02:47.400> you'll<00:02:47.579> look<00:02:47.730> great<00:02:48.049> so<00:02:49.049> I
