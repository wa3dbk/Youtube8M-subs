00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
way if you prefer can be done this way

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.420 
way if you prefer can be done this way
as<00:03:25.980> well<00:03:26.280> but<00:03:27.320> if<00:03:28.320> this<00:03:28.560> card<00:03:28.950> of<00:03:29.100> course<00:03:29.130> was

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
as well but if this card of course was

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.560 
as well but if this card of course was
included<00:03:29.970> by<00:03:30.440> speaking<00:03:32.000> if<00:03:33.000> you<00:03:33.180> lose<00:03:33.390> the

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
included by speaking if you lose the

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.840 
included by speaking if you lose the
card<00:03:34.190> you<00:03:35.190> can<00:03:35.310> use<00:03:35.430> any<00:03:35.700> name<00:03:36.450> card<00:03:37.459> or<00:03:38.459> any

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
card you can use any name card or any

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.199 
card you can use any name card or any
perhaps<00:03:39.420> of<00:03:39.540> credit<00:03:39.870> card<00:03:40.190> feels<00:03:41.190> which<00:03:41.820> you

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
perhaps of credit card feels which you

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.120 
perhaps of credit card feels which you
should<00:03:42.390> probably<00:03:42.600> watch<00:03:42.870> as<00:03:43.019> well<00:03:43.200> but<00:03:44.070> I

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
should probably watch as well but I

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.229 
should probably watch as well but I
guess<00:03:44.310> this<00:03:44.630> this<00:03:45.630> one<00:03:45.930> works<00:03:46.850> because<00:03:47.850> it's<00:03:48.209> a

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
guess this this one works because it's a

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.070 
guess this this one works because it's a
bit<00:03:48.360> too<00:03:48.510> long<00:03:48.750> you<00:03:49.050> can<00:03:49.200> see<00:03:50.750> so<00:03:51.750> I'll<00:03:51.930> just

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
bit too long you can see so I'll just

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.690 
bit too long you can see so I'll just
give<00:03:52.260> up<00:03:52.380> on<00:03:52.500> that<00:03:52.650> and<00:03:52.920> use<00:03:53.310> this<00:03:54.090> card<00:03:55.670> now<00:03:56.670> I

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
give up on that and use this card now I

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.060 
give up on that and use this card now I
like<00:03:56.910> this<00:03:57.140> champagne<00:03:58.140> gold<00:03:58.440> color<00:03:58.739> which

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
like this champagne gold color which

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.300 
like this champagne gold color which
matches<00:03:59.459> well<00:04:00.209> with<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.810> gold<00:04:01.380> iPhone<00:04:01.980> and<00:04:02.250> I

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
matches well with the gold iPhone and I

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.600 
matches well with the gold iPhone and I
have<00:04:03.590> and<00:04:04.590> I<00:04:04.680> think<00:04:04.890> on<00:04:04.950> the<00:04:05.070> whole<00:04:05.100> was<00:04:05.340> a<00:04:05.370> very

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
have and I think on the whole was a very

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.150 
have and I think on the whole was a very
beautiful<00:04:05.760> case<00:04:06.380> as<00:04:07.380> you<00:04:07.530> can<00:04:07.590> see<00:04:07.800> the<00:04:07.920> lip

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
beautiful case as you can see the lip

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.240 
beautiful case as you can see the lip
here<00:04:08.370> comes<00:04:08.880> up<00:04:09.090> just<00:04:09.480> enough<00:04:09.870> to<00:04:10.680> protect<00:04:11.040> the

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
here comes up just enough to protect the

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.240 
here comes up just enough to protect the
this<00:04:11.610> screen<00:04:12.320> right<00:04:13.320> if<00:04:13.500> you<00:04:13.769> drop<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.070> phone

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
this screen right if you drop the phone

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.640 
this screen right if you drop the phone
this<00:04:14.400> way<00:04:14.720> but<00:04:15.720> not<00:04:15.870> too<00:04:16.109> much<00:04:16.260> because<00:04:16.440> I

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
this way but not too much because I

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.500 
this way but not too much because I
personally<00:04:16.980> do<00:04:17.250> not<00:04:17.280> like<00:04:17.669> the<00:04:18.000> lips<00:04:18.239> which

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
personally do not like the lips which

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.529 
personally do not like the lips which
come<00:04:18.750> up<00:04:18.900> here<00:04:19.590> too<00:04:19.830> much<00:04:19.979> it<00:04:20.400> blocks<00:04:21.210> up<00:04:21.390> too

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
come up here too much it blocks up too

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.620
