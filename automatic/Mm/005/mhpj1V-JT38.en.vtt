00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.940
 Convenience of putting a digit in a name 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.160
 digital to measure the voltage 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.340
 battery it is already mounted armed 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.350
 illegal and I'll show you how 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.480
 You can do something very simple. 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.130
 're a glass to glass to guard awaits 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.349
 a system with a little foot for you 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.630
 support on the dashboard of the car where 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.149
 you want 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.300
 here we have a source connected to a 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:40.079
 power plug 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:42.950
 a wire behind is turned on for attention 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:47.850
 detailed with this source it gives you a 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:53.600
 panel showing that she is double with 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.600
 12 goals but she was not knocking 15 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.920
 procedures for how to do this 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.440
 but to go back there 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.660
 this measure the attention of your battery 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.949
 to stay connected there when the 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.630
 battery is low 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.310
 there is a glass that will assemble a panel 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.040
 depending on the position of your car to 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.729
 to decorate looks great as 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:19.650
 You're seeing how the son is here. 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:24.330
 Look at you buy for $ 8 is a glass for 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:27.270
 the name and the tension nothing less nothing less 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.640
 that a good team within this framework that 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.860
 you buy for five reais 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.900
 I think in the free market contract is by 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.060
 less than I bought for eight nine or 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.799
 Ten I do not know, here's a child. 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.710
 Positive negative your kids here you 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.930
 will the installation be and how I 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.170
 I put to put learning to do can 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.720
 stay like it's here it's simple it's going 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.250
 fit perfectly into this opening 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:57.600

 It was really cool, it was always there always. 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.790
 always creative intelligence you can 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.810
 come back here after a stone on the walls 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:11.700
 acrylic to make the cover here 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:18.330
 here's a little hand 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:21.319
 to be able to do to protect but 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:28.170
 even more women in me one 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:31.349
 reality has been found so far we 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.780
 we have one an acrylic cap 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.739
 transparent I place here step 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.140
 old man right? 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.750
 It's cooler, even more so now it's just going 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.780
 stay where you stay here he already 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:46.110
 moth caught the wires can be passed 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.260
 by the hole you have here and as a focus 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.209
 car installation is here with you 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.739
 will have a positive negative wire 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.519
 You'll have to find out what I did. 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:59.280
 I have it in my car is where you get it. 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.769
 You'll have to get on the system. 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.360
 the car ignition when you turn 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.950
 av 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.810
 When you come to know how to turn the panel on 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.110
 of the car item that already playing with us 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.880
 down here to be able to connect because you can not 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.070
 connected directly to the battery if 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.010
 we had here inside the battery 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.799
 it will go negative to turn the 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.280
 car will be there business there and this is 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.530
 cool 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.569
 despite being a low consumption will not 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.209
 have trouble loading 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.980
 It's not cool that you're attached to a 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.980
 car you have to pull your ignition 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.739
 of your ignition system pulling a wire 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.980
 side of your diffuser system lived 16 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.319
 and find out where your key is. 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.200
 ignition for when you turn the key 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.780
 of your car will automatically turn on 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.840
 the entire panel and goes automatically 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.810
 climb on your last and betray you 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.290
 will be aware of when it is low and 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:59.250
 How was your battery charged? 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:02.010
 above 12.5 preferably 13 volts 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.380
 preferably three flights is ideal for 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:08.250
 do the car will come if it is below 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:10.079
 12 twelve 12 volts comma 1 12 billion 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.500
 It's already a little complicated, it's going to 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:16.859
 suffered to become the ideal is 12.5 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.049
 preferably 13/3 battery pack 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.410
 have you been measuring and then you will have notion 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.630
 with this little gadget here that we 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.080
 we just created and redo the 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.790
 empty cope slaps you save the name 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.890
 fit the moment here and how you do not 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.830
 got a name on the cheapest system costs 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.810
 less than ten reais what is this fear of 2 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.910
 spin tension you fit 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.280
 perfectly here as it is 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.150
 was then material to assemble a 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.090
 cup 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.520
 I leave here a glass of monomer and a 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.220
 square altimeter that fits 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.980
 perfectly there that he rode could 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.710
 put it on the dashboard on the 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.810
 panel a console anywhere is the

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:10.210
 double-sided tape there you attach and will stay 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:13.210
