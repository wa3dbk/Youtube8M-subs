 according to the nintendo has always offered

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.070
 time frame

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.260
 videogames the axiom is that the software 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.270
 drives the hardware and that's what 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.460
 we have seen in our more than 30 years 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.470
 of experience in this category when 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.840
 is asked about the ability of wiki 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.449
 to generate when the years have passed 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.699
 the same nostalgic passion that others 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.430
 consoles of the company films 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.740
 Amy replies that it is definitely what 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.750
 wait or at the end is something that depends 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.030
 of nintendo's ability to have 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.789
 unique and attractive experiences that 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:17.050
 endure in time in the same 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:18.640
 article the analyst lewis guard and dc it 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.220
 shows positive to the future of the 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.170
 company and believes that will can compete 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.800
 with the rival consoles even if it is not 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.869
 the leader of the generation walt believes that 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.960
 nintendo will continue to bet on their 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:35.110
 own sagas and most popular characters 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.170
 and they say it's not guilt nintendo no 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.030
 put these if you look at wii 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.740
 the first the very original there are several 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.840
 Mario games that were launched 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.430
 first years of life that still 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.280
 they are selling well at the end of the cycle 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.880
 wii commercial although wards denies that 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.310
 with you 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.619
 can lead the competition if you believe 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.470
 that can stay in it and rival 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:59.600
 with playstation 4 and xbox war and says that 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.690
 if they had asked him a year ago 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.370
 I had said no but now it indicates 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.710
 that is seeing signs of hope and of 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.110
 recovery by the console and 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.540
 it's true because the truth has all been 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.660
 said many elbows are coming out 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.790
 now recently mario party 10 and 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.820
 good and this week the Mario versus 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.330
 2 and the truth is that he is going is not 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:26.150
 so two games as important apart from 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.480
 mario cartridge super smash bros etc etc 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.790
 because they are greater than 2 which is one of the 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.160
 graduates also from the console as they are 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.040
 games that are worth a lot to 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.959
 the console so this is the future that 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.720
 is expected from analysts see a great 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:45.140
 future for wii and especially for games 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.390
 exclusive to the nintendo itself that goes to 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.580
 rival not to sell to rival very 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.740
 well and it's going to sell really well 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.180
 so thanks for being there the ecc and 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.540

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.540
