00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.559
 the first tour we made was 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.070
 towards the mangroves everything here is 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.750
 totally on foot knowing also 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.670
 some of the issues that beings 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.830
 they handle but that later we're going 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.930
 to talk and in fact we will have two 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.630
 programs about this visit the 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.520
 mangroves we told them the vegetation that 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.100
 is what it implies for life in 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.770
 our planet what is the purpose of caring 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.050
 all this we are going to listen to Joaquin in 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:42.320
 the explanation people are the mangrove 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.210
 the gray or black mangrove 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.780
 they have the social characteristic 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.880
 the conca they used because with a 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.420
 filtration process 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.870
 The mangrove accumulates salt crystals in 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.870
 leaves 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.750
 and want to try some 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.460
 the things 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.460
 so he knows nothing more 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.600
 in this case we are in an estuary and in 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.299
 There is a mangrove estuary 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.630
 and there are mangroves the first ones that are 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.400
 coastal 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.920
 this May that we have here this is the 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.720
 second type of magic that we're going to 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.550
 talk is the one with the most green leaves 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.300
 back characteristic another very hot flush 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.280
 green is the red mangrove and there is 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.990
 advance I'll tell you a little bit 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.730
 more on the question of why mangle 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.450
 red and what do you mind doing this guy 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.490
 week is as important as the 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.050
 coral areas for the protection of 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.690
 marine species 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.700
 it was possible to visit the mangrove area 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.470
 on foot because the water level is very 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.080
 low at the time we were 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.050
 there but later this reaches a couple 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.130
 of meters and it is very complicated to move 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.420
 swimming simply by the amount of 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.670
 plants that are in place already after 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.520
 boats are needed of course 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.910
 to be able to do it and enjoy what 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.490
 we did is awesome 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.180
 know the fauna flora and especially 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.890
 how important it is to us 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.720
 friends of sound author we are here in 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.610
 the shark island we continue in the area 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.950
 of the mangrove already with many explanations 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.440
 that has given us joaquin about what 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.060
 what is this flora of this place the 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.430
 importance for the 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.530
 conservation of course of many 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.480
 things of a lot of life and not only of 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.730
 animals and other plants but also 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.710
 from ours we know that the zones 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.290
 of mangroves are buffer zones 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.930
 for natural disasters and also 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.540
 they are places 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.849
 and are taken advantage of by animals 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.609
 small to be able to grow to be able 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.469
 reproduce to generate a lot of life 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:34.810
 something very interesting that we 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:36.849
 We recommend doing this and it is very 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.659
 important that they bring their children to 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:42.340
 their children to the students of the 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:44.469
 different schools that can come to 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.780
 learn about life in this place 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:49.569
 also in a mystical place like is the 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:53.530
 shark island so that they learn to 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:55.419
 keep life in all aspects 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.769
 so that 's the invitation that they 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:58.389
 we are going to continue to know a 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.549
 little more from this area of the island of 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:03.069
 shark we would miss a lot for 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.169
 speak we know apart nothing more than what 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.269
 there is here but we are going today 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:08.919

 Entertaining here looking for jaivas

 Well, if we come to a place where 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:08.610
 we knew 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.610
 and seeing asylums 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.640
 so they told us that you 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:17.420
 They are tourism students , so we are 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:20.620
 of the eighth semester of the race 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.620
 heard about this place 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.420
 and you do not see mentioned you have to 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.490
 know is to accept what makes 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:30.460
 tourism times is very strong 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.680
 everything everything that is activities of 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.540
 sustainable tourism and therefore we wanted 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.280
 come to see and to promote it also 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.610
 you have to see and invite people who 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:42.039
 come more too 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:46.030
 it is an environment as he mentioned 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:49.400
 the guide because we're running out 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:51.740
 several animals in their happy habitat 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.230
 right now we are the ones here 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.970
 the invaders where it is here is but 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.350
 this imagine that also in the school to 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.420
 you have already studied many 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.210
 heads 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.830
 of ecosystems not of the units 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.410
 to see now is the time to see that 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.729
 they learned in what they heard from that 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.699
 moment then we see that the mangroves 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:12.300
 they are reserves for animals that 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:14.600
 support 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:17.590
 treat down 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.590
 the dilemma 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.760
 good that we are going to study and say then 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.350
 that thrill and I like it a lot too 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.540

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:32.070
 reservation that is from the shark island 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.070
 a greeting 

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:11.960
 Bleeding strong who is nothing more than 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:14.280
 one may arrive sooner or later but 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.930
 we are on the island in polecat has arrived 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.180
 the time to go to eat is something too 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:21.150
 very important because it further while still 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:23.660
 more things so right now we go back to 

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.660
 the shore
