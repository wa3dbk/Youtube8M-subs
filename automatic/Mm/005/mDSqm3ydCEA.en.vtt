 I want to introduce you this jacket 12-1 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.570

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.180
 This jacket is made and designed to 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.760
 those who make an expedition or the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.810
 who do work in a very 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.680
 high where there is a lot of rain or where 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.680
 it's quite cold 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.290
 I want to present the details of this 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:45.360
 jacket this jacket was made 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:48.870
 in a 50% waterproof fabric it has a 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.930
 inner lining that is fiber 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:57.230
 techniques as I come here 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:01:00.390
 This technical fiber allows us to give warmth 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.120
 and before this we have an anger 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.220
 internal 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.879
 internally in this way it is done 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.879
 of micro cola 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.020
 as you will see in the external part of 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.140
 this jacket on the front 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.030
 top we have a pocket 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.780
 very elegant very special 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:26.229
 this in case it allows us to take a 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:30.840
 portable device or a very radio 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:34.460
 small so we can have mom 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:39.560
 and this pocket as you see it here 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:42.049
 It is built and engraved with an art 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.930
 that with blazer technology in fact the 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:47.330
 closures are waterproof as you can see 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.299
 we also have pink those who wear 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.150
 our own brand this allows us 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:56.149
 this is being stressed does not allow us 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:59.140
 when we are at a height and they are 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:02.540
 Freeze your hand and to catch the 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.690
 looks is that allows us in this type 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.450
 of ornament more details of this house is 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.180
 on the bottom of this jacket 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.730
 we have the side pockets very 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.330
 wide and very safe also has the 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.330
 same technology 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.110
 and very sure not also that we have more 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.600
 of this jacket 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.490
 the jacket has a system of 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.490
 regulator in the part of the sleeves 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.670
 this regulates us to the need that 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.800
 we can have and that we never 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.850
 let's fail because it's made of a 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.870
 Very soft and elastic plastic material 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.870
 then this will never fail you 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.650
 we also have in the central part of 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.430
 The front part 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:55.459

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.579
 you will never fail 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.840
 this jacket also has a very cut 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.840
 special since 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.310
 We are in any activity or 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.310
 we raise the arm 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.890
 this is never going to sue us for that 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.590
 this has a good cut and a very design 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.620
 elegant apart from that we have in the 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.800
 part of down regulators these are the 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:30.540
 rubber and an elastic cord is for 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:34.110

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.440

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.270
