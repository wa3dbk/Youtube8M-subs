00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.069
 here we are again in the kitchen I want you 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.660
 present here I want to present yes 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.570
 I want to let you know a little about 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.490
 almonds he advised me some time ago 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.349
 he had suggested names long ago 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.099
 friend entered a recipe and then me it 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.770
 I want to propose 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.210
 I tell you immediately about almonds every month 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.220
 many because more than a total of 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.680
 then I do n't eat almonds and then 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.410
 add as many doses as I like 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.599
 I'm not there because I have an eye 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.380
 so you better or worse orient yourself 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.090
 in short according to your needs a 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.980
 some sense you also see a little bit 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.230
 how much I put in the video but here 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.870
 ninth month the companies will write to you 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.730
 almost never the doses because I go a lot to 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.010
 eye said this nothing 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.930
 this is what you can also add 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.539
 other types of vegetables I put 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.579
 only what you will see because I was 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.250
 just that kind of vegetables 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.260
 in short, do some vobis as you do 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.730
 he says and so I leave you with 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.920
 this recipe is certainly not 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.000
 just typically summer with the warm that 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.270
 makes mom my 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.949
 but we'll do it tell me your thing 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.720
 think how you do it 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.790
 give me some suggestions why 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.070
 you know that I am always welcome to 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.119
 know your recipes and goodbye 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.119
 so I greet you with this 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.940
 then use all kinds of 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:29.610
 vegetables that you have I will use anyway 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:32.920
 of celery a spring onion carrots and 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:37.270
 pepper will then serve us meat from 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:41.110
 chicken cut into cubes like this 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.940
 almonds I cut emitted from 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.670
 pier already for a quarter of an hour 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.710
 even better if you purchased them 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.720
 I only found them peeled 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.149
 I took these here and also keep them at 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.090
 so I give up a little bit later dual disc 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:59.460
 will serve our unfailing maizena a 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.460
 bit of soy sauce and sugar 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.269
 then I put the repetition of 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.599
 chicken strips you see here I have 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:14.340
 put in a bowl now add 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:20.910
 the corn starch I melted 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:24.060
 with a little water I add one 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.890
 onion a little soy sauce better 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.670
 again if you have some sauce 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.640
 oysters that I finished I put a little 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.830
 of soy sauce mix and leave 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.190
 marinate for about twenty minutes 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:42.150
 in short, for a while we leave it like this 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.760
 then repost to cook hi that 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.519
 dark because using the work then for 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.769
 cook this dish 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:54.000
 I found an old recipe 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:56.640
 he had taught my Chinese friend and I 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.810
 I'm experiencing it a little bit like then 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.170
 I have now put luke warm up add 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.170
 a little oil 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:18.510
 Milan 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:24.829
 not so much now with chopsticks I take 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.829
 the chicken I had left to macerate 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.300
 and that different memory let's say 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.860
 eighty percent world to be 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.450
 perfectly account 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.450
 you have to buy it all the way like this 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.980
 here then very removed and now come 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.640
 engines of a man 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.640
 quite right 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.930
 not only 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.760
 practice things like that 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.380
 if you like them there 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:26.820
 cautious and shaped like a turin I also did 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:30.340
 the tutorial cry nights 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.980
 you want but if you are more on the side but also 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.580
 prettier 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.509
 all of us now play 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.509
 soy sauce 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.229
 today 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.360
 we put 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.520
 still a purchasing power 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:27.380
 safe machines to make that ball 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.330
 when does stellina transport of 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.860
 slightly to all of you just frustrates 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:35.180
 of the Chinese technical group 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.400
 what we do we wait 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.580
 always your cornstarch loose 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:44.439
 in cold water 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.439
 and finally your almonds 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.650
 do we arouse all is the pot 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.650
 ready 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.199
 now that we've done everything 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.740
 in the video it looks very liquid instead 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:04.150
 like almost nothing 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.150
 you are very very dense instead 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.310
 liquid strokes girls a lot 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.810
 very mushy and now it really is 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.990
 ready 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:18.070
 chapter maybe with that 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:20.430
 white rice also boasts simple 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.430
 enjoy your meal
