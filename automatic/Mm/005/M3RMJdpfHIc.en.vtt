and 512 for this partition can I do more

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.149 
and 512 for this partition can I do more
than<00:01:28.390> that<00:01:28.570> and<00:01:28.810> that's<00:01:29.380> a<00:01:29.530> good<00:01:29.679> question

I'll show you how to do that but let's
go<00:01:32.289> through<00:01:32.469> how<00:01:32.590> to<00:01:32.619> do<00:01:32.799> this<00:01:32.950> using<00:01:33.520> the<00:01:33.729> user

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
go through how to do this using the user

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.499 
go through how to do this using the user
interface<00:01:34.390> first<00:01:34.780> so<00:01:35.439> we'll<00:01:35.590> say<00:01:35.740> 512<00:01:36.310> say<00:01:37.119> ok

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
interface first so we'll say 512 say ok

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.929 
interface first so we'll say 512 say ok

swap partition some don't so I usually

swap partition some don't so I usually

go between 32 and 64 Meg but I don't do

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
anything bigger than that just because

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
that doesn't answer our viewers

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.670 
that doesn't answer our viewers
questions<00:02:15.610> so<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:15.820> do<00:02:16.150> that<00:02:16.180> let's<00:02:17.170> come<00:02:17.590> over

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
questions so to do that let's come over

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.190 
questions so to do that let's come over
here<00:02:17.800> instead<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.900> reboot<00:02:19.900> into<00:02:20.080> recovery

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
here instead and reboot into recovery

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.870 
here instead and reboot into recovery
and<00:02:20.800> we'll<00:02:20.920> do<00:02:21.070> this<00:02:21.250> manually<00:02:23.490> are<00:02:24.490> we<00:02:24.730> sure

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
and we'll do this manually are we sure

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.740 
and we'll do this manually are we sure
we<00:02:25.000> want<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:25.240> yes<00:02:26.050> we're<00:02:26.470> sure<00:02:26.500> we<00:02:26.860> want<00:02:27.070> to

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
we want to yes we're sure we want to

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.970 
we want to yes we're sure we want to
rebooting<00:02:28.750> into<00:02:28.930> recovery<00:02:29.200> this<00:02:29.560> way<00:02:29.740> is

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
rebooting into recovery this way is

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.470 
rebooting into recovery this way is
quite<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.340> bit<00:02:30.490> faster<00:02:30.940> because<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:31.270> don't

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
quite a bit faster because you don't

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.440 
quite a bit faster because you don't
have<00:02:31.690> to<00:02:31.870> do<00:02:31.960> the<00:02:32.200> whole<00:02:32.380> finger<00:02:33.450> gymnastics

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
have to do the whole finger gymnastics

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.810 
have to do the whole finger gymnastics
to<00:02:34.600> be<00:02:34.690> able<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.900> get<00:02:35.200> into<00:02:35.680> recovery<00:02:36.280> mode<00:02:36.700> you

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
to be able to get into recovery mode you

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.400 
to be able to get into recovery mode you
don't<00:02:36.970> have<00:02:37.060> to<00:02:37.150> remember<00:02:37.330> that<00:02:37.540> what<00:02:38.110> that<00:02:38.260> is

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
don't have to remember that what that is

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.270 
don't have to remember that what that is
because<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:40.390> app<00:02:40.930> itself<00:02:41.350> will<00:02:42.070> just

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
because the app itself will just

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.220 
because the app itself will just
basically<00:02:42.430> say<00:02:43.150> hey<00:02:43.360> reboot<00:02:43.990> into<00:02:44.140> recovery

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
basically say hey reboot into recovery

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.890 
basically say hey reboot into recovery
and<00:02:44.680> it<00:02:45.040> does<00:02:45.220> that<00:02:45.460> and<00:02:45.610> you<00:02:46.450> can<00:02:46.600> see<00:02:46.720> here

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
and it does that and you can see here

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.840 
and it does that and you can see here
now<00:02:47.020> it's<00:02:47.200> done<00:02:47.410> that<00:02:47.590> so<00:02:48.070> let's<00:02:48.340> go<00:02:48.460> ahead<00:02:48.580> and

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
now it's done that so let's go ahead and

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.870 
now it's done that so let's go ahead and
come<00:02:49.060> down<00:02:49.090> here<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:52.080> advanced<00:02:53.080> and<00:02:53.880> in

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
come down here to advanced and in

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.780 
come down here to advanced and in
advanced<00:02:55.360> we<00:02:55.480> have<00:02:55.660> partition<00:02:56.410> sdcard<00:02:57.040> so

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
advanced we have partition sdcard so

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.510 
advanced we have partition sdcard so
we'll<00:02:57.970> select<00:02:58.180> that<00:02:58.450> says<00:02:59.290> ext<00:02:59.860> size<00:03:00.040> now<00:03:00.340> I've

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
we'll select that says ext size now I've

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.720 
we'll select that says ext size now I've
got<00:03:00.700> sizes<00:03:01.150> from<00:03:01.450> 128<00:03:02.080> all<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.710> way<00:03:02.800> up<00:03:02.980> to<00:03:03.190> 4

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
got sizes from 128 all the way up to 4

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.450 
got sizes from 128 all the way up to 4
gig<00:03:04.030> so<00:03:04.570> that's<00:03:05.050> how<00:03:05.230> you<00:03:05.290> can<00:03:05.500> get<00:03:05.680> around<00:03:05.800> the

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
gig so that's how you can get around the

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.270 
gig so that's how you can get around the
limitations<00:03:07.270> of<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:08.140> UI<00:03:08.380> I'm<00:03:08.950> going<00:03:09.160> to<00:03:09.220> go

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
limitations of the UI I'm going to go

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.210 
limitations of the UI I'm going to go
ahead<00:03:09.400> and<00:03:09.700> set<00:03:09.940> this<00:03:10.120> to<00:03:10.540> a<00:03:10.990> thousand<00:03:11.890> 24

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
ahead and set this to a thousand 24

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.030 
ahead and set this to a thousand 24
megabytes<00:03:12.580> or<00:03:12.790> one<00:03:13.240> gigabyte<00:03:13.750> now<00:03:14.620> you<00:03:14.680> want

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
megabytes or one gigabyte now you want

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.110 
megabytes or one gigabyte now you want
to<00:03:15.100> make<00:03:15.190> sure<00:03:15.220> that<00:03:15.400> this<00:03:15.520> is<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:15.760> right<00:03:15.880> size

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
to make sure that this is the right size

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.730 
to make sure that this is the right size
for<00:03:16.150> your<00:03:16.450> card<00:03:16.660> if<00:03:16.780> you've<00:03:16.900> got<00:03:17.050> a<00:03:17.080> 1<00:03:17.290> gig<00:03:17.470> card

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
for your card if you've got a 1 gig card

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.050 
for your card if you've got a 1 gig card
you<00:03:17.860> probably<00:03:18.130> don't<00:03:18.340> want<00:03:18.460> to<00:03:18.520> do<00:03:18.610> this<00:03:18.760> in

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
you probably don't want to do this in

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.240 
you probably don't want to do this in
this<00:03:19.420> case<00:03:19.600> I've<00:03:19.780> got<00:03:19.930> a<00:03:19.960> 16<00:03:20.560> gig<00:03:20.800> card<00:03:21.070> in

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
this case I've got a 16 gig card in

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.980 
this case I've got a 16 gig card in
there<00:03:21.460> so<00:03:22.150> I'm<00:03:22.240> going<00:03:22.330> to<00:03:22.420> select<00:03:22.570> that<00:03:22.750> my

there so I'm going to select that my

there so I'm going to select that my

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.720 
swap size I'm going to go ahead and make
64<00:03:25.300> megabytes<00:03:25.990> and<00:03:26.320> then<00:03:27.070> down<00:03:27.280> here<00:03:27.490> you<00:03:27.580> can

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
have been out there so this makes it

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.070 
have been out there so this makes it
very<00:04:31.040> very<00:04:31.400> easy<00:04:31.730> you're<00:04:32.600> a<00:04:32.630> little<00:04:32.960> bit

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
very very easy you're a little bit

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.260 
very very easy you're a little bit
limited<00:04:33.440> on<00:04:33.650> your<00:04:33.860> configuration<00:04:34.610> but<00:04:34.940> once

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
limited on your configuration but once

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.030 
limited on your configuration but once
you<00:04:35.390> drop<00:04:35.600> down<00:04:35.840> into<00:04:36.050> recovery<00:04:36.380> mode<00:04:36.590> rather

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
you drop down into recovery mode rather

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.680 
you drop down into recovery mode rather
than<00:04:37.220> doing<00:04:37.430> it<00:04:37.610> through<00:04:37.760> the<00:04:37.820> UI<00:04:38.060> it<00:04:38.420> becomes

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
than doing it through the UI it becomes

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.010 
than doing it through the UI it becomes
very<00:04:38.990> powerful<00:04:39.230> a<00:04:39.740> lot<00:04:40.580> of<00:04:40.700> those<00:04:41.020> limitations

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
very powerful a lot of those limitations

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.320 
very powerful a lot of those limitations
aren't<00:04:42.500> such<00:04:42.860> a<00:04:42.890> big<00:04:43.130> deal<00:04:43.340> anymore<00:04:43.670> because

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
aren't such a big deal anymore because

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.240 
aren't such a big deal anymore because
you<00:04:44.600> have<00:04:44.780> more<00:04:44.990> options<00:04:45.440> to<00:04:45.590> choose<00:04:45.650> from

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
you have more options to choose from

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.710 
you have more options to choose from
so<00:04:46.520> really<00:04:46.910> really<00:04:47.030> nice<00:04:47.360> this<00:04:47.660> is

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
so really really nice this is

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.020
