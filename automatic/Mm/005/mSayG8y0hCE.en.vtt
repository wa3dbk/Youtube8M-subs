00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
any Pokemon the bike for anything code

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.119 
any Pokemon the bike for anything code
and<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:38.129> cloning<00:00:38.520> pokemon<00:00:38.969> code<00:00:39.950> so<00:00:40.950> we'll

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
and the cloning pokemon code so we'll

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.639 
and the cloning pokemon code so we'll
start<00:00:41.430> with<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.700> teach<00:00:41.879> any<00:00:42.120> TM<00:00:42.690> or<00:00:42.960> HM<00:00:43.410> code

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
start with the teach any TM or HM code

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.470 
start with the teach any TM or HM code
and<00:00:45.320> a<00:00:46.320> good<00:00:46.530> little<00:00:46.710> add-on<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.610> put<00:00:48.270> with

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
and a good little add-on to put with

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.880 
and a good little add-on to put with
this<00:00:48.690> code<00:00:48.960> would<00:00:49.200> be<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> all<00:00:49.620> TMS<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.430> hms

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
this code would be the all TMS and hms

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:59.990 
this code would be the all TMS and hms
so<00:00:52.890> let's<00:00:53.100> start<00:00:57.920> all<00:00:58.920> right<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.579> this<00:00:59.730> code

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
so let's start all right so this code

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.470 
so let's start all right so this code
works<00:01:00.359> anywhere<00:01:01.020> on<00:01:01.350> any<00:01:01.829> Pokemon<00:01:02.670> I'm<00:01:03.059> just

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.449 
ashlar and surf all right so for the
next<00:02:50.950> code<00:02:51.430> I'll<00:02:51.790> be<00:02:51.970> doing<00:02:53.010> this<00:02:54.010> is<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.280> bike

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
next code I'll be doing this is the bike

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.180 
next code I'll be doing this is the bike
through<00:02:54.730> anything<00:02:55.000> code<00:02:55.799> now<00:02:56.799> I'm<00:02:56.980> sure

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
through anything code now I'm sure

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.000 
through anything code now I'm sure
you're<00:02:57.340> wondering<00:02:57.400> right<00:02:58.120> now<00:02:58.680> what<00:02:59.680> is<00:02:59.829> the

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
you're wondering right now what is the

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.860 
you're wondering right now what is the
difference<00:03:00.459> between<00:03:00.549> the<00:03:00.940> run<00:03:01.150> anywhere<00:03:01.569> code

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
difference between the run anywhere code

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.380 
difference between the run anywhere code
and<00:03:02.319> the<00:03:02.950> walk<00:03:03.130> anywhere<00:03:03.549> code<00:03:03.849> and<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.209> bike

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
and the walk anywhere code and the bike

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.890 
and the walk anywhere code and the bike
through<00:03:04.630> anything<00:03:04.870> code<00:03:05.400> well<00:03:06.690> there<00:03:07.690> are<00:03:07.870> a

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
through anything code well there are a

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.750 
through anything code well there are a
good<00:03:08.319> couple<00:03:08.560> of<00:03:08.739> differences<00:03:09.099> you<00:03:09.400> can<00:03:09.549> turn

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
good couple of differences you can turn

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.670 
good couple of differences you can turn
on<00:03:09.880> your<00:03:10.000> bike<00:03:10.269> with<00:03:10.299> the<00:03:10.690> walk<00:03:10.900> anywhere<00:03:11.410> code

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
on your bike with the walk anywhere code

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.300 
on your bike with the walk anywhere code
and<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.069> run<00:03:12.220> anywhere<00:03:12.609> code<00:03:13.799> but<00:03:14.799> the<00:03:15.040> bikes

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
and the run anywhere code but the bikes

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.910 
and the run anywhere code but the bikes
or<00:03:15.519> anything<00:03:15.880> code<00:03:16.090> works<00:03:16.389> really<00:03:16.930> well<00:03:17.109> you

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
or anything code works really well you

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.750 
or anything code works really well you
can<00:03:18.130> run<00:03:18.430> walk<00:03:18.819> or<00:03:19.120> bike<00:03:19.540> with<00:03:19.780> it<00:03:19.989> and<00:03:20.760> it

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
can run walk or bike with it and it

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.360 
can run walk or bike with it and it
doesn't<00:03:22.299> freeze<00:03:22.540> up<00:03:22.900> on<00:03:23.079> you<00:03:23.350> as<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:24.160> run

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
doesn't freeze up on you as the run

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.729 
doesn't freeze up on you as the run
anywhere<00:03:24.819> code<00:03:25.120> occasionally<00:03:25.930> does<00:03:26.139> I've

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
anywhere code occasionally does I've

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.949 
anywhere code occasionally does I've
done<00:03:27.280> it<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.489> couple<00:03:27.519> times<00:03:27.819> my<00:03:28.389> game<00:03:28.660> just

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
done it a couple times my game just

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.099 
done it a couple times my game just
froze<00:03:29.230> on<00:03:29.440> me<00:03:29.470> and<00:03:30.540> this<00:03:31.540> code<00:03:31.780> will<00:03:31.900> not

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
froze on me and this code will not

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.890 
froze on me and this code will not
freeze<00:03:32.410> up<00:03:32.620> on<00:03:32.769> you<00:03:33.069> and<00:03:33.370> it's<00:03:34.060> just<00:03:34.359> really

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
freeze up on you and it's just really

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.050 
freeze up on you and it's just really
good<00:03:35.260> i<00:03:35.290> like<00:03:35.560> it<00:03:35.769> a<00:03:35.799> lot<00:03:36.160> better<00:03:36.430> than<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:36.880> run

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
good i like it a lot better than the run

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.520 
good i like it a lot better than the run
anywhere<00:03:37.420> code<00:03:37.720> so<00:03:38.709> let<00:03:38.859> me<00:03:38.950> demonstrate<00:03:39.100> here

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
code press lb and then RB and now you

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.099 
code press lb and then RB and now you
can<00:03:59.680> walk<00:03:59.889> anywhere<00:04:00.269> run<00:04:01.269> anywhere<00:04:01.720> do<00:04:01.989> what

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
can walk anywhere run anywhere do what

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.099 
can walk anywhere run anywhere do what
you<00:04:02.200> want<00:04:03.239> but<00:04:04.239> one<00:04:04.510> of<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:04.720> key<00:04:04.900> differences

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
you want but one of the key differences

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.470 
you want but one of the key differences
that<00:04:05.620> you<00:04:05.709> should<00:04:05.859> already<00:04:06.099> notice<00:04:06.730> is<00:04:07.000> that

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
that you should already notice is that

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.360 
that you should already notice is that
it<00:04:07.780> doesn't<00:04:08.079> make<00:04:08.200> that<00:04:08.440> really<00:04:08.950> annoying

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
it doesn't make that really annoying

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.610 
it doesn't make that really annoying
banging<00:04:10.150> sound<00:04:10.540> whenever<00:04:10.930> you<00:04:11.079> run<00:04:11.230> somewhere

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
banging sound whenever you run somewhere

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.860 
banging sound whenever you run somewhere
like<00:04:11.829> when<00:04:11.980> you<00:04:12.069> walk<00:04:12.250> into<00:04:12.430> a<00:04:12.549> wall<00:04:12.790> with<00:04:13.660> your

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
like when you walk into a wall with your

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.780 
like when you walk into a wall with your
pokemon<00:04:14.620> trainer<00:04:14.980> you<00:04:15.189> know<00:04:15.310> how<00:04:15.489> it<00:04:15.670> just

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
pokemon trainer you know how it just

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.050 
pokemon trainer you know how it just
kind<00:04:16.030> of<00:04:16.060> makes<00:04:16.239> that<00:04:16.479> really

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
kind of makes that really

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.840 
kind of makes that really
I'm<00:04:17.150> banging<00:04:17.600> sound<00:04:17.930> and<00:04:18.410> when<00:04:19.400> you<00:04:19.519> turn<00:04:19.700> on

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
I'm banging sound and when you turn on

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.310 
I'm banging sound and when you turn on
the<00:04:19.880> code<00:04:20.239> how<00:04:20.450> it<00:04:20.570> makes<00:04:20.750> that<00:04:20.959> really

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
the code how it makes that really

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.840 
the code how it makes that really
annoying<00:04:21.650> sound<00:04:21.980> when<00:04:22.400> you're<00:04:22.520> going<00:04:22.700> through

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
annoying sound when you're going through

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.270 
annoying sound when you're going through
objects<00:04:23.510> this<00:04:24.290> code<00:04:24.530> will<00:04:24.680> not<00:04:24.919> just<00:04:25.250> listen

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
objects this code will not just listen

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.940

nothing<00:04:28.280> and<00:04:28.720> this<00:04:29.720> code<00:04:29.990> will<00:04:30.139> not<00:04:30.380> freeze<00:04:30.770> up

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
nothing and this code will not freeze up

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.390 
nothing and this code will not freeze up
on<00:04:31.070> you<00:04:31.250> at<00:04:31.370> all<00:04:32.139> it<00:04:33.139> also<00:04:33.320> works<00:04:33.710> very<00:04:33.860> very

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
on you at all it also works very very

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.640 
on you at all it also works very very
well<00:04:34.730> with<00:04:35.120> your<00:04:35.270> bike<00:04:35.510> better<00:04:36.260> than<00:04:36.500> the

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
well with your bike better than the

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:37.990 
well with your bike better than the
other<00:04:36.800> codes<00:04:37.160> would<00:04:37.400> actually<00:04:37.850> it's

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
other codes would actually it's

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.110 
other codes would actually it's
specialized<00:04:38.570> to<00:04:38.990> work<00:04:39.169> with<00:04:39.410> your<00:04:39.560> bike<00:04:43.120> so

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
specialized to work with your bike so

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.510 
specialized to work with your bike so
lastly<00:04:44.930> we<00:04:45.560> have<00:04:45.590> the<00:04:45.910> cloning<00:04:46.910> Pokemon<00:04:47.419> code

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
lastly we have the cloning Pokemon code

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.430 
lastly we have the cloning Pokemon code
this<00:04:49.520> code<00:04:49.580> can<00:04:50.240> be<00:04:50.270> a<00:04:50.570> little<00:04:50.870> bit<00:04:51.050> hard<00:04:51.320> to
