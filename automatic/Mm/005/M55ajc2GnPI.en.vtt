hey<00:00:11.480> all<00:00:11.660> I<00:00:11.690> was<00:00:11.930> going<00:00:12.290> I<00:00:13.210> bet<00:00:14.210> you<00:00:14.360> looked<00:00:14.540> at

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
hey all I was going I bet you looked at

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.179 
hey all I was going I bet you looked at
the<00:00:14.750> title<00:00:15.110> of<00:00:15.170> this<00:00:15.320> video<00:00:15.740> I<00:00:15.799> thought

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:16.189 
the title of this video I thought

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:19.540 
the title of this video I thought
somebody<00:00:16.460> was<00:00:16.760> crazy<00:00:17.560> well<00:00:18.560> I<00:00:18.800> may<00:00:19.160> be<00:00:19.220> crazy

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
somebody was crazy well I may be crazy

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.749 
somebody was crazy well I may be crazy
but<00:00:19.820> that's<00:00:20.029> actually<00:00:20.509> irrelevant<00:00:20.750> to<00:00:21.140> this

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:21.759 
but that's actually irrelevant to this

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.790 
but that's actually irrelevant to this

dinner guy as in a diet composed
primarily<00:00:28.730> of<00:00:29.239> not<00:00:30.110> entirely<00:00:30.470> but<00:00:30.919> primarily

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
primarily of not entirely but primarily

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.520 
primarily of not entirely but primarily
of<00:00:31.759> TV<00:00:32.180> dinners<00:00:32.570> okay

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
of TV dinners okay

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.799 
of TV dinners okay
I<00:00:33.559> call<00:00:34.040> them<00:00:34.190> TV<00:00:34.550> dinners<00:00:34.970> because<00:00:35.360> that's

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
I call them TV dinners because that's

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:36.910 
I call them TV dinners because that's
what<00:00:36.020> they<00:00:36.140> were<00:00:36.260> all<00:00:36.470> when<00:00:36.800> they<00:00:36.890> were

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
what they were all when they were

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.709 
what they were all when they were
introduced<00:00:37.520> and<00:00:37.940> now<00:00:38.120> I<00:00:38.149> guess<00:00:38.510> they're<00:00:38.690> just

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
introduced and now I guess they're just

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.260 
introduced and now I guess they're just
frozen<00:00:39.530> entrees<00:00:40.250> there's<00:00:40.640> some<00:00:40.820> crap<00:00:41.239> like

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
frozen entrees there's some crap like

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.850 
frozen entrees there's some crap like
that<00:00:41.860> anyway<00:00:42.860> I<00:00:43.130> have<00:00:43.790> spent<00:00:44.060> a<00:00:44.090> lot<00:00:44.360> of<00:00:44.390> time

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
that anyway I have spent a lot of time

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.790 
that anyway I have spent a lot of time
in<00:00:45.860> the<00:00:45.920> last<00:00:46.160> couple<00:00:46.460> of<00:00:46.610> weeks<00:00:47.680> looking<00:00:48.680> at

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
in the last couple of weeks looking at

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.630 
in the last couple of weeks looking at
the<00:00:48.950> calorie<00:00:49.430> counts<00:00:50.030> per<00:00:50.540> serving<00:00:51.640> according

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
the calorie counts per serving according

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.840 
the calorie counts per serving according
to<00:00:52.790> the<00:00:52.880> labels<00:00:53.330> on<00:00:54.290> just<00:00:55.100> about<00:00:55.220> every<00:00:55.579> food

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
to the labels on just about every food

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.030 
to the labels on just about every food
you<00:00:56.060> can<00:00:56.210> imagine<00:00:56.530> certainly<00:00:57.530> everything<00:00:57.800> I

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
you can imagine certainly everything I

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.860 
you can imagine certainly everything I
could<00:00:58.220> find<00:00:58.370> in<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:58.670> local<00:00:59.060> supermarket<00:00:59.210> and

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
could find in the local supermarket and

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.310 
could find in the local supermarket and
the<00:01:00.350> local<00:01:00.710> Walmart<00:01:00.970> Supercenter<00:01:01.970> and<00:01:02.320> what

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
the local Walmart Supercenter and what

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.620 
the local Walmart Supercenter and what
I've<00:01:03.440> come<00:01:03.470> to<00:01:03.860> the<00:01:03.950> conclusion<00:01:03.980> is<00:01:04.759> but

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
I've come to the conclusion is but

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.480 
I've come to the conclusion is but
basically<00:01:05.810> if<00:01:06.259> you<00:01:06.350> have<00:01:06.500> to<00:01:06.650> eat<00:01:06.799> on<00:01:06.950> a<00:01:06.979> budget

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
basically if you have to eat on a budget

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.060 
basically if you have to eat on a budget
you<00:01:08.329> have<00:01:08.450> to<00:01:08.570> stick<00:01:08.840> within<00:01:09.110> a<00:01:09.409> budget<00:01:09.890> a

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
you have to stick within a budget a

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.840 
you have to stick within a budget a
fairly<00:01:10.759> small<00:01:11.060> one<00:01:11.299> at<00:01:11.420> that<00:01:11.659> then<00:01:12.850> you're

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
fairly small one at that then you're

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.890 
fairly small one at that then you're
kind<00:01:14.090> of<00:01:14.210> stuck<00:01:15.340> because<00:01:16.540> almost<00:01:17.540> without

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
kind of stuck because almost without

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.640 
kind of stuck because almost without
fail<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:19.100> foods<00:01:19.430> that<00:01:19.640> are<00:01:19.909> better<00:01:20.210> for<00:01:20.570> you

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
fail the foods that are better for you

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.469 
fail the foods that are better for you
nutritionally<00:01:21.650> at<00:01:22.250> lower<00:01:22.580> calories<00:01:23.240> per

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
nutritionally at lower calories per

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.980 
nutritionally at lower calories per
serving<00:01:23.770> those<00:01:24.770> are<00:01:24.979> the<00:01:25.040> ones<00:01:25.280> that<00:01:25.670> cost<00:01:26.600> a

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
serving those are the ones that cost a

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.190 
serving those are the ones that cost a
lot<00:01:27.950> more<00:01:28.060> but<00:01:29.060> if<00:01:29.180> you<00:01:29.299> have<00:01:29.450> to<00:01:29.630> eat<00:01:29.780> cheap

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
lot more but if you have to eat cheap

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.460 
lot more but if you have to eat cheap
then<00:01:30.950> you<00:01:31.130> find<00:01:31.460> out<00:01:31.700> that<00:01:32.150> most<00:01:32.690> of<00:01:33.080> the<00:01:33.200> meals

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
then you find out that most of the meals

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.060 
then you find out that most of the meals
may<00:01:34.270> come<00:01:35.270> up<00:01:35.420> with<00:01:35.450> cheap<00:01:36.170> are<00:01:36.620> going<00:01:36.920> to

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
may come up with cheap are going to

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.490 
may come up with cheap are going to
contain<00:01:37.490> pasta<00:01:38.210> and<00:01:38.600> stuff<00:01:38.810> like<00:01:38.990> that<00:01:39.260> and

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
contain pasta and stuff like that and

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.289 
contain pasta and stuff like that and
the<00:01:39.740> calorie<00:01:40.130> counts<00:01:40.580> are<00:01:40.670> going<00:01:40.880> to<00:01:41.030> be<00:01:41.180> up

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
the calorie counts are going to be up

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.810 
the calorie counts are going to be up
through<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.780> moon<00:01:42.049> and<00:01:42.520> it's<00:01:43.520> just

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
through the moon and it's just

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:44.620 
through the moon and it's just
ridiculous

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
ridiculous

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.240 
ridiculous
and<00:01:44.840> then<00:01:45.020> I<00:01:45.049> got<00:01:45.320> looking<00:01:45.619> at<00:01:45.799> some<00:01:46.040> of<00:01:46.159> these

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
and then I got looking at some of these

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.910 
and then I got looking at some of these
TV<00:01:46.670> dinners<00:01:47.049> like<00:01:48.049> for<00:01:48.290> example<00:01:48.350> there's<00:01:48.830> a

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
TV dinners like for example there's a

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.609 
TV dinners like for example there's a
smart<00:01:49.340> ones<00:01:49.549> brand<00:01:49.970> they're<00:01:50.960> a<00:01:50.990> little<00:01:51.200> pricey

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
smart ones brand they're a little pricey

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.190 
smart ones brand they're a little pricey
but<00:01:51.860> they're<00:01:52.790> good<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:53.420> ones<00:01:53.630> I'm<00:01:53.810> thinking

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
but they're good the ones I'm thinking

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.370 
but they're good the ones I'm thinking
about<00:01:54.320> I<00:01:54.860> believe<00:01:55.670> said<00:01:56.119> Bistro<00:01:56.750> something<00:01:57.260> or

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
about I believe said Bistro something or

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.399 
about I believe said Bistro something or
other<00:01:57.560> collection<00:01:58.280> whatever<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.750> fancy<00:02:00.229> name

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
other collection whatever the fancy name

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:01.990 
other collection whatever the fancy name
gives<00:02:00.710> them<00:02:00.799> an<00:02:00.860> excuse<00:02:01.280> to<00:02:01.400> raise<00:02:01.580> the<00:02:01.729> price

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
gives them an excuse to raise the price

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.499 
gives them an excuse to raise the price
but<00:02:02.920> these<00:02:03.920> things<00:02:04.220> are<00:02:04.400> like<00:02:04.490> 200<00:02:05.000> calories

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
but these things are like 200 calories

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.480 
but these things are like 200 calories
per<00:02:06.080> entrée<00:02:07.040> dish<00:02:08.030> whatever<00:02:08.810> you<00:02:09.019> know

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
per entrée dish whatever you know

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.480 
per entrée dish whatever you know
with<00:02:10.390> a<00:02:10.420> meat<00:02:10.690> and<00:02:10.840> vegetable<00:02:11.350> dish<00:02:11.560> they've

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
with a meat and vegetable dish they've

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.310 
with a meat and vegetable dish they've
got<00:02:12.730> a<00:02:12.760> bunch<00:02:13.030> of<00:02:13.300> them<00:02:13.480> there's<00:02:13.840> several<00:02:14.080> of

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
got a bunch of them there's several of

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.440 
got a bunch of them there's several of
them<00:02:14.410> would<00:02:14.560> postulate<00:02:15.220> I've<00:02:15.910> been<00:02:16.180> kind<00:02:16.420> of

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
them would postulate I've been kind of

them would postulate I've been kind of
trying<00:02:16.600> to<00:02:16.780> stay<00:02:16.990> away<00:02:17.200> from<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.470> pasta<00:02:17.920> I

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
trying to stay away from the pasta I

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.060 
trying to stay away from the pasta I
have<00:02:19.000> a<00:02:19.030> weak<00:02:19.300> spot<00:02:19.600> for<00:02:19.630> pasta<00:02:20.350> when<00:02:20.740> I<00:02:20.770> got<00:02:20.950> to

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
have a weak spot for pasta when I got to

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.160 
have a weak spot for pasta when I got to
looking<00:02:21.340> at<00:02:21.430> these<00:02:21.580> TV<00:02:21.940> dinners<00:02:22.270> I<00:02:22.510> thought<00:02:23.020> it

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
looking at these TV dinners I thought it

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.470 
looking at these TV dinners I thought it
even<00:02:23.380> when<00:02:23.500> you<00:02:23.620> switch<00:02:23.890> down<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.490> more

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
even when you switch down to the more

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.580 
even when you switch down to the more
inexpensive<00:02:25.780> ones<00:02:26.700> $0.89<00:02:28.140> stuff<00:02:29.140> like<00:02:29.320> that

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
inexpensive ones $0.89 stuff like that

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.770 
inexpensive ones $0.89 stuff like that
but<00:02:30.280> they're<00:02:30.460> still<00:02:30.730> keeping<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.270> calories

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
but they're still keeping the calories

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.740 
but they're still keeping the calories
down<00:02:32.100> typically<00:02:33.100> between<00:02:33.430> 200<00:02:33.880> and<00:02:33.910> 400<00:02:34.180> per

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
down typically between 200 and 400 per

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.620 
down typically between 200 and 400 per
meal<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.710> in<00:02:36.190> each<00:02:36.370> one<00:02:36.400> package<00:02:37.180> is<00:02:37.330> a<00:02:37.360> meal

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
meal and in each one package is a meal

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.440 
meal and in each one package is a meal
so<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.350> grab<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.800> package<00:02:39.090> four<00:02:40.090> minutes<00:02:40.360> in

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
so you grab the package four minutes in

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.070 
so you grab the package four minutes in
the<00:02:40.510> microwave

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080
