00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
importantly the the signature

applications the things that run on top

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.490 
applications the things that run on top
that<00:00:12.179> really<00:00:12.420> make<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.690> full<00:00:12.870> sonaris<00:00:13.230> and

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
that really make the full sonaris and

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.129 
that really make the full sonaris and
user<00:00:13.650> experience<00:00:13.880> are<00:00:14.880> launched<00:00:15.330> directly<00:00:15.540> so

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
user experience are launched directly so

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.620 
user experience are launched directly so
in<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.410> case<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.650> timescape

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.620 

so<00:00:24.259> this<00:00:24.410> is<00:00:24.589> all<00:00:24.800> the<00:00:25.090> this<00:00:26.090> is<00:00:26.240> all<00:00:26.390> the

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
so this is all the this is all the

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.749 
so this is all the this is all the
events<00:00:27.589> that<00:00:27.800> have<00:00:27.919> happened<00:00:27.949> in<00:00:28.400> the<00:00:28.489> device

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:28.759 
events that have happened in the device

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.359 
events that have happened in the device
that<00:00:29.090> this<00:00:29.929> sort<00:00:30.500> of<00:00:30.590> graphics<00:00:31.189> performance

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
that this sort of graphics performance

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.580 
that this sort of graphics performance
is<00:00:31.820> obviously<00:00:32.149> not<00:00:32.329> representative<00:00:33.260> of<00:00:33.440> the

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
is obviously not representative of the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.259 
is obviously not representative of the
final<00:00:33.980> they're<00:00:34.430> here<00:00:34.550> we<00:00:34.699> have<00:00:34.879> this<00:00:35.030> sort<00:00:35.210> of

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:35.269 
final they're here we have this sort of

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:37.810 
final they're here we have this sort of
full<00:00:35.510> integration<00:00:36.170> of<00:00:36.500> Facebook<00:00:37.129> Twitter<00:00:37.399> all

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
full integration of Facebook Twitter all

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.619 
full integration of Facebook Twitter all
your<00:00:38.000> communications<00:00:38.420> in<00:00:38.960> one<00:00:39.170> and<00:00:39.410> then<00:00:40.159> if<00:00:40.280> i

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
your communications in one and then if i

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.740 
your communications in one and then if i
click<00:00:41.629> across<00:00:42.019> I<00:00:42.320> can<00:00:42.650> actually<00:00:42.769> show

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
click across I can actually show

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.149 
click across I can actually show
specific<00:00:44.750> events<00:00:45.170> related<00:00:45.620> to<00:00:45.710> one<00:00:45.890> type<00:00:46.129> of

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:46.159 
specific events related to one type of

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:51.189 
specific events related to one type of
communication<00:00:46.750> so<00:00:49.690> this<00:00:50.690> is<00:00:50.839> all<00:00:51.019> the

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
communication so this is all the

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.700 
communication so this is all the
facebook<00:00:51.829> updates

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.940 

and<00:00:57.250> then<00:00:57.370> if<00:00:57.489> I<00:00:57.670> pick<00:00:58.149> a<00:00:58.180> cross<00:00:58.450> again<00:00:58.770> all<00:00:59.770> the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
and then if I pick a cross again all the

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:06.920 
and then if I pick a cross again all the
Twitter<00:01:00.160> updates

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.810 

and<00:01:07.290> then<00:01:07.620> if<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.890> just<00:01:08.100> touch<00:01:08.310> on<00:01:08.580> one

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
and then if I just touch on one

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.010 
and then if I just touch on one
particular<00:01:09.000> trial<00:01:09.600> but<00:01:09.870> that<00:01:10.500> tile<00:01:10.880> expands

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
particular trial but that tile expands

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.050 
particular trial but that tile expands
and<00:01:13.020> then<00:01:13.620> I<00:01:13.710> touch<00:01:13.920> again<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.280> can<00:01:14.550> actually<00:01:14.910> go

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
and then I touch again I can actually go

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.700 
and then I touch again I can actually go
directly<00:01:15.540> young

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.560 

go<00:01:22.710> directly<00:01:23.100> here<00:01:23.340> we<00:01:23.430> go<00:01:23.550> into<00:01:23.880> Twitter<00:01:24.300> so

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
go directly here we go into Twitter so

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.420 
go directly here we go into Twitter so
now<00:01:24.750> I've<00:01:25.500> actually<00:01:25.680> launched<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.100> browser

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
now I've actually launched the browser

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.230 
now I've actually launched the browser
directly<00:01:26.760> from<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.630> time<00:01:27.840> scale<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:29.120> show<00:01:30.120> the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
directly from the time scale to show the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.590 
directly from the time scale to show the
full<00:01:30.450> update<00:01:31.100> so<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.400> just<00:01:32.550> a<00:01:32.820> min<00:01:33.000> NASA<00:01:33.270> I

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
full update so this is just a min NASA I

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.090 
full update so this is just a min NASA I
just<00:01:33.900> happened<00:01:34.410> to<00:01:34.440> have<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.710> massive

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
just happened to have the massive

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.170 
just happened to have the massive
twitter<00:01:35.310> feed<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:36.420> here<00:01:36.720> at<00:01:36.870> some<00:01:38.030> this<00:01:39.030> is

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
twitter feed so here at some this is

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.730 
twitter feed so here at some this is
just<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.510> NASA<00:01:39.720> Twitter<00:01:40.050> feed<00:01:40.320> directa

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
just the NASA Twitter feed directa

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:48.430 
just the NASA Twitter feed directa
displayed<00:01:41.360> from<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.630> timescape<00:01:43.410> you

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.149 

and<00:01:48.980> then<00:01:49.100> likewise<00:01:49.520> if<00:01:49.700> i<00:01:49.850> look<00:01:50.000> in<00:01:50.210> facebook

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.609 

I<00:01:53.329> can<00:01:54.329> scroll<00:01:54.689> up<00:01:54.749> and<00:01:55.020> down<00:01:55.079> through<00:01:55.499> the

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
I can scroll up and down through the

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.580 
I can scroll up and down through the
facebook<00:01:56.100> entries

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
facebook entries

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.149 
facebook entries
obviously<00:01:59.590> this<00:01:59.680> isn't<00:02:00.120> final<00:02:01.120> but<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.950> is

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
obviously this isn't final but it is

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.450 
obviously this isn't final but it is
very<00:02:03.190> laggards<00:02:04.000> moment<00:02:04.390> how<00:02:05.229> are<00:02:05.560> we<00:02:05.620> going<00:02:06.280> to

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
very laggards moment how are we going to

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.460 
very laggards moment how are we going to
be<00:02:06.550> sure<00:02:06.729> that<00:02:06.760> this<00:02:07.090> is<00:02:07.240> going<00:02:07.390> to<00:02:07.510> be<00:02:07.660> much

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
be sure that this is going to be much

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.560 
be sure that this is going to be much
leader<00:02:08.740> in<00:02:09.039> java<00:02:09.310> of<00:02:09.580> course<00:02:09.880> of<00:02:10.090> course<00:02:10.240> the

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
leader in java of course of course the

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.810 
leader in java of course of course the
the<00:02:11.070> application<00:02:12.070> performance<00:02:12.490> will<00:02:12.700> be

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
the application performance will be

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.820 
the application performance will be
similar<00:02:13.209> to<00:02:13.240> what<00:02:13.540> you<00:02:13.660> saw<00:02:13.870> on<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.080> demos

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
similar to what you saw on the demos

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.750 
similar to what you saw on the demos
that<00:02:14.860> so<00:02:15.660> that<00:02:16.660> that's<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:17.190> intended<00:02:18.190> level

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
that so that that's the intended level

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.510 
that so that that's the intended level
of<00:02:18.820> performance<00:02:19.560> this<00:02:20.560> is<00:02:20.709> just<00:02:20.980> I<00:02:21.190> mean<00:02:21.250> the

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
of performance this is just I mean the

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.800 
of performance this is just I mean the
first<00:02:21.700> implementations<00:02:22.570> of<00:02:22.660> these

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
first implementations of these

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.030 
first implementations of these
applications<00:02:23.470> just<00:02:23.530> to<00:02:23.770> show<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:23.980> that

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
applications just to show you that

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.410 
applications just to show you that
they're<00:02:24.280> really<00:02:24.430> working<00:02:24.700> they're<00:02:25.060> not<00:02:25.209> just

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
they're really working they're not just

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.040 
they're really working they're not just
in<00:02:26.230> PowerPoint<00:02:26.830> for<00:02:27.010> example<00:02:27.430> so

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
in PowerPoint for example so

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.100 
in PowerPoint for example so
this<00:02:29.650> is<00:02:29.970> actually<00:02:30.970> going<00:02:31.120> directly<00:02:31.720> from<00:02:31.930> the

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
this is actually going directly from the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.040 
this is actually going directly from the
timescape<00:02:32.620> into<00:02:33.040> this<00:02:33.940> particular<00:02:34.630> guy<00:02:34.990> who

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
timescape into this particular guy who

with his full face book details there
and<00:02:40.630> if<00:02:40.780> I<00:02:40.960> if<00:02:41.740> I<00:02:41.860> scan<00:02:42.160> across<00:02:42.450> then<00:02:43.450> I've<00:02:43.600> got

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
and if I if I scan across then I've got

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.720

so<00:03:19.990> once<00:03:20.319> we're<00:03:20.440> in<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.590> home<00:03:20.740> screen<00:03:21.040> how<00:03:21.220> do

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
so once we're in the home screen how do

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.100 
so once we're in the home screen how do
we<00:03:21.430> get<00:03:21.550> into<00:03:21.819> the<00:03:21.940> timescape<00:03:22.480> and<00:03:22.780> media

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
we get into the timescape and media

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.220 
we get into the timescape and media
skate<00:03:23.380> yeah<00:03:24.660> so<00:03:25.660> you<00:03:25.750> actually<00:03:25.870> have<00:03:26.020> two

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
skate yeah so you actually have two

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.140 
skate yeah so you actually have two
choices<00:03:26.470> that<00:03:26.890> they're<00:03:27.160> integrated<00:03:27.760> onto<00:03:27.910> the

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
choices that they're integrated onto the

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.970 
choices that they're integrated onto the
home<00:03:28.300> screen<00:03:28.630> but<00:03:29.200> in<00:03:29.290> fact<00:03:29.440> you<00:03:29.590> can<00:03:29.709> set

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
home screen but in fact you can set

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.590 
home screen but in fact you can set
timescape<00:03:30.520> as<00:03:30.730> your<00:03:30.970> home<00:03:31.120> screen<00:03:31.450> if<00:03:31.569> you

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
timescape as your home screen if you

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.809 
timescape as your home screen if you
want<00:03:31.930> so<00:03:32.590> you<00:03:32.650> could<00:03:32.890> go<00:03:33.040> directly<00:03:33.430> into<00:03:33.550> it

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
want so you could go directly into it

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:35.760 
want so you could go directly into it
into<00:03:34.450> time<00:03:34.600> so<00:03:34.750> if<00:03:34.990> you<00:03:35.050> don't<00:03:35.290> what<00:03:35.470> you<00:03:35.590> get

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
into time so if you don't what you get

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.270 
into time so if you don't what you get
is<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.100> most<00:03:36.340> recent<00:03:37.170> event<00:03:38.170> in<00:03:38.830> the<00:03:39.010> device

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
is the most recent event in the device

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.830 
is the most recent event in the device
is<00:03:39.520> actually<00:03:39.670> presented<00:03:40.240> on<00:03:40.360> a<00:03:40.390> hunch<00:03:40.600> going

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
is actually presented on a hunch going

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.230 
is actually presented on a hunch going
to<00:03:40.990> you<00:03:41.170> can<00:03:41.380> see<00:03:41.560> there<00:03:41.740> again<00:03:42.190> the<00:03:42.670> NASA<00:03:42.910> food

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
to you can see there again the NASA food

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.140 
to you can see there again the NASA food
is<00:03:43.390> the<00:03:43.540> most<00:03:43.570> recent<00:03:44.200> event<00:03:44.790> but<00:03:45.790> if<00:03:45.910> you<00:03:46.000> just

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
is the most recent event but if you just

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.570 
is the most recent event but if you just
press<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:46.630> x<00:03:46.840> key<00:03:47.080> button<00:03:47.440> then<00:03:48.310> you<00:03:48.430> move

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
press the x key button then you move

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.320 
press the x key button then you move
directly<00:03:48.790> into<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:50.790> until<00:03:51.790> the<00:03:51.850> timescape

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
directly into the until the timescape

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.810 
directly into the until the timescape
you<00:03:52.540> to<00:03:53.350> say<00:03:53.530> this<00:03:53.680> could<00:03:54.010> be<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.340> home<00:03:54.489> screen

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
you to say this could be the home screen

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.580 
you to say this could be the home screen
you<00:03:55.090> can<00:03:55.270> set<00:03:55.540> this<00:03:55.690> to<00:03:55.900> be<00:03:56.020> your<00:03:56.050> home<00:03:56.320> screen

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
you can set this to be your home screen

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.980 
you can set this to be your home screen
if<00:03:56.770> you<00:03:56.800> prefer

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.690 

just<00:04:00.680> to<00:04:00.770> give<00:04:00.950> you<00:04:01.100> an<00:04:01.190> idea<00:04:01.310> of<00:04:01.550> the

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
just to give you an idea of the

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.680 
just to give you an idea of the
performance<00:04:02.240> to<00:04:02.390> show<00:04:02.750> some<00:04:03.110> of<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:03.320> native

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
performance to show some of the native

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.740 
performance to show some of the native
google<00:04:05.690> advocate<00:04:06.230> so<00:04:06.410> this<00:04:06.530> is<00:04:06.620> google<00:04:06.770> maps

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
google advocate so this is google maps

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.500 
google advocate so this is google maps
like<00:04:09.160> so<00:04:10.160> here<00:04:10.340> you<00:04:10.490> can<00:04:10.520> see<00:04:10.850> just<00:04:11.090> to<00:04:11.270> get<00:04:11.420> an

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
like so here you can see just to get an

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.380 
like so here you can see just to get an
idea<00:04:11.600> of<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:12.230> sort<00:04:13.100> of<00:04:13.190> performance<00:04:13.910> of<00:04:14.270> the

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
idea of the sort of performance of the

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.830 
idea of the sort of performance of the
device<00:04:14.920> if<00:04:15.920> i<00:04:16.100> scan<00:04:16.370> around<00:04:16.520> this<00:04:16.790> is<00:04:17.180> this

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
device if i scan around this is this

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.330 
device if i scan around this is this
kind<00:04:18.050> of<00:04:18.110> graphics<00:04:18.500> performance<00:04:18.650> will<00:04:19.190> be

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
kind of graphics performance will be

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.860 
kind of graphics performance will be
replicated<00:04:20.300> in<00:04:20.420> all<00:04:20.540> of<00:04:20.660> the<00:04:20.750> other

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
replicated in all of the other

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.650 
replicated in all of the other
applications<00:04:21.050> as<00:04:21.680> well

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.720 

and<00:04:27.230> then<00:04:27.440> you<00:04:27.530> can<00:04:27.650> launch<00:04:27.860> of<00:04:28.250> course<00:04:28.550> the

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
and then you can launch of course the

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.760 
and then you can launch of course the
browser<00:04:28.970> far<00:04:29.330> away<00:04:29.570> your<00:04:30.380> browser<00:04:30.560> either

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
browser far away your browser either

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.810 
browser far away your browser either
this<00:04:31.490> is<00:04:31.670> the<00:04:31.850> standard<00:04:32.180> browser

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
this is the standard browser

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:40.650 
this is the standard browser
what<00:04:35.420> kid<00:04:35.660> I<00:04:35.780> think

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.470 

you<00:04:41.350> can<00:04:41.530> see<00:04:41.680> the<00:04:41.830> kind<00:04:42.040> of<00:04:42.480> graphics

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
you can see the kind of graphics

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.060 
you can see the kind of graphics
performance<00:04:44.020> that<00:04:44.560> we<00:04:44.650> would<00:04:44.800> expect

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
performance that we would expect

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.710 
performance that we would expect
now<00:04:48.070> would<00:04:48.280> I<00:04:48.340> get<00:04:48.520> a<00:04:48.550> chance<00:04:49.150> to<00:04:49.330> play<00:04:49.630> around

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
now would I get a chance to play around

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.670 
now would I get a chance to play around
with<00:04:49.960> it<00:04:50.020> a<00:04:50.080> little<00:04:50.110> bit<00:04:50.380> a<00:04:50.650> little<00:04:50.950> bit<00:04:51.190> yeah

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
with it a little bit a little bit yeah

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.230 
with it a little bit a little bit yeah
from<00:04:53.680> that<00:04:53.710> distance<00:04:54.100> it<00:04:54.340> sir<00:04:54.850> chris<00:04:55.090> good

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
from that distance it sir chris good

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.970 
from that distance it sir chris good
eyes<00:04:55.330> yeah<00:04:57.630> this<00:04:58.630> is<00:04:58.780> home<00:04:58.960> button<00:04:59.350> menu

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
eyes yeah this is home button menu

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:21.980 
eyes yeah this is home button menu
button<00:05:00.310> yeah<00:05:00.730> I<00:05:00.850> presume<00:05:01.380> options

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.309 

take<00:05:22.590> Nora

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:27.319 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:33.420 

subject

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.390 

it<00:05:34.000> is<00:05:34.240> usually<00:05:34.690> the<00:05:34.990> small<00:05:35.230> no<00:05:35.740> no<00:05:35.950> no<00:05:36.010> this<00:05:36.190> is

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
it is usually the small no no no this is

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.470 
it is usually the small no no no this is
not<00:05:36.640> fun<00:05:37.290> like<00:05:38.290> this<00:05:38.910> so<00:05:39.910> just<00:05:40.180> go<00:05:40.300> ahead<00:05:40.330> and

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:40.480 
not fun like this so just go ahead and

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.540 
not fun like this so just go ahead and
assume<00:05:40.780> that<00:05:40.840> these<00:05:41.200> things<00:05:41.500> just<00:05:42.250> beyond

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
assume that these things just beyond

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.930 
assume that these things just beyond
doubt<00:05:42.820> yeah<00:05:43.660> of<00:05:43.870> course<00:05:44.230> this<00:05:44.530> is<00:05:44.740> this<00:05:45.700> is<00:05:45.820> the

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
doubt yeah of course this is this is the

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.400 
doubt yeah of course this is this is the
work<00:05:46.090> that<00:05:46.270> we<00:05:46.390> do<00:05:46.510> now<00:05:46.690> one<00:05:46.900> thing<00:05:46.930> is<00:05:47.200> to<00:05:47.320> get

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
work that we do now one thing is to get

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:48.660 
work that we do now one thing is to get
the<00:05:47.560> applications<00:05:48.070> running<00:05:48.280> and<00:05:48.490> then<00:05:48.550> of

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:48.670 
the applications running and then of

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.720 
the applications running and then of
course<00:05:48.700> dr.<00:05:49.240> my<00:05:49.390> steps<00:05:49.690> yeah<00:05:50.430> because<00:05:51.430> it<00:05:51.610> was

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:51.730 
course dr. my steps yeah because it was

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:56.250 
course dr. my steps yeah because it was
calling<00:05:52.090> it's<00:05:52.210> pretty<00:05:52.390> snappy<00:05:55.110> this<00:05:56.110> will

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
calling it's pretty snappy this will

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.650 
calling it's pretty snappy this will
look<00:05:56.380> pretty<00:05:56.500> good<00:05:56.650> in<00:05:57.310> the<00:05:57.850> browser<00:05:58.060> it's

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
look pretty good in the browser it's

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.020 
look pretty good in the browser it's
good<00:05:58.950> if<00:05:59.950> so<00:06:00.160> the<00:06:00.280> things<00:06:00.520> that<00:06:00.700> are<00:06:00.790> sort<00:06:00.910> of

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
good if so the things that are sort of

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.790 
good if so the things that are sort of
natively<00:06:01.510> in<00:06:01.630> the<00:06:01.780> platform<00:06:01.990> have<00:06:02.620> the

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
natively in the platform have the

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.110 
natively in the platform have the
performance<00:06:03.250> already<00:06:03.550> and<00:06:03.790> then<00:06:03.910> their

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
performance already and then their

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.000 
performance already and then their
signature<00:06:04.960> applications<00:06:05.470> we've<00:06:05.620> added<00:06:05.800> on

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
signature applications we've added on

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.440 
signature applications we've added on
top<00:06:06.220> we're<00:06:06.400> obviously<00:06:06.520> in<00:06:06.850> the<00:06:06.970> process<00:06:07.390> of

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.450 
top we're obviously in the process of

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:19.690 
top we're obviously in the process of
optimizing<00:06:08.050> the<00:06:08.170> right<00:06:08.350> now

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:19.700 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.050 

where<00:06:20.330> the<00:06:20.450> back<00:06:20.630> button<00:06:20.840> is<00:06:21.290> very

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:31.110 

ok<00:06:24.810> so<00:06:24.870> doubles<00:06:25.320> in<00:06:25.440> pepper<00:06:25.919> and<00:06:26.220> browser<00:06:26.550> to

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.689 

so<00:06:31.660> that<00:06:31.840> you<00:06:32.650> have<00:06:32.770> a<00:06:32.800> preload<00:06:33.220> in<00:06:33.370> this<00:06:33.490> page

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:33.699 
so that you have a preload in this page

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:36.420 
so that you have a preload in this page
no<00:06:33.940> no<00:06:33.970> no<00:06:34.210> no<00:06:34.740> that's<00:06:35.740> how<00:06:35.830> fast<00:06:36.070> a<00:06:36.280> I'm

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
no no no no that's how fast a I'm

film escalator civil 3d icon there so
you<00:06:46.120> can<00:06:46.270> see<00:06:46.389> that<00:06:46.419> it's<00:06:46.660> downloading<00:06:47.199> you

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:47.290 
you can see that it's downloading you

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.870 
you can see that it's downloading you
should

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.000 

this<00:06:51.450> is<00:06:51.630> where<00:06:51.870> stock<00:06:52.170> market<00:06:52.470> MTG<00:06:52.560> likes<00:06:52.830> to

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.010 
this is where stock market MTG likes to

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.210 
this is where stock market MTG likes to
dance<00:06:53.160> with<00:06:53.370> the<00:06:53.400> rendering<00:06:53.940> exactly<00:06:54.750> the

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:55.220 
dance with the rendering exactly the

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.910 
dance with the rendering exactly the
sorts<00:06:56.220> of<00:06:56.310> operations<00:06:56.820> yep<00:06:57.650> so<00:06:58.650> then<00:06:58.800> it's

00:06:58.910 --> 00:06:58.920 
sorts of operations yep so then it's

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.240 
sorts of operations yep so then it's
just<00:06:59.160> a<00:06:59.250> question<00:06:59.430> of<00:06:59.640> getting<00:06:59.700> the<00:07:00.030> month
