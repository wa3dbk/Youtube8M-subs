00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 real candles on christmas tree 

00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:05.460
 It hardly goes more romantic 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.649
 But the moments can be fast 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.510
 nightmare if you are not careful 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.280
 the experiment here shows how fast so 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.820
 a christmas tree is going up in flames 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.139
 can 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.089
 for the firefighters from 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.410
 Kreisfeuerwehrverband attaining HÃ¶chstadt 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.109
 a familiar picture 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.650
 They need about 260 burning a year 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.330
 Clear 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.460
 some of them by christbaumes 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.500
 caused by the too in this year 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.689
 The pros do not explain how to avoid us 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.970
 the danger of burning rooms is clear 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.820
 and to minimize advent wreaths when 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.320
 Do not get them from the top down 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.329
 mix again from bottom to top 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.059
 for example for such a 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.489
 christbaum also with a water barrel 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.879
 or water levels surrounded 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.649
 his 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.960
 It should be despite the precautionary measures 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.879
 come so far that the tree catches fire 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.170
 you should act immediately 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.940
 because if the tree once 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.390
 It burns with a blaze of fire 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.390
 delete it 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.650
 of course, that's natural water 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.600
 You should be in the apartment area 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.040
 always a fire extinguisher water holes 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.590
 have or powder extinguisher for disposal 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.990
 ultimately achieved for emergency 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.340
 a bucket of water 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.990
 Everyone has fire extinguishers too 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.980
 there are also in the house 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.470
 differences 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:21.100
 either recommend the foam extinguisher 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.900
 or the blood burn holes while I am 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.090
 blood bath is a very big one 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.770
 Dust have and in one 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.450
 private household always critical because of that 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.070
 I would generally always a foam 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.470
 or to a water holes in 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.270
 Private households tend to be rare 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.490
 is used in private households 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.350
 the blanket with the can be for 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.640
 example of burning advent wreaths in the 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.200
 delete it by hand 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.520
 but even if the clothes before 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.320
 you can catch with one 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.479
 blanket to prevent worse 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.729
 the fire is important to the oxygen 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.430
 Take the blanket 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.650
 around the body even with a fat burn 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.750
 you should stop the oxygen supply 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.430
 and do not use water 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.830
 but for example a lid on 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:09.610
 the pot give else happens 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:12.250
 here and I started to burn 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.810
 it compares to the self-ignition there 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.260
 you need strength and source 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.360
 and it is often underestimated in everything 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.459
 normal salad oil or frying fat for 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.290
 an energy is underestimated 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.060
 You should not drive these on anybody 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.320
 fall and beforehand on the 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.690
 set serious 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.900
 to make christmas so romantic 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.900
 can
