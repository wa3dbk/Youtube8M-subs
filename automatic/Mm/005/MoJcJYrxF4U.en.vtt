 Tokyo was hit by sandstorm this afternoon 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:15.169
 Here is an image from Tokyo Skytree, but from the right side of the screen 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:17.689
 The sandstorm is going to cover the whole screen within just a 4-minute rushing You can see On the other hand here. 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:20.250

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:24.060
 Sandstorm from the back of the screen and the singer 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:29.950
 Close and Rainbow Bridge almost disappeared 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:35.910
 Traffic a variety of influences were one after another due to the effect of this sandstorm 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.910
 Afternoon the sky in central Tokyo suddenly got brown 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:46.180
 The direction of the wind has changed to northerly Tokyo has increased the cool wind And look at the sky 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.300
 Please 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.770
 A yellowish mainland is spreading 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.900
 Goods seems to be rolled up 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:00.760
 Mysterious dust that covered Tokyo 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:03.690
 Many people thought that Chinese yellow sand came 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.690
 me 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:12.110
 Father Korean children's clothes 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:19.420
 Take it actually high, but these winds were Mashi Clichy 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:25.000
 The phenomenon this time is sandstorm that occurred in Kanto instead of yellow sand coming from China 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:28.180
 And the strong northwest wind that blows up and turns up the dry sand of the Kanto plain 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.600
 I was rushed to the center of Tokyo 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:39.500
 I can not see the surroundings at all due to a sudden strong wind 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:45.610
 In Shimono City, Tochigi Prefecture , the view was blocked by sand dust soaring in strong winds 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.610
 It seems that such dry sand was transported to Tokyo by strong winds 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:53.710
 It is approaching to several hundred meters to Tokyo Sky Tree, but the upper one is sand dust 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.710
 It looks so lonely 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:02.320
 Cameras installed in Tokyo Skytree are nice 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:08.310
 You can see the sandstorm coming from the right side of the screen 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.310
 I think the distance overlooking in Tokyo has dropped to around Rikiro 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:18.000
 In addition , a strong wind blew up in the Kanto area, and some injured people were exposed. 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:21.400
 The back net over there falls down because of suddenly blowing the top in the alignment after the end of sharing of baseball 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:28.260
 It means that a man was injured 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:34.140
 Three junior high school students who became underlay of back net suffered injuries such as scratching their heads 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:40.709
 Though I have heard in the wind that has become stronger from around town road noon 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:42.420
 In addition , it is also a meeting place of the idol group akb48 etc. held at Makuhari Messe. 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.470
 Temporary tent broken 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.470
 6 people were injured 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:53.720
 Transportation has also had an impact, such as temporarily stopping driving on the Tohoku Line or Musashino Line 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.720
 It is 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:02.390
 Damage is occurring even in Kansai 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:03.980
 Girls junior high school students skipped the bench events flurry in the football ground of Lake Biwa in Otsu, Shiga Prefecture 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.000

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:15.860
 A female student is seriously injured with a broken shoulder and knee 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:17.550
 Still in the sea in Nishinomiya City, Hyogo Prefecture, six yachts practiced by university students were overturned by strong wind, and 12 people were in the sea 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:22.970
