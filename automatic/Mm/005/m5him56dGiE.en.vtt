I'm demonstrating how to cut a
cylindrical<00:00:07.379> mold<00:00:07.529> that<00:00:07.740> we've<00:00:07.919> made<00:00:08.130> inside

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
cylindrical mold that we've made inside

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.240 
cylindrical mold that we've made inside
of<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:08.940> film<00:00:09.179> canister<00:00:09.530> so<00:00:10.530> first<00:00:10.830> I<00:00:10.950> cut<00:00:11.130> the

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
of a film canister so first I cut the

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.039 
of a film canister so first I cut the
film<00:00:11.460> canister<00:00:11.730> off<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.300> outside<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:12.929> the

film canister off the outside of the

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.470 
film canister off the outside of the
mold<00:00:13.200> that's<00:00:13.500> already<00:00:13.769> cured<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.490> you<00:00:15.330> can

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
mold that's already cured and you can

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.670 
mold that's already cured and you can
see<00:00:15.660> sometimes<00:00:15.900> there's<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.320> bit<00:00:16.500> of<00:00:16.529> a

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
see sometimes there's a bit of a

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.890 
see sometimes there's a bit of a
struggle<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.220> get<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.490> out<00:00:17.640> but<00:00:17.880> eventually<00:00:18.539> it

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
struggle to get it out but eventually it

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.429 
struggle to get it out but eventually it
comes<00:00:19.140> out<00:00:19.320> quite<00:00:19.650> easily<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:21.080> you<00:00:22.080> can<00:00:22.140> see

side<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.790> this<00:02:06.149> helps<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.570> improve<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
side and this helps to improve the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.270 
side and this helps to improve the
leverage<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.550> can<00:02:08.819> get<00:02:09.060> on<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:10.280> mold

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
leverage that I can get on the mold

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.460 
leverage that I can get on the mold
compound<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:12.000> spread<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.599> get<00:02:12.750> my<00:02:12.870> blade<00:02:13.170> in

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
compound to spread it to get my blade in

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.000 
compound to spread it to get my blade in
there

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
there

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.580 
there
now<00:02:16.099> just<00:02:17.099> keep<00:02:17.659> cutting<00:02:18.659> those<00:02:18.930> ripple<00:02:19.349> cuts

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
now just keep cutting those ripple cuts

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.530 
now just keep cutting those ripple cuts
and<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.920> flat<00:02:20.159> cuts<00:02:20.489> to<00:02:20.760> open<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.360> mold<00:02:23.540> you

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
and the flat cuts to open the mold you

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.320 
and the flat cuts to open the mold you
can<00:02:24.750> see<00:02:25.049> the<00:02:25.680> cuts<00:02:26.400> going<00:02:26.730> all<00:02:26.879> the<00:02:27.000> way<00:02:27.030> down

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
can see the cuts going all the way down

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.729 
can see the cuts going all the way down
through<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.629> mold<00:02:27.930> now<00:02:28.260> I'm<00:02:28.470> actually

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
through the mold now I'm actually

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.690 
through the mold now I'm actually
cutting<00:02:29.129> right<00:02:29.549> next<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.629> head<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.700> you

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
cutting right next to the head and you

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.680 
cutting right next to the head and you
can<00:02:32.879> see<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:35.040> blade<00:02:35.340> going<00:02:35.790> right<00:02:36.000> past<00:02:36.030> the

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
can see the blade going right past the

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.339 
can see the blade going right past the
head<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:37.920> cutting<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.849> bottom<00:02:39.299> part<00:02:39.840> of<00:02:40.110> the

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
head and cutting the bottom part of the

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.550 
head and cutting the bottom part of the
mold<00:02:40.590> open<00:02:41.209> now<00:02:42.209> I'll<00:02:42.390> take<00:02:42.599> the<00:02:42.840> sprue<00:02:43.260> out

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
mold open now I'll take the sprue out

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.280 
mold open now I'll take the sprue out
the<00:02:43.829> rubber<00:02:44.069> sprue<00:02:44.430> just<00:02:44.700> pull<00:02:44.879> it<00:02:44.970> right<00:02:45.120> off

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
the rubber sprue just pull it right off

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.229 
the rubber sprue just pull it right off
and<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.709> see<00:02:46.860> a<00:02:46.890> close-up<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.760> head<00:02:47.970> and

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
and you see a close-up of the head and

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.819 
and you see a close-up of the head and
I'll<00:02:48.390> reach<00:02:48.629> right<00:02:48.900> in<00:02:49.019> there<00:02:49.200> with<00:02:49.319> my<00:02:49.530> blade

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
I'll reach right in there with my blade

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.509 
I'll reach right in there with my blade
and<00:02:50.040> cut<00:02:50.940> that<00:02:51.360> tongue<00:02:51.810> of<00:02:52.140> our<00:02:52.560> TV<00:02:53.220> rubber

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
and cut that tongue of our TV rubber

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.610 
and cut that tongue of our TV rubber
that<00:02:54.120> goes<00:02:54.329> inside<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.230> head<00:02:55.440> freeing<00:02:56.400> it

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
that goes inside the head freeing it

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.069 
that goes inside the head freeing it
next<00:02:58.620> I'll<00:02:58.799> cut<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.670> bye<00:03:00.239> cut<00:03:00.660> all<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.989> way

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
next I'll cut the bye cut all the way

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.770 
next I'll cut the bye cut all the way
around<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.620> head<00:03:01.769> and<00:03:02.040> next<00:03:02.730> I'm<00:03:02.879> now<00:03:03.329> cutting

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
around the head and next I'm now cutting

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.650 
around the head and next I'm now cutting
the<00:03:04.349> two<00:03:04.620> halves<00:03:05.129> of<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.489> mold<00:03:05.609> apart<00:03:06.480> these

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
the two halves of the mold apart these

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.110 
the two halves of the mold apart these
are<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:06.989> last<00:03:07.200> cuts<00:03:07.650> in<00:03:07.920> this<00:03:08.549> whole<00:03:08.790> series

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
are the last cuts in this whole series

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.809 
are the last cuts in this whole series
of<00:03:09.510> cuts<00:03:09.780> so<00:03:10.470> you<00:03:10.560> can<00:03:10.739> see<00:03:10.950> on<00:03:11.129> the<00:03:11.280> right<00:03:11.489> the

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
of cuts so you can see on the right the

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.210 
of cuts so you can see on the right the
bottom<00:03:12.030> of<00:03:12.329> the<00:03:12.450> mold<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:12.840> on<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.379> left<00:03:13.620> the

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
bottom of the mold and on the left the

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.770 
bottom of the mold and on the left the
top<00:03:14.250> of<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.760> mold<00:03:14.970> what<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.359> head<00:03:15.510> still

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
top of the mold what the head still

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.930 
top of the mold what the head still
stuck<00:03:16.079> in<00:03:16.290> it<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:17.040> head<00:03:17.220> is<00:03:17.340> stuck<00:03:17.609> in<00:03:17.790> there

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
stuck in it the head is stuck in there

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.569 
stuck in it the head is stuck in there
so<00:03:17.970> I<00:03:18.180> have<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:18.720> make<00:03:19.319> some<00:03:19.590> release<00:03:19.980> cuts<00:03:20.310> and

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
so I have to make some release cuts and

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.970 
so I have to make some release cuts and
I<00:03:21.090> choose<00:03:21.329> to<00:03:21.450> make<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:21.810> release<00:03:22.109> cuts<00:03:22.470> along

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
I choose to make the release cuts along

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.000 
I choose to make the release cuts along
the<00:03:23.160> edges<00:03:23.700> or<00:03:23.970> off<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:24.870> corners<00:03:25.319> of<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.769> head

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
the edges or off the corners of the head

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.420 
the edges or off the corners of the head
this<00:03:26.579> will<00:03:26.819> also<00:03:27.030> help<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.930> injection<00:03:28.859> wax<00:03:29.130> to

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
this will also help the injection wax to

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.849 
this will also help the injection wax to
come<00:03:29.609> out<00:03:29.760> of<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:30.000> mold<00:03:30.180> after<00:03:30.630> it's<00:03:31.200> injected

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
come out of the mold after it's injected

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.990 
come out of the mold after it's injected
but<00:03:32.430> once<00:03:32.669> I've<00:03:33.260> freed<00:03:34.260> up<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.470> mole<00:03:34.829> the<00:03:35.099> head

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
but once I've freed up the mole the head

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.930 
but once I've freed up the mole the head
with<00:03:36.569> the<00:03:36.660> release<00:03:36.959> cuts<00:03:37.260> then<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.519> model

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
with the release cuts then the model

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.099 
with the release cuts then the model
will<00:03:39.120> come<00:03:39.720> out<00:03:39.950> so<00:03:40.950> this<00:03:41.370> RP<00:03:41.940> model<00:03:42.720> despite

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
will come out so this RP model despite

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.559 
will come out so this RP model despite
it<00:03:43.230> being<00:03:43.260> fragile<00:03:43.709> can<00:03:44.669> be<00:03:44.790> used<00:03:45.000> over<00:03:45.329> again

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
it being fragile can be used over again

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.559 
it being fragile can be used over again
so<00:03:46.169> there's<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.590> finished<00:03:46.919> mold<00:03:47.130> I<00:03:47.569> powder

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
so there's the finished mold I powder

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.900 
so there's the finished mold I powder
the<00:03:49.019> outside<00:03:49.650> of<00:03:49.799> the<00:03:49.919> mold<00:03:50.099> only<00:03:50.579> not<00:03:50.880> the

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
the outside of the mold only not the

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.539 
the outside of the mold only not the
inside<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:51.750> put<00:03:52.590> it<00:03:52.680> inside<00:03:53.040> of<00:03:53.099> a<00:03:53.280> film

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
inside and put it inside of a film

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.059 
inside and put it inside of a film
canister<00:03:53.819> and<00:03:54.269> then<00:03:54.810> I<00:03:54.900> push<00:03:55.139> it<00:03:55.290> up<00:03:55.500> against

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
canister and then I push it up against

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.610 
canister and then I push it up against
the<00:03:56.130> nozzle<00:03:56.790> on<00:03:56.940> my<00:03:57.150> wax<00:03:57.329> injector<00:03:57.930> fill<00:03:58.470> it

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
the nozzle on my wax injector fill it

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.589 
the nozzle on my wax injector fill it
with<00:03:58.739> wax<00:03:58.950> and<00:03:59.370> oops<00:03:59.760> there's<00:04:00.060> a<00:04:00.150> little<00:04:00.480> bit

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
with wax and oops there's a little bit

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.150 
with wax and oops there's a little bit
too<00:04:00.780> high<00:04:00.930> of<00:04:00.989> a<00:04:01.079> pressure<00:04:01.379> on<00:04:01.530> that<00:04:01.769> injection

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
too high of a pressure on that injection

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.780 
too high of a pressure on that injection
but<00:04:02.879> then<00:04:03.720> we<00:04:03.900> can<00:04:04.109> peel<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:05.010> two<00:04:05.220> halves<00:04:05.579> of

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
but then we can peel the two halves of

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.220 
but then we can peel the two halves of
the<00:04:06.329> mold<00:04:06.480> apart<00:04:07.139> and<00:04:08.090> I<00:04:09.090> take<00:04:09.359> that<00:04:09.389> one<00:04:09.900> half

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
the mold apart and I take that one half
