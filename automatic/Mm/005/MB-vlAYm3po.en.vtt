00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
you learn but in essence when we want to

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.889 
you learn but in essence when we want to
start<00:00:47.370> connecting<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.059> music<00:00:48.480> we<00:00:48.629> want<00:00:48.840> to

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
start connecting to the music we want to

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.380 
start connecting to the music we want to
break<00:00:49.140> those<00:00:49.440> up<00:00:49.469> even<00:00:50.010> further<00:00:50.280> into<00:00:50.969> two

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
break those up even further into two

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.510 
break those up even further into two
beats<00:00:51.629> at<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> time<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.070> past<00:00:53.280> two

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
beats at a time and so the past two

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.369 
beats at a time and so the past two
weeks<00:00:53.550> we've<00:00:53.969> been<00:00:54.120> working<00:00:54.510> on<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.989> figure

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
weeks we've been working on a figure

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.709 
weeks we've been working on a figure
where<00:00:55.680> we<00:00:55.829> can<00:00:56.039> do<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.940> what<00:00:57.149> we<00:00:57.270> started

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
where we can do that so what we started

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.170 
where we can do that so what we started
with<00:00:57.899> was<00:00:58.230> we're<00:00:58.800> letting<00:00:59.129> go<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.340> our<00:00:59.730> basic

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
with was we're letting go of our basic

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.599 
with was we're letting go of our basic
triple<00:01:00.600> step<00:01:00.840> starter<00:01:01.379> steps<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.340> this

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
triple step starter steps and so this

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.479 
triple step starter steps and so this
starter<00:01:03.000> step<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> point<00:01:03.989> step<00:01:04.439> instead<00:01:05.339> of

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
starter step is a point step instead of

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.590 
starter step is a point step instead of
a<00:01:05.580> triple<00:01:05.909> triple

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
a triple triple

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.310 
a triple triple
so<00:01:07.229> we're<00:01:07.439> doing<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.920> point<00:01:08.460> step<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.869> point

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
so we're doing a point step and a point

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.100 
so we're doing a point step and a point
step<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.640> leaders<00:01:11.970> what<00:01:12.240> I'm<00:01:12.360> doing<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.020> I'm

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
step so leaders what I'm doing and I'm

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.380 
step so leaders what I'm doing and I'm
gonna<00:01:13.290> turn<00:01:13.530> w<00:01:13.950> this<00:01:14.100> way<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:15.060> order<00:01:15.270> to

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
gonna turn w this way is in order to

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.200 
gonna turn w this way is in order to
lead<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.960> I'm<00:01:16.290> bringing<00:01:17.070> her<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:17.549> weeded

onto her left foot and I'm on my right

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.160 
onto her left foot and I'm on my right
foot<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.970> way<00:01:21.030> she<00:01:21.570> knows<00:01:21.780> she's<00:01:22.140> not

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
foot this way she knows she's not

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.260 
foot this way she knows she's not
stepping<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.130> right<00:01:23.400> like<00:01:23.640> she<00:01:23.880> normally

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
stepping to the right like she normally

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.330 
stepping to the right like she normally
would<00:01:24.450> for<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.750> start<00:01:25.140> for<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.439> typical<00:01:25.740> starter

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
would for a start for a typical starter

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.460 
would for a start for a typical starter
and<00:01:26.549> I'm<00:01:26.909> gonna<00:01:27.090> lead<00:01:27.360> her<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.780> point<00:01:28.170> and

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
and I'm gonna lead her in a point and

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.789 
and I'm gonna lead her in a point and
then<00:01:28.890> step<00:01:29.250> point<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.299> then<00:01:30.509> step<00:01:30.810> point<00:01:31.560> and

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
then step point and then step point and

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.490 
then step point and then step point and
then<00:01:31.979> step<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:33.210> what<00:01:33.630> we're<00:01:33.810> doing<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.290> we're

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
then step so what we're doing is we're

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.859 
then step so what we're doing is we're
taking<00:01:34.799> these<00:01:34.950> two<00:01:35.250> beats<00:01:35.520> at<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:36.030> time<00:01:36.420> and

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
taking these two beats at a time and

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.170 
taking these two beats at a time and
listening<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.189> music<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.850> phrase

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
listening to the music and the phrase

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.230 
listening to the music and the phrase
changes<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.310> then<00:01:41.340> lead<00:01:41.820> her<00:01:42.000> into

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
changes so that I can then lead her into

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.270 
changes so that I can then lead her into
something<00:01:42.450> new<00:01:42.899> when<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.409> hear<00:01:43.950> something

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
something new when I hear something

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.609 
something new when I hear something
change<00:01:44.820> in<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.149> music<00:01:45.470> typically<00:01:46.470> the

change in the music typically the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.440 
change in the music typically the
changes<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.280> music<00:01:47.430> happen<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.360> the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
changes in the music happen in the

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.630 
changes in the music happen in the
phrases<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.619> don't<00:01:49.950> need<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.220> count<00:01:50.399> to

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
phrases so I don't need to count to

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.310 
phrases so I don't need to count to
eight

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
eight

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.680 
eight
don't<00:01:51.470> need<00:01:51.620> to<00:01:51.710> count<00:01:51.980> to<00:01:52.100> sixteen<00:01:52.670> I<00:01:53.000> just

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
don't need to count to sixteen I just

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.180 
don't need to count to sixteen I just
want<00:01:53.900> to<00:01:53.990> listen<00:01:54.200> to<00:01:54.440> the<00:01:54.530> music<00:01:54.680> and<00:01:55.010> what

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
want to listen to the music and what

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.940 
want to listen to the music and what
changes<00:01:55.760> and<00:01:56.000> that's<00:01:56.150> gonna<00:01:56.420> be<00:01:56.660> my<00:01:56.810> cue<00:01:56.950> that

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
changes and that's gonna be my cue that

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.490 
changes and that's gonna be my cue that
the<00:01:58.010> new<00:01:58.370> phrase<00:01:58.700> is<00:01:58.940> starting<00:01:59.390> so<00:01:59.900> my<00:02:00.080> starter

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
the new phrase is starting so my starter

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.460 
the new phrase is starting so my starter
stem<00:02:00.770> is<00:02:00.980> going<00:02:01.190> to<00:02:01.250> be<00:02:01.430> a<00:02:01.760> point<00:02:02.630> step<00:02:03.170> in<00:02:03.380> this

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
stem is going to be a point step in this

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.720 
stem is going to be a point step in this
case<00:02:03.740> just<00:02:03.980> because<00:02:04.220> when<00:02:04.400> you<00:02:04.460> hear<00:02:04.610> the

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
case just because when you hear the

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.250 
case just because when you hear the
music<00:02:04.850> you'll<00:02:05.210> see<00:02:05.420> why<00:02:05.570> that<00:02:05.600> makes<00:02:05.930> sense

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
music you'll see why that makes sense

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.370 
music you'll see why that makes sense
and<00:02:06.500> then<00:02:07.130> I'm<00:02:07.340> going<00:02:07.490> to<00:02:07.550> do<00:02:07.760> a<00:02:08.110> starter<00:02:09.110> step

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
and then I'm going to do a starter step

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.830 
and then I'm going to do a starter step
slower<00:02:09.740> throw<00:02:10.130> out<00:02:10.310> with<00:02:10.670> her<00:02:10.910> so<00:02:11.450> I'm<00:02:11.630> going

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
slower throw out with her so I'm going

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.340 
slower throw out with her so I'm going
to<00:02:11.930> listen<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:12.440> music<00:02:12.650> as<00:02:13.130> I<00:02:13.370> point<00:02:13.700> step

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
to listen to the music as I point step

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.600 
to listen to the music as I point step
her<00:02:15.350> back<00:02:15.620> is<00:02:15.830> in<00:02:15.980> my<00:02:16.130> hand

we're cushy in this starter step and

I'm going to lead a series of whole ball
changes<00:02:55.100> or<00:02:55.340> a<00:02:55.370> bump<00:02:55.820> we've<00:02:56.390> been<00:02:56.600> calling

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
changes or a bump we've been calling

changes or a bump we've been calling
them<00:02:57.050> bump<00:02:57.350> backs<00:02:57.620> so<00:02:58.340> we're<00:02:58.519> doing<00:02:58.640> bump

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
them bump backs so we're doing bump

we<00:03:09.019> move<00:03:09.230> through<00:03:09.530> that<00:03:09.709> series<00:03:10.040> I'm<00:03:10.430> doing

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
we move through that series I'm doing

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.370 
we move through that series I'm doing
this<00:03:10.970> because<00:03:11.209> I<00:03:11.540> hear<00:03:11.810> something<00:03:12.230> in<00:03:12.350> the

changes with the bump backs and I'm
leading<00:03:31.070> her<00:03:31.220> out<00:03:31.400> with<00:03:31.670> something<00:03:32.090> changes

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
leading her out with something changes

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.820 
leading her out with something changes
so<00:03:32.690> it<00:03:32.780> looks<00:03:32.989> a<00:03:33.080> little<00:03:33.200> bit<00:03:33.410> like<00:03:33.620> this

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
so it looks a little bit like this

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:46.640 
so it looks a little bit like this
everywhere

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.910 

so<00:03:47.650> I'm<00:03:47.740> listening<00:03:48.160> to<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.460> change<00:03:48.790> here<00:03:49.920> I'm

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
so I'm listening to the change here I'm

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.550 
so I'm listening to the change here I'm
listening<00:03:53.490> it's<00:03:54.490> kind<00:03:54.850> of<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:55.060> same<00:03:55.320> so<00:03:56.320> I<00:03:56.350> did

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
listening it's kind of the same so I did

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.210 
listening it's kind of the same so I did
a<00:03:56.590> regular<00:03:56.860> sure<00:03:57.960> now<00:03:58.960> I<00:03:58.990> hear<00:03:59.410> something

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
a regular sure now I hear something

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:07.880 
a regular sure now I hear something
changing<00:04:03.690> so<00:04:04.690> I'm<00:04:04.780> still<00:04:05.110> listening

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:22.830 
it's all the same so I'm sticking with
these<00:04:10.080> for<00:04:10.440> now<00:04:15.650> now<00:04:16.650> I<00:04:16.680> hear<00:04:17.070> a<00:04:17.100> little<00:04:17.340> change

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.800 

havens<00:04:23.840> are<00:04:23.990> listening<00:04:24.500> to<00:04:24.710> the<00:04:24.800> music<00:04:25.810> and

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
havens are listening to the music and

I'm taking something like a with their
little<00:04:48.020> brain<00:04:48.230> dead<00:04:48.470> but<00:04:48.740> they<00:04:48.860> have<00:04:49.040> a<00:04:49.070> lot<00:04:49.250> of

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
little brain dead but they have a lot of

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.420 
little brain dead but they have a lot of
fun<00:04:49.520> so<00:04:50.150> you<00:04:50.750> can<00:04:50.900> see<00:04:51.110> how<00:04:51.290> Debbie<00:04:51.530> responded

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
fun so you can see how Debbie responded

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.760 
fun so you can see how Debbie responded
every<00:04:52.790> two<00:04:53.000> beats<00:04:53.270> as<00:04:53.630> I<00:04:53.990> was<00:04:54.170> moving<00:04:54.440> through

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
every two beats as I was moving through

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.460 
every two beats as I was moving through
that<00:04:54.800> music<00:04:55.100> and<00:04:55.610> so<00:04:56.210> as<00:04:56.540> I<00:04:56.810> was<00:04:56.990> listening<00:04:57.170> to

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
that music and so as I was listening to

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.200 
that music and so as I was listening to
the<00:04:57.710> music<00:04:57.860> I<00:04:58.220> was<00:04:58.340> leading<00:04:58.610> her<00:04:58.970> and

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
the music I was leading her and

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.570 
the music I was leading her and
something<00:04:59.990> that<00:05:00.140> I<00:05:00.200> wanted<00:05:00.710> to<00:05:00.920> interpret<00:05:01.400> to

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
something that I wanted to interpret to

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.150 
something that I wanted to interpret to
the<00:05:01.730> music<00:05:02.120> so<00:05:02.570> instead<00:05:02.840> of<00:05:02.900> tying<00:05:03.290> myself<00:05:03.920> to

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
the music so instead of tying myself to

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.120 
the music so instead of tying myself to
a<00:05:04.370> beat<00:05:04.640> or<00:05:05.000> six<00:05:05.840> feet<00:05:06.050> figure<00:05:06.500> an<00:05:06.710> eight<00:05:06.920> beat

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
a beat or six feet figure an eight beat

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.340 
a beat or six feet figure an eight beat
figure<00:05:07.460> I'm<00:05:07.820> instead<00:05:08.300> thinking<00:05:08.810> what<00:05:09.110> am<00:05:09.230> i

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
figure I'm instead thinking what am i

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.920 
figure I'm instead thinking what am i
hearing<00:05:09.620> and<00:05:09.980> what<00:05:10.220> can<00:05:10.430> I<00:05:10.550> lead<00:05:10.820> her<00:05:11.090> in<00:05:11.300> so

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
hearing and what can I lead her in so

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.850 
hearing and what can I lead her in so
that<00:05:12.140> she<00:05:12.560> and<00:05:13.400> I<00:05:13.640> get<00:05:14.000> to<00:05:14.120> partner<00:05:14.540> together

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
that she and I get to partner together

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.980 
that she and I get to partner together
to<00:05:15.860> the<00:05:16.010> music<00:05:16.460> so<00:05:16.880> it's<00:05:17.030> not<00:05:17.120> just<00:05:17.180> partnering

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
to the music so it's not just partnering

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.430 
to the music so it's not just partnering
with<00:05:18.230> each<00:05:18.920> other<00:05:19.190> we're<00:05:19.760> also<00:05:20.170> partnering<00:05:21.170> to

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
with each other we're also partnering to

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.280 
with each other we're also partnering to
the<00:05:21.530> music<00:05:21.920> so<00:05:22.340> West<00:05:23.180> Coast<00:05:23.360> Swing<00:05:23.450> happens<00:05:24.020> to

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
the music so West Coast Swing happens to

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.350 
the music so West Coast Swing happens to
bits<00:05:24.470> at<00:05:24.590> a<00:05:24.620> time<00:05:24.710> you<00:05:25.580> can<00:05:25.610> splice<00:05:26.090> the

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
bits at a time you can splice the

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.450 
bits at a time you can splice the
figures<00:05:26.660> just<00:05:26.900> like<00:05:27.080> we<00:05:27.230> did<00:05:27.380> with<00:05:27.530> the<00:05:27.590> web<00:05:27.890> so

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
figures just like we did with the web so

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.800 
figures just like we did with the web so
in<00:05:28.580> the<00:05:28.670> WIMP<00:05:28.880> you<00:05:29.030> have<00:05:29.210> an<00:05:29.330> option<00:05:29.720> of

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
in the WIMP you have an option of

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.870 
in the WIMP you have an option of
stopping<00:05:30.290> in<00:05:30.410> the<00:05:30.440> middle<00:05:30.830> and<00:05:31.040> doing<00:05:31.730> the

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
stopping in the middle and doing the

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.380 
stopping in the middle and doing the
bump<00:05:32.060> acts<00:05:32.300> here<00:05:32.690> and<00:05:33.490> then<00:05:34.490> we<00:05:34.610> also<00:05:34.820> have<00:05:35.210> the

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
bump acts here and then we also have the

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.520 
bump acts here and then we also have the
opportunity<00:05:36.110> to<00:05:36.650> do<00:05:36.800> a<00:05:36.830> whip<00:05:38.080> staying<00:05:39.080> closed

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
opportunity to do a whip staying closed

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:45.970 
opportunity to do a whip staying closed
and<00:05:40.210> then<00:05:41.210> bone<00:05:42.340> and<00:05:43.340> my<00:05:44.060> choice<00:05:44.800> to<00:05:45.800> do<00:05:45.950> that

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:45.980 
and then bone and my choice to do that

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.450 
and then bone and my choice to do that
is<00:05:46.520> going<00:05:46.790> to<00:05:46.970> be<00:05:47.120> the<00:05:47.840> music<00:05:48.260> what<00:05:48.920> I<00:05:48.950> hear<00:05:49.310> in

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
is going to be the music what I hear in

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.580 
is going to be the music what I hear in
the<00:05:49.490> music<00:05:49.670> so<00:05:50.330> I<00:05:50.360> would<00:05:50.720> choose<00:05:51.020> to<00:05:51.260> splice

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
the music so I would choose to splice

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.620 
the music so I would choose to splice
the<00:05:51.650> whip<00:05:52.070> if<00:05:52.250> I<00:05:52.400> heard<00:05:52.610> a<00:05:52.730> change<00:05:53.060> at<00:05:53.390> that

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
the whip if I heard a change at that

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.720 
the whip if I heard a change at that
point<00:05:53.990> in<00:05:54.110> the<00:05:54.200> music<00:05:54.590> and<00:05:54.770> stop<00:05:55.430> in<00:05:55.610> the

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:55.730 
point in the music and stop in the

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.330 
point in the music and stop in the
middle<00:05:55.970> of<00:05:56.060> the<00:05:56.150> whip<00:05:56.330> or<00:05:56.740> if<00:05:57.740> I<00:05:57.890> didn't<00:05:58.160> hear<00:05:58.310> a

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
middle of the whip or if I didn't hear a

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.370 
middle of the whip or if I didn't hear a
change<00:05:58.610> till<00:05:58.910> the<00:05:59.000> end<00:05:59.180> of<00:05:59.300> the<00:05:59.420> whip<00:05:59.600> and<00:05:59.870> then

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
change till the end of the whip and then

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.750 
change till the end of the whip and then
I<00:06:00.440> heard<00:06:00.710> the<00:06:00.860> change<00:06:01.130> at<00:06:01.250> the<00:06:01.280> end<00:06:01.400> I<00:06:01.700> would

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
I heard the change at the end I would

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.970 
I heard the change at the end I would
keep<00:06:02.030> her<00:06:02.210> in<00:06:02.330> close<00:06:02.570> position<00:06:02.870> and<00:06:03.410> do<00:06:03.860> the

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:03.980 
keep her in close position and do the

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.390 
keep her in close position and do the
bumps<00:06:04.310> in<00:06:04.550> that<00:06:05.210> way<00:06:05.420> okay<00:06:06.080> so<00:06:06.560> to<00:06:06.620> review<00:06:06.890> we

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
bumps in that way okay so to review we

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.850 
bumps in that way okay so to review we
have<00:06:08.000> the<00:06:08.150> opportunity<00:06:08.780> to<00:06:08.990> stop<00:06:09.290> doing<00:06:09.710> a

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
have the opportunity to stop doing a
