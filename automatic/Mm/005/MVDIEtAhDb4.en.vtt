00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
something along the lines of that and

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.300 
something along the lines of that and
that<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.049> problem<00:01:13.350> for<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.680> lot<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.890> people

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
that is a problem for a lot of people

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.010 
that is a problem for a lot of people
but<00:01:14.490> there<00:01:14.670> have<00:01:14.940> been<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.240> few<00:01:15.360> people<00:01:15.840> on

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
but there have been a few people on

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.560 
but there have been a few people on
YouTube<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.740> have<00:01:16.979> made<00:01:17.640> videos<00:01:18.060> on<00:01:18.299> how<00:01:18.540> to

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
YouTube that have made videos on how to

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.180 
YouTube that have made videos on how to
bypass<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.440> and<00:01:20.010> how<00:01:20.730> to<00:01:21.680> basically<00:01:22.680> record

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
bypass that and how to basically record

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.210 
bypass that and how to basically record
on<00:01:23.550> the<00:01:23.880> ps4<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:24.780> there<00:01:25.530> are<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> couple<00:01:25.920> ways

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
on the ps4 so there are a couple ways

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.560 
on the ps4 so there are a couple ways
and<00:01:26.780> will<00:01:27.780> this<00:01:27.930> hurt<00:01:28.260> us<00:01:28.440> in<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.680> long<00:01:28.710> run<00:01:28.920> I

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
and will this hurt us in the long run I

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.820 
and will this hurt us in the long run I
probably<00:01:30.570> don't<00:01:30.780> think<00:01:31.080> so<00:01:31.260> because<00:01:31.290> we'll

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
probably don't think so because we'll

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.400 
probably don't think so because we'll
find<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.190> way<00:01:32.490> around<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.420> one<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.230> the<00:01:34.380> ways

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
find a way around it and one of the ways

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.460 
find a way around it and one of the ways
is<00:01:34.770> getting<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.220> hdmi<00:01:36.000> splitter<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.630> using

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
is getting a hdmi splitter and using

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.780 
is getting a hdmi splitter and using
that<00:01:37.500> as<00:01:37.800> a<00:01:37.920> way<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.100> bypass<00:01:38.760> the<00:01:39.150> hdcp<00:01:40.110> and

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
that as a way to bypass the hdcp and

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.250 
that as a way to bypass the hdcp and
there<00:01:41.790> are<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.000> couple<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.720> ways<00:01:42.900> i'm<00:01:43.110> not

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
there are a couple of the ways i'm not

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.290 
there are a couple of the ways i'm not
sure<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.500> how<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:44.160> works<00:01:44.430> but<00:01:44.580> i<00:01:44.790> know<00:01:44.970> that

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
sure of how that works but i know that

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.410 
sure of how that works but i know that
one<00:01:45.690> with<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.230> hdmi<00:01:46.800> splitter<00:01:47.130> works<00:01:47.610> and

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
one with the hdmi splitter works and

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.390 
one with the hdmi splitter works and
yeah<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.080> guys<00:01:49.320> will<00:01:49.590> be<00:01:49.710> able<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:50.100> record

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
yeah you guys will be able to record

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.940 
yeah you guys will be able to record
stuff<00:01:50.940> and<00:01:51.330> i'll<00:01:51.570> have<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.990> video<00:01:52.260> link<00:01:52.650> to

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
the one of the people who has the videos

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.110 
the one of the people who has the videos
on<00:01:56.640> this<00:01:57.030> how-to<00:01:57.300> and<00:01:58.280> yeah<00:01:59.280> another<00:01:59.790> thing<00:02:00.090> is

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
on this how-to and yeah another thing is

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.990 
on this how-to and yeah another thing is
we<00:02:00.570> have<00:02:00.780> an<00:02:01.020> HD<00:02:01.380> PVR<00:02:01.590> which<00:02:02.190> is<00:02:02.370> a<00:02:02.400> big<00:02:02.760> problem

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
we have an HD PVR which is a big problem

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.970 
we have an HD PVR which is a big problem
because<00:02:03.330> these<00:02:03.630> next-gen<00:02:04.080> consoles<00:02:04.590> run<00:02:04.860> on

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
because these next-gen consoles run on

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:05.770 
because these next-gen consoles run on
HTM

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
HTM

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.639 
HTM
and<00:02:06.430> the<00:02:07.430> HD<00:02:08.060> PVR<00:02:08.090> that<00:02:08.720> we<00:02:08.810> have<00:02:08.929> right<00:02:09.140> now<00:02:09.200> it

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
and the HD PVR that we have right now it

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.610 
and the HD PVR that we have right now it
only<00:02:09.830> has<00:02:10.130> component<00:02:10.789> and<00:02:10.940> I'm<00:02:11.630> pretty<00:02:12.319> sure

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
only has component and I'm pretty sure

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.360 
only has component and I'm pretty sure
the<00:02:12.920> ps4<00:02:13.490> dozen<00:02:14.060> or<00:02:15.050> isn't<00:02:15.500> compatible<00:02:15.860> with

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
the ps4 dozen or isn't compatible with

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.059 
the ps4 dozen or isn't compatible with
the<00:02:17.050> component<00:02:18.050> cables<00:02:18.440> that<00:02:18.590> we<00:02:18.680> have<00:02:18.830> for

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
the component cables that we have for

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.479 
the component cables that we have for
the<00:02:19.250> HD<00:02:19.730> PVR<00:02:19.760> so<00:02:20.450> we're<00:02:21.230> gonna<00:02:21.380> have<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.650> try<00:02:22.430> to

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
the HD PVR so we're gonna have to try to

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.809 
the HD PVR so we're gonna have to try to
save<00:02:22.700> up<00:02:22.910> for<00:02:23.270> an<00:02:23.650> elgato<00:02:24.650> AC<00:02:24.920> game<00:02:25.310> cap<00:02:25.580> or

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
save up for an elgato AC game cap or

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.470 
save up for an elgato AC game cap or
something<00:02:26.540> else<00:02:27.050> that<00:02:27.260> also<00:02:28.190> records<00:02:28.640> an<00:02:28.760> HDMI

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
something else that also records an HDMI

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.740
