however what we have here on the screen
is<00:00:46.379> extremely<00:00:47.160> interesting<00:00:47.520> because<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:48.059> is

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
is extremely interesting because this is

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.990 
is extremely interesting because this is
a<00:00:48.210> point<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.750> an<00:00:48.960> apartment<00:00:49.410> creator<00:00:49.980> now<00:00:50.789> if

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
a point to an apartment creator now if

and<00:01:04.170> along<00:01:04.409> with<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> content<00:01:05.309> creator<00:01:06.020> there

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
and along with the content creator there

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.539 
and along with the content creator there
is<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.350> captcha<00:01:07.710> crater<00:01:07.979> which<00:01:08.130> came<00:01:08.310> out<00:01:08.430> a

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
is the captcha crater which came out a

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.820 
is the captcha crater which came out a
few<00:01:08.580> days<00:01:09.060> ago<00:01:09.320> this<00:01:10.320> allows<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.740> create

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
few days ago this allows you to create

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.350 
few days ago this allows you to create
missions<00:01:11.250> create<00:01:11.549> your<00:01:11.610> own<00:01:11.700> jobs<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.240> then

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
missions create your own jobs and then

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.149 
missions create your own jobs and then
share<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.930> have<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> chance<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.680> be<00:01:13.770> verified

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
share and have the chance to be verified

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.370 
share and have the chance to be verified
now<00:01:14.850> this<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.180> think<00:01:15.390> will<00:01:15.659> be<00:01:15.780> used<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.140> little

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
now this I think will be used a little

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.810 
now this I think will be used a little
bit<00:01:16.470> differently<00:01:16.890> perhaps<00:01:17.130> not<00:01:17.520> through<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
bit differently perhaps not through the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.240 
bit differently perhaps not through the
content<00:01:18.360> crater<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.470> online<00:01:19.650> section

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
content crater in the online section

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.710 
content crater in the online section
perhaps<00:01:20.520> we'll<00:01:20.729> be<00:01:20.759> able<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.150> just<00:01:21.240> customize

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
perhaps we'll be able to just customize

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.530 
perhaps we'll be able to just customize
our<00:01:21.869> apartment<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.439> our<00:01:22.740> apartment<00:01:23.540> similar

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
our apartment in our apartment similar

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.060 
our apartment in our apartment similar
to<00:01:24.659> maybe<00:01:24.900> what<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.619> do<00:01:25.740> in<00:01:25.830> The<00:01:25.920> Sims

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
to maybe what this you do in The Sims

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.740 
to maybe what this you do in The Sims
you<00:01:26.280> can<00:01:26.520> pull<00:01:26.700> up<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.880> menu<00:01:27.030> perhaps<00:01:27.450> go<00:01:27.600> into

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
you can pull up a menu perhaps go into

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.510 
you can pull up a menu perhaps go into
our<00:01:27.840> planning<00:01:28.140> room<00:01:28.290> or<00:01:28.380> something<00:01:28.710> edit

with<00:01:42.270> coding<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:43.079> not<00:01:43.320> really<00:01:43.470> my<00:01:43.619> forte

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
with coding it's not really my forte

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.730

I<00:01:45.000> like<00:01:45.920> making<00:01:46.920> games<00:01:47.430> if<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:48.030> can<00:01:48.330> but<00:01:48.690> code<00:01:49.530> in

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
I like making games if I can but code in

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.060 
I like making games if I can but code in
sort<00:01:50.190> of<00:01:50.250> like<00:01:50.460> XCX<00:01:51.270> isn't<00:01:51.690> really<00:01:52.070> something

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
sort of like XCX isn't really something

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.640 
sort of like XCX isn't really something

me the comments section below if you

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.150 
me the comments section below if you
think<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:00.960> true<00:02:01.230> this<00:02:01.260> is<00:02:01.710> something<00:02:01.980> you

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
think this is true this is something you

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.180 
think this is true this is something you
can<00:02:02.340> see<00:02:03.410> yes<00:02:04.410> under<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.800> top<00:02:04.920> we<00:02:05.010> have<00:02:05.040> a

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
can see yes under the top we have a

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.430 
can see yes under the top we have a
partner<00:02:05.580> /<00:02:05.760> online<00:02:06.240> down<00:02:06.510> XCX<00:02:07.050> so<00:02:07.260> there's

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
partner / online down XCX so there's

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.169 
partner / online down XCX so there's
probably<00:02:07.500> in<00:02:07.860> excess<00:02:07.980> menu<00:02:08.550> or<00:02:08.640> something<00:02:09.030> I

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
probably in excess menu or something I

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.609 
probably in excess menu or something I
know<00:02:09.240> you<00:02:09.390> get<00:02:09.630> these<00:02:09.720> with<00:02:09.899> jtag<00:02:10.259> so<00:02:10.440> that's

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
know you get these with jtag so that's

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.590 
know you get these with jtag so that's
probably<00:02:10.830> nothing<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.430> do<00:02:11.550> with<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.820> I'm<00:02:12.240> again

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
probably nothing to do with it I'm again

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.540 
probably nothing to do with it I'm again
correct<00:02:12.870> me<00:02:13.080> if<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.380> am<00:02:13.410> wrong<00:02:13.530> but<00:02:13.950> this<00:02:14.430> is

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
correct me if I am wrong but this is

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.130 
correct me if I am wrong but this is
obviously<00:02:14.640> referring<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.330> apartment<00:02:15.930> for

obviously referring to apartment for

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.650 
obviously referring to apartment for
online<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:17.190> we<00:02:17.310> have<00:02:17.520> on<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.760> right<00:02:17.940> our<00:02:18.240> data

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.360 
online and we have on the right our data
and<00:02:18.959> then<00:02:19.020> number<00:02:19.410> so<00:02:19.620> this<00:02:19.890> is<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.130> data

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
and then number so this is the data

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.570

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
between each object on the right it says

confirmed<00:03:25.200> purchase<00:03:25.680> with<00:03:26.520> ps3<00:03:26.790> so<00:03:27.150> perhaps

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
confirmed purchase with ps3 so perhaps

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.900 
confirmed purchase with ps3 so perhaps
this<00:03:27.660> is<00:03:27.810> this<00:03:28.320> is<00:03:28.470> coding<00:03:28.830> from<00:03:28.950> ps3<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.880> the

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
this is this is coding from ps3 and the

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.150 
this is this is coding from ps3 and the
confirmed<00:03:30.870> purchase<00:03:31.320> is<00:03:31.530> you<00:03:31.710> have<00:03:31.860> to<00:03:31.980> buy

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
confirmed purchase is you have to buy

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.820 
confirmed purchase is you have to buy
each<00:03:32.460> object<00:03:32.730> so<00:03:33.570> you<00:03:34.050> might<00:03:34.260> have<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.440> amount

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
each object so you might have the amount

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.850
