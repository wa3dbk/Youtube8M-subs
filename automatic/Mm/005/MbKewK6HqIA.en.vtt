00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
my videos you see me do the incipio for

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.359 
my videos you see me do the incipio for
the<00:00:17.670> galaxy<00:00:18.029> note<00:00:18.060> 3<00:00:18.740> this<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.039> plexitone

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
the galaxy note 3 this is the plexitone

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.730 
the galaxy note 3 this is the plexitone
iam<00:00:20.699> joint<00:00:20.939> everybody<00:00:21.689> remember<00:00:22.050> that<00:00:22.080> but

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
now we got the plutonium joint for the

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.960 
now we got the plutonium joint for the
HTC<00:00:24.840> One<00:00:25.170> Maxx<00:00:25.490> so<00:00:26.490> let<00:00:26.580> me<00:00:26.670> pull<00:00:26.789> up<00:00:26.880> the

plutonium<00:00:52.140> alright<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:53.010> one<00:00:53.070> has<00:00:53.280> Plex

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
plutonium alright so this one has Plex

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.910 
plutonium alright so this one has Plex
tone<00:00:54.180> iam<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.539> plutonium<00:00:55.079> now<00:00:55.649> if<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.829> don't

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
tone iam and plutonium now if you don't

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.799 
tone iam and plutonium now if you don't
know<00:00:56.100> what<00:00:56.250> Plex<00:00:56.520> tone<00:00:56.730> iam<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.059> basically

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
know what Plex tone iam is basically

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.020 
know what Plex tone iam is basically
it's<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.109> material<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:59.010> Superman's<00:00:59.550> outfit
