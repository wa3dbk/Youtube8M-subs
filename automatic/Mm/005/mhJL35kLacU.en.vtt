00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.960
 Hello everyone, guys, subscribe 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.109
 on my channel and why do i say the beginning 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.849
 video but what's the difference here are the results 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.619
 past releases with command blocks and 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.079
 but now will be another table with 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.029
 block and today show how to build 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:28.399
 skyblock one team perth we need 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.789
 develop it somewhere levels of heaven can 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:34.430
 have time here in general the main thing that we 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:39.830
 in the fall even as broken in what 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:42.080
 were I think you are unlikely to craft 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.330
 diamond armor on sky blocks 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:49.580
 next we write such a command that is 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:50.930
 started with a slash set block on shift + 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.440
 and this is such a thing called 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.329
 signal boredom know sewing space shift + 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.400
 I am sewing space 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.260
 and of course shift the light in English 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.759
 do to English the further 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:07.030
 commands ground block and press enter here 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:10.189
 we remember the command head 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.619
 next we need the console command 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.869
 kill the one that is actually a thing well, reference 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.319
 on her in the description 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:24.679
 kill further I understand activate 

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:29.149
 the hole was understood now shame now 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:34.249
 somehow activate it yourself came up with 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:37.759
 as now while i figure it out i will deliver 

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:39.319
 pause after now attention I came up 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.030
 how to cut to install 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:42.280
 you can do it just like I did 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:50.480
 here 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:54.010
 team blog or sex block of ice 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:57.220
 typically much Generally cinema well and further 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.220
 redstone block 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.790
 giving a resume in general I am a sucker why immediately 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.810
 so i did i don't know and now we have 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.280
 our skyblock will be made 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:18.050
 the whole mechanism has become where we are 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:20.780
 was dropped here fell the trolley interesting 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.110
 get on farther he is there our skype of legs 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.390
 let's see what kind of cobbles are that 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:34.820
 they are inside ie you can either 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:36.770

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.390

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:43.730
 bearded not again oh which team 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.920
 It was carried out that the chicken faith I caught caught it 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.800
 principle of the sky block lying around you 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:53.470
 it will be easy to play it seems to me 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.470
 What it seems to be that there is a tree there 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:01.580
 more than you need to play sky block 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.060
 but then just try to fall and 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:12.359

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:19.000
 try well yes love base 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:21.629
 Well on there it just started 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.609
