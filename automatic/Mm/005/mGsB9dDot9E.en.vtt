00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 what would you do with 35 thousand reais more 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.630
 for a year buying a new car would do 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.670
 accounts travel parties well in 2011 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.940
 government has raised the record 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.460
 point 4 trillion reais represents 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.570
 approximately 35 thousand reais per family 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.039
 Brazilian 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.830
 but what if you did not win it all? 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.900
 This not everything you consume is taxed 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.810
 at all stages of production and therefore 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.849
 approximately 50% of the final value of 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.369
 each product goes straight to the coffers 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.860
 government, leaving everything more expensive to 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.870
 taxation is so blatant that the same 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.030
 car produced in Brazil is sold to 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.280
 our brothers for only fifteen thousand 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.559
 2 nd tax exemption 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.870
 And have you ever wondered where you are going? 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.480
 all that money now imagine that 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.190
 you could do with 35 thousand reais 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.079
 more for one year 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.390
 you could pay the rent of your 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.789
 flat pay for private school for 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.829
 two children a health plan so that 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.510
 You do not die on the south globe waiting 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.850
 by our service as well as our 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.890
 politicians do and yet you could 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.189
 do the shopping from the month to the whole year 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.900
 but now stop and think if there were not 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.490
 taxes the prices automatically 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.229
 they fell by half 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.570
 soon you would have the money to 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.200
 pay the gas bill of your gas 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.909
 car 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.979
 books and school supplies for their 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.900
 children and even the possibility of 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.729
 have a well-paid police officer at every corner 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.009
 and why not give a new lease 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.900
 york to do some shopping and 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.729
 final would still have one of the ten 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.950
 with which you could do 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.840
 a charity donating to the government 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.600
 after all, 10 reais of each 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.390
 would represent a point 9 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.189
 billions of reais would be sufficient to 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.649
 politicians were joking to do 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.720
 laws season off because unfortunately 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.270
 although Brazil is one of the countries 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.350
 the world's richest countries also has one of 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.670
 lower rates of development 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.390
 human 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.390
