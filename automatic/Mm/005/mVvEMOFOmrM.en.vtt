00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
obviously learnt over the years and mm

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.740 
obviously learnt over the years and mm
I<00:01:54.810> have<00:01:55.380> obviously<00:01:55.560> like<00:01:56.210> Africa<00:01:57.210> RJ<00:01:59.030> okay<00:02:00.030> so

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.470 
me the sign of a successful film is not
by<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.040> money<00:02:37.340> it<00:02:37.550> makes<00:02:37.760> but<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.120> fact<00:02:38.360> that

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
by the money it makes but the fact that

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.530 
by the money it makes but the fact that
it<00:02:39.290> should<00:02:39.590> have<00:02:39.710> repeat<00:02:40.070> value<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:40.670> I<00:02:41.330> hope

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
it should have repeat value and I hope

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.480 
it should have repeat value and I hope
that<00:02:41.720> finding<00:02:42.110> Sanji's<00:02:42.500> one<00:02:42.770> such<00:02:43.010> film<00:02:43.310> where

enjoy Turing it I have never for me the

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.210 
enjoy Turing it I have never for me the
definition<00:02:50.780> of<00:02:51.260> success<00:02:51.470> has<00:02:51.830> never<00:02:52.040> been

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
definition of success has never been

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.580 
definition of success has never been
related<00:02:52.640> to<00:02:52.670> box-office<00:02:53.590> I<00:02:56.230> hope<00:02:57.230> so<00:02:57.440> I<00:02:57.560> hope

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
related to box-office I hope so I hope

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.090 
related to box-office I hope so I hope
so<00:02:57.710> I<00:02:58.190> hope<00:02:58.340> so<00:02:58.550> read<00:02:58.880> it<00:02:59.830> pictures<00:03:00.830> are<00:03:00.980> more

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
so I hope so read it pictures are more

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.440 
so I hope so read it pictures are more
apparent<00:03:01.460> even<00:03:01.670> if<00:03:01.760> we<00:03:01.880> really<00:03:02.180> enjoyed

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
apparent even if we really enjoyed

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.690 
apparent even if we really enjoyed
working<00:03:02.630> together<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:03.260> hopefully<00:03:04.010> somebody

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
working together and hopefully somebody

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.100 
working together and hopefully somebody
finds<00:03:04.880> the<00:03:05.030> perfect<00:03:05.390> script<00:03:05.510> for<00:03:05.780> both<00:03:05.900> of<00:03:06.020> us

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
finds the perfect script for both of us

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:12.510 
finds the perfect script for both of us
to<00:03:06.230> come<00:03:06.350> together<00:03:06.500> soon

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.760 

the<00:03:12.970> entirely<00:03:13.390> difficult<00:03:13.960> one<00:03:14.230> defies<00:03:14.530> one

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
the entirely difficult one defies one

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.190 
the entirely difficult one defies one
your<00:03:15.100> diet<00:03:15.340> experience<00:03:15.970> I<00:03:16.150> think<00:03:16.210> from<00:03:17.080> the

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
your diet experience I think from the

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.070 
your diet experience I think from the
time<00:03:17.410> we<00:03:17.590> started<00:03:18.130> from<00:03:18.280> our<00:03:18.520> readings<00:03:18.970> to<00:03:19.480> the

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
time we started from our readings to the

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.830 
time we started from our readings to the
time<00:03:20.260> that<00:03:20.290> we<00:03:20.470> spent<00:03:20.920> together<00:03:21.100> in<00:03:21.520> Goa<00:03:21.840> and

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
time that we spent together in Goa and

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.750 
time that we spent together in Goa and
not<00:03:23.050> just<00:03:23.290> on<00:03:23.470> set<00:03:23.800> but<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.160> time<00:03:24.400> that<00:03:24.430> we

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
not just on set but the time that we

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.600 
not just on set but the time that we
both<00:03:24.940> spent<00:03:25.360> outside<00:03:26.080> of<00:03:26.590> set<00:03:26.890> bonding

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
both spent outside of set bonding

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.310 
both spent outside of set bonding
getting<00:03:27.970> to<00:03:28.060> know<00:03:28.150> each<00:03:28.300> other<00:03:28.540> spending<00:03:29.170> time

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
getting to know each other spending time

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.750 
getting to know each other spending time
with<00:03:29.470> each<00:03:29.620> other<00:03:29.860> I<00:03:29.950> think<00:03:30.100> that<00:03:30.310> has<00:03:30.610> all

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
with each other I think that has all

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.160 
with each other I think that has all
been<00:03:30.910> really<00:03:31.090> really<00:03:31.330> special<00:03:31.780> this<00:03:31.930> film

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
been really really special this film

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.600 
been really really special this film
would<00:03:32.290> not<00:03:32.320> have<00:03:32.620> been<00:03:32.800> would<00:03:33.310> not<00:03:33.460> have

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
would not have been would not have

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.580 
would not have been would not have
turned<00:03:34.060> out<00:03:34.330> like<00:03:34.510> this<00:03:34.570> if<00:03:34.900> all<00:03:35.110> five<00:03:35.290> of<00:03:35.350> us

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
turned out like this if all five of us

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.130 
turned out like this if all five of us
didn't<00:03:35.860> enjoy<00:03:36.100> being<00:03:36.400> with<00:03:36.460> each<00:03:36.580> other<00:03:37.140> thank
