stay alive for the standing stone I

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.110 
stay alive for the standing stone I
think<00:04:22.229> you<00:04:22.410> should<00:04:22.590> probably<00:04:22.740> used<00:04:23.220> maybe<00:04:23.940> the

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
think you should probably used maybe the

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.450 
think you should probably used maybe the
lover<00:04:24.360> stone<00:04:24.830> because<00:04:25.830> that<00:04:25.950> way<00:04:26.100> you<00:04:26.160> can<00:04:26.340> get

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
lover stone because that way you can get

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.990 
lover stone because that way you can get
your<00:04:26.490> two

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
your two

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
and your major skills up faster or maybe

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.440 
and your major skills up faster or maybe
even<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.870> tower<00:04:31.650> stone<00:04:32.070> which<00:04:32.910> will<00:04:33.120> arming
