00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.779 

okay<00:01:29.659> so<00:01:29.720> that's<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.110> ipod<00:01:30.409> touch<00:01:30.439> now<00:01:31.340> I've

okay so that's the ipod touch now I've

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:33.130 
okay so that's the ipod touch now I've
got<00:01:31.939> figure<00:01:32.210> out<00:01:32.329> where<00:01:32.479> the<00:01:32.570> speaker<00:01:32.960> is

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
got figure out where the speaker is

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.679 
got figure out where the speaker is
there<00:01:33.409> it<00:01:33.500> is<00:01:33.560> right<00:01:33.799> to<00:01:34.490> see<00:01:35.149> what<00:01:35.420> the

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
there it is right to see what the

00:01:35.689 --> 00:02:40.490 
there it is right to see what the
Sampson<00:01:36.590> is<00:01:36.890> like<00:01:37.990> so<00:01:38.990> try<00:01:39.590> that

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.470 

so<00:02:41.500> there<00:02:41.650> you<00:02:41.680> go<00:02:41.739> that's<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.340> sound<00:02:42.640> test<00:02:43.060> of

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
so there you go that's the sound test of

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.680 
so there you go that's the sound test of
the<00:02:43.989> galaxy<00:02:44.530> s4<00:02:44.860> mini<00:02:45.120> compared<00:02:46.120> to<00:02:46.269> the<00:02:46.390> ipod

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
the galaxy s4 mini compared to the ipod

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.160 
the galaxy s4 mini compared to the ipod
touch<00:02:46.720> 4th<00:02:47.200> gen<00:02:48.209> straight<00:02:49.209> away<00:02:49.420> I<00:02:49.810> could

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
touch 4th gen straight away I could

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.539 
touch 4th gen straight away I could
easily<00:02:50.500> tell<00:02:51.310> that<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:52.390> gap<00:02:53.349> the<00:02:53.920> samsung

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
easily tell that the gap the samsung

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.559 
easily tell that the gap the samsung
galaxy<00:02:54.579> s4<00:02:55.450> mini<00:02:56.130> was<00:02:57.130> a<00:02:57.459> lot<00:02:57.790> better<00:02:57.970> and

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
galaxy s4 mini was a lot better and

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.370 
galaxy s4 mini was a lot better and
louder<00:02:58.930> i<00:02:59.140> think<00:02:59.500> than<00:02:59.769> the<00:02:59.920> ipod<00:03:00.220> touch<00:03:01.380> but

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
louder i think than the ipod touch but

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.140 
louder i think than the ipod touch but
then<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.650> ipod<00:03:02.950> touches<00:03:03.340> speaker<00:03:03.880> isn't

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
then the ipod touches speaker isn't

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.449 
then the ipod touches speaker isn't
exactly<00:03:04.750> that<00:03:05.019> great<00:03:05.349> it<00:03:06.069> would<00:03:06.310> have<00:03:06.430> been

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
exactly that great it would have been

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.289 
exactly that great it would have been
interesting<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:07.269> compare<00:03:07.510> it<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:08.489> what<00:03:09.489> the

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
interesting to compare it to what the

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.449 
interesting to compare it to what the
ipod<00:03:10.900> touch<00:03:10.930> 5th<00:03:11.410> gen<00:03:11.620> was<00:03:11.769> like<00:03:11.920> obviously

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
ipod touch 5th gen was like obviously

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.490 
ipod touch 5th gen was like obviously
i've<00:03:12.610> got<00:03:12.849> one<00:03:13.000> so<00:03:13.690> that's<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:13.900> sound<00:03:14.140> test

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
i've got one so that's the sound test

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.410 
i've got one so that's the sound test
i'm<00:03:15.160> going<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:15.430> do<00:03:15.489> a<00:03:15.519> couple<00:03:15.700> of<00:03:15.849> other<00:03:16.000> tests

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
i'm going to do a couple of other tests

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.190 
i'm going to do a couple of other tests
i'm<00:03:16.569> going<00:03:16.690> to<00:03:16.750> 1080p<00:03:17.290> test<00:03:17.799> a<00:03:18.130> 720p<00:03:19.120> test<00:03:19.630> and
