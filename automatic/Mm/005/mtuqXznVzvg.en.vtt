00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.940
 You, but I never said commented and the 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.380
 of today is another video of rumors about 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.970
 the 2015 podium that's more stuff 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.730
 more information is coming 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.060
 Coming to us and again they 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.980
 point to a flat ocs 3 on this you 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.110
 has accompanied and rumored videos that 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.340
 has been releasing and in recent weeks 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.350
 last months 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.829
 you must have already realized that there is 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.300
 a great doubt among them is going to 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.890
 characterizing by two the game in that year 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.140
 is known to be developed by the 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.829
 treyarch and some rumors point to the 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.379
 cop 3 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.960
 others point to a mandate of 2 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.750
 today points again to black ops 3 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.870
 the information comes from the super resort website 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.329
 is a site of gringo 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.980
 sales of games and other things but 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.780
 also on average in the whole 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.659
 market and everything else 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.360
 ok they made a post is about the 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.740
 February digital game sales 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.930
 right 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.490
 obviously was on the coast list always 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.170
 selling the crap was even the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.490
 game that made the most money in the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.049
 February was adverse to the affair 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.180
 surpassing even gta5 he's good at 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.000
 that they did there in the text in the 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.140
 article they did is they spoke 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.520
 about the activision games that 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.220
 appeared on the list that were adverse 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.970
 of the destiny call of ghosts affair and 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.939
 Last 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.180
 that the success of this month has already 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.490
 that increases the expectation for the 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.390
 launch of call of duty black ops 3 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.520
 huh 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.350
 sort of confirming that they know that 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.180
 the black ops 3 would be the cut of this year 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.920
 nothing more than that but it has already been clear 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.380
 enough to create all the buzz 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.360
 and within the gaming industry several 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.969
 sites are already heralding more inclusive 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.670
 this article also matters that people 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.320
 would have a new resident evil even in this 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.110
 year is what we are all assuming 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.850
 would be resident evil 7 with this leading the 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.170
 news began to populate the sites 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.780
 of games around the world and 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.660
 the very super from Tower 7 is over 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.390
 updating this article of theirs is putting 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.090
 an update at the end saying that they 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.680
 quoted black ops three just as one 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.930
 kind of continuation that they 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.940
 premeditated double kobe of japan since 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.950
 support who is responsible for cutting 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.400
 this year they imagined that she 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.380
 3i is developing the playoff on 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.269
 resident evil they did not reach 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.650
 that you would be a resident or 7 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.290
 their article just said that they wanted 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.019
 resident evil a new né many sites 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.660
 ended up being titled It 's night or 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.069
 7 but they said that it has no name 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.510
 specific president that they 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.730
 I would like it to be a president or 7 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.989
 but that has nothing confirmed but that 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.000
 We should wait to see more about 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.030
 resident evil still this year by 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.790
 of the right capcom and this is it this is a rumor 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.410
 this is basically what happened now 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.870
 is this doubt if they really know 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.230
 break-break cop3 if it really was a 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.220
 kick a premeditation from him 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.350
 right 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.170
 the other thing the latter the latter 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:13.140
 days, another humor appeared that included 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.030
 several Brazilian sites is made up is 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.100
 news the own bassaki games I do not 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.549
 I made a mistake about a 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.650
 supposed to tweet the air tv that paste by 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:25.290
 six seconds where she said that the 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.799
 of the next game would be a baby and 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.600
 Oh, right, and then everyone was super 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.150
 flying with this everybody talking 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.540
 millions for me very very much 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:40.109
 mention about supposed twitter was right here 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.989
 It's so expensive, this way, there's no way 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:45.810
 100% sure for you but me 9936 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:48.150
 brazil cef remove first tuite was 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.430
 badly written without commas in anything second 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.160
 this is not the kind of rumor you have that 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.920
 give a check no rumors tips one 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.130
 things so specific are in the 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.440
 That's the way it is and I would not do it that way. 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.810
 also in a way so early she did not 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.459
 would make an announcement of such a mood of these 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.569
 This time of year, it's okay. 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.280
 You can see that you think it's quiet. 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.230
 not very quiet because now you have the 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.940
 understand that they are focusing on the 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.680
 affectionate and I would not even like her to 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.209
 Have that kind of joke now then. 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.549
 certainly the rumors that it will 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.970
 start in a while and then you should 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.769
 be a new audience of the adversary 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.630
 the corinthians pass with their satire that 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.460
 will start and I can assure you that 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.740
 it will not be anything as specific as this 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.120
 as it was supposed to have been this tweet 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.310
 six seconds why I did not 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.170
 a video on this is very easy to do 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.940
 a twitter fake of those gives to you 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.830
 make a little trick by html of which 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.800
 You type whatever you want and it appears 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:42.370
 that person tutted that then it's got 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.900
 99 priscila sure're made just for 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.550
 make it clear to you, yes it was 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.860
 aware of this rumor but I did not because 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.600
 I really do not think it's anything too much. 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.010
 Okay then I just hope you go 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.360
 I really like this video if you like it 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.860
 and want to leave your home and and if possible 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.170

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:00.420
 here a hug, everyone stay with god 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.420
