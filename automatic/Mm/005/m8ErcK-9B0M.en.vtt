effort<00:04:37.720> like

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
effort like

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.510 
effort like
really<00:04:39.539> nice<00:04:39.659> gold<00:04:40.139> right<00:04:40.439> there<00:04:40.470> and<00:04:40.860> I<00:04:41.280> do

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
really nice gold right there and I do

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.790 
really nice gold right there and I do
get<00:04:41.729> a<00:04:41.789> chance<00:04:42.060> to<00:04:42.270> make<00:04:42.419> it<00:04:42.449> to<00:04:42.870> all<00:04:43.169> but<00:04:43.680> it's

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
get a chance to make it to all but it's

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.469 
get a chance to make it to all but it's
a<00:04:43.830> great<00:04:43.979> save<00:04:44.310> from<00:04:44.340> his<00:04:44.639> keeper<00:04:45.060> you<00:04:45.330> know

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
a great save from his keeper you know

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.149 
a great save from his keeper you know
that<00:04:45.689> blondes<00:04:45.990> keepers<00:04:46.319> always<00:04:46.650> quite<00:04:46.919> bad

00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:47.159 
that blondes keepers always quite bad

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:49.010 
that blondes keepers always quite bad
but<00:04:47.729> his<00:04:47.969> keeper<00:04:48.270> was<00:04:48.419> quite<00:04:48.629> good<00:04:48.659> in<00:04:48.960> this

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
but his keeper was quite good in this

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.290 
but his keeper was quite good in this
game<00:04:49.110> and<00:04:49.500> he<00:04:50.129> does<00:04:50.340> get<00:04:50.460> a<00:04:50.520> chance<00:04:50.789> to<00:04:50.939> make<00:04:51.060> it

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
game and he does get a chance to make it

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.510 
game and he does get a chance to make it
3-1<00:04:51.629> but<00:04:52.050> it's<00:04:52.199> a<00:04:52.259> great<00:04:52.409> say<00:04:52.800> from<00:04:52.979> my<00:04:53.009> keeper

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
3-1 but it's a great say from my keeper

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.580 
3-1 but it's a great say from my keeper
but<00:04:53.969> I<00:04:54.030> do<00:04:54.120> look<00:04:54.509> to<00:04:54.659> upgrade<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.110> team<00:04:55.349> after

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
but I do look to upgrade the team after

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.529 
but I do look to upgrade the team after
this<00:04:56.039> game<00:04:56.250> we<00:04:56.460> do<00:04:56.580> lose<00:04:56.729> our<00:04:56.939> first<00:04:57.180> game<00:04:57.360> of

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
this game we do lose our first game of

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:00.170 
this game we do lose our first game of
this<00:04:57.750> series<00:04:58.020> 2-1<00:04:58.889> so<00:04:59.129> um<00:04:59.340> I<00:04:59.610> haven't<00:05:00.030> actually

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
this series 2-1 so um I haven't actually

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.969 
this series 2-1 so um I haven't actually
done<00:05:00.419> a<00:05:00.479> road<00:05:00.750> to<00:05:00.870> Division<00:05:01.229> one<00:05:01.259> before<00:05:01.770> my

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
done a road to Division one before my

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:03.559 
done a road to Division one before my
finger<00:05:02.250> like<00:05:02.280> channel<00:05:02.819> but<00:05:03.210> i<00:05:03.240> thought<00:05:03.449> i'd

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:03.569 
finger like channel but i thought i'd

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:05.300 
finger like channel but i thought i'd
try<00:05:03.719> it<00:05:03.870> out<00:05:04.050> and<00:05:04.110> see<00:05:04.469> what<00:05:04.650> you<00:05:04.830> guys<00:05:05.069> think

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
try it out and see what you guys think

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.820 
try it out and see what you guys think
of<00:05:05.460> it<00:05:05.639> so<00:05:05.879> we<00:05:06.389> do<00:05:06.840> go<00:05:07.050> into<00:05:07.139> that<00:05:07.409> like<00:05:07.680> the

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
of it so we do go into that like the

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.159 
of it so we do go into that like the
third<00:05:08.129> game<00:05:08.340> of<00:05:08.400> this<00:05:08.639> episode<00:05:08.969> with<00:05:09.629> two

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
third game of this episode with two

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.469 
third game of this episode with two
games<00:05:10.349> played<00:05:10.620> 11<00:05:11.099> and<00:05:11.340> 1<00:05:11.520> loss<00:05:11.759> term<00:05:12.060> and<00:05:12.449> we

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
games played 11 and 1 loss term and we

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.149 
games played 11 and 1 loss term and we
do<00:05:12.690> actually<00:05:12.810> upgrade<00:05:13.289> this<00:05:13.440> team<00:05:13.710> in<00:05:13.919> the<00:05:14.069> end

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:14.159 
do actually upgrade this team in the end

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:16.040 
do actually upgrade this team in the end
that<00:05:14.340> we<00:05:14.430> get<00:05:14.580> a<00:05:14.610> two-cent<00:05:15.150> amid<00:05:15.419> look<00:05:15.900> at

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
that we get a two-cent amid look at

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.300 
that we get a two-cent amid look at
those<00:05:16.169> like<00:05:16.500> just<00:05:16.740> to<00:05:16.830> get<00:05:16.949> that<00:05:17.069> extra

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
those like just to get that extra

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.700 
those like just to get that extra
chemistry<00:05:17.819> whist<00:05:18.000> currently<00:05:18.449> standing<00:05:18.750> on<00:05:18.900> 66

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
chemistry whist currently standing on 66

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.649 
chemistry whist currently standing on 66
chemistry<00:05:20.250> so<00:05:20.490> it's<00:05:20.759> not<00:05:21.000> too<00:05:21.210> bad<00:05:21.389> at<00:05:21.569> the

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:21.659 
chemistry so it's not too bad at the

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:23.119 
chemistry so it's not too bad at the
moment<00:05:21.960> I<00:05:22.050> think<00:05:22.110> this<00:05:22.440> game<00:05:22.680> would<00:05:22.770> be<00:05:22.919> even

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:23.129 
moment I think this game would be even

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:25.790 
moment I think this game would be even
better<00:05:23.159> than<00:05:23.490> the<00:05:23.550> like<00:05:23.969> the<00:05:24.120> second<00:05:24.539> and<00:05:24.800> but

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
better than the like the second and but

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.439 
better than the like the second and but
we<00:05:26.009> just<00:05:26.129> don't<00:05:26.310> want<00:05:26.520> to<00:05:26.639> lose<00:05:26.789> many<00:05:27.030> times<00:05:27.300> as

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:27.449 
we just don't want to lose many times as

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:29.240 
we just don't want to lose many times as
possible<00:05:27.629> because<00:05:27.990> division<00:05:28.440> 10<00:05:28.620> you<00:05:28.740> don't

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
possible because division 10 you don't

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.920 
possible because division 10 you don't
expect<00:05:29.460> to<00:05:29.699> lose<00:05:29.909> many<00:05:30.180> times<00:05:30.419> at<00:05:30.569> all<00:05:30.750> because

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
expect to lose many times at all because

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.649 
expect to lose many times at all because
it's<00:05:31.469> quite<00:05:31.830> an<00:05:31.919> easy<00:05:32.009> League<00:05:32.370> or<00:05:33.090> division

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:33.659 
it's quite an easy League or division

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:35.300 
it's quite an easy League or division
and<00:05:33.900> them<00:05:34.080> I<00:05:34.229> go<00:05:34.590> into<00:05:34.710> the<00:05:34.860> third<00:05:35.039> game<00:05:35.250> of

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
and them I go into the third game of

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.369 
and them I go into the third game of
this<00:05:35.669> episode<00:05:36.000> three<00:05:36.389> games<00:05:36.629> in<00:05:36.779> episode<00:05:37.169> and

00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:37.379 
this episode three games in episode and

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:40.070 
this episode three games in episode and
he's<00:05:37.919> got<00:05:38.099> three<00:05:38.129> gold<00:05:38.490> players<00:05:38.789> in<00:05:38.909> it<00:05:39.029> so<00:05:39.240> his

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
he's got three gold players in it so his

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.899 
he's got three gold players in it so his
team<00:05:40.229> looked<00:05:40.409> a<00:05:40.529> lot<00:05:40.650> better<00:05:40.830> than<00:05:41.099> the<00:05:41.490> second

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:41.909 
team looked a lot better than the second

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:45.170 
team looked a lot better than the second
team<00:05:42.180> which<00:05:42.330> I<00:05:42.449> came<00:05:42.689> up<00:05:42.840> against<00:05:43.259> and<00:05:43.440> i<00:05:44.310> was

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.920 
percent possession and 13 shots to his
three<00:06:59.160> so<00:06:59.550> it<00:06:59.850> looked<00:07:00.060> promising<00:07:00.240> going<00:07:00.720> into

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:00.930 
three so it looked promising going into
