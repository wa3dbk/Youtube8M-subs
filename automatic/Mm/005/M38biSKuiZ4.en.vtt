00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:09.080
 Children have many cup effects than adults, but they also receive a lot of risk 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:14.870
 Although I think that there is to say 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:20.520
 For example, the government should create the guidelines for preventing suicide, right? 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:22.870
 Early demonstrate to hear so I'm For information about that quite psychotropic drugs is positive and the other a 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:28.870
 Say to use the playing period 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:31.850
 That is attached to the wound but has become a sound I and the other the General Assembly early intervention Toka early detection 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:38.030
 I really hate the way of thinking 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:43.130
 Originally It is a child if it is said that the idea of ​​the early detection early meeting is properly 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:47.630
 I grasp that the mind is in the state of saying now for a while now, and it is 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:51.870
 If it is only to care in this way psychologically, we will not deny it separately 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:58.110
 However, all the medicines that I am doing now and early intervention 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:03.839
 It is a strategy to tie it up, and it is said that the child is psychic medication actually 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:10.470
 The fact that the suicide rate is overwhelmingly high is also routinely concealed in the picture , but it is all hidden 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:11.860
 With a headquarters in such that Sendai of, for example, is it that suicide survivors Liaison Committee in Tay masu 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.980
 The chairman 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:19.510
 Mr. Satsuko, who is the largest self-killing bereaved family in Japan 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:26.290
 There is a liaison meeting of 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:28.159
 About 70% of those who were killed and committed suicide went to the psychiatry , as long as they were examined there 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:33.350
 Do not know is to say that it is ingested about nose 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:38.689
 And for those who jumped down I knew I had 100% drinking 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:41.360
 Woman In a recent survey, it used to be 70%, but now it is only 70% in a recent survey 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:47.150
 80% or more people 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:53.210
 I know that I was drinking, so in foreign countries the medicine, for example, the coats role, is the most dangerous 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:58.190
 It and so I am Saku had saved something like that medicine was a suicide I'd have been said to be 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:01.350
 Well it has been reported in people that Tteyuu cause the Do behavior say 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:06.840
 But the reality is that there is hardly any coverage in Japan 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:09.959
 There is a lot of drugs in the US that are the most litigious and the most sold. 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:14.940
 The business side has already continued to lose 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:17.430
 You may say that the foreign ministers of about 90 billion yen as this that now Utsumi's 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.910
 It is the reason for saying the way the ruling 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.370
 After all it induces suicidal behavior or there is addiction 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.799
 But 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:29.240
 This same medicine has been prescribed for about 100 years in Japan 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:36.290
 Such information itself is 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:42.350
 Ano Internet Speaking in and does not come into the Japan Well tour now his overseas information 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:47.750
 About only actually enter the information hand I think it is my own and Well activities difficult wake up 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:49.230
 Well, though it is various slander also a sense it perhaps in Japan, which is also the relationship are 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:55.080
 As a doctor 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:57.510
 It is said that it is said that it is largely rebellious by showing it out, but it is the first time to say it that way 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:03.060
 It means that humans are eventually becoming me 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:07.470
 And the person who was saying to the old days of the 1960s've been drowned out that most 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.220
 I was a little bit open when I had a taste, but there was a chance that it was crunchy 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:14.880
 After all this 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:17.160
 I think it can be said that it is also a problem of information dissemination of the whole media 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:22.470
 Overseas 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.490
 The side effects of the vaccine in question and such information does not appear in Japan 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:29.580
 in Japan 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:32.340
 a is a very young subject for prescriptions since several types of songs are released at one time compared to overseas 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:36.450
 These problems are 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:44.680
 There continue Could but it is the second half Well that is 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:50.590
 Positive for Reduce the suicide are many in suicide prevention week Japan in 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:52.239
 Is there any thing as is or how to do and now to issue any wind of psychotropic drugs 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.489
 Should I catch it? 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.489
 Spicy Masu's ish continue Pu in Utsumi's
