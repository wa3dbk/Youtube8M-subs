 factory here is this regular monitor 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.960
 already here during installation done 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.180
 additionally one video and dinner 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.800
 here on the tape recorder 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.660
 respectively, rear view camera too 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.300
 working i'm just sitting right now on 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.090
 driver's seat car owner 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.590
 departed and I probably show you not 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.950
 I will if during the review it now 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.270
 come back we ask you to do it but 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.520
 rearview camera factory too 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:26.240
 it works it is shown simultaneously and 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.860
 on this small screen and on this small screen 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.930
 also customer at will 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:35.310
 installed to the front camera 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:38.700
 which is launched by pressing the button 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:41.610
 aux and brought it specifically on the button 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.630
 separate button here it is optional 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.000
 established 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.490
 why is it done the thing is that in 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.440
 the glove compartment of the client has regular and yusb 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:54.390
 regular aux we connected them too 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.840
 regular usb and regular aux supported 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:01.940
 but the fact is that aux in this radio 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:05.010
 implies when you click on the icon aux 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.650
 this is automatic start up aux like 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.380
 audio signal and video signal 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.840
 so we decided to do the following 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.060
 if the client will listen through aux 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.280
 audio input but so he has a camera 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.100
 constantly did not work we did 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.920
 video interrupt and 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.220
 if he already needs it in the end 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:28.520
 video signal just when parking click 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.680
 on the button installed additionally 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.660
 which will show him yet 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.820
 no video signal 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:40.430
 interrupt the audio start 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:42.110
 playing music with iphone 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:48.740
 Next is all the standard button 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:50.870
 Naturally the button works here all by 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.240
 standard here is no news I you 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.940
 I will not say here I see the client is going now 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.850
 we will ask him to turn on the camera yes not 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.800
 I see Evgeny and I am filming a video review. 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.570
