Director: Stand by and action

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.060
Linda: There’s no doubt about it both awareness

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.240
and understanding of dementia has increased
tremendously but the problem Alzheimer’s

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.300
Society had had is that people don’t know
about us. They don’t know about what we

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.490
offer, they don’t know about the services
that we provide that can really help support

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.750
people with dementia.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.130
Nick: I think we wanted to really have the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.019
courage to trouble people and make people
understand just how serious this condition

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:41.960
is. You know we have a gentleman of a certain
age sitting extensively really enjoying a

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.819
Sunday lunch with his family and then all
of a sudden he starts to forget who’s around

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:52.629
him and we see that he’s very very troubled
by the experience that he is momentarily suffering.

00:00:52.629 --> 00:01:01.349
Then we see him sort of regain his composure
and his faculty and that really is a sort

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.730
of metaphor for the help that Alzheimer’s
Society can provide.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.920
Dylan: Our main aim was just to try and put
the viewer in that world and kind of create

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.659
the sense of disorientation and confusion
that people with Alzheimer’s have to live

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.750
with sometimes. We wanted it to feel very
real we, we wanted them to be characters that

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.460
people would recognise. When we cast we asked
everyone who came in if they had any family

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.329
or loved ones or other personal experience
of Alzheimer’s and it really showed in the

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:38.540
performances when they had and Ray in particular
just you know was very nuanced and it just

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.560
seemed very very authentic watching him, so
we were keen for that to be part of it.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.880
Ray: Yeah my father had dementia and as a
family we looked after him for five years

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.579
but with retrospect he had it for longer than
five years because we didn’t recognise his

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:00.030
behaviour at first. Much the same way that
this character around the dining room table,

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.829
he’s got his family around him and starts
doing things which are out of character, so

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.400
it was very important not to caricature and
to make it as real as possible.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.960
Leo: I was particularly drawn to his project
for personal reasons my grandfather died of

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.670
Alzheimer’s and I have a very good memory
of the last few years of his life. I actually

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.390
recall, remember very clearly the kind of
look in his eye which Ray the actor portrayed.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.850
Hopefully I was able to help recognise some
of these moments and help portray the subjective

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.730
experience that Will and Dylan were trying
to create.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.380
Dylan: We just wanted people to kind of empathise
rather than sympathise, we wanted to make

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.340
a film that you know went some way to helping
people understand what it must be like but

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.970
also that lets families know and carers know
that there is support there.
