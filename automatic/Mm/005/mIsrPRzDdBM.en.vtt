00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.090 

alright<00:00:00.539> let's<00:00:01.170> talk<00:00:01.589> really<00:00:02.159> quick<00:00:02.580> about

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:04.100 
alright let's talk really quick about

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.860 
alright let's talk really quick about
kennel<00:00:05.100> cough<00:00:05.310> in<00:00:05.549> humans<00:00:05.580> and<00:00:06.089> specifically

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
kennel cough in humans and specifically

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.640 
kennel cough in humans and specifically
if<00:00:07.309> a<00:00:08.309> human<00:00:09.120> can<00:00:09.480> actually<00:00:09.840> get<00:00:10.110> kennel<00:00:10.469> cough

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
if a human can actually get kennel cough

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.370 
if a human can actually get kennel cough
so<00:00:11.160> when<00:00:11.969> people<00:00:12.360> typically<00:00:12.960> hear<00:00:13.230> their

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
so when people typically hear their

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.140 
so when people typically hear their
beloved<00:00:13.799> dog<00:00:14.009> coughing<00:00:14.549> away<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:14.910> not<00:00:14.969> only

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
beloved dog coughing away and not only

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.670 
beloved dog coughing away and not only
sounds<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.719> little<00:00:15.809> bit<00:00:16.020> weird<00:00:16.230> but<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.500> can<00:00:16.619> be

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
sounds a little bit weird but it can be

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.050 
sounds a little bit weird but it can be
very<00:00:16.740> scary<00:00:17.070> as<00:00:17.580> well

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
very scary as well

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.200 
very scary as well
so<00:00:18.539> this<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.500> because<00:00:19.920> coughing<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:20.730> typically

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
so this is because coughing is typically

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.779 
so this is because coughing is typically
associated<00:00:21.630> with<00:00:22.050> us<00:00:22.380> as<00:00:22.529> humans<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.550> truth

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
associated with us as humans the truth

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.849 
associated with us as humans the truth
is<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.480> there<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.840> not<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.199> big<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.710> a

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
is that there is not that big of a

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.769 
is that there is not that big of a
difference<00:00:26.010> between<00:00:26.580> dogs<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.240> humans<00:00:27.330> when

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
difference between dogs and humans when

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.439 
difference between dogs and humans when
it<00:00:27.900> comes<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.289> respiratory<00:00:28.859> infections<00:00:29.449> dogs

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
it comes to respiratory infections dogs

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.690 
it comes to respiratory infections dogs
will<00:00:30.779> suffer<00:00:31.140> from<00:00:31.289> respiratory<00:00:31.700> discomfort

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
will suffer from respiratory discomfort

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.209 
will suffer from respiratory discomfort
as<00:00:32.820> well<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.540> there<00:00:34.170> has<00:00:34.320> been<00:00:34.350> some<00:00:34.710> concern

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
as well and there has been some concern

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.220 
as well and there has been some concern
over<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.790> relationship<00:00:35.940> between<00:00:36.660> kennel

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
over the relationship between kennel

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.860 
over the relationship between kennel
cough<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.410> humans<00:00:38.250> now<00:00:38.910> while<00:00:39.660> the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
cough and humans now while the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.869 
cough and humans now while the
possibility<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.680> an<00:00:40.829> infection<00:00:41.370> traveling

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
possibility of an infection traveling

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.049 
possibility of an infection traveling
between<00:00:42.030> an<00:00:42.480> animal<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.620> humans<00:00:43.980> may<00:00:44.370> at

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
between an animal and humans may at

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.240 
between an animal and humans may at
first<00:00:45.090> appear<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.840> little<00:00:46.020> confusing<00:00:46.379> there<00:00:47.070> is

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
first appear a little confusing there is

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.100 
first appear a little confusing there is
research<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.730> supports<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.899> indeed

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
research that supports that it is indeed

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.420 
research that supports that it is indeed
the<00:00:49.500> truth<00:00:49.800> ok<00:00:50.600> so<00:00:51.600> although<00:00:52.379> it's<00:00:52.890> not<00:00:53.100> all

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
the truth ok so although it's not all

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.450 
the truth ok so although it's not all
that<00:00:53.489> common<00:00:54.180> it's<00:00:54.600> also<00:00:54.930> not<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.590> rare<00:00:56.100> and

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
that common it's also not that rare and

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.790 
that common it's also not that rare and
you<00:00:57.059> need<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.300> make<00:00:57.449> sure<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.660> its<00:00:58.379> effects

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
you need to make sure that its effects

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.779 
you need to make sure that its effects
don't<00:00:59.280> go<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.640> ignore<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.090> okay<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.930> the

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
don't go and ignore it okay so the

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.399 
don't go and ignore it okay so the
transmission<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.940> kennel<00:01:03.899> cough<00:01:04.080> is

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
transmission of kennel cough is

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.429 
transmission of kennel cough is
typically<00:01:04.920> through<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.489> air<00:01:05.869> as<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.229> main

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
typically through the air as the main

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.380 
typically through the air as the main
transmitter<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.130> kennel<00:01:08.430> cough<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.760> humans<00:01:09.060> ok

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
transmitter of kennel cough to humans ok

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.570 
transmitter of kennel cough to humans ok
those<00:01:09.659> individuals<00:01:10.350> living<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.830> dirty<00:01:11.189> and

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
those individuals living in dirty and

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.969 
those individuals living in dirty and
poorly<00:01:11.970> ventilated<00:01:12.180> areas<00:01:13.020> are<00:01:13.290> more

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
poorly ventilated areas are more

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.010 
poorly ventilated areas are more
vulnerable<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:15.000> disease<00:01:15.420> than<00:01:15.840> those

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
vulnerable to this disease than those

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.840 
vulnerable to this disease than those
that<00:01:16.259> live<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.590> well-ventilated<00:01:16.860> areas

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
that live in well-ventilated areas

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.090 
that live in well-ventilated areas
therefore<00:01:18.630> it's<00:01:19.170> important<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.799> ensure<00:01:20.070> that

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
therefore it's important to ensure that

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.580 
therefore it's important to ensure that
your<00:01:20.310> environment<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.030> clean<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.810> addition

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
your environment is clean in addition

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.070 
your environment is clean in addition
humans<00:01:23.430> should<00:01:24.060> avoid<00:01:24.330> interacting<00:01:24.810> with

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
humans should avoid interacting with

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.100 
humans should avoid interacting with
infected<00:01:25.439> dogs<00:01:25.820> flu<00:01:26.820> as<00:01:27.060> well<00:01:27.090> as<00:01:27.360> bad<00:01:27.600> colds

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
infected dogs flu as well as bad colds

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.899 
infected dogs flu as well as bad colds
are<00:01:28.200> also<00:01:28.380> two<00:01:28.590> symptoms<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.430> are<00:01:29.549> often

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
are also two symptoms that are often

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.560 
are also two symptoms that are often
associated<00:01:30.360> with<00:01:30.509> kennel<00:01:30.869> cough<00:01:30.900> ok<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:32.570> here

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
associated with kennel cough ok so here

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.539 
associated with kennel cough ok so here
are<00:01:33.689> some<00:01:33.869> prevention<00:01:34.500> tips<00:01:34.740> ok<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.100> health

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
are some prevention tips ok so health

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.850 
are some prevention tips ok so health
care<00:01:35.759> practitioners<00:01:36.479> believe<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.650> there<00:01:37.829> is

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
care practitioners believe that there is

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.560 
care practitioners believe that there is
no<00:01:38.159> need<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.520> worry<00:01:38.729> about<00:01:38.820> kennel<00:01:39.270> cough<00:01:39.390> in

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
no need to worry about kennel cough in

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.030 
no need to worry about kennel cough in
humans<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.590> typically<00:01:40.950> because

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
humans this is typically because

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.340 
humans this is typically because
prevention<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.180> these<00:01:42.329> diseases<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:43.020> actually

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
prevention of these diseases is actually

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.780 
prevention of these diseases is actually
easier<00:01:43.770> than<00:01:43.950> treating<00:01:44.280> them<00:01:44.399> once<00:01:44.640> they

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
easier than treating them once they

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.569 
easier than treating them once they
occur<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.869> those<00:01:46.110> who<00:01:46.320> would<00:01:46.439> like<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.740> avoid

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
occur so those who would like to avoid

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.950 
occur so those who would like to avoid
going<00:01:47.820> through<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.090> troubles<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.630> being

infected<00:01:49.829> with<00:01:50.040> kennel<00:01:50.340> cough<00:01:50.520> should<00:01:50.909> avoid

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
infected with kennel cough should avoid

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.410 
infected with kennel cough should avoid
interacting<00:01:51.659> with<00:01:51.990> infected<00:01:52.380> dogs<00:01:53.240> since<00:01:54.240> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
interacting with infected dogs since the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.840 
interacting with infected dogs since the
illness<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.899> airborne<00:01:55.229> in<00:01:55.409> nature<00:01:55.680> ok<00:01:55.979> in<00:01:56.189> case

illness is airborne in nature ok in case

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.910 
illness is airborne in nature ok in case
you<00:01:57.060> believe<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.659> cannot<00:01:58.079> avoid<00:01:58.500> interacting

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
you believe you cannot avoid interacting

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.639
