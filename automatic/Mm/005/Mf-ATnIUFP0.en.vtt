00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
part of me that kind of feels like I am

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.870 
part of me that kind of feels like I am
projecting<00:02:37.230> modern<00:02:37.590> values<00:02:38.010> onto<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.580> and<00:02:38.790> I

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
projecting modern values onto it and I

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.580 
projecting modern values onto it and I
don't<00:02:39.120> feel<00:02:39.300> like<00:02:39.450> that's<00:02:39.600> really<00:02:39.960> fair<00:02:40.140> this

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
don't feel like that's really fair this

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.590 
don't feel like that's really fair this
right<00:02:40.830> here<00:02:41.100> this<00:02:41.430> is<00:02:41.640> why<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:41.790> never<00:02:41.940> give<00:02:42.330> star

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
right here this is why I never give star

ratings<00:02:42.990> to<00:02:43.200> books<00:02:43.410> during<00:02:43.680> reviews<00:02:44.130> I<00:02:44.460> think

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
ratings to books during reviews I think

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.140 
ratings to books during reviews I think
ultimately<00:02:45.900> my<00:02:46.260> opinion<00:02:46.740> is<00:02:47.040> yeah<00:02:47.550> you<00:02:47.610> should

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
ultimately my opinion is yeah you should

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.150 
ultimately my opinion is yeah you should
probably<00:02:48.390> read<00:02:48.750> this<00:02:48.990> because<00:02:49.470> even<00:02:49.890> a<00:02:49.950> less

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
probably read this because even a less

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.730 
probably read this because even a less

ridiculous by modern standards so the

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.350 
ridiculous by modern standards so the
most<00:03:58.920> prominent<00:03:59.250> theme<00:03:59.550> of<00:03:59.760> Mansfield<00:04:00.209> Park

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
most prominent theme of Mansfield Park

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.110 
most prominent theme of Mansfield Park
is<00:04:00.570> probably<00:04:00.959> morality<00:04:01.800> which<00:04:02.190> yeah<00:04:02.640> fair

is probably morality which yeah fair
enough

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
enough

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.970 
enough
totally<00:04:03.900> something<00:04:04.260> that's<00:04:04.440> worth<00:04:04.560> exploring

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
totally something that's worth exploring

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.100 
totally something that's worth exploring
and<00:04:05.430> I<00:04:05.790> mean<00:04:05.940> Jane<00:04:06.180> Austen<00:04:06.600> was<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.930> daughter

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
and I mean Jane Austen was the daughter

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.890 
and I mean Jane Austen was the daughter
of<00:04:07.260> clergymen<00:04:07.860> so<00:04:08.459> it's<00:04:09.180> not<00:04:09.510> that<00:04:09.750> surprising

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
of clergymen so it's not that surprising

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.260 
of clergymen so it's not that surprising
that<00:04:10.380> it<00:04:10.470> would<00:04:10.590> come<00:04:10.739> up<00:04:10.770> the<00:04:11.340> thing<00:04:11.520> is<00:04:11.730> when

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
that it would come up the thing is when

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.260 
that it would come up the thing is when
you<00:04:12.420> read<00:04:12.630> classics<00:04:13.320> and<00:04:13.650> other<00:04:13.860> older<00:04:14.820> works

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
you read classics and other older works

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.030 
you read classics and other older works
of<00:04:15.510> literature<00:04:15.780> particularly<00:04:16.380> stuff<00:04:16.830> like

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
of literature particularly stuff like

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.890 
of literature particularly stuff like
Austen's<00:04:17.520> that<00:04:17.760> centers<00:04:18.090> around<00:04:18.120> manners

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
Austen's that centers around manners

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.680 
Austen's that centers around manners
sometimes<00:04:19.590> you're<00:04:20.280> like<00:04:20.459> oh<00:04:20.669> man<00:04:20.970> why<00:04:21.330> do<00:04:21.390> we
