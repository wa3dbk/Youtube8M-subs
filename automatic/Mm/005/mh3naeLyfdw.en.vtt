last<00:00:00.979> time<00:00:01.250> on<00:00:01.490> the<00:00:01.670> bill

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.109 

we've<00:00:18.420> reached<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.780> milestone<00:00:18.810> on<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:19.710> car

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
we've reached a milestone on this car

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.540 
we've reached a milestone on this car
sandblasted<00:00:21.119> ground<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.380> bondo<00:00:22.860> out<00:00:23.070> ground

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
sandblasted ground the bondo out ground

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.730 
sandblasted ground the bondo out ground
the<00:00:23.670> rust<00:00:23.880> out<00:00:24.090> now<00:00:24.689> let's<00:00:24.869> assess<00:00:25.200> the<00:00:25.349> damage

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
the rust out now let's assess the damage

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:33.819 
the rust out now let's assess the damage
and<00:00:25.920> see<00:00:26.130> what<00:00:26.279> we've<00:00:26.400> got

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.110 

as<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:34.920> can<00:00:35.010> see<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.460> back<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.910> car

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
as you can see in the back of the car

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.020 
as you can see in the back of the car
underneath<00:00:37.109> the<00:00:37.230> tail<00:00:37.410> light<00:00:37.620> area<00:00:37.980> we<00:00:38.460> have<00:00:38.730> a

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
underneath the tail light area we have a

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.599 
underneath the tail light area we have a
significant<00:00:39.840> amount<00:00:40.019> of<00:00:40.140> rust<00:00:40.410> we<00:00:40.769> are<00:00:40.890> going

00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:41.609 
significant amount of rust we are going

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:44.060 
significant amount of rust we are going
to<00:00:41.670> have<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.879> go<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.210> here<00:00:42.539> and<00:00:42.690> put<00:00:43.559> new<00:00:43.739> metal

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
to have to go in here and put new metal

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.479 
to have to go in here and put new metal
in<00:00:44.280> at<00:00:45.120> least<00:00:45.390> from<00:00:45.890> one<00:00:46.890> third<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.339> way

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
in at least from one third of the way

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.569 
in at least from one third of the way
out<00:00:48.140> get<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.260> rest<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:49.649> bondo<00:00:50.100> out<00:00:50.309> and

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
out get the rest of this bondo out and

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.039 
out get the rest of this bondo out and
stuff<00:00:50.790> like<00:00:50.909> that<00:00:51.120> it's<00:00:51.390> not<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.600> difficult

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:52.049 
stuff like that it's not a difficult

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:54.410 
stuff like that it's not a difficult
repair<00:00:52.680> but<00:00:53.070> it's<00:00:53.190> not<00:00:53.339> an<00:00:53.489> easy<00:00:53.579> repair<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.239> we

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
repair but it's not an easy repair so we

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.410 
repair but it's not an easy repair so we
will<00:00:54.600> be<00:00:54.750> spending<00:00:55.110> some<00:00:55.290> time<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:55.860> area

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
will be spending some time in this area

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.389 
will be spending some time in this area
moving<00:00:57.420> on<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:58.110> see<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.860> there<00:00:59.010> was<00:00:59.190> some

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
moving on we see that there was some

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.369 
moving on we see that there was some
damage<00:00:59.610> here<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.210> quarter<00:01:00.510> panel<00:01:00.839> this

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
damage here in the quarter panel this

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.439 
damage here in the quarter panel this
one's<00:01:01.649> not<00:01:01.799> too<00:01:01.860> bad<00:01:02.250> but<00:01:02.760> there<00:01:03.000> was<00:01:03.119> an<00:01:03.269> old

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
one's not too bad but there was an old

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.719 
one's not too bad but there was an old
repair<00:01:03.960> done<00:01:04.259> we<00:01:04.920> will<00:01:05.070> hammer<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.519> dolly

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
repair done we will hammer and dolly

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.300 
repair done we will hammer and dolly
this<00:01:06.030> out<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.390> where<00:01:06.539> we<00:01:06.690> want<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.320> get<00:01:08.190> it

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
this out to where we want it and get it

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.389 
this out to where we want it and get it
right<00:01:08.550> and<00:01:08.820> fix<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.289> then<00:01:11.070> you've<00:01:11.250> got

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
right and fix that and then you've got

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:14.059 
right and fix that and then you've got
the<00:01:11.550> wheel<00:01:11.759> wells<00:01:12.500> we've<00:01:13.500> got<00:01:13.679> some<00:01:13.830> rust

00:01:14.059 --> 00:01:14.069 
the wheel wells we've got some rust

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:16.550 
the wheel wells we've got some rust
issues<00:01:14.490> this<00:01:14.759> is<00:01:14.909> actually<00:01:15.330> common<00:01:15.569> for<00:01:16.440> these

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
issues this is actually common for these

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.609 
issues this is actually common for these
types<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.979> cars<00:01:17.220> we<00:01:18.030> will<00:01:18.210> get<00:01:18.479> patch<00:01:19.110> panels

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
types of cars we will get patch panels

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.499 
types of cars we will get patch panels
to<00:01:19.830> put<00:01:20.009> in<00:01:20.190> to<00:01:20.310> go<00:01:20.460> over<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.789> wheel<00:01:20.940> wells<00:01:21.210> I

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
to put in to go over the wheel wells I

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.389 
to put in to go over the wheel wells I
don't<00:01:22.140> want<00:01:22.289> to<00:01:22.350> go<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.679> replace<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.009> entire

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
don't want to go and replace the entire

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:24.770 
don't want to go and replace the entire
quarter<00:01:23.850> because<00:01:23.940> the<00:01:24.030> rest<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.509> quarter

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
quarter because the rest of the quarter

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.510 
quarter because the rest of the quarter
panel<00:01:25.110> even<00:01:25.319> with<00:01:25.560> old<00:01:25.770> body<00:01:26.009> damage

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
panel even with old body damage

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.630 
panel even with old body damage
is<00:01:27.450> still<00:01:27.869> good<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.649> we<00:01:28.890> can<00:01:28.920> straighten<00:01:29.429> the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
is still good so we can straighten the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.419 
is still good so we can straighten the
metal<00:01:30.050> but<00:01:31.050> we<00:01:31.170> want<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.440> cut<00:01:31.649> out<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.130> replace

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:32.429 
metal but we want to cut out and replace

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:34.669 
metal but we want to cut out and replace
all<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.819> rust<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.780> we'll<00:01:33.899> do<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.259> with<00:01:34.470> patch

00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:34.679 
all the rust so we'll do that with patch

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:36.740 
all the rust so we'll do that with patch
panels<00:01:35.100> on<00:01:35.220> this<00:01:35.340> car<00:01:35.580> a<00:01:35.759> little<00:01:36.630> more

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
panels on this car a little more

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.240 
panels on this car a little more
bodywork<00:01:37.200> here<00:01:37.500> on<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.920> front<00:01:38.129> of<00:01:38.160> the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
bodywork here on the front of the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.020 
bodywork here on the front of the
quarter<00:01:38.660> we<00:01:39.660> also<00:01:39.869> have<00:01:40.399> very<00:01:41.399> nice<00:01:41.640> rocker

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
quarter we also have very nice rocker

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.800 
quarter we also have very nice rocker
panels<00:01:42.539> with<00:01:43.110> no<00:01:43.379> rust<00:01:43.709> at<00:01:44.190> all<00:01:44.629> which<00:01:45.629> is<00:01:45.660> a

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
panels with no rust at all which is a

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.869 
panels with no rust at all which is a
plus<00:01:46.289> with<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.709> car<00:01:46.979> there<00:01:47.280> I've<00:01:47.429> seen<00:01:47.670> these

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:47.879 
plus with this car there I've seen these

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:49.580 
plus with this car there I've seen these
where<00:01:48.119> they<00:01:48.209> were<00:01:48.270> completely<00:01:48.780> gone<00:01:49.110> before

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
where they were completely gone before

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.809 
where they were completely gone before
so<00:01:49.830> this<00:01:50.429> is<00:01:50.580> a<00:01:50.610> very<00:01:50.940> good<00:01:51.239> deal<00:01:51.959> for<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.259> car

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
so this is a very good deal for this car

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:55.130 
so this is a very good deal for this car
we<00:01:53.819> have<00:01:54.179> up<00:01:54.509> here<00:01:54.539> where<00:01:54.840> we<00:01:54.929> did<00:01:55.110> some

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
we have up here where we did some

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.949 
we have up here where we did some
pulling<00:01:55.679> before<00:01:56.009> on<00:01:56.190> the<00:01:56.310> firewall<00:01:56.789> we<00:01:57.720> have

00:01:57.949 --> 00:01:57.959 
pulling before on the firewall we have

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:01.190 
pulling before on the firewall we have
some<00:01:58.379> damage<00:01:59.190> here<00:01:59.369> we<00:01:59.489> still<00:01:59.729> need<00:01:59.970> to<00:02:00.200> pound

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
some damage here we still need to pound

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.919 
some damage here we still need to pound
out<00:02:01.379> and<00:02:01.560> make<00:02:01.649> straight<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:03.060> but<00:02:03.810> that's

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
out and make straight and but that's

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:05.900 
out and make straight and but that's
going<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.229> be<00:02:04.289> done<00:02:04.590> later<00:02:04.830> but<00:02:05.459> we<00:02:05.580> will<00:02:05.759> go

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
going to be done later but we will go

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.790 
going to be done later but we will go
ahead<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.179> seal<00:02:06.479> this<00:02:06.720> with<00:02:06.959> the<00:02:07.110> primer<00:02:07.410> and

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
ahead and seal this with the primer and

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.619

back all right the front of the car on
this<00:02:11.550> side<00:02:11.819> this<00:02:12.180> is<00:02:12.239> where<00:02:12.480> we<00:02:12.599> cut<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.930> panel

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
this side this is where we cut the panel

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.009 
this side this is where we cut the panel
out<00:02:13.379> before<00:02:13.970> we<00:02:14.970> will<00:02:15.150> be<00:02:15.269> doing<00:02:15.420> some<00:02:15.690> work<00:02:15.720> on

out before we will be doing some work on

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.309 
out before we will be doing some work on
that<00:02:16.230> but<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.739> main<00:02:16.980> focus<00:02:17.220> was<00:02:18.230> sanding<00:02:19.230> the

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
that but the main focus was sanding the

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.140 
that but the main focus was sanding the
body<00:02:19.530> down<00:02:19.830> getting<00:02:20.400> it<00:02:20.519> down<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.790> bare<00:02:20.970> metal

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150

body down getting it down the bare metal
we're<00:02:21.660> gonna<00:02:21.810> be<00:02:21.900> doing<00:02:22.080> some<00:02:22.230> bodywork<00:02:22.470> in

we're gonna be doing some bodywork in
this<00:02:22.950> area<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:23.430> we<00:02:23.550> didn't<00:02:23.700> really<00:02:23.819> need<00:02:24.030> to

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
this area so we didn't really need to

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.490 
this area so we didn't really need to
sand<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.480> down<00:02:24.540> we'll<00:02:24.840> worry<00:02:25.050> about<00:02:25.140> that

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
sand it down we'll worry about that

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.170 
sand it down we'll worry about that
after<00:02:25.709> we<00:02:25.920> do<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.280> welding<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:26.819> everything

bit worse than the other side but still

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.099 
bit worse than the other side but still
a<00:03:06.180> patch<00:03:06.390> panel<00:03:06.799> around<00:03:07.799> will<00:03:08.129> fix<00:03:08.430> this<00:03:09.109> it'll

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
a patch panel around will fix this it'll

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.920 
a patch panel around will fix this it'll
be<00:03:10.260> all<00:03:10.409> fresh<00:03:10.769> new<00:03:11.189> metal<00:03:11.549> and<00:03:12.540> we'll<00:03:12.720> weld

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
be all fresh new metal and we'll weld

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.250 
be all fresh new metal and we'll weld
that<00:03:13.109> in<00:03:13.319> and<00:03:13.560> then<00:03:14.370> this<00:03:14.549> area<00:03:14.879> is<00:03:15.329> the<00:03:15.900> area

that in and then this area is the area

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.160 
that in and then this area is the area
where<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:16.709> got<00:03:16.859> hit<00:03:17.069> before<00:03:17.220> and<00:03:17.849> we<00:03:18.420> have<00:03:18.689> a

lot of damage here where it looks like

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.059 
lot of damage here where it looks like
somebody<00:03:21.510> came<00:03:21.750> in<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:21.930> used<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:22.650> hammer<00:03:22.829> and

hammered it out to try to get it
straight<00:03:25.440> enough<00:03:25.889> and<00:03:26.040> then<00:03:26.159> covered<00:03:26.549> it<00:03:26.670> up
