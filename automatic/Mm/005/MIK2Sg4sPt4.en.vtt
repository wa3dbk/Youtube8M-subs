00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.250
 the house of the simpsons I tried 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.300
 do as much as possible and today 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.870
 have followed a little I close the door 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.579
 so that no one enters this is the best 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.900
 This is the dining room where or 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.239
 be where they have the fireplace and the 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.670
 piano tries to imitate the piano but the 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.070
 minecraft is impossible on this 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.470
 pay so I do not miss this 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.480
 is where you should eat television the 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.160
 tele large monoxide but the 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.680
 another was too small if they put a 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.110
 new cubes 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.690

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.990
 it's worse because it's too long and 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.600
 it's not so like life 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.269
 the series here where the staircase would go 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.070
 for the basement and this is the garage 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.380
 our car or anything because it is 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.869
 impossible with so much square 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.850

 first to teach the room 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.850
 homer and marge I made the beds like this 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.370
 because the others are dwarfed 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.640
 according to the size of the room one 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.640

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.450
 theoretically of disa according to the sre and 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.360

 some chapters is the room of 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.560
 maggie and in others a bath that's why the 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.800
 leave empty 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.550
 until he finds out what can be and is 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.880
 the same 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.000
 note that small are those that more 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.980
 arrangement to the room so big 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.400
 to note is that the room is going to have 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.500
 10 x 12 or so more or less in the beds 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.920

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.210

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.260
 here a trap door I can not put 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.220
 stairs that go down 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.400
 you have to catch 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.319
 now now 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.209
 it's huge is almost bigger than all the 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.530
 house on the roof that has impulse a 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.310
 little taste so they did not come out 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.310
 bugs or anything 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:06.000
 this to sell peanuts of everything now we're going 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:08.280
 to go out to the street as you can see 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.380
 this chulÃ­simo to the house I have left very 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.780
 well at least I think that the 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.170
 server think the same thing I've put up 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.430
 the scream that comes out here in the photos of 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.430
 the house of the simpsons 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.670
 is that to notice that enormous that 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.770

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.360
 creative for khedira and new that 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.880
 it is impossible to do it without creative has 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.990
 made with creatives and I admit it we go 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.150
 to see the back garden 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.640
 this is the pool in the chapter that 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.080
 smooth bust with two makes popular da 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.430
 this also for doing it by filling in a 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.430
 little the garden that too huge 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.340
 this is the sandbox of maguey and now I'm going 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.590
 to teach the vaart tree house 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.739
 it has been very good for me I love it 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.739
 much 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.790
 that does not open open 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.730
 for the break in the shit the trapdoor 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.190
 go now 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.370
 fuck that up the hard would be for the 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:13.709
 grass this one would be willing to put 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.709
 another little bit better 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.329
 and this is the nano psoe but it's good 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.909
 fairly good 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.389

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:25.639

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.870
 hello I wanted to teach everyone I do not think that 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.050
 pass the map and things like that so that 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.300
 be personal 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.370
 as you can see it is huge and I do not want 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.840
 that they copy it because I like two days 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:40.540
 and something to finish it 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.010
 from a distance it looks a lot like 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.680
 close not so much is what the 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.490
