00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
progressed torch at all both guys going

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.480 
progressed torch at all both guys going
insane<00:02:24.750> by<00:02:25.560> each<00:02:25.770> other<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.040> think<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.400> was

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
insane by each other I think it was

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.520 
insane by each other I think it was
about<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.790> fifth<00:02:27.090> round<00:02:27.330> when<00:02:28.140> something

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
about the fifth round when something

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.780 
about the fifth round when something
happened<00:02:28.860> where<00:02:30.020> Lopez<00:02:31.020> had<00:02:31.170> his<00:02:31.290> head<00:02:31.470> down

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
happened where Lopez had his head down

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.130 
happened where Lopez had his head down
Victor<00:02:32.790> Ortiz<00:02:33.180> walked<00:02:33.450> him<00:02:33.690> in<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.840> back<00:02:33.989> of

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
Victor Ortiz walked him in the back of

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.650 
Victor Ortiz walked him in the back of
the<00:02:34.230> head<00:02:34.380> clean<00:02:34.739> unnecessarily<00:02:35.670> obviously

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
the head clean unnecessarily obviously

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.870 
the head clean unnecessarily obviously
it<00:02:36.720> was<00:02:36.810> intentional<00:02:37.500> but<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.040> guess<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.760> was

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
it was intentional but I guess it was

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.190 
it was intentional but I guess it was
the<00:02:38.910> heat<00:02:39.150> of<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.390> moment<00:02:39.569> there<00:02:39.870> was<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:40.020> lot

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
the heat of the moment there was a lot

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.820 
the heat of the moment there was a lot
going<00:02:40.230> on

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
going on

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.670 
going on
no<00:02:41.280> both<00:02:41.580> going<00:02:41.880> at<00:02:41.970> each<00:02:42.090> other<00:02:42.319> so<00:02:43.319> he<00:02:43.530> just

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
no both going at each other so he just

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.530 
no both going at each other so he just
walked<00:02:43.980> him<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:44.340> referee<00:02:44.730> gives<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.300> guy<00:02:45.510> a

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
walked him and referee gives the guy a

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.650 
walked him and referee gives the guy a
timeout<00:02:46.340> Lopez<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.370> timeout<00:02:47.670> did<00:02:48.030> not<00:02:48.209> deduct<00:02:48.510> a

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
timeout Lopez a timeout did not deduct a

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.050 
timeout Lopez a timeout did not deduct a
point<00:02:49.070> and<00:02:50.070> which<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:50.340> thought<00:02:50.519> was<00:02:50.670> fair

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
point and which I thought was fair

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.160 
point and which I thought was fair
enough

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
enough

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.949 
enough
and<00:02:52.590> then<00:02:52.769> they<00:02:52.890> continued<00:02:53.519> and<00:02:53.790> then<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.780> was

think one of the last punches broke

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.580 
think one of the last punches broke
Ortiz<00:03:23.250> his<00:03:23.400> jaw<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.690> guy<00:03:24.900> didn't<00:03:25.290> get<00:03:25.440> up

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
Ortiz his jaw and the guy didn't get up

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.319 
Ortiz his jaw and the guy didn't get up
from<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:25.860> student<00:03:26.220> he<00:03:26.280> seemed<00:03:26.610> you<00:03:27.030> know<00:03:27.150> like
