00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
um just the standard password that the

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.250 
um just the standard password that the
most<00:02:40.150> has<00:02:40.330> is<00:02:40.510> four<00:02:40.750> zeros<00:02:42.600> four<00:02:43.600> zeros<00:02:43.989> and

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
most has is four zeros four zeros and

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.960 
most has is four zeros four zeros and
we're<00:02:44.830> done<00:02:45.239> and<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.720> mouse<00:02:46.870> works<00:02:47.970> so

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
we're done and the mouse works so

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.539 
we're done and the mouse works so
basically<00:02:49.630> we<00:02:49.780> don't<00:02:49.930> get<00:02:50.049> any<00:02:50.170> scrolling<00:02:50.680> so

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
basically we don't get any scrolling so

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:52.920 
basically we don't get any scrolling so
we<00:02:51.730> don't<00:02:51.880> get<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.120> do<00:02:52.239> the<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.720> touch

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
we don't get to do the the touch

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.300 
we don't get to do the the touch
scrolling<00:02:53.260> but<00:02:53.410> you<00:02:53.560> can<00:02:53.739> still<00:02:53.920> use<00:02:54.100> it<00:02:54.130> as<00:02:54.280> a

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
scrolling but you can still use it as a

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.180 
scrolling but you can still use it as a
point<00:02:54.610> and<00:02:54.700> click<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:55.830> that's<00:02:56.830> about<00:02:56.950> all<00:02:57.070> it

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
point and click and that's about all it

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.610 
point and click and that's about all it
does<00:02:57.459> there's<00:02:57.670> no<00:02:57.760> buttons<00:02:58.090> I<00:02:58.930> imagine<00:02:59.530> the

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
does there's no buttons I imagine the

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.660 
does there's no buttons I imagine the
applet<00:02:59.890> will<00:03:00.010> come<00:03:00.130> up<00:03:00.220> with<00:03:00.250> an<00:03:00.400> update

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
applet will come up with an update

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.090 
applet will come up with an update
eventually<00:03:01.120> for<00:03:01.900> so<00:03:02.530> that<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:02.769> can<00:03:02.920> use<00:03:02.950> it

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
eventually for so that you can use it

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.699 
eventually for so that you can use it
with<00:03:03.400> their<00:03:03.670> which<00:03:04.000> bootcamp<00:03:04.510> or<00:03:04.709> vmware

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
with their which bootcamp or vmware
