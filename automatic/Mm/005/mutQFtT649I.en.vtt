00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.440
 Doing Well now this now pulled out the ones that long ago 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.570
 Leave it Toka tell you whether Well I have a variety to 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.789
 that 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:17.949
 It but I still can shorter but it is do Toka that so it is important animation I history 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:22.410
 It has a little history 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:26.560
 Something has gone Well Hey short because Atoka is 50 years 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:32.300
 Even if you search for something else , you must first secure it 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:35.550
 It is such a place to mix such a bill to such a plan this time 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:40.730
 I think it was really good, but I say it is connected properly 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:46.210
 Now is there is already stacked gave to Potsun in this surprisingly because it was a little while ago 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.210
 Near- term registration like rootote intertwining like this 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.040
 If there is a restriction on the work, there is likely to be people 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.610
 Among them 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.590
 It is valuable 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.600
 I have to do this when I can do the celty child of the fan at such timing 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.970
 Well so 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:10.350
 That here also but is sputum explore the future of the festival in this project itself is 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:13.040
 In order to explore the future , that past is not even sub 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.390
 Then in that there is a very meaning of such a 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.790
 What Kana now of people it is contents 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:25.030
 I only look before I say old things are bad 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:27.310
 Tiny like a sound lifting those things would use is something good in the bad new is Iinda 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.159
 Hard-to-work 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.290
 I think that is too obsessed with related so much not Regards 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.370
 To say there is no good in those of the old days 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:40.090
 I think I'm a presenter too 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:44.890
 The good and the bad are various in the history 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:49.030
 It might be better to pick it up at the time of pick-up 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:53.590
 What is ask you is the most important thing is to become a creator to have support of the door that mountain 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:58.150
 I think you have just now becomes the answer When will I thought I but possibly to try to 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:01.570
 Oh There are do's or Atchaimachi there is a spirit in one question of such another question female 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:04.880
 Although I was from 9:00 Innovation What is important thing to become a creator 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.190
 Of course there is also a history of knowing the history 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.550
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:12.860
 Is it Seth again? 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:14.580
 Hypothesis, is not it to observe whether the observation force Toka voice quality is also one Well important to many things read strongly 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:20.650
 Ne 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:23.120
 Specializing in people who can get balance in them 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.480
 People and their balance 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.030
 Do not come differences in the personality of the various child 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.400
 by greaterer 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.400
 I wonder if Well those things The important thing to crater 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.459
 After all it is sense 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.060
 Oh dear 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:45.100
 There are many other things, too 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:49.870
 I also think that it is necessary for experience points and such 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.330
 It is quite easy for people to know what they are and what they are experiencing. 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.680
 Can not put out 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.180
 It is interesting if this looks like something after seeing something 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.220
 That's right 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:04.260
 It is nice to say that this image can be produced 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.830
 I do n't think that it is not 0 tech because Sora- sama puts it sideways like this 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:12.750
 Nay but 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:19.590
 After all, humans have that imagination, but before that, they still have observational power and so on 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:20.280
 Something is not and still care what I think and does not lead to it entered to flying trigger sky 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.540
 Teru and 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.670
 I think I can fly 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:31.209
 Fish is high 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:33.280
 If you look at swimming in the river, you can call yourself what you can do with this kind of thing you saw 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.300
 Human beings are amazing 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.110
 It is an image 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:45.130
 It's a good place, so I think there is a chance on the dog ground 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:48.480
 Really it really less but we also put a genius system that can not hear up 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.480
 It came a few genius 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.880
 Oh dear 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:57.380
 Question to increase experience or number of observations 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:04:01.760
 I role that you do not want why when the ball 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.420
 I was asked to lay out at the beginning of the site of Yamato who was not why why two schools 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.540
 There will be 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:09.290
 Along or So in Tsu I'm Why sufficient child 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:12.000
 Then there is no one who will teach you, and it's because there is no anime scale at the time 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:16.190
 Believe in yourself from such to 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.950
 Animator Before changing it , it's just a task to hit the sheet once . 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.420
 Because I was the day after tomorrow move Adeje 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.420
 This is another great job 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:29.980
 I learned a very good story Even if I am not an animator I learned 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:34.510
 Thank you for your feedback from users 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:39.060

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.060
