Holborn I'm just going to tell you a
little<00:00:15.240> bit<00:00:15.390> about<00:00:15.600> the<00:00:16.020> sonic<00:00:16.560> AC<00:00:16.830> 90<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.790> for

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
little bit about the sonic AC 90 and for

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.130 
little bit about the sonic AC 90 and for
the<00:00:19.560> AC<00:00:19.740> 90<00:00:20.310> here<00:00:20.610> this<00:00:21.450> is<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.600> new<00:00:21.840> small

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
the AC 90 here this is a new small

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.530 
the AC 90 here this is a new small
camera<00:00:22.529> from<00:00:22.710> panasonic<00:00:23.360> the<00:00:24.360> most

camera from panasonic the most

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.030 
camera from panasonic the most
incredible<00:00:24.990> thing<00:00:25.170> about<00:00:25.200> it<00:00:25.619> actually<00:00:25.770> is

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.040 
incredible thing about it actually is

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.260 
incredible thing about it actually is
that<00:00:26.220> you're<00:00:26.369> getting<00:00:26.460> this<00:00:26.730> sort<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.060> quality

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.270 
that you're getting this sort of quality

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.220 
that you're getting this sort of quality
at<00:00:27.750> about<00:00:28.289> 1400<00:00:29.010> pounds<00:00:29.160> mr.<00:00:29.580> Vyse<00:00:30.050> this<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.199> a

resolution onto two SD card slots here

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.740 
resolution onto two SD card slots here
so<00:00:43.949> we<00:00:44.070> can<00:00:44.220> either<00:00:44.339> relay<00:00:44.909> record<00:00:45.360> for<00:00:45.600> one

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
so we can either relay record for one

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.360 
so we can either relay record for one
part<00:00:46.019> to<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.229> other<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:46.650> one<00:00:46.800> one<00:00:46.979> that<00:00:47.129> builds

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
part to the other so one one that builds

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.210 
part to the other so one one that builds
up<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.640> switches<00:00:47.970> here<00:00:48.150> or<00:00:48.989> we<00:00:49.409> can<00:00:49.650> record<00:00:50.070> on

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220 
up and switches here or we can record on

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.219 
up and switches here or we can record on
both<00:00:50.430> simultaneously<00:00:50.729> so<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.540> have<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.720> backup

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:52.229 
both simultaneously so you have a backup

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:53.930 
both simultaneously so you have a backup
or<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.800> can<00:00:52.979> give<00:00:53.100> one<00:00:53.309> card<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.640> somebody

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
or you can give one card to somebody

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.780 
or you can give one card to somebody
else<00:00:54.089> and<00:00:54.269> keep<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.570> company<00:00:54.780> yourself<00:00:55.790> to

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
else and keep it company yourself to

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.299 
else and keep it company yourself to
card<00:00:57.089> recording<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:58.170> you've<00:00:58.350> got<00:00:58.500> HDMI<00:00:58.949> out

moving backwards and forwards or if
you've<00:01:39.710> had<00:01:39.860> a<00:01:39.890> couple<00:01:40.160> too<00:01:40.370> many<00:01:40.400> drinks<00:01:40.760> it

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
you've had a couple too many drinks it

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.240 
you've had a couple too many drinks it
can<00:01:41.720> cope<00:01:41.930> with<00:01:42.230> any<00:01:42.590> sort<00:01:42.980> of<00:01:43.070> movement

can cope with any sort of movement
around<00:01:43.820> any<00:01:44.630> sort<00:01:44.960> of<00:01:45.280> any<00:01:46.280> sort<00:01:46.610> of<00:01:46.670> direction

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
around any sort of any sort of direction

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.120 
around any sort of any sort of direction
so<00:01:47.780> this<00:01:47.960> this<00:01:48.200> really<00:01:48.560> can<00:01:48.860> give<00:01:49.040> you
