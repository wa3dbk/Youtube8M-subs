00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.629
 hello together we want you today 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.630
 show like a simple flute 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.210
 is tinkering and july shows you that 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.420
 final result when we are done okay 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:19.199
 blow in it 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:22.400
 So you can hear works beautifully to 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.400
 to make the flute 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.220
 I do not know if you can see well 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.619
 this is the flute july in the boy 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.100
 garde has whistled to tinker 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.879
 we need the following material we 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:44.520
 a carpet knife needs a file 1 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:49.770
 12 mm book roundwood and optional 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:54.000
 either half pipe 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:58.710
 inches from the obi as it is baptized out 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.239
 plastic or you take too 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:06.060
 a half inch pipe 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:07.650
 I think that's for me from pvc 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.610
 Just keep the types here for me 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.680
 knows if you can not see it you 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.240
 can not recognize it 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:21.710
 yes in any case is on the side 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:27.990
 of the tube easy luthe and hard pvc c 16 x 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:31.220
 1 bv c tube in half full okay and 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.220
 then it starts with the tinkering 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:52.390
 First, a heavy carver 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.390
 shaped before 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:06.290
 so to approach 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:08.500
 after that , if I do not edge 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.500
 boned 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:41.670
 when that happens the twelve will be 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:51.370
 meter high pile sections circa 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:56.380
 five to seven inches long can 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:58.360
 show her from the side so from 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.130
 in front and from the side you can see it 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:10.330
 just as good as the oblique should be 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:13.150
 okay, the whole thing is now in one another 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:19.420
 stuck and that comes the end of the 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:24.910
 book stabs almost to the first card 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:26.710
 the tube so a section now 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.530
 suddenly the face plugged smoke 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:34.350
 important is now when trying or 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:38.380
 when adjusting that the started 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:40.660
 to be held and then positioned 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.260
 one died the book as far as infected 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:47.100
 so far that then the whistle 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.100
 spatially wrong 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.980
 because that happened is said back 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:04:04.290
 the excess from the week start 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:04.290
 Last sample you further away that is too 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.900
 so as not to keep the whistle 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.260
 I have to cut a piece now 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:20.230
 and as a closure at the other end 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.360
 plugged in the excess piece 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.570
 again sawed off the pipe flush 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.570
 is 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:42.390
 for a better mouthpiece that will 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:48.090
 front of the fold a bit 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:51.630
 rejuvenated meaning that no more so 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.220
 thick in the front but it is still one 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:59.100
 piece sawn off now again to 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:02.370
 The test is going well so that's it 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:05.180
 so to speak, the end product so we the 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.180
 whistle finished
