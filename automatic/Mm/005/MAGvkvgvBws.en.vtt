and that's how they grade them i guess

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.670 
and that's how they grade them i guess
on<00:00:26.550> ps3<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.510> don't<00:00:27.689> really<00:00:27.840> have<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.050> ps3<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:28.619> I

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
on ps3 I don't really have a ps3 so I

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.070 
on ps3 I don't really have a ps3 so I
couldn't<00:00:29.039> say<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.820> but<00:00:30.060> whatever<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.539> mabbe

couldn't say that but whatever and mabbe
the<00:00:31.320> dead<00:00:31.560> execute<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.790> plan<00:00:33.030> now<00:00:33.660> since<00:00:33.899> this

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
the dead execute the plan now since this

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.380 
the dead execute the plan now since this
is<00:00:34.230> silver<00:00:34.620> it's<00:00:34.890> no<00:00:35.430> one<00:00:35.579> escapes<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.030> lab<00:00:36.210> I'm

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
is silver it's no one escapes a lab I'm

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.990 
is silver it's no one escapes a lab I'm
going<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:37.020> assume<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.640> Easter

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
going to assume that this is the Easter

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.450 
going to assume that this is the Easter
egg<00:00:39.030> but<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.570> could<00:00:39.809> be<00:00:39.840> wrong<00:00:40.070> feed<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.250> beast

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
egg but I could be wrong feed the beast

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.030 
egg but I could be wrong feed the beast
bronze<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.450> mob<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.110> dead<00:00:43.170> obtained

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
bronze and mob of the dead obtained

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.260 
bronze and mob of the dead obtained
he'll<00:00:44.870> obtain<00:00:45.870> hell's<00:00:46.410> retriever<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.489> then

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
he'll obtain hell's retriever and then

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.959 
he'll obtain hell's retriever and then
the<00:00:48.480> next<00:00:48.510> one<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.079> making<00:00:49.350> around<00:00:49.920> bronze<00:00:50.640> and

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
the next one is making around bronze and

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.660 
the next one is making around bronze and
mob<00:00:51.510> with<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.750> dead<00:00:51.960> complete<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.190> cycle

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
mob with the dead complete the cycle

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.869 
mob with the dead complete the cycle
three<00:00:54.660> times<00:00:55.110> now<00:00:55.770> I'm<00:00:55.890> going<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.070> assume<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
three times now I'm going to assume the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.209 
three times now I'm going to assume the
cycle<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.660> like<00:00:57.870> walking<00:00:58.500> around<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.039> map

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
cycle is like walking around the map

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.510 
cycle is like walking around the map
three<00:00:59.489> times<00:00:59.989> acid<00:01:00.989> drip<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.620> mob<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
three times acid drip and mob of the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.140 
three times acid drip and mob of the
dead<00:01:02.780> convert<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.960> weapon<00:01:04.439> using<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.220> kit<00:01:05.489> now

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
dead convert a weapon using a kit now

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.179 
dead convert a weapon using a kit now
that<00:01:06.360> seems<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.900> be<00:01:07.020> really<00:01:07.229> cool<00:01:07.439> we<00:01:07.979> didn't

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
that seems to be really cool we didn't

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.590 
that seems to be really cool we didn't
get<00:01:08.280> any<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.820> trailer<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.360> I

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
get any of that in the trailer that I

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.410 
get any of that in the trailer that I
know<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.930> full<00:01:10.799> lockdown<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.729> mob<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
know of full lockdown and mob of the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.980 
know of full lockdown and mob of the
dead<00:01:12.799> Brutus<00:01:13.799> completes<00:01:14.460> his<00:01:14.760> patrol<00:01:15.299> I'm

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
dead Brutus completes his patrol I'm

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.990 
dead Brutus completes his patrol I'm
going<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.619> assume<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:16.950> Brutus<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
going to assume that Brutus is the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.420 
going to assume that Brutus is the
warden<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.630> warden<00:01:19.140> walks<00:01:19.470> around<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.070> if

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
warden in the warden walks around and if

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.580 
warden in the warden walks around and if
he<00:01:20.610> sees<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.240> he's<00:01:21.479> going<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.689> get<00:01:21.840> angry<00:01:22.080> so

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
he sees you he's going to get angry so

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.740 
he sees you he's going to get angry so
if<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.890> guess<00:01:23.130> he<00:01:23.759> just<00:01:23.790> goes<00:01:24.180> out<00:01:24.390> through<00:01:24.659> his

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
if I guess he just goes out through his

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.749 
if I guess he just goes out through his
patrol<00:01:25.380> doesn't<00:01:26.009> see<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.400> goes<00:01:26.520> back

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
patrol doesn't see you and goes back

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.600 
patrol doesn't see you and goes back
