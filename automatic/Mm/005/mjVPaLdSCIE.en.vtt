a<00:00:54.920> couple<00:00:55.309> of<00:00:55.340> weeks<00:00:55.670> now<00:00:56.059> and<00:00:56.620> and<00:00:57.620> I<00:00:57.770> do<00:00:57.829> think

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
a couple of weeks now and and I do think

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.930 
a couple of weeks now and and I do think
it's<00:00:58.340> a<00:00:58.430> really<00:00:58.460> nice<00:00:58.910> device<00:00:59.710> to<00:01:00.710> use<00:01:00.980> however

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
it's a really nice device to use however

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.119 
it's a really nice device to use however
I'll<00:01:02.750> take<00:01:02.960> them<00:01:03.079> out<00:01:03.170> of<00:01:03.350> the<00:01:03.410> box<00:01:03.649> for<00:01:04.070> the

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
I'll take them out of the box for the

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.870 
I'll take them out of the box for the
last<00:01:04.369> couple<00:01:05.360> of<00:01:05.539> weeks<00:01:05.600> has<00:01:06.050> not<00:01:06.640> got<00:01:07.640> any

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
last couple of weeks has not got any

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.190 
last couple of weeks has not got any
easier<00:01:08.630> at<00:01:09.289> all<00:01:10.180> so<00:01:11.180> in<00:01:11.299> the<00:01:11.360> Box<00:01:11.540> we<00:01:11.900> get<00:01:12.080> the

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
easier at all so in the Box we get the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.330 
easier at all so in the Box we get the
unit<00:01:12.530> itself<00:01:13.010> we<00:01:13.850> get<00:01:14.030> a<00:01:14.240> box<00:01:14.990> to<00:01:15.770> keep<00:01:16.189> the

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
unit itself we get a box to keep the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.710 
unit itself we get a box to keep the
unit<00:01:16.610> in<00:01:16.760> and<00:01:17.530> we<00:01:18.530> also<00:01:18.740> get<00:01:19.130> a<00:01:19.340> few<00:01:20.060> extra<00:01:20.299> ear

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
unit in and we also get a few extra ear

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.249 
unit in and we also get a few extra ear
buds<00:01:20.960> and<00:01:21.170> ear<00:01:21.860> clip<00:01:22.130> and<00:01:22.340> a<00:01:22.850> pen<00:01:23.060> clip<00:01:23.330> itself

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
buds and ear clip and a pen clip itself

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.490 
buds and ear clip and a pen clip itself
so<00:01:24.619> we<00:01:24.920> get<00:01:25.070> three<00:01:25.640> extra<00:01:26.450> ear<00:01:26.689> buds<00:01:26.900> with<00:01:27.380> the

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
so we get three extra ear buds with the

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.880 
so we get three extra ear buds with the
unit<00:01:27.740> as<00:01:27.920> well<00:01:28.610> as<00:01:28.900> the<00:01:29.900> one<00:01:30.110> that<00:01:30.380> already

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
unit as well as the one that already

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.060 
unit as well as the one that already
comes<00:01:31.100> on<00:01:31.580> the<00:01:31.790> unit<00:01:32.060> just<00:01:32.270> there<00:01:33.110> as<00:01:33.890> you<00:01:34.040> can

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
this slides onto the shaft of the carbon

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.740 
this slides onto the shaft of the carbon
and<00:01:39.710> it<00:01:39.890> allows<00:01:40.130> you<00:01:40.400> to<00:01:40.670> keep<00:01:41.150> the<00:01:41.450> unit

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
and it allows you to keep the unit

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.100 
and it allows you to keep the unit
secured<00:01:42.229> in<00:01:42.470> your<00:01:42.619> pocket<00:01:43.450> you<00:01:44.450> do<00:01:44.630> get<00:01:44.840> an<00:01:44.960> air

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
clip to fit onto the device if you don't

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.249 
clip to fit onto the device if you don't
think<00:01:47.299> the<00:01:47.390> ear<00:01:47.509> buds<00:01:47.689> are<00:01:47.810> good<00:01:47.930> enough<00:01:48.079> of

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
think the ear buds are good enough of

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.139 
think the ear buds are good enough of
keeping<00:01:48.590> it<00:01:48.649> in<00:01:48.710> your<00:01:48.740> ear<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.159> you<00:01:49.820> get<00:01:49.970> this

keeping it in your ear and you get this

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.620 
keeping it in your ear and you get this
hard<00:01:50.840> case<00:01:51.170> now<00:01:51.439> this<00:01:51.590> hard<00:01:51.799> case<00:01:52.009> is<00:01:52.670> a<00:01:53.060> little

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
hard case now this hard case is a little

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.050 
hard case now this hard case is a little
bit<00:01:53.869> of<00:01:53.960> feminine<00:01:55.060> but<00:01:56.060> inside<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.780> hard<00:01:56.990> case

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
bit of feminine but inside the hard case

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.130 
bit of feminine but inside the hard case
you<00:01:59.060> get<00:01:59.240> a<00:01:59.390> microUSB<00:02:00.340> lead<00:02:01.340> to<00:02:01.759> charge<00:02:02.140> the

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
you get a microUSB lead to charge the

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.780 
you get a microUSB lead to charge the
carbon<00:02:03.590> with<00:02:04.420> so<00:02:05.420> this<00:02:05.630> is<00:02:06.040> real<00:02:07.040> carbon<00:02:07.549> fiber

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
carbon with so this is real carbon fiber

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.490 
carbon with so this is real carbon fiber
like<00:02:08.209> I've<00:02:08.420> already<00:02:08.720> said<00:02:08.959> and<00:02:09.200> it<00:02:09.350> is<00:02:09.470> a

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
like I've already said and it is a
