00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:24.580 

we<00:02:13.750> do<00:02:13.900> need<00:02:14.049> backup<00:02:14.680> that's<00:02:14.859> your<00:02:14.980> department

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.600 

this<00:02:30.630> is<00:02:30.810> an<00:02:30.930> interesting<00:02:31.200> trailer<00:02:31.830> I'm<00:02:32.250> still

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
this is an interesting trailer I'm still

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.340 
this is an interesting trailer I'm still
not<00:02:32.730> blown<00:02:33.030> away<00:02:33.360> by<00:02:33.600> it<00:02:33.660> but<00:02:33.960> I<00:02:34.020> don't<00:02:34.140> think

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
not blown away by it but I don't think

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.900 
not blown away by it but I don't think
this<00:02:34.560> trailer<00:02:34.800> is<00:02:34.950> supposed<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.400> blow<00:02:35.610> us<00:02:35.790> away

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
this trailer is supposed to blow us away

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.680 
this trailer is supposed to blow us away
I<00:02:36.240> think<00:02:36.720> it's<00:02:36.840> supposed<00:02:36.960> to<00:02:37.350> signal<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.690> change

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
I think it's supposed to signal a change

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.390 
I think it's supposed to signal a change
in<00:02:39.840> direction<00:02:39.960> for<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.470> Ironman<00:02:40.830> franchise

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
in direction for the Ironman franchise

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.240 
in direction for the Ironman franchise
so<00:02:42.030> I<00:02:42.390> think<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:43.170> Robert<00:02:43.350> Downey<00:02:43.530> jr.<00:02:43.950> we<00:02:44.100> all

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
so I think that Robert Downey jr. we all

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.030 
so I think that Robert Downey jr. we all
know<00:02:44.460> is<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.670> fantastic<00:02:45.330> actor<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.470> definitely

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
know is a fantastic actor and definitely

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.310 
know is a fantastic actor and definitely
has<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.370> acting<00:02:48.240> chops<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.660> pull<00:02:48.840> off<00:02:49.050> a

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
has the acting chops to pull off a

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.890 
has the acting chops to pull off a
darker<00:02:49.770> more<00:02:49.950> serious<00:02:50.400> Tony<00:02:50.700> Stark<00:02:51.030> movie<00:02:51.390> but

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
darker more serious Tony Stark movie but

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.150 
darker more serious Tony Stark movie but
I<00:02:51.930> think<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.170> question<00:02:52.560> is<00:02:52.620> going<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:52.770> be<00:02:52.830> and

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
I think the question is going to be and

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.410 
I think the question is going to be and
this<00:02:53.220> is<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.430> gamble<00:02:53.820> for<00:02:53.850> Marvel<00:02:54.270> but<00:02:54.360> the

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
this is a gamble for Marvel but the

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.640 
this is a gamble for Marvel but the
question<00:02:54.780> is<00:02:54.900> is<00:02:55.230> this<00:02:55.410> something<00:02:55.620> that

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
question is is this something that

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.380 
question is is this something that
audiences<00:02:56.160> want<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.550> see<00:02:56.760> I<00:02:56.970> mean<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.360> course

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
audiences want to see I mean of course

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.360 
audiences want to see I mean of course
it's<00:02:57.690> been<00:02:57.840> wildly<00:02:58.260> successful<00:02:58.350> for<00:02:59.100> Warner

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
on you know more more realistic

real-life<00:04:01.530> problem<00:04:02.130> now<00:04:02.520> you<00:04:02.580> might<00:04:02.820> be

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
real-life problem now you might be

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.120 
real-life problem now you might be
thinking<00:04:03.240> hey<00:04:03.300> the<00:04:03.420> Mandarin<00:04:03.810> is<00:04:03.959> a<00:04:04.440> villain<00:04:04.920> a

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
thinking hey the Mandarin is a villain a

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.100 
thinking hey the Mandarin is a villain a
super<00:04:05.459> villain<00:04:05.760> in<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:05.940> comics<00:04:06.330> but<00:04:06.780> I<00:04:06.840> think

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
super villain in the comics but I think

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.050 
super villain in the comics but I think
clearly<00:04:07.500> they<00:04:07.770> redefined<00:04:08.459> him<00:04:08.610> here<00:04:08.820> I<00:04:08.850> mean

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
clearly they redefined him here I mean

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.699 
clearly they redefined him here I mean
beyond<00:04:09.330> the<00:04:09.570> fact<00:04:09.750> that<00:04:09.870> he's<00:04:09.959> not<00:04:10.080> Asian

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
beyond the fact that he's not Asian

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.280 
beyond the fact that he's not Asian
he<00:04:11.340> he<00:04:11.970> seems<00:04:12.200> very<00:04:13.200> much<00:04:13.470> to<00:04:13.770> be<00:04:14.520> drawn<00:04:14.790> from

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
he he seems very much to be drawn from

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.260 
he he seems very much to be drawn from
the<00:04:16.290> big<00:04:16.799> terrorism<00:04:17.459> figures<00:04:17.760> that<00:04:18.000> we've

more<00:04:53.129> I<00:04:53.159> hear<00:04:53.429> it<00:04:53.580> the<00:04:53.789> more<00:04:53.939> it<00:04:54.059> starts<00:04:54.419> to

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:54.509 
more I hear it the more it starts to

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:56.029 
more I hear it the more it starts to
become<00:04:54.659> its<00:04:54.869> own<00:04:54.989> thing<00:04:55.289> and<00:04:55.439> not<00:04:55.559> like<00:04:55.709> a<00:04:55.739> copy

actually doing in the film but clearly I

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.329 
actually doing in the film but clearly I

00:06:05.329 --> 00:06:05.339 
think they're gonna play this one close

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:06.919 
think they're gonna play this one close
to<00:06:05.550> the<00:06:05.639> vest<00:06:05.849> all<00:06:06.119> the<00:06:06.240> way<00:06:06.329> down<00:06:06.509> to<00:06:06.659> the<00:06:06.749> wire

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:06.929 
to the vest all the way down to the wire

00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:08.359 
to the vest all the way down to the wire
because<00:06:07.319> the<00:06:07.409> Iron<00:06:07.649> Man<00:06:07.769> 3<00:06:07.919> is<00:06:07.979> coming<00:06:08.069> out<00:06:08.309> in

00:06:08.359 --> 00:06:08.369 
because the Iron Man 3 is coming out in

00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:11.089 
because the Iron Man 3 is coming out in
about<00:06:08.429> two<00:06:08.699> months<00:06:08.849> already<00:06:09.119> so<00:06:09.929> if<00:06:10.889> they<00:06:11.039> were

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:11.099 
about two months already so if they were

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:12.709 
about two months already so if they were
gonna<00:06:11.249> show<00:06:11.669> some<00:06:11.879> money<00:06:12.029> shots<00:06:12.329> now<00:06:12.569> would<00:06:12.689> be

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:12.719 
gonna show some money shots now would be

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:13.969 
gonna show some money shots now would be
the<00:06:12.809> time<00:06:12.929> I<00:06:13.079> guess<00:06:13.319> you<00:06:13.439> could<00:06:13.559> argue<00:06:13.589> the

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:13.979 
the time I guess you could argue the

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:15.109 
the time I guess you could argue the
money<00:06:14.159> shot<00:06:14.369> is<00:06:14.519> from<00:06:14.579> the<00:06:14.729> first<00:06:14.879> trailer

00:06:15.109 --> 00:06:15.119 
money shot is from the first trailer

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:16.489 
money shot is from the first trailer
when<00:06:15.360> it's<00:06:15.479> house<00:06:15.629> falls<00:06:15.899> into<00:06:16.110> the<00:06:16.229> ocean

when it's house falls into the ocean
which<00:06:16.619> I<00:06:16.740> thought<00:06:16.949> was<00:06:17.069> devastating<00:06:17.729> because

00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:17.879 
which I thought was devastating because

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:20.239

I loved that house but I still you know

I think very much so they're trying this
is<00:06:23.219> more<00:06:23.459> about<00:06:23.610> a<00:06:23.669> thematic<00:06:23.909> tonal<00:06:24.569> change
