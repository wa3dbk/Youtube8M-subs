00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.390
 following the scheme of the original dead 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.950
 island the new delivery called riptide 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.220
 is located halfway between a 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.990
 sequel and a dlc a new long campaign 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.210
 that adds more than 20 hours of fun 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.570
 kill zombies to the formula that we 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.400
 introduced two years ago is the anses can 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.099
 played directly without 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.600
 arrange the original dead island though 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.489
 yes we can import the profile 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.739
 saved what allows us are the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.320
 level and skills we had of the 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.660
 previous game something that I will appreciate 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.059
 so much the level of aggressiveness 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.540
 and speed and resistance of the zombies 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.370
 it has grown quite like the first 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.960
 it can be played alone although it is 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.690
 playing cooperatively when more 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.979
 we enjoyed this experience for 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.970
 this review we have played 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:03.119
 riptide in individual and in xbox 360 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.710
 having the original dead island in ps3 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:06.659
 that means we are the oscars 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.299
 pimps or directly unconscious 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.760
 it has cost us many attempts 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.500
 kill certain enemies 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.180
 we have also decided to make this 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.220
 review testing the new protagonist 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.110
 called jon moore 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.660
 which we already saw as a character not 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.430
 controllable in the original and that adds 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.340
 to the four survivors of the 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.680
 vanoy events and the former player of 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.840
 american football bodyguard urn 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.620
 the oriental worker of the cyan resort 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.200
 and the rapper sam vie remember that every 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.670
 one has its pros and cons so 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.060
 the playable experience varies slightly 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.710
 depending on which one we select if not 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.750
 we import the data from the previous game 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.810
 before starting to play we will select 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.670
 what character of the 5 do we choose 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.190
 as well as what set of attributes 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.930
 we promote combat with attacks from 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.390
 fury more demolishing the attributes of 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.190
 survival or if we prefer we can 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.460
 select a balanced profile 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.020
 or enhance what we want 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.700
 after a prologue that links the facts 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.470
 the first game and just when 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.470
 characters thought they were safe 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.080
 the virus will start to expand all over 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.080
 the boat for more 'inri' a storm 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.630
 makes us shipwreck by reaching a new 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.560
 island called for the night and walk you by 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.430
 where 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.959
 she is still much more infected than they are today 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.880
 the approach of the game is based on the 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.190
 same base as the previous game without 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.709
 present any innovation in this regard 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.060
 although if something works well because 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.650
 touch him 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.390
 we are again in front of a huge 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.330
 open space of game in which 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.599
 we will also eliminate forgiveness we want 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.069
 say destroying zombies everywhere to 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.130
 the time that we are improving our 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.420
 character with new skills 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.220
 getting new weapons and improving 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.700
 to successfully complete missions 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.340
 that await us on the island we will see that 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.780
 we are not the only survivors 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.540
 receiving orders from almost 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.500
 all of them rescuing others 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.780
 that are attacked by groups of zombies 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.340
 From the beginning we will see that many 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.920
 of these missions force us to 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.740
 move much wider spaces 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.630
 than the ones on the island, adding many 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.270
 more dangers between the starting point and 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.760
 the objective to fulfill the presentation of 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.440
 they also vary and it is no longer a 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.750
 simple paper that shows what we are 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.790
 proposes but it visualizes a lot 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.010
 better the difficulty of it the 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.010
 reward to get and the weapon that 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.020
 we will get the speed with which they spend 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.060
 or spoil weapons has increased 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.190
 slightly having to look for the 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.950
 work banks more assiduously to 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.110
 repair them in certain places is 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.510
 difficult to find new weapons so 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.150
 which will be recommended repairing irlas 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.070
 quite often it is also good to do 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.950
 collection of first aid kits to apply the 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.260
 quickly when necessary and from 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.850
 all the ammunition that we can as well as 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.980
 replenish small parts of energy 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.510
 eating fruit energy bars or 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.870
 drinking isotonic drinks 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.860
 and if we die that will be quite often 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.860
 we will go back to the save point 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:11.010
 closest automatic the most 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.659
 they well placed one of the aspects 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.280
 The most liked of Dead Island are the 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:16.680
 destructive blows that we can perform 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.810
 to men from movements 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.380
 violent to simple punches and 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.419
 kicks 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.760
 these last ones serve us perfectly 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:26.250
 to get away momentarily from above 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.889
 to the zombies that surround us as well as 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.360
 stop from a zapatazo in the whole mouth to 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.300
 a zombie that approaches all milk 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.430
 anxious towards men bursting 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.440
 ribs shred legs or heads 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.020
 using from a simple knife to bats 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.419
 with spikes to mechanical saws or weapons 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.600
 of improved fire trample the heads 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:47.669
 to burst the apps maybe we should 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.580
 have indicated before that we are before 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:53.300
 an ip for over 18 years even though a 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.590
 this stage of the review gives equal 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.380
 The more destruction and how we perform 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.060
 higher score we will get and more 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.030
 fast we will get skill points 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.800
 to spend, we will also fill in the 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.199
 small red circle that tells us that 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.570
 it is possible to awaken all our rage 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.669
 and will promote a state that 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.460
 allows to be much more brutal during 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.110
 a few seconds the control is the same as 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.419
 the previous game although there are some 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.160
 asperities should therefore be corrected 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.050
 sometimes punctual our 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.320
 character has not executed correctly 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.420
 the blow that we have ordered 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.310
 at the mercy of men 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.990
 tour the island with the help of 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.330
 different vehicles that we will have 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.730
 our disposition not only allows us 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.250
 go faster from one point to another but 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.530
 that also allows us to run over and 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.230
 scatter bits of zombie all over the 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:46.440
 feeling zone that turns out bright with 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:48.150
 the use of the motor boat we noticed 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.700
 that this time there is a greater emphasis on 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.410
 that we are not alone and we will see how 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.440
 all the survivors try 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.630
 help each other something that is left 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.510
 patent and at the beginning when it fortifies 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.280
 We base our different areas of 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.990
 I play the variable climatology the 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.240
 orography of the terrain with its waterfalls 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.280
 the abrupt zones and constructions 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.120
 half abandoned give us good sample 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.680
 of the open space that we will cover 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.500
 using the chrome engine 5 again 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:19.140
 we again indicate that the scenarios 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:21.810
 present a credible correct finish 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:23.820
 but without being anything bright highlighting 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.310
 like the previous game the design and the 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.680
 zone destruction of zombies 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.900
 the huge play space allows a lot 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.790
 more variety of situations 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.620
 locations and ambushes there is a 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:37.590
 lots of items to find as well 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.810
 missions to solve as defects 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:42.600
 some zombies do not notice 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:45.030
 our presence and others detect us 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.620
 miles away there are zombies that 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:49.350
 they run the same on the ground as on the 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:51.510
 miracle water and there are areas where 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.920
 enemy enemies and enemies like 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.840
 churros although we have passed 

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.210
 previously there and we would not have 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.520
 any body we also indicate that the 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.660
 cycles day and night are very abrupt as well 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.840
 like rain and other representations 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:06.090
 of the water that rubs the dead 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.710
 island riptide good to repeat your 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:10.050
 outline and if you liked the first one that 

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:12.000
 he will like it, although he loses part of his 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.470
 charm by surprise extractor what 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.910
 compensates with a greater amount of 

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:18.090
 zombies that include new creatures 

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:19.950
 more gore more difficult space 

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:22.370
 Most varied game and huge number of 

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.370
 missions
