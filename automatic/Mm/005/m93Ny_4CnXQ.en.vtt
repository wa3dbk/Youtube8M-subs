 the simultaneous today have been disputed 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.590
 surely yes because it was wonderful and I think I think it's a 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.930
 gesture that should be imitated by others 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.370
 they were great teachers of the touch as you are not currently number one 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.370

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.440

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.060
 devote to take profit 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.799
 would describe comments was nancy teacher 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.270
 there were many children in this broadcast 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.380
 we have just spoken with two one from Argentina and the other from venezuela 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.880

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.189

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:15.309
 but in life too and good 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:18.109
 from me I want is a means to me this is a big 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:19.429
 the chess 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:22.429
 and as a very good action that has had today 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.959
 thank you 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.799
 this flight we are really this one a bit as impressed how god of 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.060
 have him here chatting with us I think it's a luxury that the bcc 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:39.339
 i also the luxury of age has been able to transmit live the simultaneous 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:40.599
 from your house 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.950
 and well I do not know what else means to return really percent 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.950
 it's an honor that implies not us 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.529
 if you can be in the command line hours to clear the 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:54.729
 there were many in what 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:56.439
 I have had problems 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:58.109
 mahan but in the end 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:03.389
 rudd I think that in Russian only lose a state well because in a moment I saw and 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.389
 dangerous of a comfortable 3 4 games 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:10.599
 if they will go backward they will not believe 

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:12.939
 the next turn 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:14.339
 in the end 

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:17.339
 I'm happy honda 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.619
 the result 

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:23.439
 no to the results or I think it deserves the wonderful in terms of the score 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:26.480
 obtained this start 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.679
 the point is something very difficult matches 

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:33.439
 we were following all of them and we did not see any problems and resolved 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:37.299
 masterfully several of the ones that had problems that was being 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.439
 attacked and more 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:40.529
 this 

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:43.529
 I really think that in the end, good 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.799
 it stopped us all scored had started very dangerous itself 

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:52.069
 ana of that also surprises me that 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.899
 pÃ©rez and the one that maybe was not as dangerous as the others also so 

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:57.119
 is 

00:03:57.119 --> 00:04:02.629
 here the arachnid the embraer both channel that people do not stop to greet him by the 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:03.619
 chat line 

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:06.749
 internal voices for good at this time but 

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:12.230
 that in regards to you this greetings and and admiration not from the people 

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:14.299
 already occurred after its simultaneous 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:16.919
 and I wanted to ask you one more question 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.799
 with respect to another great tourney tournament that is the linares tournament that you have 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.340
 won and that says c 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.430
 covered live this 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.430
 Yes, when do you consider that it was your 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.200
 his merit more gold to win so convincingly 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.200
 that tournament that is he the good chess ball 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:39.889
 for that 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.889
 yes before answering this from to 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.110
 I would take the opportunity to tell all the people who have been greeted the most by the state 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:54.770
 from the nenuco jack to answer everyone I thank you greetings 

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:56.830
 you can 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.930
 If I believe that this year I would have liked the most important 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.129
 age 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:07.129
 take advantage of every possibility that I had 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:10.629
 there were many sada games 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.770
 dangerous too but the truth is that do not waste in with almost no 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:16.849
 opportunity 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:18.650
 i 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.129
 it's about squeezing the most 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:24.129
 and I think that was a secret to winning such a difficult tournament 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:26.020
 of course, of course 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.220
