away<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.060> was<00:01:21.240> obviously<00:01:22.110> very

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
away and that was obviously very

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.929 
away and that was obviously very
frustrating<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.860> didn't<00:01:23.159> mind<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.549> when<00:01:23.880> he

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
frustrating I didn't mind it when he

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.550 
frustrating I didn't mind it when he
likes<00:01:24.150> like<00:01:24.540> handled<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.170> well<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.470> like

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
likes like handled it well and like

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.200 
likes like handled it well and like
cleared<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.009> ball<00:01:26.189> with<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.790> service

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
cleared the ball with the service

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.210 
cleared the ball with the service
sometimes<00:01:27.450> he'd<00:01:28.229> just<00:01:28.380> pound<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.710> into<00:01:28.829> danger

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
sometimes he'd just pound it into danger

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.859 
sometimes he'd just pound it into danger
and<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.490> obviously<00:01:29.700> was<00:01:30.360> very<00:01:30.630> very

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
and that obviously was very very

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:31.999 
and that obviously was very very
frustrating<00:01:31.380> but<00:01:31.470> what<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.710> did<00:01:31.829> like<00:01:31.950> about

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
frustrating but what it did like about

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.740 
frustrating but what it did like about
was<00:01:32.369> how<00:01:32.490> quick<00:01:32.700> he<00:01:32.790> was<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.030> react<00:01:33.180> how<00:01:33.390> good

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
was how quick he was to react how good

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.630 
was how quick he was to react how good
his<00:01:33.840> reflexes<00:01:34.170> where<00:01:34.590> some<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.280> blocks<00:01:35.460> in

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
his reflexes where some of the blocks in

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.730 
his reflexes where some of the blocks in
minutes<00:01:35.909> in<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.420> 1<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.720> wond<00:01:36.840> he's<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> very

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
minutes in the 1 and wond he's a very

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.410 
minutes in the 1 and wond he's a very
very<00:01:38.040> good<00:01:38.220> goalkeeper<00:01:38.579> but<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:39.030> just<00:01:39.180> say<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
very good goalkeeper but I just say the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.929 
very good goalkeeper but I just say the
handling<00:01:39.810> thing<00:01:40.020> can<00:01:40.590> become<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.189> bit<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.850> an

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
handling thing can become a bit of an

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.550 
handling thing can become a bit of an
issue<00:01:42.060> in<00:01:42.390> my<00:01:42.810> opinion<00:01:43.140> but<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.439> what<00:01:43.530> I

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
issue in my opinion but this is what I

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.469 
issue in my opinion but this is what I
liked<00:01:43.740> about<00:01:43.829> him<00:01:44.070> even<00:01:44.579> shots<00:01:44.790> like<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.090> he

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
liked about him even shots like this he

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.700 
liked about him even shots like this he
actually<00:01:45.570> did<00:01:45.869> well<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.259> deal<00:01:46.470> with<00:01:46.590> them

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
actually did well to deal with them

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.080 
actually did well to deal with them
because<00:01:46.860> then<00:01:47.159> instead<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.759> just<00:01:47.939> like

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
because then instead of just like

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.120 
because then instead of just like
rebounding<00:01:48.990> them<00:01:49.110> out<00:01:49.229> he<00:01:49.590> makes<00:01:49.799> sure<00:01:49.860> as<00:01:50.040> it

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
rebounding them out he makes sure as it

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.859 
rebounding them out he makes sure as it
goes<00:01:50.280> over<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.700> bar<00:01:50.850> or<00:01:51.060> out<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.479> play<00:01:51.659> which

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
goes over the bar or out of play which

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.480 
goes over the bar or out of play which
obviously<00:01:52.079> isn't<00:01:52.409> very<00:01:52.920> good<00:01:52.979> -<00:01:53.250> it's<00:01:53.369> not

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
obviously isn't very good - it's not

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.160 
obviously isn't very good - it's not
putting<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.790> ball<00:01:53.939> into<00:01:54.180> any<00:01:54.509> danger<00:01:54.930> but<00:01:54.990> the

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
putting the ball into any danger but the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.109 
putting the ball into any danger but the
way<00:01:55.290> instance<00:01:55.710> is<00:01:55.890> waitjust<00:01:56.460> pounds<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.000> ball

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
way instance is waitjust pounds the ball

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.609 
way instance is waitjust pounds the ball
straight<00:01:57.390> back<00:01:57.570> out<00:01:57.689> just<00:01:57.960> straight<00:01:58.259> out<00:01:58.290> and

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
straight back out just straight out and

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.649 
straight back out just straight out and
I'm<00:01:59.340> very<00:01:59.610> lucky<00:01:59.759> that<00:02:00.329> there<00:02:00.450> isn't<00:02:00.540> an

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
I'm very lucky that there isn't an

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:01.850 
I'm very lucky that there isn't an
attacker<00:02:00.899> there<00:02:01.140> for<00:02:01.290> instance<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:01.770> a

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
attacker there for instance this is a

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.440 
attacker there for instance this is a
occasion<00:02:02.369> luckily<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.000> attacker

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
occasion luckily the attacker

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.690 
occasion luckily the attacker
air<00:02:03.600> scoops<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.350> shot<00:02:04.380> but<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:05.219> know<00:02:05.340> the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
air scoops the shot but you know the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.160 
air scoops the shot but you know the
hair<00:02:05.850> got<00:02:06.030> very<00:02:06.210> lucky<00:02:06.299> in<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.509> distance<00:02:06.810> but

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
hair got very lucky in that distance but

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.080 
hair got very lucky in that distance but
this<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.439> what<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.590> can<00:02:07.829> do<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.700> wish<00:02:08.940> you'd

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
this is what I can do and I wish you'd

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.309 
this is what I can do and I wish you'd
do<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.300> more<00:02:09.450> often<00:02:09.569> when<00:02:09.869> he<00:02:09.899> does<00:02:10.140> make<00:02:10.259> the

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
do it more often when he does make the

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.470 
do it more often when he does make the
save<00:02:10.590> clear<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.310> ball<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:12.060> make<00:02:12.209> sure<00:02:12.330> they've

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
save clear the ball to make sure they've

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.790 
save clear the ball to make sure they've
got<00:02:12.569> no<00:02:12.840> chance<00:02:13.050> of<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.290> shot

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
got no chance of a shot

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.920 
got no chance of a shot
that<00:02:14.250> is<00:02:14.370> what<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.550> liked<00:02:14.790> about<00:02:15.000> what<00:02:15.450> he<00:02:15.690> could

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
that is what I liked about what he could

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.300 
that is what I liked about what he could
do<00:02:16.110> but<00:02:16.320> other<00:02:16.590> say<00:02:16.800> it<00:02:16.890> just<00:02:16.980> wasn't

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
do but other say it just wasn't

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.010 
do but other say it just wasn't
consistent<00:02:17.580> in<00:02:17.790> his<00:02:17.850> handling<00:02:18.210> as<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.720> whole

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
consistent in his handling as a whole

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.900 
consistent in his handling as a whole
was<00:02:19.560> just<00:02:19.770> inconsistent<00:02:20.430> that's<00:02:20.670> probably

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
was just inconsistent that's probably

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.430 
was just inconsistent that's probably
the<00:02:21.000> best<00:02:21.150> way<00:02:21.270> I<00:02:21.450> can<00:02:21.660> describe<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:22.020> but<00:02:22.230> other

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
the best way I can describe it but other

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.200 
the best way I can describe it but other
than<00:02:22.500> that<00:02:22.680> he's<00:02:23.100> a<00:02:23.130> very<00:02:23.430> salty<00:02:23.730> but<00:02:24.120> he's

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
than that he's a very salty but he's

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.270 
than that he's a very salty but he's
tall<00:02:24.540> he's<00:02:24.780> so<00:02:25.050> quick<00:02:25.200> off<00:02:25.350> his<00:02:25.470> line<00:02:25.650> great

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
tall he's so quick off his line great

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.980 
tall he's so quick off his line great
and<00:02:26.460> won't<00:02:26.580> be<00:02:26.700> worn<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:27.000> make<00:02:27.150> himself<00:02:27.330> big<00:02:27.690> he

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
and won't be worn to make himself big he

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.360 
and won't be worn to make himself big he
comes<00:02:28.260> out<00:02:28.380> from<00:02:28.500> corners<00:02:28.860> collects<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.220> ball

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
comes out from corners collects the ball

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.190 
comes out from corners collects the ball
well<00:02:29.610> in<00:02:29.940> that<00:02:30.180> instance<00:02:30.360> his<00:02:30.690> handle<00:02:30.960> is<00:02:30.990> good

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
well in that instance his handle is good

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.780 
well in that instance his handle is good
he<00:02:31.320> will<00:02:31.530> come<00:02:31.650> up<00:02:31.740> from<00:02:31.860> corners<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.310> they

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
he will come up from corners and they

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.280 
he will come up from corners and they
handled<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.210> ball<00:02:33.330> well<00:02:33.510> but<00:02:33.930> when<00:02:34.050> it<00:02:34.140> comes

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
handled the ball well but when it comes

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.170 
handled the ball well but when it comes
to<00:02:34.380> just<00:02:34.530> saving<00:02:34.770> shots<00:02:35.130> even<00:02:35.370> soft<00:02:35.820> shots

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
to just saving shots even soft shots

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.210
