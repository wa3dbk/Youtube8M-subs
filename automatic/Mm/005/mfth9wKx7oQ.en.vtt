will be flood maps but every once in a
while<00:00:16.049> I'll<00:00:16.230> throw<00:00:16.410> something<00:00:16.650> different<00:00:17.400> in

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
while I'll throw something different in

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.580 
while I'll throw something different in
to<00:00:17.609> try<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.820> keep<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.779> variety<00:00:19.230> at<00:00:19.350> least<00:00:19.500> a

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
to try to keep it the variety at least a

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.470 
to try to keep it the variety at least a
little<00:00:19.770> bit<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.850> kind<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.150> just<00:00:21.270> helps

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
little bit and it kind of just helps

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.599 
little bit and it kind of just helps
keep<00:00:21.660> my<00:00:21.779> sanity<00:00:22.020> because<00:00:22.650> every<00:00:23.369> once<00:00:23.430> a

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
keep my sanity because every once a

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:24.920 
keep my sanity because every once a
while<00:00:23.640> it's<00:00:23.939> fun<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.330> make<00:00:24.420> something<00:00:24.840> a

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
while it's fun to make something a

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.810 
while it's fun to make something a
little<00:00:25.050> goofy<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.189> what<00:00:26.460> this<00:00:26.609> is

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
little goofy and that is what this is

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.750 
little goofy and that is what this is
this<00:00:26.970> map<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.180> called<00:00:27.510> zero-g<00:00:28.170> jamboree

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
this map is called zero-g jamboree

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.389 
this map is called zero-g jamboree
nothing<00:00:29.760> serious<00:00:30.000> about<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.599> name<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.399> this

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
nothing serious about that name and this

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.250 
nothing serious about that name and this
is<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.579> kind<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.329> based<00:00:33.510> off<00:00:33.719> with<00:00:33.899> something<00:00:34.050> I

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
is a kind of based off with something I

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.350 
is a kind of based off with something I
played<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.680> reach<00:00:34.860> quite<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.190> bit<00:00:35.399> way<00:00:36.149> back<00:00:36.329> in

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
played and reach quite a bit way back in

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.030 
played and reach quite a bit way back in
reach<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.719> got<00:00:36.840> really<00:00:37.140> bored<00:00:37.500> one<00:00:37.680> afternoon

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
reach I got really bored one afternoon

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.069 
reach I got really bored one afternoon
and<00:00:38.370> made<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> map<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.300> was<00:00:39.510> essentially<00:00:39.809> one

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
and made a map that was essentially one

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.650 
and made a map that was essentially one
giant<00:00:40.530> perfect<00:00:40.950> circle<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:42.180> played<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> lot

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
giant perfect circle and I played a lot

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.030 
giant perfect circle and I played a lot
of<00:00:42.809> different<00:00:43.079> free<00:00:43.260> for<00:00:43.440> all<00:00:43.530> variants<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> lot

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
of different free for all variants a lot

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.250 
of different free for all variants a lot
of<00:00:44.160> fiesta<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.789> lot<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.570> modes<00:00:45.750> with<00:00:45.960> jetpacks

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
of fiesta a lot of modes with jetpacks

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.779 
of fiesta a lot of modes with jetpacks
and<00:00:46.770> stuff<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.250> was<00:00:47.340> always<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.550> favour

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
and stuff and that was always the favour

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.130 
and stuff and that was always the favour
was<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.000> play<00:00:48.210> with<00:00:48.360> jetpacks<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.899> think<00:00:49.079> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
was to play with jetpacks I think the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.630 
was to play with jetpacks I think the
map<00:00:49.289> was<00:00:49.440> called<00:00:49.590> shafted<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.340> played<00:00:50.550> it

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
map was called shafted and I played it

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.850 
map was called shafted and I played it
quite<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.820> bit<00:00:51.030> with<00:00:51.180> my<00:00:51.420> my<00:00:52.170> friends<00:00:52.590> people

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
quite a bit with my my friends people

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.040 
quite a bit with my my friends people
from<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.129> play<00:00:53.340> testing<00:00:53.730> lobbies<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
from the play testing lobbies and the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.110 
from the play testing lobbies and the
people<00:00:55.620> who<00:00:55.649> managed<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.579> get<00:00:56.699> into<00:00:56.820> my<00:00:56.940> few

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
people who managed to get into my few

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.459 
people who managed to get into my few
open<00:00:57.390> lobbies<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.840> did<00:00:57.989> back<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.350> reach

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
open lobbies that I did back and reach

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.979 
open lobbies that I did back and reach
and<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:59.399> thought<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.730> would<00:00:59.879> try<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.180> recreate<00:01:00.899> a

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
and I thought I would try to recreate a

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.689 
and I thought I would try to recreate a
similar<00:01:01.320> experience<00:01:01.620> but<00:01:01.859> with<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:01.980> twist<00:01:02.129> so

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
similar experience but with a twist so

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.549 
similar experience but with a twist so
essentially<00:01:03.359> we<00:01:03.420> have<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:03.629> giant<00:01:03.930> octagon

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
essentially we have this giant octagon

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.500 
essentially we have this giant octagon
here<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.070> like<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.030> said<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.299> being

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
here and like I said this is being

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.780 
here and like I said this is being
recorded<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:07.110> theater<00:01:07.500> mode<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.100> none<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.610> the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
recorded in theater mode so none of the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.340 
recorded in theater mode so none of the
actual<00:01:09.180> effects<00:01:09.420> here<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.780> map<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:09.960> actually

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
actual effects here this map is actually

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.740 
actual effects here this map is actually
kind<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.590> dark<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.159> there<00:01:11.700> are<00:01:11.909> bright<00:01:12.570> two

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
kind of dark and there are bright two

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.660 
kind of dark and there are bright two
red<00:01:12.960> green<00:01:13.320> yellow<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.770> blue<00:01:14.100> lights<00:01:14.340> around

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
red green yellow and blue lights around

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.370 
red green yellow and blue lights around
the<00:01:14.790> edges<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.600> actually<00:01:16.020> looks<00:01:16.320> really

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
the edges so it actually looks really

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.109 
the edges so it actually looks really
cool<00:01:16.799> it's<00:01:16.979> like<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.159> crazy<00:01:17.400> disco<00:01:17.880> in<00:01:17.970> here

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
cool it's like a crazy disco in here

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.960 
cool it's like a crazy disco in here
with<00:01:18.240> all<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.450> lasers<00:01:18.810> going<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.729> this<00:01:20.729> mode

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
with all the lasers going and this mode

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.420 
with all the lasers going and this mode
is<00:01:21.000> based<00:01:21.630> with<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.320> binary<00:01:22.740> rifles<00:01:23.159> and

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
is based with the the binary rifles and

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.499 
is based with the the binary rifles and
like<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.580> said<00:01:23.700> they're<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.909> biggest<00:01:24.210> twist

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
like I said they're the biggest twist

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.330 
like I said they're the biggest twist
about<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:24.900> map<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.710> zero<00:01:26.040> g

should<00:01:59.100> say<00:01:59.310> have<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.670> thruster<00:02:00.299> pack<00:02:00.420> as

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
should say have a thruster pack as

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.149 
should say have a thruster pack as
thruster<00:02:00.899> pack<00:02:01.049> works<00:02:01.290> really<00:02:01.530> well<00:02:01.649> for<00:02:01.799> this

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
thruster pack works really well for this

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.819

game<00:02:05.040> is<00:02:05.219> probably<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.610> most<00:02:05.640> fun<00:02:06.030> i<00:02:06.270> would

recommend this for about i'd say six to

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
guns hovering around the map so when you

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.220 
guns hovering around the map so when you
play<00:02:20.700> with<00:02:20.820> 16<00:02:21.240> people<00:02:21.570> you<00:02:21.690> end<00:02:21.840> up<00:02:21.990> with<00:02:22.080> this

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
play with 16 people you end up with this

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.370 
play with 16 people you end up with this
massive<00:02:22.680> pile<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.550> gear<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.180> bodies<00:02:24.660> just

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
massive pile of gear and bodies just

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.140 
massive pile of gear and bodies just
hovering<00:02:25.740> near<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.130> buoyancy<00:02:26.610> level<00:02:26.970> and

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
hovering near the buoyancy level and

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.240 
hovering near the buoyancy level and
that<00:02:27.960> really<00:02:28.350> kills<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.710> frame<00:02:28.890> rate<00:02:29.040> so

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
that really kills the frame rate so

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.980 
that really kills the frame rate so
Promethean<00:02:30.120> weapons<00:02:30.420> really<00:02:30.630> work<00:02:30.780> best

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
Promethean weapons really work best

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.260 
Promethean weapons really work best
that's<00:02:31.200> why<00:02:31.230> binaries<00:02:31.800> is<00:02:31.920> really<00:02:32.250> fun<00:02:32.460> with

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
that's why binaries is really fun with

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.610 
that's why binaries is really fun with
with<00:02:33.570> we<00:02:33.840> play<00:02:33.990> this<00:02:34.140> with<00:02:34.260> about<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.500> think

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
with we play this with about I think

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.440 
with we play this with about I think
eight<00:02:34.860> people<00:02:35.250> in<00:02:35.370> this<00:02:35.490> game<00:02:35.760> so<00:02:36.210> the<00:02:36.300> frame

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
eight people in this game so the frame

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.820 
eight people in this game so the frame
rate<00:02:36.600> stayed<00:02:36.780> pretty<00:02:36.960> smooth<00:02:37.320> and<00:02:37.680> the

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
rate stayed pretty smooth and the

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:38.900 
rate stayed pretty smooth and the
binaries<00:02:38.280> really<00:02:38.490> help<00:02:38.670> because<00:02:38.730> they

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
binaries really help because they

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.250 
binaries really help because they
disintegrate<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.480> body<00:02:39.660> so<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:39.960> really

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
disintegrate the body so I really

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.420 
disintegrate the body so I really
recommend<00:02:40.290> this<00:02:40.620> mode<00:02:40.860> though<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.040> will<00:02:41.160> be

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
recommend this mode though I will be

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.040 
recommend this mode though I will be
putting<00:02:41.640> up<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.940> sticky<00:02:42.240> detonator<00:02:42.630> one<00:02:42.840> and

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
putting up a sticky detonator one and

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.960 
putting up a sticky detonator one and
the<00:02:43.440> railgun<00:02:43.830> one<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.190> you<00:02:44.280> could<00:02:44.760> feel<00:02:44.790> free

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
the railgun one and you could feel free

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.000 
the railgun one and you could feel free
to<00:02:45.300> go<00:02:45.390> ahead<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.660> make<00:02:45.750> your<00:02:45.840> own<00:02:45.900> but<00:02:46.620> like<00:02:46.950> i

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
to go ahead and make your own but like i

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.170 
to go ahead and make your own but like i
said<00:02:47.040> this<00:02:47.220> map<00:02:47.370> is<00:02:47.400> available<00:02:47.580> now<00:02:47.940> so<00:02:47.970> you

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
said this map is available now so you

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.910 
said this map is available now so you
can<00:02:48.270> definitely<00:02:48.390> go<00:02:48.600> check<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.900> out<00:02:48.990> the

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
can definitely go check it out the

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.890 
can definitely go check it out the

dreamers folly flood map is pretty much

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.050 
dreamers folly flood map is pretty much
done<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.290> did<00:02:52.860> my<00:02:53.070> last<00:02:53.280> little<00:02:53.550> round<00:02:53.790> of<00:02:53.940> play
