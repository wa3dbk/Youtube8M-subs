because<00:00:06.509> it<00:00:06.660> was<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:06.810> first<00:00:07.049> lady<00:00:07.319> championship

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
because it was a first lady championship

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.999 
because it was a first lady championship
in<00:00:08.340> LA<00:00:08.760> so<00:00:09.630> I<00:00:09.679> think<00:00:10.679> about<00:00:10.860> that<00:00:13.009> my

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009

championship ring I still have it and

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.599 
championship ring I still have it and
every<00:00:17.789> time<00:00:18.000> somebody<00:00:18.420> wants<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.869> see<00:00:19.140> I

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:24.859 

always<00:00:23.609> put<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.119> away<00:00:24.210> somewhere<00:00:24.330> but<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.840> don't

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
always put it away somewhere but I don't

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.099 
always put it away somewhere but I don't
wear<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.189> don't<00:00:26.390> like<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.990> then

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
wear it so I don't like that and then

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.019 
wear it so I don't like that and then
they<00:00:28.199> take<00:00:28.410> me<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.619> while<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.830> find<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.820> then

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
they take me a while to find it and then

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.479 
they take me a while to find it and then
I'll<00:00:32.480> and<00:00:33.480> then<00:00:33.510> I'll<00:00:33.960> show<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.500> put<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.399> away

loved and it was broken but I think the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.389 
loved and it was broken but I think the
cheaper<00:01:00.449> ship<00:01:00.660> itself

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399
