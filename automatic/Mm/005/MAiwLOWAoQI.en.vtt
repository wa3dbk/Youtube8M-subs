 get excited about it 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.480
 what youtuber is doing nowadays 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.670
 still crooked around the hump, like a few 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.889

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:21.669
 whatever we speak for youtuber 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:24.940
 gage hot topic is still there today 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:27.160
 organizations or groups of friends and in 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.580
 unite that have a compact show 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.870
 would like 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.210
 even if youtube sometimes says it 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.130
 better than watching TV I say so 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.110
 Of course, the stars are youtube stars 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.360
 But tangible does not mean that 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.669
 content of the fair and the good 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.300
 Content is also available on the internet 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.460
 watch TV 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.370
 that does not mean it's platform 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.050
 agree I think that the typical 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.610
 family-watching 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.780

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.479

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.979

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.780
 Saturday night set by television as 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.849
 otherwise there is no family anymore because of it 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.919

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:02.830
