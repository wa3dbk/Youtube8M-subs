00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:11.389 
burnt out my stock speed control place I

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.500 
burnt out my stock speed control place I
didn't<00:00:12.170> have<00:00:12.289> that<00:00:12.500> happen<00:00:12.920> again<00:00:13.510> switched

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:14.510 
didn't have that happen again switched

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.550 
didn't have that happen again switched
it<00:00:14.690> all<00:00:14.840> up<00:00:15.049> with<00:00:15.080> the<00:00:15.550> traxxas<00:00:16.550> stock<00:00:16.940> system

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
it all up with the traxxas stock system

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.939 
it all up with the traxxas stock system
including<00:00:18.560> the<00:00:19.190> motor<00:00:19.460> I<00:00:20.240> did<00:00:20.929> this<00:00:21.140> because<00:00:21.439> i

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
including the motor I did this because i

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.390 
including the motor I did this because i
already<00:00:22.250> had<00:00:22.669> it<00:00:22.849> 12<00:00:23.779> I<00:00:24.140> didn't<00:00:24.619> want<00:00:24.830> to<00:00:24.949> spend

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
already had it 12 I didn't want to spend

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.099 
already had it 12 I didn't want to spend
a<00:00:25.550> bunch<00:00:25.699> of<00:00:25.820> money<00:00:25.910> on<00:00:26.089> a<00:00:26.179> system<00:00:26.509> that<00:00:26.779> wasn't

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
a bunch of money on a system that wasn't

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:28.870 
a bunch of money on a system that wasn't
wanted<00:00:27.380> proof<00:00:27.560> from<00:00:27.740> hat<00:00:27.949> to<00:00:28.130> waterproof<00:00:28.579> its

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
wanted proof from hat to waterproof its

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.230 
wanted proof from hat to waterproof its
is<00:00:29.150> already<00:00:29.749> waterproof<00:00:30.369> and<00:00:31.369> the<00:00:31.579> motor<00:00:31.849> too

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:32.240 
is already waterproof and the motor too

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.060 
is already waterproof and the motor too
i<00:00:32.270> switched<00:00:32.900> because<00:00:33.110> this<00:00:33.590> is<00:00:33.770> a<00:00:33.800> lot

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
i switched because this is a lot

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.370 
i switched because this is a lot
smoother<00:00:34.640> with<00:00:35.329> the<00:00:35.450> trenches<00:00:35.960> motor<00:00:36.200> as

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
smoother with the trenches motor as

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.690 
smoother with the trenches motor as
opposed<00:00:36.680> to<00:00:36.860> the<00:00:36.950> one<00:00:37.100> that<00:00:37.220> comes<00:00:37.400> with<00:00:37.580> this

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
opposed to the one that comes with this

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.660 
opposed to the one that comes with this
back<00:00:38.000> which<00:00:38.180> I<00:00:38.360> like<00:00:38.570> a<00:00:38.600> lot<00:00:38.690> better<00:00:38.990> and<00:00:39.670> the

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
back which I like a lot better and the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.490 
back which I like a lot better and the
system<00:00:41.120> has<00:00:41.300> also<00:00:41.510> been<00:00:41.870> through<00:00:42.080> a<00:00:42.110> lot<00:00:42.440> of

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
system has also been through a lot of

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.850 
system has also been through a lot of
abuse<00:00:42.920> already<00:00:43.790> and<00:00:44.410> hasn't<00:00:45.410> given<00:00:45.470> me<00:00:45.650> any

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
abuse already and hasn't given me any

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.740 
abuse already and hasn't given me any
problems<00:00:45.890> besides<00:00:46.430> me<00:00:46.790> having<00:00:47.060> to<00:00:47.090> reset<00:00:47.570> it<00:00:47.600> a

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
problems besides me having to reset it a

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.350 
problems besides me having to reset it a
couple<00:00:47.930> times<00:00:48.110> and<00:00:48.890> that's<00:00:49.160> it<00:00:49.460> so<00:00:50.180> I'm<00:00:50.300> going

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
couple times and that's it so I'm going

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.910

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
things you have to adjust start down

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.740 
things you have to adjust start down
here<00:00:55.100> with<00:00:55.430> the<00:00:55.550> motor<00:00:55.790> take<00:00:56.210> it<00:00:56.360> out<00:00:56.480> and<00:00:56.510> I'll

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
here with the motor take it out and I'll

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.270 
here with the motor take it out and I'll
show<00:00:56.960> you<00:00:57.020> what<00:00:57.170> I<00:00:57.260> did<00:00:59.650> ok<00:01:00.650> there<00:01:00.890> we<00:01:00.950> go<00:01:01.070> the

show you what I did ok there we go the

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.340 
show you what I did ok there we go the
motor<00:01:01.490> is<00:01:01.610> out<00:01:02.000> a<00:01:02.270> couple<00:01:02.660> things<00:01:02.810> you<00:01:03.140> got<00:01:03.320> to

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
motor is out a couple things you got to

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.700 
motor is out a couple things you got to
do<00:01:03.590> here<00:01:04.570> stop<00:01:05.570> check<00:01:05.869> this<00:01:06.049> motor<00:01:06.320> is<00:01:06.439> going

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
do here stop check this motor is going

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.130 
do here stop check this motor is going
to<00:01:06.770> have<00:01:06.920> a<00:01:06.950> plastic<00:01:07.280> cover<00:01:07.820> over<00:01:08.119> this<00:01:08.539> that

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
to have a plastic cover over this that

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.109 
to have a plastic cover over this that
just<00:01:09.469> pops<00:01:09.740> right<00:01:09.950> off<00:01:10.219> you<00:01:10.460> take<00:01:10.670> that<00:01:10.880> right

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
just pops right off you take that right

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.080 
just pops right off you take that right
off<00:01:11.149> because<00:01:11.689> it<00:01:11.719> won't<00:01:12.020> fit<00:01:12.320> in<00:01:12.859> here<00:01:13.189> so<00:01:14.030> you

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
off because it won't fit in here so you

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.819 
off because it won't fit in here so you
just<00:01:14.299> take<00:01:14.509> that<00:01:14.539> up<00:01:14.869> and<00:01:15.079> wrap<00:01:15.259> it<00:01:15.469> with<00:01:15.590> some

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:15.829 
just take that up and wrap it with some

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:18.700 
just take that up and wrap it with some
electrical<00:01:16.369> tape<00:01:16.509> and<00:01:17.509> the<00:01:18.170> other<00:01:18.320> thing<00:01:18.439> is

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
electrical tape and the other thing is

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.419 
electrical tape and the other thing is
right<00:01:19.100> here<00:01:19.659> you'll<00:01:20.659> notice<00:01:20.869> that<00:01:21.469> when<00:01:22.310> you

00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:22.429 
right here you'll notice that when you

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:26.169 
right here you'll notice that when you
put<00:01:22.729> yours<00:01:22.999> in<00:01:24.310> that's<00:01:25.310> going<00:01:25.549> to<00:01:25.609> be<00:01:25.700> sticking

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:26.179 
put yours in that's going to be sticking

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:28.149 
put yours in that's going to be sticking
up<00:01:26.299> a<00:01:26.390> little<00:01:26.659> bit<00:01:26.780> higher<00:01:27.020> so<00:01:27.439> you<00:01:27.829> won't<00:01:28.009> be

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
up a little bit higher so you won't be

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.109 
up a little bit higher so you won't be
able<00:01:28.219> to<00:01:28.429> get<00:01:28.609> this<00:01:28.939> to<00:01:29.299> go<00:01:29.479> back<00:01:29.749> on<00:01:30.020> right<00:01:31.119> so

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
able to get this to go back on right so

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.989 
able to get this to go back on right so
all<00:01:32.210> I<00:01:32.359> had<00:01:32.569> all<00:01:32.899> I<00:01:32.929> did<00:01:33.319> was<00:01:33.350> drill<00:01:33.829> hole<00:01:34.130> right

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:34.999 
all I had all I did was drill hole right

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:38.980 
all I had all I did was drill hole right
in<00:01:35.060> there<00:01:36.130> even<00:01:37.130> with<00:01:37.280> this<00:01:37.659> then<00:01:38.659> you<00:01:38.780> just

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
in there even with this then you just

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.309 
in there even with this then you just
take<00:01:39.200> a<00:01:39.229> piece<00:01:39.499> of<00:01:39.530> electrical<00:01:40.369> tape<00:01:40.579> and<00:01:41.319> you

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
take a piece of electrical tape and you

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:44.559 
take a piece of electrical tape and you
double<00:01:43.069> it<00:01:43.219> up<00:01:43.310> so<00:01:43.609> it's<00:01:43.789> not<00:01:43.969> sticking<00:01:44.329> on

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:44.569 
double it up so it's not sticking on

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:46.389 
double it up so it's not sticking on
both<00:01:44.749> sides<00:01:45.079> when<00:01:45.289> you<00:01:45.469> just<00:01:45.710> super<00:01:46.189> glue

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
both sides when you just super glue

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.629 
both sides when you just super glue
around<00:01:47.179> the<00:01:47.479> edges<00:01:47.889> getting<00:01:48.889> my<00:01:49.039> seal<00:01:49.399> on

00:01:49.629 --> 00:01:49.639 
around the edges getting my seal on

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:53.020 
around the edges getting my seal on
there<00:01:50.560> and<00:01:51.560> then<00:01:51.709> that<00:01:51.859> fits<00:01:52.130> on<00:01:52.340> there<00:01:52.579> really

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
there and then that fits on there really

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.109 
there and then that fits on there really
nice<00:01:53.270> no<00:01:53.780> problems<00:01:54.409> lot<00:01:55.310> smoother<00:01:55.700> than<00:01:55.939> the

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
nice no problems lot smoother than the

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.080 
nice no problems lot smoother than the
stock<00:01:56.420> one<00:01:56.689> and<00:01:57.649> that's<00:01:57.889> that's<00:01:58.549> it<00:01:58.819> with<00:01:58.969> the

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
stock one and that's that's it with the

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.550 
stock one and that's that's it with the
motor<00:02:00.189> next<00:02:01.509> speed<00:02:02.509> control

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
that right there and you could go either

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.020 
that right there and you could go either
way<00:02:49.330> with<00:02:49.480> this<00:02:49.720> would<00:02:50.050> I<00:02:50.140> go<00:02:50.290> this<00:02:50.440> way<00:02:51.030> slide

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
servo and the link just because it was

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.670 
servo and the link just because it was
with<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.340> whole<00:03:36.489> system<00:03:37.019> servo<00:03:38.019> is<00:03:38.170> very<00:03:38.440> easy

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
with the whole system servo is very easy

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.729 
with the whole system servo is very easy
