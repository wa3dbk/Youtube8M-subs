signature<00:00:31.430> guitar<00:00:31.789> which<00:00:32.510> I<00:00:32.599> think<00:00:32.840> we<00:00:32.989> the

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:33.379 
signature guitar which I think we the

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:36.130 
signature guitar which I think we the
first<00:00:33.590> prototype<00:00:34.010> was<00:00:34.040> made<00:00:34.160> 1994<00:00:35.059> and<00:00:36.050> then

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
first prototype was made 1994 and then

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.100 
first prototype was made 1994 and then
we<00:00:36.230> did<00:00:36.379> a<00:00:36.410> limited<00:00:36.590> run<00:00:36.860> in<00:00:37.010> 99<00:00:37.430> and<00:00:37.670> then

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
we did a limited run in 99 and then

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.450 
we did a limited run in 99 and then
there's<00:00:39.110> been<00:00:39.199> a<00:00:39.260> few<00:00:39.470> different<00:00:39.769> versions<00:00:40.220> it

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
there's been a few different versions it

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.399 
there's been a few different versions it
took<00:00:40.820> five<00:00:41.089> years<00:00:41.120> for<00:00:41.600> Ibanez<00:00:42.019> to<00:00:42.140> get<00:00:42.260> their

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:42.409 
took five years for Ibanez to get their

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:47.110 
took five years for Ibanez to get their
act<00:00:42.530> together<00:00:42.970> it<00:00:43.970> was<00:00:44.089> just<00:00:44.269> yeah<00:00:45.170> yes<00:00:46.120> yes

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
act together it was just yeah yes yes

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.719 
act together it was just yeah yes yes
all<00:00:47.659> along<00:00:47.960> the<00:00:48.140> way<00:00:48.229> the<00:00:48.530> idea<00:00:48.650> for<00:00:48.949> me<00:00:49.070> having

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:49.729 
all along the way the idea for me having

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:51.850 
all along the way the idea for me having
a<00:00:49.790> signature<00:00:50.120> model<00:00:50.570> is<00:00:50.720> it<00:00:51.409> has<00:00:51.589> to<00:00:51.739> be

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
a signature model is it has to be

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.410 
a signature model is it has to be
exactly<00:00:52.280> the<00:00:52.430> guitar<00:00:52.670> on<00:00:52.790> play<00:00:53.030> yeah

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
exactly the guitar on play yeah

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.930 
exactly the guitar on play yeah
otherwise<00:00:54.290> it<00:00:54.650> doesn't<00:00:54.830> feel<00:00:55.070> honest<00:00:55.729> to<00:00:55.820> me

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
otherwise it doesn't feel honest to me

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.609 
otherwise it doesn't feel honest to me
but<00:00:56.390> then<00:00:56.510> they<00:00:56.600> came<00:00:56.780> to<00:00:56.930> me<00:00:57.049> that<00:00:57.350> this<00:00:57.470> is

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:57.619 
but then they came to me that this is

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:59.890 
but then they came to me that this is
the<00:00:57.710> a<00:00:57.739> t10<00:00:58.280> yeah<00:00:58.820> it's<00:00:59.600> that<00:00:59.750> in<00:00:59.869> the

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
the a t10 yeah it's that in the

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.079 
the a t10 yeah it's that in the
Indonesian<00:01:00.350> made<00:01:00.799> version<00:01:01.519> of<00:01:01.610> my<00:01:01.729> guitar

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
Indonesian made version of my guitar

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:03.910

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
we can make a Virginia guitar and maybe

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.270 
we can make a Virginia guitar and maybe
that<00:01:05.600> would<00:01:05.720> be<00:01:05.750> more<00:01:06.439> affordable<00:01:06.710> for<00:01:07.130> some

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
that would be more affordable for some

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.000 
that would be more affordable for some
media<00:01:07.430> yeah<00:01:07.790> and<00:01:08.360> I<00:01:08.420> said<00:01:08.630> well<00:01:08.780> ok<00:01:09.560> I'm<00:01:09.830> not
