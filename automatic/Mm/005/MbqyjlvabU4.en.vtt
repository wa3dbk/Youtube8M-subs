00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.750
 Let's start our brew today. 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:13.860
 there is mail crime that is weighing the 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:29.340
 basic malt is an annoying bastard that's 1 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:33.590
 7 kilograms of ugly boring inside the field I 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.590
 Just complete our love, my love. 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.140
 now we're making our water 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.559
 our reverse filtered water to the modes 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.399
 plus a mixed resin filter that turns 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.930
 her site so she practically leaves 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:53.309
 water as if it were distilled water 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:56.610
 now that we are simulating the water 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.750
 that the people of the region that we are 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.940
 this type of 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.960
 complete with magnesium sulphate and 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.100
 calcium caco3 calcium carbonate 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:16.760
 baking soda that 70 from the city 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.760
 it's weighing here the site was 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.890
 now that I'm already bombed 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.530
 water circulating the water from here up 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:31.880
 the audience's armful of paper 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.880
 wash starts to mix the site 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.560
 here we are boiling boiling we 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:43.710
 then a water on the stove to 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:48.560
 put the ethical asteras and sites to 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:52.040
 bottle nishizaka gui everything else needs 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.040
 Night of chaos 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.830
 How many grams is everything a little bit in 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.060
 little bit we turn 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.180
 I know it will correct the 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.850
 characteristics of the water in the 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.640
 origin of beer style week 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.910
 last week brings madrid staut 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:17.470
 we made the water a lot 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:21.820
 calcium carbonate inside 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:27.310
 behold, now we have put all the 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:33.010
 sites on the recirculation zabumba 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:35.709
 commanding mixed with water gets very cloudy 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.790
 with a calcium carbonate but has no 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:42.100
 no problem 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:48.370
 here she is at the top and we 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:53.230
 Let's correct the pH with lactic acid at 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:58.630
 bring him to this pan who knows how to 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:06.280
 Leave 5.4 washing and Word 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:11.079
 low leaves more or less 5.186 and 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.670
 time that puts the bad o the maltes ph 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:16.329
 dropped a little 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.970
 I'll let you mix a little to make 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.350
 the measurement of ph 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:25.500
 while it prepares in passing water 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:30.400
 nights missing in 60 liters of water here 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:35.590
 put 3 tablespoons of 2,000 pak 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:39.070
 peracetic acid water is already morning 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:43.860
 ideal is to place the acid above 20 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.860
 degree I speak here on packaging 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:56.020
 know what's hot is how 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:59.050
 very flame control here so that 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.820
 they reach 60 degrees later but until the end 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:10.570
 of the day we will need it several 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:21.540
 times and now I am measuring pH after bh 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:31.060
 of the placed site is giving and 7.17 point 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:35.650
 17.2 shows in lactic acid can give 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:41.290
 more than one touch she will judge and 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:42.910
 accompanied will judge to accompany 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.330
 the experience of the people speaks here in the hour 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.450
 water is already close to the ph 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.450
 ideal
