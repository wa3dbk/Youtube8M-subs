00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
dead centered and you see how close the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.219 
dead centered and you see how close the
blade<00:01:10.860> comes<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.520> contact<00:01:11.760> with<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.720> liners

blade comes in contact with the liners

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.870 
blade comes in contact with the liners
but<00:01:13.380> actually<00:01:13.650> does<00:01:13.770> not<00:01:13.890> actually<00:01:14.220> touch<00:01:14.460> so

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
but actually does not actually touch so

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.630 
but actually does not actually touch so
very<00:01:15.479> good<00:01:15.810> high<00:01:16.650> tolerances<00:01:17.159> on<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.460> knife

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
very good high tolerances on this knife

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.240 
very good high tolerances on this knife
is<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.540> very<00:01:18.659> beautiful<00:01:19.020> spear<00:01:19.680> point<00:01:19.950> style

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250

locking bar here you can tell us nicely
jumped<00:02:05.430> here<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:05.640> mean<00:02:05.880> look<00:02:06.000> how<00:02:06.030> hard<00:02:06.270> cut

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
jumped here I mean look how hard cut

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.150 
jumped here I mean look how hard cut
that<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.259> does<00:02:07.469> protrude<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.920> little

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.089 
that is and it does protrude a little
bit<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.550> accessing<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.410> lock<00:02:10.410> bar<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.739> very

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
bit so accessing the lock bar is very

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.350 
bit so accessing the lock bar is very
very<00:02:11.370> easy
