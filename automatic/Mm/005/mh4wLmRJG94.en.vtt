00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
unless you can make that out there's a

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.649 
unless you can make that out there's a
lot<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.180> people<00:01:15.420> complaining<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:17.420> you<00:01:18.420> see

the rainbow so to speak or the color

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.710 
the rainbow so to speak or the color
spectrum<00:01:41.729> if<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.540> makes<00:01:42.720> more<00:01:42.899> sense<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.549> so

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
spectrum if that makes more sense and so

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.030 
spectrum if that makes more sense and so
me<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.750> know<00:01:46.020> i'm<00:01:46.110> not<00:01:46.259> too<00:01:46.409> flashy<00:01:46.649> with<00:01:46.950> it
