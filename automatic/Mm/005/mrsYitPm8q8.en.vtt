going<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.619> make<00:01:19.770> these<00:01:19.920> two<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.340> then<00:01:20.430> put<00:01:20.580> a

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
going to make these two and then put a

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.550 
going to make these two and then put a
scarf<00:01:20.909> on<00:01:21.060> them<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.750> what<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.080> usually<00:01:22.259> do<00:01:22.530> for

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
scarf on them and what I usually do for

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.380 
scarf on them and what I usually do for
the<00:01:22.799> scarf<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.310> usually<00:01:23.640> try<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.880> measure<00:01:24.150> it

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
the scarf is I usually try to measure it

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.020 
the scarf is I usually try to measure it
down<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:25.049> like<00:01:25.710> about<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.000> little

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
down I like about that so it's a little

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.630 
down I like about that so it's a little
bit<00:01:27.390> longer<00:01:27.750> than<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.170> actual<00:01:28.470> body<00:01:28.710> for<00:01:29.549> my

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
bit longer than the actual body for my

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.109 
bit longer than the actual body for my
first<00:01:29.909> list<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.930> then<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.140> make<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.650> bubble<00:01:32.250> in

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
first list and then I make a bubble in

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.499 
first list and then I make a bubble in

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.929 
in a minute and then breaking this one
off<00:01:45.179> the<00:01:46.179> same<00:01:46.450> time<00:01:47.249> and<00:01:48.249> what<00:01:48.490> that's<00:01:48.759> gonna

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
off the same time and what that's gonna

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.090 
off the same time and what that's gonna
allow<00:01:49.090> me<00:01:49.359> to<00:01:49.390> do<00:01:49.600> is<00:01:50.109> give<00:01:50.649> these<00:01:50.770> a<00:01:50.799> little

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
allow me to do is give these a little

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.700 
allow me to do is give these a little
bit<00:01:51.159> of<00:01:51.310> a<00:01:51.369> flex<00:01:52.020> what<00:01:53.020> that<00:01:53.170> allows<00:01:53.380> me<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.619> do

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
bit of a flex what that allows me to do

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.039 
bit of a flex what that allows me to do
is<00:01:53.829> when<00:01:53.979> I<00:01:54.039> set<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.429> Snowman<00:01:54.789> down<00:01:55.060> it'll

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
is when I set the Snowman down it'll

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.899 
is when I set the Snowman down it'll
actually<00:01:56.229> make<00:01:56.439> a<00:01:56.709> tripod<00:01:57.310> and<00:01:57.609> it<00:01:57.819> will

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
actually make a tripod and it will

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.550 
actually make a tripod and it will
actually<00:01:58.060> stay<00:01:58.450> up<00:01:58.479> all<00:01:58.750> by<00:01:58.899> itself

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
actually stay up all by itself

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.949 
actually stay up all by itself
so<00:01:59.890> that<00:02:00.039> way<00:02:00.159> it<00:02:00.490> stays<00:02:00.670> vertical<00:02:00.909> and<00:02:01.329> then

00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:01.959 
so that way it stays vertical and then

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:03.179 
so that way it stays vertical and then
this<00:02:02.079> one<00:02:02.259> what<00:02:02.380> I'm<00:02:02.469> gonna<00:02:02.560> do<00:02:02.649> is<00:02:02.770> just<00:02:02.799> draw

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
this one what I'm gonna do is just draw

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:08.180 
this one what I'm gonna do is just draw
a<00:02:03.459> very<00:02:03.729> very<00:02:03.969> simple<00:02:04.590> eyes<00:02:05.590> on<00:02:06.840> some<00:02:07.840> little

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190

charcoal or something for the smile and

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.220 
charcoal or something for the smile and
then<00:02:12.250> maybe<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.580> little<00:02:13.269> charcoal<00:02:13.629> nose<00:02:13.840> but

on<00:02:16.900> one<00:02:17.530> of<00:02:17.620> my<00:02:17.680> other<00:02:17.799> videos<00:02:18.160> I<00:02:18.280> had<00:02:18.489> I

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
on one of my other videos I had I

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:19.920 
on one of my other videos I had I
actually<00:02:18.760> made<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.180> carrot<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:19.629> glue<00:02:19.810> the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
actually made the carrot and glue the

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.080 
actually made the carrot and glue the
carrot<00:02:20.260> for<00:02:20.769> the<00:02:20.860> younger<00:02:21.220> kids<00:02:21.400> I<00:02:21.670> don't<00:02:21.879> like

carrot for the younger kids I don't like

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.270 
carrot for the younger kids I don't like
to<00:02:22.329> UM<00:02:22.540> glue<00:02:22.989> that<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.440> Hat<00:02:23.650> on<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.890> nose<00:02:24.069> on

to UM glue that the Hat on the nose on

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.520 
to UM glue that the Hat on the nose on
because<00:02:24.760> I<00:02:25.090> use<00:02:25.299> I<00:02:25.569> use<00:02:25.599> rubber<00:02:25.930> cement<00:02:26.140> and

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
because I use I use rubber cement and

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.530 
because I use I use rubber cement and
that<00:02:26.620> will<00:02:27.310> actually<00:02:27.610> pop<00:02:27.819> the<00:02:27.879> head<00:02:28.209> balloon

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540
