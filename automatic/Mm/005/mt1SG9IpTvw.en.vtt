00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 A) Yes 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.840
 if a few days ago we brought you 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.299
 some of the ms models and for the 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.400
 new socket 2011 3 the turn has arrived 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.410
 of gb and is that thanks to the brand 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.710
 we can have in our hands one of 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.339
 his last plates 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.109
 it's about the x 99 gaming 5 a series 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:30.720
 that comes directly from soccer 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.650
 1150 thus carrying characteristics 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.810
 aimed at the most gamers 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.550
 already from the first glance we appreciate in 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.650
 its manufacture the use of 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.880
 high quality materials in addition to the 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.060
 implementation of the fourth generation 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.910
 of the digital controller for p wm lo 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.590
 which offers outstanding precision to 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.040
 this must be added that incorporates and 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.660
 it was digital and pau and rs stage and cs that 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.010
 will provide greater precision to 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.079
 different sensors 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.760
 as we have commented the most gamers 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.109
 will have in the gaming 5 multiple 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.359
 options to get the most 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.850
 performance in games and is that in addition to 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.770
 to be able to use a single gpu we will have the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.290
 option to assemble configurations both 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.840
 crossfire as sly with four graphics 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.350
 thus obtaining a bandwidth of 320 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.330
 gb per second 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.119
 in addition to this and like what happens with 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.520
 other brands like ms or as rock gb e 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.080
 implemented an improved audio 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.180
 using for it 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.070
 audio technology that promises a 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.170
 really attractive audio experience 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.540
 if we take into account that it is about 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.220
 a chip built into the board is more the 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.560
 own brand boasts that this 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.659
 technology offers the highest level of 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.810
 audio and industry characteristics 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.700
 quad-core audio processor 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.289
 polarized beat trainers 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.509
 amplifier upgradeable amplifier 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.630
 microphone connectors gold plated 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.369
 or the software sound blaster sbx pro 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.020
 study are among their 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.670
 characteristics 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.500
 and of course and how it has been 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.390
 usual could not miss the inclusion 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.119
 Manufacturer killer for your card 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.100
 network and that is with the 2200 traffic 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.690
 generated by games will have priority 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.700
 About the rest of applications 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.520
 but we can not stop talking about the 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.230
 novelties of x 99 and is that between these 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.020
 is the inclusion of support 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.110
 for ddr3 memories and sata ports 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.780
 express and m2 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.850
 we find support for up to 64 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.010
 gb of ram at a maximum frequency of 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.810
 3000 megahertz and with a rate of 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.690
 transfer of up to 10 gigs per 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.450
 second if we consider gaming 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.550
 7 of ms and recently analyzed we see 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.950
 to this plate at a certain disadvantage since 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.900
 supports a smaller amount of memory and 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.300
 in addition the transfer rates of your 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.400
 port m2 reached up to 36 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.870
 gigabytes per second 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.560
 in the connectivity section 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:54.189
 we will find 6 usb ports 3.0 4 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.409
 2.0 usb ports and ps2 connectors for 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:58.069
 keyboard and mouse all of them in their part 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:02.120
 rear 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:04.609
 four ports pci express 2 x 16 and 2 x 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.850
 8 and 3 ports pci express x 1 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:10.070
 will complete the gaming 5 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.780
 a very complete plate that will not take long 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.790
 much to appear available in our 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.830
 web no doubt it's about a whole 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.020
 alternative to current models 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.130
 betting clearly on the growing 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.130
 interest in gaming
