 I've been fighting this two days ago and some lawyers have that 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.660
 already long ago in the pits 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.140
 However, the last few days have not been too much time because of that I have 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.290

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.220
 stays that way 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.890
 In the event that it gets bit worse then two years will always be like this 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.410
 or Salzburg what to send when Mans ordered 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.540

 this image fits against the impending takeover normal and 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.630
 I find him at the airport 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.430
 That's why I have a chair back ordered the blu-ray disc 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.500
 It has been noticed that the passage was forbidden by the century 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.500
 a normal action called by relatives 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.520

 Clearly that is the talk of Avatar 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:16.529
 but it looks quite like that 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.579
 this would only be nine percent the flyer 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.610
 the batteries and farmer was another topic you would like to avoid 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.559

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.940
 I hope that Arjen I would like to do that for the first time 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.170
 Maximilian what I have seen here on the tube was mainly of one

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.059

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:10.589
 just super cool then I would like to stop then and yes already 

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:14.359
 which they say under the slogan that you have everything content differently percent 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:17.069

 I've just tried the next video in English or 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.259
 especially the morning their majority decide what you want from it 

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.959
 think 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.639
 As I said, I have often made a video in English and listen 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.839
 yes I think in the people understand what I want to say or 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:46.619
 or what synonymous in the video mean 

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:50.279
