00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
we're looking at here is a reference cat

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.410 
we're looking at here is a reference cat
scan<00:01:17.380> this<00:01:18.250> is<00:01:18.520> the<00:01:18.729> patients<00:01:19.150> with<00:01:19.240> pelvic

scan this is the patients with pelvic

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.719 
scan this is the patients with pelvic
area<00:01:19.810> and<00:01:20.200> this<00:01:20.620> is<00:01:20.800> the<00:01:20.920> cat<00:01:21.100> scan<00:01:21.430> that<00:01:21.460> was

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
area and this is the cat scan that was

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.700 
area and this is the cat scan that was
used<00:01:22.030> to<00:01:22.210> define<00:01:22.750> all<00:01:23.050> of<00:01:23.080> our<00:01:23.320> treatment

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
used to define all of our treatment

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.719 
used to define all of our treatment
themes<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:25.000> you<00:01:25.060> can<00:01:25.360> see<00:01:25.600> that<00:01:25.840> today<00:01:26.729> we've

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
themes so you can see that today we've

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.420 
themes so you can see that today we've
got<00:01:27.970> these<00:01:28.600> two<00:01:28.900> calcifications<00:01:29.830> here<00:01:30.250> in

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
got these two calcifications here in

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.960 
got these two calcifications here in
here<00:01:30.820> and<00:01:31.410> when<00:01:32.410> we<00:01:32.590> go<00:01:32.890> and<00:01:33.250> match<00:01:33.520> this<00:01:33.790> up

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
here and when we go and match this up

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.930 
here and when we go and match this up
with<00:01:34.210> our<00:01:34.330> reference<00:01:34.900> cat<00:01:35.380> scan<00:01:35.770> we<00:01:36.550> can<00:01:36.580> say

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
with our reference cat scan we can say

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.840 
with our reference cat scan we can say
that<00:01:37.150> they're<00:01:37.330> literally<00:01:38.400> perfectly<00:01:39.400> aligned

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
that they're literally perfectly aligned

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.060 
that they're literally perfectly aligned
and<00:01:40.210> then<00:01:40.930> when<00:01:41.110> you<00:01:41.200> start<00:01:41.440> looking<00:01:41.560> beyond

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
and then when you start looking beyond

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.760 
and then when you start looking beyond
those<00:01:42.310> you<00:01:42.490> can<00:01:42.670> also<00:01:42.820> see<00:01:43.300> that<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:44.350> rectum

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
those you can also see that the rectum

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.620 
those you can also see that the rectum
lines<00:01:45.040> up<00:01:45.280> perfectly<00:01:45.670> in<00:01:45.790> the<00:01:45.970> prostate<00:01:46.420> as

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
lines up perfectly in the prostate as

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.310 
lines up perfectly in the prostate as
well<00:01:46.869> so<00:01:47.800> this<00:01:47.920> patient<00:01:48.220> is<00:01:48.610> now<00:01:49.320> his
