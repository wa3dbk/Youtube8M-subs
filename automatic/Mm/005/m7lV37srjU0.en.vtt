pointers<00:01:15.540> got<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.259> 90s<00:01:17.070> we<00:01:17.640> don't<00:01:17.820> want<00:01:17.970> to

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
pointers got in 90s we don't want to

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.820 
pointers got in 90s we don't want to
take<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.330> risks<00:01:18.600> from<00:01:18.720> 90s<00:01:19.259> that's<00:01:19.500> why<00:01:19.650> we

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
take the risks from 90s that's why we

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.920 
take the risks from 90s that's why we
wait<00:01:20.580> for<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.850> Pulsar<00:01:21.299> angles<00:01:21.600> get<00:01:21.780> after

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
wait for the Pulsar angles get after

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.630 
wait for the Pulsar angles get after
photons<00:01:22.439> we<00:01:22.530> get<00:01:22.650> 100<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.280> take<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
photons we get 100 that so I take the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.880 
photons we get 100 that so I take the
power<00:01:23.970> play<00:01:24.150> after<00:01:24.330> they<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:24.960> start<00:01:25.619> really

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
power play after they have start really

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.289 
power play after they have start really

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
well but we are not worried we know is

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.010 
well but we are not worried we know is
after<00:01:27.950> 15<00:01:28.950> overs<00:01:29.520> ball<00:01:29.759> little<00:01:30.360> bit<00:01:30.479> after

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
after 15 overs ball little bit after

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.350

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
and spinners come to the attack it's

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.210 
and spinners come to the attack it's
very<00:01:36.810> difficult<00:01:37.170> that's<00:01:37.680> why<00:01:37.829> we<00:01:37.979> are<00:01:38.009> not

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
very difficult that's why we are not

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.080 
very difficult that's why we are not
worried<00:01:38.579> whenever<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.659> start<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.950> think<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.939> at
