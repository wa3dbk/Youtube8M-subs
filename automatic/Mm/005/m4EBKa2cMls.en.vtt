00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.750
 it's a way of telling you that you're going to 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.080
 eat something that may appear with this 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.420
 case 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.830
 multi soto so you understand that later 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.990
 at lunchtime there is something that is not 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.880
 the reality we in this risotto do not 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.130
 we have rice there is no rice no 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.340
 what there are are grains made with the 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.340
 squid 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.110
 if not 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.500
 it will bring us freshness and acidity 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.860
 some fresh cilantro and sprouts skin 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.860
 Lebanon 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.320
 the 25 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.600
 and why not make a paella 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.040
 traditional but where there were no grains 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.390
 of rice and where the rice was in 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.850
 olive oil methylcellulose 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.840
 basically it's a gelling agent but the 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.550
 characteristic that it has is that 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.830
 means the inverse that all is to say 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.240
 rate with heat and now let's go 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.300
 doing with a syringe grain 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.300
 to grain 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.100
 level and taste if you close your eyes you 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.900
 you are eating a paella 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.670
 the only thing is undoubtedly the 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.020
 texture is not exactly the same is 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.140
 say he spends a little rice 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.390
 paco today but you eat it and really 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.710
 I recommend a vaccine no fails and 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.420
 we finished it instead of the cock 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.870
 of the lemon of all the life then with a 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.870
 lemon air 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.659
 good the good bulls rice is the most 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.340
 important in cooking here the 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.130
 equation is a bit different but it's 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.570
 clear that the active matter us and 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.729
 raw material are going to give us so 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.360
 raw material and good technique and is capable 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.360
 to do anything 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.380
 ah 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.420
 Y
