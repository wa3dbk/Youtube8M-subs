00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.420
 hello how about friends and are welcome 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.490
 in today's video because I come to 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.859
 share a small gameplay of the game 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.779
 of the strict fifa for our 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.580
 Android devices and as you see then what 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.460
 let's emulate with an application 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.960
 called apps pp and I remind you that there 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.599
 a totally free version in the 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.460
 Or place thor or also as 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.070
 you can download the goal version from 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.250
 my blog spot and then I'll leave you right there 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.920
 the point cc.oo of the game that only has 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.680
 a size of 220 megabytes and that is because 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.690
 very good because it will not occupy us 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.149
 too much space in our terminals 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.100
 so then I'm going to 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:52.570
 show recommended settings 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.720
 for this game as you see here I am 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.160
 and going a little fast let's say but 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.800
 well in any case you can 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.780
 pause the video or if not then 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.790
 You can also download it from the 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.400
 spot block as screenshots 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.680
 to be able to have a backup either in 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.420
 your computer or on your terminal and how 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.759
 come once 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.890
 we already have the point of desire of the game 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.990
 We will pick it up as you see here 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.600
 we see all the folders that I have in 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.790
 my case I saved it in this call 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.369
 rose speed stick so below 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.229
 so let's go see the game as we see 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.270
 he has already loaded the game we give him 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.659
 be I am playing with a 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.020
 control 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.990
 usb so we go here or we go 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.240
 as 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.579
 local and we will choose for example to 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.770
 mexico against 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.420
 let's see against Spain if you did not have here 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.990
 and I saw it 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.610
 here we have it so let's start 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.270
 and he's already loading the game as well 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.299
 It has very very detailed graphics 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.630
 here we are playing a little the memory 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.369
 friends that can go through the page 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.380
 of facebook I leave it in the description 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.479
 as always equally my account 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.090
 twitter as the facebook group 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.360
 also so that it is coming together so 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.360
 we go 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.540
 As you can see, it has a good performance in 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.640
 top part we are looking at the frames 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.769
 per second and the speed at which 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.410
 post runs I'm running it a 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.930
 Annex 7 of 2013 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.970
 in case anyone has doubt and good as 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.760
 I recommend a gigabyte of 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.190
 minimum RAM 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.230
 and a processor 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.670
 July and a dual core processor 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.230
 also at least to be 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.770
 run 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.890
 very good this game 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.130
 so let's go let's go because we 're going 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.130
 where are they 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.530
 you have to be a little quick to avoid 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.760
 let's do some magic I could not go 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.280

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.260
