00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
world dot yml we see here that we have

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.819 
world dot yml we see here that we have
just<00:01:53.430> two<00:01:53.810> brackets<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.380> nothing

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
just two brackets that is it nothing

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.310 
just two brackets that is it nothing
else<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:57.000> makes<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.270> little<00:01:57.390> little

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
else and this makes a little little

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.139 
else and this makes a little little
tough<00:01:58.590> run<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:59.250> get<00:01:59.340> started<00:01:59.759> but<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.000> should

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
tough run to get started but it should

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.630 
tough run to get started but it should
be<00:02:00.270> pretty<00:02:00.479> simple

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
be pretty simple

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.310 
be pretty simple
I<00:02:02.670> found<00:02:03.210> B<00:02:03.329> permissions<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.840> be<00:02:03.930> simple<00:02:04.229> to

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
I found B permissions to be simple to

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.109 
I found B permissions to be simple to
understand<00:02:04.740> compared<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.399> most<00:02:05.610> permissions

so<00:04:21.750> to<00:04:21.810> do<00:04:21.930> that<00:04:21.959> we<00:04:22.230> do<00:04:22.380> -<00:04:22.740> space<00:04:23.340> and<00:04:23.760> then<00:04:23.970> the

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
so to do that we do - space and then the

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.450 
so to do that we do - space and then the
star<00:04:24.480> just<00:04:24.780> like<00:04:25.380> that<00:04:25.650> and<00:04:25.920> the<00:04:26.010> start<00:04:26.310> of

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
star just like that and the start of

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.160 
star just like that and the start of
makes<00:04:26.820> it<00:04:26.970> so<00:04:27.500> that<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:30.090> permissions<00:04:30.480> plugin

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
makes it so that the permissions plugin

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.750 
makes it so that the permissions plugin
takes<00:04:31.440> all<00:04:31.650> of<00:04:31.890> the<00:04:31.980> commands<00:04:32.280> and<00:04:32.460> gives<00:04:32.610> them

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
takes all of the commands and gives them

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.550 
takes all of the commands and gives them
all<00:04:32.940> to<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.240> admins<00:04:33.510> they<00:04:33.780> have<00:04:33.960> every<00:04:34.380> single

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
all to the admins they have every single

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.520 
all to the admins they have every single
permission<00:04:35.400> that<00:04:35.640> would<00:04:36.030> ever<00:04:36.210> come<00:04:36.300> through

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
permission that would ever come through

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.900 
permission that would ever come through
through<00:04:37.530> the<00:04:37.680> permissions<00:04:38.100> plug-in<00:04:38.550> so<00:04:38.760> when

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
through the permissions plug-in so when

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.310 
through the permissions plug-in so when
you<00:04:38.970> add<00:04:39.090> a<00:04:39.120> new<00:04:39.300> plugin<00:04:39.510> it'll<00:04:39.870> automatically

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
you add a new plugin it'll automatically

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.050 
you add a new plugin it'll automatically
get<00:04:40.530> those<00:04:40.680> permissions<00:04:41.160> and<00:04:41.640> we're<00:04:41.790> gonna<00:04:41.880> do

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
get those permissions and we're gonna do

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.600 
get those permissions and we're gonna do
that<00:04:42.180> because<00:04:42.360> most<00:04:42.660> admins<00:04:43.080> are<00:04:43.260> trusted<00:04:43.710> and

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
that because most admins are trusted and

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.880 
that because most admins are trusted and
they<00:04:44.700> probably<00:04:45.300> deserve<00:04:45.710> most<00:04:46.710> of<00:04:46.830> the

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
they probably deserve most of the

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.140 
they probably deserve most of the
commands<00:04:47.190> if<00:04:47.460> you'd<00:04:47.580> like<00:04:47.760> you<00:04:47.910> can<00:04:48.000> add

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
commands if you'd like you can add

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.420 
commands if you'd like you can add
another<00:04:48.480> group<00:04:48.600> and<00:04:49.560> call<00:04:49.770> them<00:04:49.920> admins<00:04:50.250> and

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
another group and call them admins and

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.070 
another group and call them admins and
then<00:04:50.550> have<00:04:50.730> owners<00:04:51.180> or<00:04:51.450> you<00:04:51.630> know<00:04:51.750> do<00:04:51.900> whatever

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
then have owners or you know do whatever

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.600 
then have owners or you know do whatever
you<00:04:52.320> want<00:04:52.530> rename<00:04:52.890> them<00:04:53.100> to<00:04:53.220> whatever<00:04:53.400> you

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
you want rename them to whatever you

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.430 
you want rename them to whatever you
