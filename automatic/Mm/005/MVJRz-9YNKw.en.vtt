00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
chunks anything that they could just

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.420 
chunks anything that they could just
grab<00:02:58.329> and<00:02:58.720> not<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.380> idea<00:02:59.709> is<00:02:59.829> just<00:02:59.920> that<00:03:00.220> they

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
it is still like pretty firm so they can

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.089 
it is still like pretty firm so they can
like<00:05:21.000> really<00:05:21.240> grab<00:05:21.630> it<00:05:21.870> but<00:05:22.080> the<00:05:22.229> top<00:05:22.470> is<00:05:22.530> soft
