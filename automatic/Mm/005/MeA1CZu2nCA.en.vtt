00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.899
 hello and welcome to this tutorial 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.410
 about logic pro 10 then 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.929
 today it's a pretty fast video 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:16.850
 and quite specialized since it concerns 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.859
 the multi-screen display of logic pro 10 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:23.430
 so to do that you have to you 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.880
 provide a bolt tender adapter towards 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.740
 vga or thunder bolt to hdmi or else 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.660
 still thunder bold to thunder bolt 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.730
 depending on which screen you want to connect 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.860
 to your mac 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:39.690
 here I have a 2009 imac connect to a 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.420
 acer screen that I put vertical everything 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.670
 simply because the mixer 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.649
 is higher than it is wide and that's 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.100
 the one know that I 'm going active and the 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.480
 less displayed on this screen so for 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.670
 do this we'll go to the tab 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:59.640
 window in the bar up there is here 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.649
 we can offer all parts 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.170
 of logic that we opened with 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.180
 the toolbar buttons 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.250
 except that here open up in 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.880
 windows apart so for example here I 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.080
 will open my mixer 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.450
 here it appears in a new 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.909
 window so you're not going to see it 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.070
 in the video but for example here I 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.509
 will slide my window into my other 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.759
 screen simply by doing it 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.490
 slide on the edge of which I'm already going 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.829
 their size because my screen is 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.189
 in a vertical position and there I go all 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.110
 just drag it into my second 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.170
 screen that we can see that it is not 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.049
 this hop it goes into the other 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.630
 so be careful to manage the 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.680
 layout of your screens so we will 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.840
 go for a walk in the 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.909
 settings to see a little bit how it gets 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.799
 then go on to access the 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.600
 screen layout was going all 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.310
 simply layout and monitors 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.299
 there you will have to go see your 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.950
 monitor so here we can see that my 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.810
 second monitor is in position 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.360
 vertical 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:10.289
 I set the vertical position all 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.720
 simply by opening this panel which 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.170
 also opens on the second 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.220
 monitor and we can configure 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.959
 individually the parameters 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.600
 display 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.819
 here you can reverse the position of 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.980
 your screens for example here he is at my 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.450
 right on my desk but I could 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.280
 very well put it on the left so for 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.390
 that I saw the window on the left of 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.920
 the screen a little setting has done and that's it 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.980
 however, to access it you will have to 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.290
 go to the left and only after 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.790
 your fate and will appear on the other side 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.769
 if I continue to go to the left 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.230
 I am a goal and I can not believe it 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.010
 on the right of my screen there I come back 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.190
 to the right 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.480
 I will put back my screen you see 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.450
 also that you can adjust the 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.030
 height with the main window by 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.470
 example here the top of my screen 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.900
 fits in water here from my screen there 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.760
 understood the toolbar so if I 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.420
 want them to reach just below 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.459
 the toolbar 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.709
 I shifted me here is what is still a 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.709
 little here is so when I'm here 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.530
 there I touch the top of my screen at 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.900
 right 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.549
 so here if I wanted I could 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.410
 also change the inclination for example 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:29.069
 I'm going to put my mouse on my 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.079
 second screen to adjust its position 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.880
 if ever my monitor was not 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.410
 vertical game can put it in 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.989
 horizontal position what am I going 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:41.130
 do it right now by disabling the 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:43.830
 rotation at 90 Â° and that's my screen is at 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.780
 present in a good way 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.300
 however, compared to my 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.800
 configuration is not at all in the 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.050
 common sense because here I have a landscape mode 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:57.180
 on a vertical screen in other words I 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:59.520
 do not see anything so for you 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.450
 show a little how it's going on 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.880
 the second monitor 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.180
 we will immediately put the 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.010
 video on this second monitor 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.700
 so here we are on my second screen 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:15.420
 which is upright 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:18.120
 so you see that it has nothing to do 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:21.750
 with the window that I have on my on my 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:26.400
 screen of an imac I can here adjust the 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:28.520
 resolution the rotation as we can 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.080
 see here the refresh rate 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.970
 possibly good here it's really 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.420
 not a screen mode it does not really serve me 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:39.600
 not often it's just for the demo 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:43.440
 here are two women back in logic 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:45.740
 and I'm going to show you a little trick 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.450
 nice called the screens is 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.460
 so the screen 7 actually is a 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.970
 way to memorize the layout of your 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.600
 Windows 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.460
 whether in full screen or not on a 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.210
 or multiple screens we will 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:02.040
 start for example by choosing a 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.650
 layout that we like by 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.890
 example I want to put smart control 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.110
 here vologe disables 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.700
 the track inspector and we'll say that 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.460
 this disposition I like 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:18.480
 so I'll go up there in the 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:22.250
 figure and we see that here it is written 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:25.440
 screen 7.1 and what makes up the window 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:28.470
 so what I'm going to do already is that 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.880
 I will give him a little name they 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:37.320
 are 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:40.890
 my view and I will lock this screen 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.510
 this way then it means that the 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.500
 setting that I just did will 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.770
 always the same 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.800
 so if I change the whole man being I 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:52.650
 do that and go back to my 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.100
 screen set i will find my 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:58.830
 original display 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:02.340
 on the other hand it does not recover fully 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:05.070
 screen these first serious just the 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:08.850
 put in full screen know that you 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:11.580
 can also reach our screen 7 in 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:13.170
 going through the key that contains your 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.670
 number ie if you do not have 

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:19.350
 no numeric keypad for the 1 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:21.000
 you tap the key and for the 2 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:25.050
 you tap the accents key 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.360
 treble for the three touched them 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:31.050
 quotes etc 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:35.280
 you can also do a second 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:39.780
 screen 7 or even more for that you 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:42.000
 click duplicate wanted to poke towards 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:46.400
 numbers 2 and eventually and there you 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:54.450
 put another name the second view 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:58.630
 hockey and we'll put something else and I 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:07:01.150
 the klaus lock is locked 

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:05.080
 then you have to unlock and their 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:07.720
 locked to memorize the setting if 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:10.720
 I go on a I get my sight of 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:13.540
 just now if I go on two I 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.190
 get back the sight that I'm coming from 

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.440
 also that everything you put 

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:20.700
 on your other monitor or on your 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:23.050
 other monitors are also backing up 

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:25.990
 so it's a very practical way he 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:29.130
 found his work patterns 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:31.120
 and it's a very fast tool too 

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:32.590
 that's it for today 1 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.810
 it was a very short video 

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:38.580
 so I wish you well 

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:38.580
 have fun on logic and see you soon
