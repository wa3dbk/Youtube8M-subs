00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.840

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.980
 had a person who was the first 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.369
 The person who warned me today May 28 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.189

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:25.830

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:41.820
 installing updated 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:50.309
 let's do the following so that the 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:51.930
 other apps is not how I go 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.219
 do the first game play that we go 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.050
 change a little that the position of the 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.780
 camera to be able to place the arms here 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.920
 on the table and we will make the first 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.360
 samba and sef pro moto game play and already 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.970
 in the new version that was updated today 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.189
 Okay, I do not remember any tokens this. 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.880
 same tokyo version 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:23.570
 let's see how it goes this al 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:33.060
 khor with the tranquil samba in front 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:34.590
 a little beauty and let's install 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.810
 scor 0 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.299
 come on the only thing i think is bad 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:45.420
 is that it runs a piece of the screen that 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:53.880
 are the shortcut buttons touch the Japanese 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:56.509
 there the antenna antenna in Japan should speak 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.860
 Tokyo in Japan and there's only one and let's go 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:04.120
 talking bullshit and also made 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:11.820
 come on a little tutorial forget that 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:11.820
 that bullet train neither of japan fest muits 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:38.110
 let's go there overboard japanese architecture 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:48.940
 and very cool changed the scenario to 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:56.430
 side that I think is from a 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:57.640
 Geisha is almost hit people pillar 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.380
 best 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:07.720
 it is running perfect without any leg 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:13.870
 leg the blog fan the staff goes there cattle 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:15.390
 spoke right is right staff for my father 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.030
 for him talking there 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.280
 the law passed in fact I went to see the geisha 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:28.690
 I just hit the top here 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:29.560
 in him, his sensational performance did not 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.299
 no leg 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.890
 during the game very good 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:38.230
 as I said the only bad thing is that he 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.860
 eat a little here but do not do so much 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.760
 difference in the final result of the 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.250
 game 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:50.049
 very cool first channel game play 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.140
 I think it's the first one that the law 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:55.180
 people because I already did the bike g 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.280
 I hope it's the first game I play 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.959
 I've done so many since I do not even know 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.360
 Sometimes people sometimes even lose their 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:04.630
 control but congratulations the game 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.730

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.390

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.090
