just hit attack you can see the TP cost

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:24.920 
just hit attack you can see the TP cost
hit<00:03:16.739> attack

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.839 

there<00:03:25.560> you<00:03:25.769> it's<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.939> battle<00:03:27.269> result<00:03:27.629> screen

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
there you it's the battle result screen

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.569 
there you it's the battle result screen
so<00:03:29.849> as<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.060> can<00:03:30.239> see<00:03:30.510> i<00:03:30.780> took<00:03:31.469> losses<00:03:31.950> because

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
so as you can see i took losses because

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.610 
so as you can see i took losses because
the<00:03:32.909> levels<00:03:33.299> do<00:03:33.540> defend<00:03:33.870> themselves<00:03:34.260> just<00:03:34.530> a

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
the levels do defend themselves just a

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.009 
the levels do defend themselves just a
little<00:03:34.859> bit<00:03:35.010> that's<00:03:35.489> my<00:03:35.640> total<00:03:35.969> damage<00:03:36.329> this

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
little bit that's my total damage this

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.069 
little bit that's my total damage this
is<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.319> offender<00:03:38.209> that's<00:03:39.209> his<00:03:39.390> total<00:03:39.750> damage

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
is the offender that's his total damage

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.589 
is the offender that's his total damage
so<00:03:40.379> since<00:03:40.709> I<00:03:40.829> have<00:03:40.859> more<00:03:41.310> I<00:03:41.579> win<00:03:42.000> the

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
so since I have more I win the

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.809 
so since I have more I win the
percentage<00:03:43.049> of<00:03:43.139> Units<00:03:43.439> lost<00:03:43.680> for<00:03:43.889> me<00:03:44.010> was<00:03:44.219> 32

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
percentage of Units lost for me was 32

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.220 
percentage of Units lost for me was 32

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
sick that I gave eight experience now if

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:55.580 
sick that I gave eight experience now if
I<00:03:49.319> go<00:03:49.349> back<00:03:49.469> to<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.889> navigation<00:03:50.430> sweet<00:03:54.590> this

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
I go back to the navigation sweet this

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.900 
up here if the Galactic map here is
listed<00:04:42.720> all<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:42.990> capital<00:04:43.860> sectors<00:04:44.610> these

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
listed all the capital sectors these

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.340 
listed all the capital sectors these
sectors<00:04:45.240> have<00:04:45.390> a<00:04:45.480> hundred<00:04:45.750> and<00:04:45.960> fifty

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
sectors have a hundred and fifty

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.810 
sectors have a hundred and fifty
building<00:04:46.770> slots<00:04:47.100> so<00:04:47.430> they<00:04:47.610> are<00:04:47.790> very

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
building slots so they are very

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.180 
building slots so they are very
desirable<00:04:48.690> but<00:04:49.230> they're<00:04:49.440> difficult<00:04:49.710> to<00:04:50.040> take

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
desirable but they're difficult to take

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.620 
desirable but they're difficult to take
them<00:04:50.370> whole<00:04:50.550> because<00:04:50.580> the<00:04:51.150> most<00:04:51.330> powerful

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
them whole because the most powerful

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.700 
them whole because the most powerful
people<00:04:51.840> have<00:04:52.200> them<00:04:54.140> you<00:04:55.140> always<00:04:55.410> get<00:04:55.530> this

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
people have them you always get this

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.970 
people have them you always get this
little<00:04:55.920> sentient<00:04:56.370> spotted<00:04:56.940> and<00:04:57.900> then<00:04:58.680> that's

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
little sentient spotted and then that's

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.450 
little sentient spotted and then that's
the<00:04:59.130> total<00:04:59.370> it<00:05:00.030> can<00:05:00.270> get<00:05:00.420> up<00:05:00.570> to<00:05:00.720> about<00:05:00.750> 14<00:05:01.470> 285

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
the total it can get up to about 14 285

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.650 
the total it can get up to about 14 285
so<00:05:02.910> right<00:05:03.180> now<00:05:03.210> it's<00:05:03.540> still<00:05:03.720> growing<00:05:04.250> this<00:05:05.250> is

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
so right now it's still growing this is

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.300 
so right now it's still growing this is
the<00:05:06.660> Galactic<00:05:07.290> map<00:05:07.500> as<00:05:07.740> opposed<00:05:08.070> to<00:05:08.220> the

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
the Galactic map as opposed to the

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.420 
the Galactic map as opposed to the
navigation<00:05:08.910> screen<00:05:09.710> it's<00:05:10.710> not<00:05:10.890> a<00:05:10.950> five<00:05:11.220> by

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
navigation screen it's not a five by

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.920 
navigation screen it's not a five by
five<00:05:11.700> it<00:05:12.030> is<00:05:12.150> a<00:05:12.180> 9<00:05:12.510> x<00:05:12.780> 9<00:05:12.810> speed<00:05:13.700> which<00:05:14.750> does<00:05:15.750> not

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
five it is a 9 x 9 speed which does not

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.900 
five it is a 9 x 9 speed which does not
display<00:05:16.530> quite<00:05:16.950> as<00:05:17.130> much<00:05:17.340> information<00:05:17.970> as<00:05:19.910> the

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
display quite as much information as the

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.890 
display quite as much information as the
navigation<00:05:21.540> screen<00:05:22.940> but<00:05:23.940> it<00:05:23.970> does<00:05:24.360> have<00:05:24.870> a

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
navigation screen but it does have a

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.560 
navigation screen but it does have a
wider<00:05:25.260> area<00:05:25.710> so<00:05:25.920> you<00:05:25.980> can<00:05:26.160> get<00:05:26.250> a<00:05:26.310> better<00:05:26.580> idea

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
wider area so you can get a better idea

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.650 
wider area so you can get a better idea
of<00:05:28.380> what's<00:05:28.770> around<00:05:28.920> you<00:05:29.280> if<00:05:29.820> you<00:05:29.970> want<00:05:30.180> you<00:05:30.570> can

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
of what's around you if you want you can

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.110 
of what's around you if you want you can
go<00:05:30.720> to<00:05:30.870> zoom<00:05:31.230> level<00:05:31.560> 2

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.249 

it<00:05:36.120> will<00:05:36.240> load<00:05:36.389> it<00:05:36.419> up<00:05:36.569> it<00:05:36.750> even<00:05:36.990> further

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:37.259 
it will load it up it even further

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:43.850 
it will load it up it even further
review<00:05:40.759> just<00:05:41.759> like<00:05:41.909> that<00:05:42.199> but<00:05:43.199> you<00:05:43.319> can't<00:05:43.560> see

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
review just like that but you can't see

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.950 
review just like that but you can't see
any<00:05:44.189> of<00:05:44.400> the<00:05:44.520> labels<00:05:44.879> at<00:05:45.000> all<00:05:45.150> from<00:05:45.419> this<00:05:45.659> view

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
any of the labels at all from this view

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.369 
any of the labels at all from this view
but<00:05:46.289> you<00:05:46.439> can't<00:05:46.680> see<00:05:47.120> just<00:05:48.120> a<00:05:48.240> general<00:05:48.479> idea<00:05:49.050> of

00:05:49.369 --> 00:05:49.379 
but you can't see just a general idea of

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:52.999 
but you can't see just a general idea of
what's<00:05:49.770> around<00:05:49.919> you<00:05:50.310> which<00:05:50.909> is<00:05:51.060> helpful<00:05:51.860> so<00:05:52.860> as
