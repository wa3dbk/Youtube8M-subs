00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.040
 there is a lot of misinformation about 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.840
 Most fat see it as something bad 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.490
 that holds our body and this is not 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.349
 of all true few have a 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.750
 more detailed understanding of what it is 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.520
 its purpose actually that's why today in 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.859
 this video we're going to talk about fat 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.990
 body we should know that fat 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.180
 is a generic term to designate 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.400
 various kinds of fat lipids 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.980
 stored body is the type of fat 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.050
 that contributes to obesity if it is 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.420
 stored in large quantities when 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.579
 these fats are not used as energy 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.590
 then they are stored in the 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.989
 adiposites which form the 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.329
 composition of the adipose tissue 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.829
 Adipose is mainly found 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.079
 under the skin where one of your 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.480
 main functions is to store 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.760
 energy in the form of fat this fat 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.379
 It can be good or bad depending on the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.930
 amount of fats we have 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.399
 stored a negative point is that it 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.859
 have shown that fat cells 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.660
 play an important role in the 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.609
 determination of resistance to 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.530
 insulin a large accumulation of 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.670
 Fat is seen as an important 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.040
 Diabetes marker 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.080
 in addition to its influence on the response 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.270
 insulin obesity and more in 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.280
 concrete abdominal obesity is 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.380
 consider an indicator of factor of 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.630
 risk for blood pressure and 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.640
 heart disease it is clear that 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.680
 excess fat can contribute to 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.690
 a series of health problems several 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.820
 of which we have mentioned but 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.740
 within acceptable limits is 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.840
 can be very advantageous a level of 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.680
 acceptable fat for men could 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.450
 be between 18 to 24 percent and 25 to 31 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.630
 percent for women according 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.550
 with the america a cancer on exercise more 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.130
 of the percentages said can promote 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.990
 unfavorable health conditions now 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.520
 let's go to the positive points of having 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.920
 body fat several researchers 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.990
 they claim that fat cells are not 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.850
 as passive as you thought this is 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.159
 because adipose tissue is not limited 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.590
 only to storage of fat 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.539
 it is also an endocrine organ 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.789
 that secretes hormones that regulate the 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.799
 appetite favor sensitivity to 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.539
 insulin and also regulate the weight 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.580
 body of leptin is one of the 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.149
 hormones secreted by the cells of 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.310
 grease 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.620
 it acts on the hypothalamus to 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.299
 suppress the appetite and also contributes 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.939
 the burning of fats in adipose tissue 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:20.099
 so we can see the have a level 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:22.019
 healthy body fat produced 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.599
 sufficient amounts of these hormones 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.670
 the fat cells also play a 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.769
 important role in maintaining 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.870
 triglyceride levels and 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.299
 free fatty acids the last 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.459
 components of acid triglycerides 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.959
 fatty acids and glycerol are released in the 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.989
 blood to provide energy 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.430
 being able to produce quantities 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.069
 relatively large atp so 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.870
 both the one that has a supply 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.760
 logical and normal triglycerides will have 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.040
 a reserve of additional energy the 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.470
 fat as energy is considered one of 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.599
 the most efficient sources this should be 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.430
 to which the fat initially contains 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.769
 little oxygen and having to be 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.689
 combined with more oxygen can produce 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.939
 a major fuel source 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:05.010
 duration as you can see the fat is 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:06.840
 essential for the body all within 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.909
 some logical guidelines as well as the 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.709
 energy supply and promotion 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.420
 of the release of important hormones 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.160
 the fat cells also have the 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.580
 ability to cushion and isolate the 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.830
 body 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.930
 This is important for well-being 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.700
 general and as protector of the organs 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.620
 vital regardless of the 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.630
 constant obsession with lowering the index 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.690
 of body fat we all must 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.280
 maintain at least 3% will help 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.990
 to have the organs in their place already 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.580
 protect them from injuries 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.350
 the fat is also necessary for 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.090
 absorb certain vitamins that are 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.690
 essential for health and well - being 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.370
 vitamins ady k are stored in 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.710
 the fat cells to be 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.570
 used when necessary this is 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.400
 one of the main benefits of 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.590
 consume adequate amounts of the 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.840
 in our diet we hope that this 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.390
 video has helped you, do not forget 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.780
 subscribe and of course follow the 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.780
 madness 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.850
 slowly
