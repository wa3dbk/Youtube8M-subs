if I wanted this to be more of a square
haircut<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:45.149> would<00:00:45.960> take<00:00:46.140> partings<00:00:46.590> more<00:00:46.739> like

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
haircut I would take partings more like

haircut I would take partings more like
this

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.920 

and<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:06.000> would<00:01:06.150> take<00:01:06.270> them<00:01:06.390> straight<00:01:06.720> across

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
and I would take them straight across

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.950 
and I would take them straight across
through<00:01:08.870> like<00:01:09.870> this<00:01:11.180> this<00:01:12.180> would<00:01:12.420> create<00:01:12.750> more

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
through like this this would create more

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.230 
through like this this would create more
of<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.200> square<00:01:13.590> shape<00:01:13.620> through<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.640> haircut

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
of a square shape through the haircut

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.210 
of a square shape through the haircut
but<00:01:15.780> what<00:01:15.930> we<00:01:16.050> want<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.320> create<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.800> more<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:17.130> an

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
but what we want to create is more of an

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.400 
but what we want to create is more of an
angular<00:01:17.670> look<00:01:18.090> because<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.690> creates<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.229> more

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
angular look because it creates a more

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.500 
angular look because it creates a more
softer<00:01:19.950> look<00:01:20.159> if<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.850> wanted<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.210> create<00:01:21.360> a

softer look if you wanted to create a

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.090 
softer look if you wanted to create a

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
more bold and blunt look you would do

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.010 
more bold and blunt look you would do
the<00:01:23.280> square<00:01:23.790> partings<00:01:26.570> so<00:01:27.570> back<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.810> the

triangular partings we'll be starting

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:40.310 
triangular partings we'll be starting
here<00:01:36.289> and<00:01:38.479> working<00:01:39.479> our<00:01:39.630> way<00:01:39.660> through<00:01:40.170> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
here and working our way through the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.029 
here and working our way through the
haircut<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.460> way<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.740> same<00:01:43.740> through<00:01:44.009> the

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
haircut in this way and same through the

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.580 
haircut in this way and same through the
sides<00:01:44.509> always<00:01:45.509> making<00:01:46.080> sure<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.380> head<00:01:46.560> is

sides always making sure the head is
properly<00:01:47.130> tilted<00:01:50.570> this<00:01:51.570> would<00:01:51.840> be<00:01:51.930> your

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
properly tilted this would be your

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.469 
properly tilted this would be your
triangular<00:01:52.649> parting

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
triangular parting

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:20.339 
triangular parting
this<00:01:54.479> would<00:01:54.750> be<00:01:54.869> your<00:01:54.990> square<00:01:55.320> party

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.610 

and<00:02:21.390> that's<00:02:22.390> how<00:02:22.629> you<00:02:22.689> do<00:02:22.870> triangular<00:02:23.439> and

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
and that's how you do triangular and

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.370
