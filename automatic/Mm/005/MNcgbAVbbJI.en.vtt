cats<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:32.130> I'm<00:01:33.119> clumsy<00:01:33.689> sometimes<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.829> so

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
cats and I'm clumsy sometimes and so

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.030 
cats and I'm clumsy sometimes and so
these<00:01:35.430> boards<00:01:35.759> get<00:01:35.909> knocked<00:01:36.150> around<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:37.040> so

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
these boards get knocked around and so

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.550 
these boards get knocked around and so
the<00:01:38.130> beads<00:01:38.310> may<00:01:38.640> Scheffel<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.570> little<00:01:39.780> bit<00:01:39.960> but

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
the beads may Scheffel a little bit but

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.200 
the beads may Scheffel a little bit but
they<00:01:40.680> don't<00:01:40.860> get<00:01:41.159> they<00:01:41.520> don't<00:01:41.700> fall<00:01:41.909> off<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
they don't get they don't fall off the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.749 
they don't get they don't fall off the
board<00:01:42.659> which<00:01:43.079> if<00:01:43.409> you're<00:01:43.860> using<00:01:44.100> just<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.460> plain

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
board which if you're using just a plain

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.690 
board which if you're using just a plain
mat<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.960> would<00:01:46.200> happen<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.860> believe<00:01:47.549> me

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
mat that would happen and believe me

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.249 
mat that would happen and believe me
that's<00:01:48.000> why<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.240> have<00:01:48.479> tons<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.840> beads<00:01:49.049> on<00:01:49.200> my

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
that's why I have tons of beads on my

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.499 
that's why I have tons of beads on my
floor<00:01:49.560> all<00:01:49.770> over<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.040> place

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
floor all over the place

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.580 
floor all over the place
the<00:01:51.509> other<00:01:51.659> thing<00:01:51.869> about<00:01:51.960> these<00:01:52.200> bead<00:01:52.409> on<00:01:52.560> it

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
the other thing about these bead on it

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.100 
the other thing about these bead on it
boards<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.220> if<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.820> put<00:01:54.060> beads<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:54.780> them

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
boards is that if you put beads on them

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.139 
boards is that if you put beads on them
and<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.950> kind<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.340> just<00:01:56.399> do<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.700> little<00:01:56.939> bit<00:01:57.119> of

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
and you kind of just do a little bit of

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.170 
and you kind of just do a little bit of

laptop<00:02:44.650> computer<00:02:45.010> sitting<00:02:45.580> right<00:02:45.730> in<00:02:45.760> front

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
laptop computer sitting right in front

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.050 
laptop computer sitting right in front
of<00:02:46.120> me<00:02:46.299> and<00:02:46.540> this<00:02:47.319> works<00:02:47.799> perfectly<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:48.880> sit

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
of me and this works perfectly to sit

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.490 
of me and this works perfectly to sit
right<00:02:49.209> in<00:02:49.330> front<00:02:49.510> of<00:02:49.569> that<00:02:49.660> laptop<00:02:50.080> and<00:02:50.110> yet<00:02:50.470> I

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
right in front of that laptop and yet I

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.440 
right in front of that laptop and yet I
can<00:02:50.709> still<00:02:50.950> reach<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.489> laptop<00:02:51.910> to<00:02:52.120> work<00:02:52.269> away

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
can still reach the laptop to work away

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.300 
can still reach the laptop to work away
so<00:02:53.230> this<00:02:53.349> is<00:02:53.590> a<00:02:53.620> really<00:02:53.860> this<00:02:54.010> is<00:02:54.069> also<00:02:54.190> a

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
so this is a really this is also a

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.900 
so this is a really this is also a
really<00:02:54.459> good<00:02:54.549> size<00:02:55.120> if<00:02:55.150> you're<00:02:55.599> going<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.260> a

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
really good size if you're going to a

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.670 
really good size if you're going to a
beating<00:02:57.910> class<00:02:58.209> this<00:02:58.780> can<00:02:58.989> be<00:02:59.110> a<00:02:59.140> really<00:02:59.319> good

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
beating class this can be a really good

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.460 
beating class this can be a really good
size<00:02:59.950> for<00:03:00.220> that<00:03:00.340> she<00:03:01.120> also<00:03:01.269> makes<00:03:01.630> one<00:03:01.870> similar

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
size for that she also makes one similar

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.490 
size for that she also makes one similar
width<00:03:03.250> but<00:03:03.640> about<00:03:04.000> how<00:03:04.299> about<00:03:05.019> 2<00:03:05.170> inches

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
width but about how about 2 inches

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.250 
width but about how about 2 inches
shorter<00:03:05.950> so<00:03:06.459> it's<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.880> this<00:03:07.750> is<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:07.959> 8<00:03:08.079> by<00:03:08.230> 11

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
shorter so it's a this is the 8 by 11

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.880 
shorter so it's a this is the 8 by 11
it's<00:03:08.739> just<00:03:08.890> like<00:03:09.069> a<00:03:09.099> 6<00:03:09.430> by<00:03:09.640> 11<00:03:10.120> and<00:03:10.530> so<00:03:11.530> if<00:03:11.769> you

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
it's just like a 6 by 11 and so if you

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.350 
it's just like a 6 by 11 and so if you
tend<00:03:12.130> to<00:03:12.250> work<00:03:12.430> kind<00:03:12.760> of<00:03:12.819> in<00:03:12.940> a<00:03:13.000> straight<00:03:13.329> line

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
tend to work kind of in a straight line

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.809 
tend to work kind of in a straight line
that<00:03:14.200> can<00:03:14.410> be<00:03:14.440> a<00:03:14.560> really<00:03:14.739> good<00:03:15.040> option<00:03:15.250> for<00:03:15.670> you

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
that can be a really good option for you

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.710 
that can be a really good option for you
and<00:03:16.030> then<00:03:16.870> this<00:03:17.109> one<00:03:17.350> that<00:03:17.500> I<00:03:17.530> use<00:03:18.010> in<00:03:18.720> the

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
and then this one that I use in the

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.590 
and then this one that I use in the
videos<00:03:20.079> is<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.620> Big<00:03:20.920> Mama<00:03:21.190> this<00:03:21.700> is<00:03:21.850> an<00:03:22.030> 11<00:03:22.299> by
