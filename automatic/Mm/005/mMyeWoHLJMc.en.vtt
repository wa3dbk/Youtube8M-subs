 we had said at the beginning of the transfer window that the 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:21.460
 club would go fast as the club took advantage 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.919
 of his situation that is a situation 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.060
 extreme stage of a club that has 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.130
 worked throughout the season 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.779
 last of a club that could 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.109
 project quickly on the season to 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:30.849

 headlights in front of guingamp version 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.900
 2014 2015 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.180
 he often says that in a team there is 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.710
 two positions extremely important the 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.979
 Position Goalkeeper 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.619
 and here I am pleased to introduce 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.549
 jonas the only one on my right and 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.550
 then the attacker's post 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:22.300
 then we find martin senn who is at 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.880
 my recruits left that was for us 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:28.560
 clearly identified objectives 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:33.310
 as such in the offseason we had 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:36.159
 with the coach with stéphane carnot targeted 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.680
 Denmark as a country a country 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.040
 interesting a country in which there is 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.460
 certainly some opportunities to 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.100
 to fetch 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:49.840
 it's a country that has proven through 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.820
 recent seasons that it's a country that has 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.130
 proven through the last seasons 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.740
 that there were players who were 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.090
 able to acclimatize extremely 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.700
 chilli at the championships of France 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.229
 today the championship of France 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.700
 account of the Danish players who are 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:03.970
 extremely powerful in different 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.080
 clubs 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.950
 so we thought it was ideal to go 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.569
 return on the spot 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.730
 we did not want to do anything 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.720
 no matter how true it was 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.810
 already disappointed actually 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:20.230
 but stéphane and then later 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.170
 the entire staff have seen each other 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.380
 many times 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:29.440
 the barges too much earlier and 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.230
 it's true that it's now a 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.630
 sacred moment that we follow at once jonas 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.160
 aironi to be very honest if we 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.410
 could have brought them the season 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.820
 last I think we would already have 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.720
 tried to take the plunge it was 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.490
 players who were not accessible 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.530
 for ahead of season guingamp 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.030
 last who became it because 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.640
 as I wanted to said the clab was fine 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.730
 worked on the past season 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.750
 so that opened up opportunities 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.070
 are two players who were not 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.440
 available and they were both 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.360
 under contract but given their 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.280
 performance and excellent 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.220
 relationships that they each had with 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.810
 with their club the midtjylland club of 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.090
 and the hiking club 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.950
 both agreed 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.060
 open the discussions and I held 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.810
 by the way to thank 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.270
 in this respect both the leaders 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.390
 midtjylland of the leaders of 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.080
 randers but also the agents are there 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.530
 present in the room 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.510
 so the fabrice year for work 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.590
 we could realize all together 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.040
 was done in an excellent condition 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.770
 spirit 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.750
 I enjoyed one thing is a point 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:36.620
 joint between against the square and aironi 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.480
 is that both have then 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.220
 asked after when you are my perception 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.320
 it's channel and the other would have come in 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.330
 running and winning and you know like 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.770
 me as it is important for us 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.940
 to have players who have a 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.710
 absolutely uncommon mentality of 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.290
 players who want to get started 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.640
 immediately in an adventure 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.380
 immediately in a battle we know 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.209
 that the coming season is going to be a 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.110
 fantastic season for us with 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.680
 multiple goals 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:06.370
 it's going to be a big fight too and before 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.840
 to recruit football players and 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.820
 stéphane we will say a word just now 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.270
 on the intrinsic qualities of 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.610
 footballer 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.489
 you know that we are looking to recruit 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.820
 men of men many men on 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.820
