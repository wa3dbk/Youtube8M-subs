00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
chip that I did here wasn't actually as

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.479 
chip that I did here wasn't actually as
hi<00:02:13.489> or<00:02:13.879> long<00:02:14.209> as<00:02:14.480> across<00:02:15.440> usually<00:02:15.890> is<00:02:16.010> but<00:02:16.340> that

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
hi or long as across usually is but that

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.190 
hi or long as across usually is but that
was<00:02:16.580> just<00:02:16.730> me<00:02:16.819> pressing<00:02:17.180> X<00:02:17.390> pitch<00:02:17.659> not<00:02:17.959> for<00:02:18.140> as

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
was just me pressing X pitch not for as

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.809 
was just me pressing X pitch not for as
long<00:02:18.379> period<00:02:18.709> of<00:02:18.739> time<00:02:18.890> so<00:02:19.489> I<00:02:19.519> think<00:02:19.700> they've

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
long period of time so I think they've

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.220 
long period of time so I think they've
implemented<00:02:20.269> that<00:02:20.540> into<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.810> game<00:02:21.019> which

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
implemented that into the game which

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.410 
implemented that into the game which
makes<00:02:21.379> for<00:02:21.590> really<00:02:21.950> nice<00:02:22.069> balls<00:02:22.849> for<00:02:23.180> people
