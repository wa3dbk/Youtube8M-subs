00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
into they lose at bc and over time you

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.340 
into they lose at bc and over time you
know<00:00:36.980> and<00:00:37.160> it<00:00:37.250> over<00:00:37.609> bc<00:00:38.359> we<00:00:38.750> were<00:00:38.899> tied<00:00:39.109> with

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
know and it over bc we were tied with

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.509 
know and it over bc we were tied with
them<00:00:39.530> Harvard<00:00:40.519> I<00:00:41.800> think<00:00:42.800> this<00:00:42.949> is<00:00:43.010> a<00:00:43.190> fourth

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
them Harvard I think this is a fourth

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:44.529 
them Harvard I think this is a fourth
year<00:00:43.730> in<00:00:43.760> a<00:00:43.850> row<00:00:43.879> they've<00:00:44.239> been<00:00:44.420> the

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
year in a row they've been the

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:46.180 
year in a row they've been the
tournament<00:00:44.960> and<00:00:45.079> the<00:00:45.559> other<00:00:45.710> three<00:00:45.980> years

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
tournament and the other three years

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.040 
tournament and the other three years
they've<00:00:46.339> won<00:00:46.370> a<00:00:46.519> game<00:00:46.730> they're<00:00:47.239> very<00:00:47.510> balanced

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
they've won a game they're very balanced

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.069 
they've won a game they're very balanced
club<00:00:48.609> they<00:00:49.609> make<00:00:49.850> about<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:50.239> same<00:00:50.660> number<00:00:50.719> of

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
club they make about the same number of

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:52.930 
club they make about the same number of
three<00:00:51.379> that<00:00:51.559> we<00:00:51.710> do<00:00:51.859> per<00:00:52.070> game<00:00:52.309> but<00:00:52.460> it's<00:00:52.640> fewer

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
three that we do per game but it's fewer

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.939 
three that we do per game but it's fewer
possession<00:00:53.600> so<00:00:53.839> they<00:00:53.960> do<00:00:54.019> rely<00:00:54.469> on<00:00:54.499> the<00:00:54.710> three

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
possession so they do rely on the three

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.360 
possession so they do rely on the three
a<00:00:54.980> little<00:00:55.219> bit<00:00:55.339> more<00:00:55.519> than<00:00:55.670> we<00:00:55.820> do<00:00:57.249> you<00:00:58.249> know

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
a little bit more than we do you know

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.919 
a little bit more than we do you know

that's pretty impressive to me we really

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.380 
that's pretty impressive to me we really
had<00:01:15.530> some<00:01:15.740> good<00:01:15.890> stretches<00:01:16.460> in<00:01:16.640> all<00:01:17.150> of<00:01:17.300> those

had some good stretches in all of those
games<00:01:17.800> we<00:01:18.800> really<00:01:19.040> had<00:01:19.250> some<00:01:19.460> good<00:01:19.610> stretches

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150

there<00:01:20.390> that<00:01:20.570> can<00:01:20.690> overcome<00:01:20.840> some<00:01:21.560> of<00:01:21.590> the<00:01:21.920> poor

there that can overcome some of the poor
stretches<00:01:23.090> you<00:01:23.660> know<00:01:23.780> during<00:01:23.960> the<00:01:24.080> course<00:01:24.350> of

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
stretches you know during the course of

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.800 
stretches you know during the course of
a<00:01:24.530> game<00:01:24.560> I<00:01:24.800> think<00:01:25.040> this<00:01:25.400> team<00:01:25.640> probably<00:01:25.970> as<00:01:26.330> a

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
a game I think this team probably as a

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.590 
a game I think this team probably as a
wider<00:01:27.340> variant<00:01:28.340> peaks<00:01:28.730> and<00:01:28.910> valleys<00:01:28.970> of<00:01:29.330> any

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
wider variant peaks and valleys of any

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.180 
wider variant peaks and valleys of any
team<00:01:29.810> maybe<00:01:30.050> I've<00:01:30.230> ever<00:01:30.440> had<00:01:30.680> during<00:01:30.920> one

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
team maybe I've ever had during one

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.510 
team maybe I've ever had during one
during<00:01:31.880> one<00:01:32.060> game<00:01:32.410> but<00:01:33.410> I<00:01:33.470> was<00:01:33.800> really<00:01:34.220> pleased

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
during one game but I was really pleased

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.100 
during one game but I was really pleased
with<00:01:34.670> a<00:01:34.790> lot<00:01:35.060> of<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.300> things<00:01:35.540> we<00:01:35.720> did<00:01:35.870> up<00:01:36.080> there

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
with a lot of the things we did up there

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.790 
with a lot of the things we did up there
and<00:01:36.440> I<00:01:36.530> think<00:01:36.770> that<00:01:37.510> that<00:01:38.510> should<00:01:39.440> have<00:01:39.590> given

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
and I think that that should have given

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.290 
and I think that that should have given
our<00:01:39.980> guys<00:01:40.160> even<00:01:40.430> a<00:01:40.520> little<00:01:40.700> more<00:01:40.850> positive

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
overall you know I'm a little bit

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.490 
overall you know I'm a little bit
quicker<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:20.600> jump<00:02:21.600> a<00:02:21.690> little<00:02:21.780> bit<00:02:22.020> higher<00:02:22.170> and

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
quicker I jump a little bit higher and

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.410 
quicker I jump a little bit higher and
those<00:02:23.280> things<00:02:23.490> don't<00:02:23.640> really<00:02:24.060> make<00:02:24.210> that<00:02:24.360> big

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
those things don't really make that big

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.730 
those things don't really make that big
of<00:02:24.600> a<00:02:24.720> difference<00:02:24.810> because<00:02:25.050> i'm<00:02:25.230> not<00:02:25.380> really

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
of a difference because i'm not really

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.050 
of a difference because i'm not really
the<00:02:25.830> guy<00:02:26.100> that<00:02:26.280> relies<00:02:26.400> on<00:02:26.520> my<00:02:26.730> athleticism

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
the guy that relies on my athleticism

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.600 
the guy that relies on my athleticism
but<00:02:27.480> when<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:28.200> play<00:02:28.470> without<00:02:28.830> you<00:02:29.520> know

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
but when you play without you know

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.100 
but when you play without you know
worried<00:02:29.910> about<00:02:29.970> anything<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:30.660> you<00:02:31.080> don't

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
worried about anything and you don't

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.690 
worried about anything and you don't
have<00:02:31.470> any<00:02:31.620> pain<00:02:31.830> you<00:02:32.070> just<00:02:32.250> play<00:02:32.460> and

have any pain you just play and
everything<00:02:32.940> is<00:02:33.360> natural<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.200> instinctual<00:02:34.710> I

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
everything is natural and instinctual I

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.960

think that helps so yeah I guess I play

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.400 
think that helps so yeah I guess I play
a<00:02:39.000> lot<00:02:39.150> better<00:02:39.360> because<00:02:39.660> I'm<00:02:39.930> feeling<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.320> lot
