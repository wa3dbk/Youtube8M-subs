that<00:00:17.980> per<00:00:18.980> Nabi<00:00:19.400> was<00:00:19.579> supposed<00:00:19.999> to<00:00:20.119> come

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
that per Nabi was supposed to come

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.989 
that per Nabi was supposed to come
pre-installed<00:00:20.749> on<00:00:21.470> the<00:00:21.650> device<00:00:21.980> but<00:00:22.759> it<00:00:22.880> was

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:22.999 
pre-installed on the device but it was

not ready when Nabi was ready to launch

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.630 
not ready when Nabi was ready to launch
so<00:00:25.369> they<00:00:25.789> did<00:00:26.179> not<00:00:26.210> include<00:00:26.599> it<00:00:27.460> from<00:00:28.460> what<00:00:28.609> I

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
so they did not include it from what I

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.800 
so they did not include it from what I
understand<00:00:29.029> it<00:00:29.119> is<00:00:29.239> going<00:00:29.390> to<00:00:29.479> be<00:00:29.569> available
