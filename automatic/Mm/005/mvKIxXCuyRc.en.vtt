00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
down the straightaway because that could

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.950

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.440 

I'm<00:02:42.420> sensitive

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:58.660 

two<00:02:47.450> three

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.550

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
got a lot of traffic right in front of

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.960 
got a lot of traffic right in front of
him<00:03:00.740> see<00:03:00.920> how<00:03:01.040> that<00:03:01.250> affects<00:03:01.580> what<00:03:01.640> he's<00:03:01.850> able

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
him see how that affects what he's able

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.990 
him see how that affects what he's able
to<00:03:02.120> do

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
to do

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.380 
to do
there's<00:03:04.480> Harvick<00:03:05.230> I<00:03:06.000> think<00:03:07.000> Harvey's<00:03:07.270> gonna

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
there's Harvick I think Harvey's gonna

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.810 
there's Harvick I think Harvey's gonna
catch<00:03:07.690> him<00:03:07.870> is<00:03:08.020> it's<00:03:08.500> just<00:03:08.560> gonna<00:03:08.820> because

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
catch him is it's just gonna because

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.980 
catch him is it's just gonna because
Harvick<00:03:10.210> have<00:03:10.360> enough<00:03:10.570> fuel<00:03:10.690> to<00:03:10.780> make<00:03:10.870> it

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
Harvick have enough fuel to make it

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.300 
Harvick have enough fuel to make it
through<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.320> end<00:03:11.350> and<00:03:11.590> I<00:03:11.680> think<00:03:11.710> when<00:03:12.010> he<00:03:12.040> gets

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
through the end and I think when he gets

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.920 
through the end and I think when he gets
the<00:03:12.460> Stewart<00:03:12.790> Stewart's<00:03:13.390> gonna<00:03:13.480> quit<00:03:13.750> all<00:03:13.840> the

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
the Stewart Stewart's gonna quit all the

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.240 
the Stewart Stewart's gonna quit all the
nonsense<00:03:14.110> and<00:03:14.470> pushing<00:03:14.710> the<00:03:14.770> clutch<00:03:14.920> he<00:03:15.100> and

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
nonsense and pushing the clutch he and

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.100 
nonsense and pushing the clutch he and
it<00:03:15.310> broke<00:03:15.460> the<00:03:15.640> hearts<00:03:15.850> again<00:03:16.150> yeah<00:03:16.630> they<00:03:16.840> ran

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
it broke the hearts again yeah they ran

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.960 
it broke the hearts again yeah they ran
about<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.740> same<00:03:17.980> lap<00:03:18.220> time<00:03:18.490> only<00:03:18.730> three

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
about the same lap time only three

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.340 
about the same lap time only three
hundredths<00:03:19.420> of<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.600> second<00:03:19.960> that<00:03:20.080> last<00:03:20.320> lap

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.380 

then<00:03:24.920> one<00:03:25.130> thing<00:03:25.340> is<00:03:25.490> helping<00:03:25.700> Tony<00:03:25.970> Stewart

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
then one thing is helping Tony Stewart

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.480 
then one thing is helping Tony Stewart
that<00:03:26.540> car<00:03:26.780> is<00:03:26.960> driving<00:03:27.560> so<00:03:27.770> good<00:03:28.010> and<00:03:28.220> when<00:03:28.400> it

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
that car is driving so good and when it

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.460 
that car is driving so good and when it
drives<00:03:28.820> like<00:03:29.060> that<00:03:29.300> you<00:03:29.720> can<00:03:29.900> back<00:03:30.110> off<00:03:30.140> the

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
drives like that you can back off the

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.470 
drives like that you can back off the
throttle<00:03:30.650> let<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.070> car<00:03:31.250> roll<00:03:31.550> a<00:03:31.610> lot<00:03:32.030> more<00:03:32.270> and

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
throttle let the car roll a lot more and

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.480 
throttle let the car roll a lot more and
now<00:03:32.510> obviously<00:03:33.170> you're<00:03:33.380> you<00:03:33.500> lose<00:03:33.680> using<00:03:34.340> less

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
now obviously you're you lose using less

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.250 
now obviously you're you lose using less
fuel<00:03:34.760> like<00:03:35.090> that<00:03:35.300> that's<00:03:35.750> why<00:03:35.900> he's<00:03:36.080> not

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
fuel like that that's why he's not

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.570 
fuel like that that's why he's not
slowing<00:03:36.560> down<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:36.980> budget

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
slowing down and budget

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.420 
slowing down and budget
to<00:03:39.390> go<00:03:41.510> point<00:03:42.510> seven<00:03:42.990> seconds<00:03:43.590> back<00:03:44.070> to<00:03:44.250> Kevin

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430
