game like I think after a few missions
you<00:02:18.420> have<00:02:18.510> like<00:02:18.660> 40<00:02:18.959> points<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.380> can<00:02:19.530> buy<00:02:19.680> the

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.950 
like this must be a fallout reference
cuz<00:03:32.820> it<00:03:33.450> looks<00:03:33.630> so<00:03:33.870> similar<00:03:34.170> to<00:03:35.360> a<00:03:36.360> fault<00:03:36.780> or
