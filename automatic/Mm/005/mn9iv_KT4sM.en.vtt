wall<00:00:10.320> combo<00:00:10.710> baraka<00:00:11.099> this<00:00:11.580> was<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.910> combos

talking<00:00:12.599> about<00:00:12.750> in<00:00:12.809> my<00:00:12.900> last<00:00:12.929> video<00:00:13.460> it's<00:00:14.460> very

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
talking about in my last video it's very

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.359 
talking about in my last video it's very
similar<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.240> less<00:00:15.660> combo<00:00:16.170> but<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.859> inputs<00:00:17.220> are

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
similar to less combo but the inputs are

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.910 
similar to less combo but the inputs are
a<00:00:17.400> lot<00:00:17.580> easy<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:18.029> remember<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.800> but<00:00:19.800> the

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
a lot easy to remember and but the

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.189 
a lot easy to remember and but the
timing<00:00:20.189> is<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.490> bit<00:00:20.640> harder<00:00:21.090> but<00:00:21.810> all<00:00:21.990> in<00:00:22.109> all

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
timing is a bit harder but all in all

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.200 
timing is a bit harder but all in all
both<00:00:22.470> combos<00:00:22.920> are<00:00:22.949> freaking<00:00:23.670> great<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:24.000> use

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
both combos are freaking great to use

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.420 
both combos are freaking great to use
and<00:00:24.510> whichever<00:00:25.080> one<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.439> prefer<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.310> one

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
and whichever one you prefer is the one

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.370 
and whichever one you prefer is the one
you<00:00:26.519> should<00:00:26.609> be<00:00:26.699> using<00:00:26.939> many<00:00:27.720> ways<00:00:27.869> I'm<00:00:28.230> going

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
you should be using many ways I'm going

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.109 
you should be using many ways I'm going
to<00:00:28.439> start<00:00:28.590> with<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:28.710> up<00:00:29.039> forward<00:00:29.580> triangle

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
to start with that up forward triangle

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.840 
to start with that up forward triangle

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
to the back x square so the diagonal

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.900 
to the back x square so the diagonal
punch<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.450> back<00:00:33.600> x<00:00:33.809> square<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.910> xbox

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
controls on the bottom there but here's

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.590 
controls on the bottom there but here's
what<00:00:38.520> should<00:00:38.670> look<00:00:38.790> like<00:00:38.820> on<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.180> controller

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
what should look like on a controller

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.260 
what should look like on a controller
and<00:00:39.980> pretty<00:00:40.980> much<00:00:41.040> baraka<00:00:41.489> overall<00:00:42.059> it's

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
and pretty much baraka overall it's

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.670 
and pretty much baraka overall it's
pretty<00:00:42.300> solid<00:00:42.629> character<00:00:42.899> especially<00:00:43.260> after

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
pretty solid character especially after

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.750 
pretty solid character especially after
his<00:00:43.860> buff<00:00:44.480> and<00:00:45.620> he's<00:00:46.620> always<00:00:46.829> obviously<00:00:47.460> had

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
his buff and he's always obviously had

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.510 
his buff and he's always obviously had
sick<00:00:48.329> wake<00:00:48.660> up<00:00:48.840> moves<00:00:49.079> wake<00:00:49.770> up<00:00:49.920> attacks<00:00:50.250> or

freaking sick with the sky you can't
play<00:00:52.199> aggressive<00:00:52.559> against<00:00:52.770> Baraka<00:00:53.070> by<00:00:53.789> the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
play aggressive against Baraka by the

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.090 
play aggressive against Baraka by the
way<00:00:53.940> step<00:00:54.210> 2<00:00:54.390> we're<00:00:54.660> gonna<00:00:54.750> do<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> pause<00:00:55.500> back<00:00:55.860> x

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
way step 2 we're gonna do a pause back x

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.799 
way step 2 we're gonna do a pause back x
squared<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.550> another<00:00:57.030> paul<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.390> back<00:00:57.570> x

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
squared and another paul is back x

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.799 
squared and another paul is back x
squared<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.460> see<00:00:59.699> there<00:00:59.879> we<00:00:59.969> repeating

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
squared and you see there we repeating

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.560 
squared and you see there we repeating
the<00:01:00.899> same<00:01:01.079> string<00:01:01.379> 3<00:01:01.620> x<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.129> y<00:01:02.730> say<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.300> the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
the same string 3 x and y say this the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.119 
the same string 3 x and y say this the
timing<00:01:03.930> miscomm<00:01:04.229> was<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> bit<00:01:04.650> harder<00:01:04.949> is

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
timing miscomm was a bit harder is

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.000 
timing miscomm was a bit harder is
because<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.420> pop<00:01:06.630> scaling<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.260> game<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
because the pop scaling in this game the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.070 
because the pop scaling in this game the
way<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.280> works<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.150> more<00:01:09.330> pop-ups<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.900> do

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
way it works is the more pop-ups you do

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.929 
way it works is the more pop-ups you do
with<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.409> one<00:01:10.560> combo<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.220> faster<00:01:11.610> they<00:01:11.700> fall

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
with in one combo the faster they fall

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.270 
with in one combo the faster they fall
down<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.930> you'd<00:01:13.409> want<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.710> put<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.070> mind

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
down so you'd want to put that in mind

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.399 
down so you'd want to put that in mind
to<00:01:14.400> make<00:01:14.580> those<00:01:14.760> pauses<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.299> bit<00:01:15.689> smaller<00:01:16.080> and

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
to make those pauses a bit smaller and

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.950 
to make those pauses a bit smaller and
when<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.340> when<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.119> want<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.479> hit<00:01:18.600> those<00:01:18.750> back

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
when you when you want to hit those back

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.320 
when you when you want to hit those back
x<00:01:19.170> squared<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.710> when<00:01:20.009> your<00:01:20.189> opponent<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.729> mid

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
x squared is when your opponent is mid

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.010 
x squared is when your opponent is mid
level<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.689> baraka<00:01:22.580> so<00:01:23.580> i<00:01:24.000> see<00:01:24.420> there<00:01:24.600> i<00:01:24.630> did<00:01:24.900> it

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
level of baraka so i see there i did it

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.109 
level of baraka so i see there i did it
at<00:01:25.229> hip<00:01:25.530> level<00:01:25.670> whichever<00:01:26.670> one<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:27.000> prefer

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
at hip level whichever one you prefer

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.940 
at hip level whichever one you prefer
but<00:01:27.960> anyways<00:01:28.350> we're<00:01:28.530> going<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.710> add<00:01:28.799> another

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
but anyways we're going to add another

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.630 
but anyways we're going to add another
pause<00:01:29.430> square<00:01:30.030> triangle<00:01:30.299> square<00:01:31.070> so<00:01:32.070> pretty

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
pause square triangle square so pretty

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.770 
pause square triangle square so pretty
much<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.909> only<00:01:32.939> difference<00:01:33.360> with<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.600> less

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
much the only difference with that less

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.390 
much the only difference with that less
