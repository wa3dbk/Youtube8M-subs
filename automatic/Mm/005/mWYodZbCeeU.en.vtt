00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
it's not going to make sure that the

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.219 
it's not going to make sure that the
washer<00:01:58.520> is<00:01:58.759> next<00:01:59.299> to<00:01:59.450> the<00:01:59.570> knot<00:01:59.750> in<00:01:59.990> this

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
washer is next to the knot in this

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.499 
washer is next to the knot in this
sponge<00:02:00.590> is<00:02:00.890> on<00:02:01.549> the<00:02:01.670> bottom<00:02:02.030> and<00:02:02.179> what<00:02:02.299> that

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
sponge is on the bottom and what that

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.660 
sponge is on the bottom and what that
does<00:02:02.750> is<00:02:03.140> that<00:02:03.320> prevents<00:02:03.830> the<00:02:04.009> wax<00:02:04.250> from

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
does is that prevents the wax from

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.380 
does is that prevents the wax from
leaking<00:02:05.060> out<00:02:05.179> of<00:02:05.330> the<00:02:05.420> bottom<00:02:05.720> of<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:05.840> hole

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
leaking out of the bottom of the hole

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.120 
leaking out of the bottom of the hole
and<00:02:08.390> you<00:02:08.509> just<00:02:08.690> stick<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.319> week<00:02:09.500> to<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:09.950> hole

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
and you just stick the week to the hole

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.460 
and you just stick the week to the hole
like<00:02:10.489> this<00:02:10.599> and<00:02:11.599> it's<00:02:11.810> going<00:02:11.930> to<00:02:11.989> come<00:02:12.170> out<00:02:12.290> the

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
like this and it's going to come out the

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.270 
like this and it's going to come out the
other<00:02:12.620> side

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
other side

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.990 
other side
all<00:02:13.970> that<00:02:14.360> voila<00:02:15.350> and<00:02:16.220> then<00:02:16.519> you're<00:02:16.819> going<00:02:16.940> to

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
all that voila and then you're going to

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.610 
all that voila and then you're going to
take<00:02:17.209> this<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:17.870> you're<00:02:18.049> going<00:02:18.200> to<00:02:18.290> use<00:02:18.440> the

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
take this and you're going to use the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.059 
take this and you're going to use the
center<00:02:19.040> hole<00:02:19.299> to<00:02:20.299> stick<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:21.470> wick<00:02:21.680> through

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
center hole to stick the wick through

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.539 
center hole to stick the wick through
like<00:02:22.519> that<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:23.980> then<00:02:24.980> you<00:02:25.069> want<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.340> pull<00:02:25.519> it

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
like that and then you want to pull it

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.479 
like that and then you want to pull it
really<00:02:26.269> tight<00:02:26.540> as<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:27.380> possibly<00:02:27.410> can<00:02:28.100> and

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
really tight as you possibly can and

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.520 
really tight as you possibly can and
then<00:02:29.060> you<00:02:29.180> bring<00:02:29.450> it<00:02:29.600> over<00:02:29.660> to<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:30.019> side<00:02:30.260> like

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
then you bring it over to the side like

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.309 
then you bring it over to the side like
that<00:02:32.110> wrap<00:02:33.110> it<00:02:33.350> around<00:02:33.440> if<00:02:33.830> you<00:02:35.019> step<00:02:36.019> three

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
that wrap it around if you step three

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.890 
that wrap it around if you step three
add<00:02:36.530> wax<00:02:37.100> chips<00:02:37.549> you<00:02:38.360> want<00:02:38.510> to<00:02:38.599> seek<00:02:38.750> these

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
add wax chips you want to seek these

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.620 
add wax chips you want to seek these
chips<00:02:39.340> then<00:02:40.340> you<00:02:40.430> want<00:02:40.580> to<00:02:40.670> break<00:02:40.819> them<00:02:40.940> up<00:02:41.120> and

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
chips then you want to break them up and

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.390 
chips then you want to break them up and
put<00:02:41.870> them<00:02:41.959> in<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.230> pillar<00:02:42.440> candles<00:02:42.920> what<00:02:43.190> this

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
put them in the pillar candles what this

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.099 
put them in the pillar candles what this
does<00:02:43.670> is<00:02:43.880> it's<00:02:44.090> going<00:02:44.299> to<00:02:44.390> make<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.690> candles

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
does is it's going to make the candles

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.440 
does is it's going to make the candles
cold<00:02:45.380> faster<00:02:45.890> when<00:02:46.310> wax<00:02:46.579> cools<00:02:47.000> it<00:02:47.420> shrinks

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
cold faster when wax cools it shrinks

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.380 
cold faster when wax cools it shrinks
this<00:02:48.380> prevents<00:02:48.829> shrinkage<00:02:49.640> it's<00:02:50.000> going<00:02:50.209> to<00:02:50.269> go

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
this prevents shrinkage it's going to go

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.670 
this prevents shrinkage it's going to go
down<00:02:50.660> in<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:50.959> middle<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:51.290> you<00:02:51.350> don't<00:02:51.530> want

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
down in the middle and you don't want

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.289 
down in the middle and you don't want
that<00:02:51.799> and<00:02:52.070> the<00:02:52.250> chips<00:02:52.519> look<00:02:52.670> pretty<00:02:52.910> they<00:02:53.090> put

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
that and the chips look pretty they put

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.030 
that and the chips look pretty they put
a<00:02:53.329> little<00:02:53.570> especially<00:02:53.959> when<00:02:54.290> you<00:02:54.440> can<00:02:54.620> do<00:02:54.769> any

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
a little especially when you can do any

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.220

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
color I like it and do white it gives it

like a little under globe if you have a

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.490 
like a little under globe if you have a

that<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:43.040> chips<00:03:43.459> the<00:03:43.849> color<00:03:44.060> is<00:03:44.360> all<00:03:44.599> blended

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
that the chips the color is all blended

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.509 
that the chips the color is all blended
step<00:03:45.950> 5

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
step 5

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.539 
step 5
pour<00:03:46.730> the<00:03:46.879> wax<00:03:47.049> just<00:03:48.049> let<00:03:48.290> it<00:03:48.440> sit<00:03:48.680> but<00:03:48.890> what

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
pour the wax just let it sit but what

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.490 
pour the wax just let it sit but what
happens<00:03:49.819> candles<00:03:50.360> is<00:03:50.510> they<00:03:50.660> do<00:03:50.840> shrink<00:03:51.079> and

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
happens candles is they do shrink and

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.960 
happens candles is they do shrink and
though<00:03:51.829> they'll<00:03:52.370> kind<00:03:52.610> of<00:03:52.670> create<00:03:52.910> a<00:03:52.940> little

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
though they'll kind of create a little

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.819 
though they'll kind of create a little
divot<00:03:53.420> so<00:03:53.599> you<00:03:53.690> can<00:03:53.870> keep<00:03:54.079> filling<00:03:54.470> it<00:03:54.650> up<00:03:54.769> with

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
divot so you can keep filling it up with

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.680 
divot so you can keep filling it up with
more<00:03:55.190> wax<00:03:55.459> do<00:03:55.819> when<00:03:55.970> that<00:03:56.090> happens

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
more wax do when that happens

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.309 
more wax do when that happens
step<00:03:57.470> 6<00:03:57.980> remove<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:58.670> mold<00:03:58.880> this<00:03:59.480> is<00:03:59.540> actually

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
step 6 remove the mold this is actually

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.770 
step 6 remove the mold this is actually
the<00:04:00.470> top<00:04:00.650> of<00:04:00.920> your<00:04:01.010> candles<00:04:01.489> bottom<00:04:01.910> and<00:04:02.660> this

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
the top of your candles bottom and this

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.750 
the top of your candles bottom and this
is<00:04:02.930> actually<00:04:03.349> the<00:04:03.470> bottom<00:04:03.680> it's<00:04:04.250> actually

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
is actually the bottom it's actually

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.420 
is actually the bottom it's actually
better<00:04:05.090> to<00:04:05.269> cut<00:04:05.720> the<00:04:05.870> wick<00:04:06.140> before<00:04:06.739> the<00:04:06.890> wax<00:04:07.160> is

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
better to cut the wick before the wax is

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.220 
better to cut the wick before the wax is
completely<00:04:08.030> solidified<00:04:08.299> because<00:04:09.019> then<00:04:09.140> you

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
completely solidified because then you

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.630 
completely solidified because then you
can<00:04:09.379> actually<00:04:09.530> stick<00:04:09.950> the<00:04:10.099> scissors<00:04:10.459> and<00:04:10.489> the

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
can actually stick the scissors and the

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.000 
can actually stick the scissors and the
wax<00:04:10.879> in<00:04:11.150> the<00:04:11.239> wick<00:04:11.450> is<00:04:11.870> hidden<00:04:12.260> underneath<00:04:12.560> the

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
wax in the wick is hidden underneath the

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.220 
wax in the wick is hidden underneath the
wax<00:04:13.220> so<00:04:13.489> it<00:04:13.579> makes<00:04:13.760> a<00:04:13.879> flatter<00:04:14.269> bottom<00:04:14.750> this<00:04:15.019> is

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
wax so it makes a flatter bottom this is

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.960 
wax so it makes a flatter bottom this is
your<00:04:15.470> wick<00:04:15.680> that<00:04:16.070> you're<00:04:16.250> gonna<00:04:16.400> light<00:04:16.699> the

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
your wick that you're gonna light the

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:17.979 
your wick that you're gonna light the
way<00:04:17.090> so<00:04:17.150> you<00:04:17.299> don't<00:04:17.419> want<00:04:17.539> to<00:04:17.600> cut<00:04:17.750> too<00:04:17.959> much

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
way so you don't want to cut too much

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.050 
way so you don't want to cut too much
you<00:04:18.590> want<00:04:18.799> to<00:04:18.889> really<00:04:19.190> cut<00:04:19.459> on<00:04:19.669> the<00:04:19.880> knot

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
you want to really cut on the knot

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.120 
you want to really cut on the knot
around<00:04:20.660> a<00:04:21.139> little<00:04:21.530> bit<00:04:21.739> and<00:04:21.919> then<00:04:22.010> you<00:04:22.100> can

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
around a little bit and then you can

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.250 
around a little bit and then you can
always<00:04:22.460> trim<00:04:22.910> it<00:04:22.970> a<00:04:23.120> little<00:04:23.150> more<00:04:23.510> later<00:04:23.780> so

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
always trim it a little more later so

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.070 
always trim it a little more later so
you're<00:04:24.410> ready<00:04:24.770> for<00:04:25.160> the<00:04:25.220> other<00:04:25.340> daily<00:04:25.850> one<00:04:26.270> two

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:30.319 
three of the moon

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:47.129 
three of the moon
bad<00:04:31.639> done
