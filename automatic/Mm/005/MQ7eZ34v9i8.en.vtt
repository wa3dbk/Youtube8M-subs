just made quickly in max also contains a
globe<00:00:24.220> all<00:00:24.429> that<00:00:24.820> I'll<00:00:24.939> be<00:00:25.089> doing<00:00:25.390> for<00:00:25.599> like

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:25.749 
globe all that I'll be doing for like

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:29.609 
globe all that I'll be doing for like
little<00:00:26.939> like<00:00:27.939> embers<00:00:28.359> coming<00:00:28.630> off<00:00:28.960> the<00:00:29.380> fire

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
little like embers coming off the fire

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.760 
little like embers coming off the fire
and<00:00:29.859> also<00:00:30.609> a<00:00:30.640> cloud<00:00:31.230> texture<00:00:32.230> which<00:00:32.439> I<00:00:32.560> made

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
and also a cloud texture which I made

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.550 
and also a cloud texture which I made
also<00:00:33.480> ok<00:00:34.480> so<00:00:34.540> first<00:00:35.079> of<00:00:35.230> all<00:00:35.290> we're<00:00:35.410> going<00:00:35.500> to

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:35.560 
also ok so first of all we're going to

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.530 
also ok so first of all we're going to
make<00:00:35.710> our<00:00:35.860> materials<00:00:36.370> so<00:00:36.610> right-click<00:00:37.000> on<00:00:37.360> the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
make our materials so right-click on the

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.180 
make our materials so right-click on the
cloud<00:00:37.720> for<00:00:37.990> example<00:00:38.020> and<00:00:38.560> go<00:00:39.430> to<00:00:41.160> create<00:00:42.160> new

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
cloud for example and go to create new

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.240 
cloud for example and go to create new
material<00:00:42.850> and<00:00:43.600> I'm<00:00:44.530> going<00:00:44.680> to<00:00:44.710> give<00:00:44.920> it<00:00:45.040> in<00:00:45.190> a

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
material and I'm going to give it in a

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:52.760 
material and I'm going to give it in a
group<00:00:45.490> called<00:00:45.880> materials<00:00:49.950> hit<00:00:50.950> OK

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
group called materials hit OK

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.800 
group called materials hit OK
and<00:00:53.770> we<00:00:54.130> go<00:00:54.310> back<00:00:54.340> to<00:00:54.490> textures<00:00:55.000> right<00:00:55.570> click

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.810 
and we go back to textures right click

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.580 
and we go back to textures right click
on<00:00:55.990> globe<00:00:56.290> all<00:00:56.940> create<00:00:57.940> new<00:00:58.060> material<00:00:58.600> put

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
on globe all create new material put

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:06.480 
on globe all create new material put
that<00:00:59.770> materials<00:01:00.460> also<00:01:01.800> ok<00:01:05.159> going<00:01:06.159> to<00:01:06.369> the

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
that materials also ok going to the

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.440 
that materials also ok going to the
cloud<00:01:06.759> now<00:01:08.490> over<00:01:09.490> on<00:01:09.580> this<00:01:09.700> side<00:01:09.760> you<00:01:10.300> have

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
cloud now over on this side you have

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.380 
cloud now over on this side you have
your<00:01:10.480> viewport<00:01:11.350> of<00:01:11.500> the<00:01:12.070> material<00:01:12.580> this<00:01:13.120> is

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
your viewport of the material this is

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.060 
your viewport of the material this is
where<00:01:13.600> you'll<00:01:13.840> be<00:01:13.870> placing<00:01:14.230> all<00:01:14.590> your<00:01:14.770> nodes

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
where you'll be placing all your nodes

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.370 
where you'll be placing all your nodes
and<00:01:15.280> hooking<00:01:15.580> them<00:01:15.730> all<00:01:15.820> together<00:01:16.000> and<00:01:16.510> right

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
and hooking them all together and right

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.190 
and hooking them all together and right
here<00:01:17.680> is<00:01:17.830> the<00:01:18.159> nodes<00:01:18.580> that<00:01:19.030> you<00:01:19.420> can<00:01:19.630> select<00:01:19.930> to

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
here is the nodes that you can select to

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:32.679 
here is the nodes that you can select to
add<00:01:20.770> to<00:01:21.250> your<00:01:21.900> material<00:01:22.900> also

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.980 

right<00:01:33.259> here<00:01:33.469> is<00:01:33.679> the<00:01:33.979> source<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:36.399> this<00:01:37.399> is<00:01:37.990> how

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
right here is the source and this is how

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.779 
right here is the source and this is how
you<00:01:39.049> be<00:01:39.259> setting<00:01:39.499> the<00:01:39.590> values<00:01:39.950> down<00:01:40.189> here<00:01:40.659> so

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
you be setting the values down here so

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:45.279 
you be setting the values down here so
what<00:01:43.789> you<00:01:43.909> can<00:01:44.060> do<00:01:44.179> is<00:01:44.299> if<00:01:44.420> you<00:01:44.450> left<00:01:44.840> click<00:01:44.990> on

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
what you can do is if you left click on

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.499 
what you can do is if you left click on
the<00:01:45.829> texture<00:01:46.340> if<00:01:46.640> you<00:01:46.729> want<00:01:47.000> to<00:01:47.060> move<00:01:47.179> it<00:01:47.359> you

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
the texture if you want to move it you

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.569 
the texture if you want to move it you
hit<00:01:47.659> control<00:01:48.170> hold<00:01:49.009> down<00:01:49.189> the<00:01:49.310> left<00:01:49.399> mouse

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
hit control hold down the left mouse

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.559 
hit control hold down the left mouse
button<00:01:49.729> and<00:01:50.090> move<00:01:50.149> it<00:01:50.329> out<00:01:50.450> of<00:01:50.479> the<00:01:50.780> way<00:01:52.270> so<00:01:53.270> for

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:53.569 
button and move it out of the way so for

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:55.779 
button and move it out of the way so for
this<00:01:53.689> we're<00:01:54.020> gonna<00:01:54.140> need<00:01:54.289> a<00:01:54.740> constant<00:01:55.549> a

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
this we're gonna need a constant a

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.580 
this we're gonna need a constant a
constant<00:01:56.240> is<00:01:57.049> a<00:01:57.590> value<00:01:58.520> between<00:01:58.959> zero<00:01:59.959> and<00:02:00.079> one

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
constant is a value between zero and one

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.639 
constant is a value between zero and one
zero<00:02:00.859> is<00:02:01.369> black<00:02:01.609> one<00:02:02.000> is<00:02:02.179> white<00:02:02.450> we're<00:02:03.439> also

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
zero is black one is white we're also

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:09.009 
zero is black one is white we're also
going<00:02:03.920> to<00:02:03.979> be<00:02:04.130> needing<00:02:04.490> a<00:02:04.700> vertex<00:02:05.329> color<00:02:08.019> which

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
going to be needing a vertex color which

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.770 
going to be needing a vertex color which
is<00:02:09.200> good<00:02:09.440> for<00:02:10.090> particles<00:02:11.090> because<00:02:11.480> it<00:02:11.599> allows

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
is good for particles because it allows

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.900 
is good for particles because it allows
you<00:02:12.049> to<00:02:12.290> control<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.680> color<00:02:13.010> of<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.670> material

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
you to control the color of the material

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.020 
you to control the color of the material
through<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.569> particle<00:02:14.959> system<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:16.700> we<00:02:17.000> also

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
through the particle system and we also

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.619 
through the particle system and we also
are<00:02:17.599> going<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:17.870> need<00:02:17.989> a<00:02:18.470> multiply<00:02:19.360> multiply<00:02:20.360> if

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
are going to need a multiply multiply if

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.000 
are going to need a multiply multiply if
you<00:02:20.750> think<00:02:20.959> about<00:02:21.170> it<00:02:21.379> it's<00:02:21.530> kind<00:02:21.769> of<00:02:21.829> like<00:02:21.980> a

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
you think about it it's kind of like a

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.240 
you think about it it's kind of like a
layer<00:02:22.489> in<00:02:22.730> Photoshop<00:02:23.799> so<00:02:24.799> I'm<00:02:24.859> gonna<00:02:25.010> grab<00:02:25.220> one

constant<00:02:44.510> first<00:02:44.750> and<00:02:45.200> I'll<00:02:45.620> make<00:02:45.769> it<00:02:45.920> white

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
constant first and I'll make it white

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.979 
constant first and I'll make it white
like<00:02:47.690> that<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:49.340> I'm<00:02:49.910> going<00:02:50.120> to<00:02:50.329> grab<00:02:50.690> this

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
like that and I'm going to grab this

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.930 
like that and I'm going to grab this
black<00:02:51.290> channel<00:02:52.040> right<00:02:52.310> here<00:02:52.489> which<00:02:52.669> is<00:02:52.700> the

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
black channel right here which is the

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.830 
black channel right here which is the
main<00:02:53.090> Channel<00:02:53.510> and<00:02:54.109> put<00:02:54.319> it<00:02:54.380> into<00:02:54.530> a<00:02:55.599> B<00:02:56.599> is

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
main Channel and put it into a B is

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.379 
main Channel and put it into a B is
gonna<00:02:57.079> be<00:02:57.319> into<00:02:57.709> the<00:02:57.829> constant<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:58.609> if<00:02:59.299> you

00:02:59.379 --> 00:02:59.389 
gonna be into the constant and if you

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:01.030 
gonna be into the constant and if you
click<00:02:59.569> little<00:02:59.840> box<00:03:00.079> up<00:03:00.260> here<00:03:00.380> you<00:03:00.500> can<00:03:00.680> see<00:03:00.919> at

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
click little box up here you can see at

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.520 
click little box up here you can see at
the<00:03:01.220> result<00:03:03.459> this<00:03:04.459> the<00:03:05.260> output<00:03:06.260> of<00:03:06.290> this<00:03:06.470> is

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
the result this the output of this is

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.150 
the result this the output of this is
going<00:03:06.859> to<00:03:06.980> a<00:03:07.130> and<00:03:07.989> then<00:03:08.989> B<00:03:09.019> is<00:03:09.500> going<00:03:09.709> into<00:03:10.069> the

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
going to a and then B is going into the

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.370 
going to a and then B is going into the
vertex<00:03:10.609> color<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:11.269> main<00:03:12.049> channel<00:03:12.349> and<00:03:14.380> click

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
vertex color the main channel and click

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.830 
vertex color the main channel and click
that<00:03:15.530> so<00:03:15.680> you<00:03:15.739> can<00:03:15.889> see<00:03:16.099> it<00:03:16.250> and<00:03:16.480> then<00:03:17.480> this<00:03:17.660> is

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
that so you can see it and then this is

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.690 
that so you can see it and then this is
going<00:03:18.109> into<00:03:18.380> emissive<00:03:18.829> because<00:03:19.459> it's<00:03:19.639> a

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
going into emissive because it's a

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.750 
going into emissive because it's a
particle<00:03:20.030> system<00:03:20.299> the<00:03:20.930> particles<00:03:21.380> don't<00:03:21.760> show

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
particle system the particles don't show

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.900 
particle system the particles don't show
diffuse<00:03:23.269> so<00:03:24.049> it's<00:03:24.769> emissive<00:03:25.190> it'll<00:03:25.400> be<00:03:25.489> unlit

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
diffuse so it's emissive it'll be unlit

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.240 
diffuse so it's emissive it'll be unlit
so<00:03:26.419> we<00:03:26.739> and<00:03:28.239> then<00:03:29.239> we're<00:03:30.169> gonna<00:03:30.290> go<00:03:30.560> select<00:03:31.040> the

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
so we and then we're gonna go select the

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.240 
so we and then we're gonna go select the
red<00:03:31.819> Channel<00:03:32.769> actually<00:03:33.769> we'll<00:03:33.919> select<00:03:34.040> the

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
red Channel actually we'll select the

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.250 
red Channel actually we'll select the
white<00:03:34.400> Channel<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:34.849> Alpha<00:03:35.060> Channel<00:03:35.359> and<00:03:36.049> put

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
white Channel the Alpha Channel and put

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.650 
white Channel the Alpha Channel and put
it<00:03:36.349> into<00:03:36.500> a<00:03:36.739> and<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.819> Alpha<00:03:38.060> Channel<00:03:38.389> on<00:03:38.540> the

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
it into a and the Alpha Channel on the

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.409 
it into a and the Alpha Channel on the
vertex<00:03:38.989> color<00:03:39.290> will<00:03:39.709> go<00:03:39.859> into<00:03:40.010> B<00:03:40.280> and<00:03:40.489> hit<00:03:41.239> the

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:41.419 
vertex color will go into B and hit the

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:43.090 
vertex color will go into B and hit the
little<00:03:41.570> button<00:03:41.959> so<00:03:42.259> you<00:03:42.320> can<00:03:42.380> see<00:03:42.680> what<00:03:42.859> the

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
little button so you can see what the

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.979 
little button so you can see what the
Alpha<00:03:43.400> Channel<00:03:43.669> looks<00:03:43.759> like<00:03:44.000> and<00:03:44.239> that's

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
Alpha Channel looks like and that's

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.940 
Alpha Channel looks like and that's
going<00:03:45.169> to<00:03:45.229> go<00:03:45.410> into<00:03:45.709> a<00:03:45.739> pass

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
going to go into a pass

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.490 
going to go into a pass
now<00:03:47.950> we<00:03:48.070> do<00:03:48.310> now<00:03:48.490> is<00:03:48.900> select<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:50.170> preview

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
now we do now is select the preview

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.520 
now we do now is select the preview
material<00:03:51.040> right<00:03:51.190> here<00:03:51.720> and<00:03:52.720> go<00:03:52.900> to<00:03:52.960> opacity

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
material right here and go to opacity

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
material right here and go to opacity
and<00:03:53.710> go<00:03:53.830> to<00:03:53.890> additive<00:03:55.800> and<00:03:56.800> we<00:03:57.160> want<00:03:57.340> to<00:03:57.430> make

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
and go to additive and we want to make

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.790 
and go to additive and we want to make
sure<00:03:57.580> this<00:03:58.240> for<00:03:58.960> particles<00:03:59.380> it's<00:03:59.590> set<00:03:59.770> to

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
sure this for particles it's set to

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.030 
sure this for particles it's set to
unlit<00:04:00.340> and<00:04:01.110> we<00:04:02.110> hit<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.350> little<00:04:02.470> green<00:04:02.740> box

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
unlit and we hit the little green box

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.150 
unlit and we hit the little green box
check<00:04:03.880> box<00:04:04.090> and<00:04:04.390> that<00:04:04.990> is<00:04:05.050> saved<00:04:05.410> the<00:04:05.680> that

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
check box and that is saved the that

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.130 
check box and that is saved the that
texture<00:04:06.580> for<00:04:06.760> that<00:04:07.180> material<00:04:07.330> for<00:04:07.720> us<00:04:07.750> so<00:04:08.050> we

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
texture for that material for us so we

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.880 
texture for that material for us so we
can<00:04:08.230> close<00:04:08.350> it<00:04:08.530> down<00:04:10.230> open<00:04:11.230> up<00:04:11.470> the<00:04:11.560> next<00:04:11.740> one

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
doesn't have an alpha Channel so we're

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.550 
doesn't have an alpha Channel so we're
gonna<00:04:57.520> go<00:04:57.730> blue<00:04:58.000> there<00:04:58.870> we<00:04:58.960> go
