00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
elastin from this side so that the plate

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.900 
elastin from this side so that the plate
presence<00:02:49.850> of<00:02:50.090> those<00:02:50.750> finished<00:02:51.520> cowboy<00:02:52.520> steaks

is<00:02:54.100> completely<00:02:55.210> appetizing<00:02:56.560> okay<00:02:57.560> so<00:02:58.370> once<00:02:58.490> we

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
is completely appetizing okay so once we

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.010 
is completely appetizing okay so once we
get<00:02:58.730> that<00:02:58.910> trimmed<00:02:59.210> down<00:02:59.300> and<00:02:59.630> you<00:02:59.690> see<00:02:59.870> there

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
get that trimmed down and you see there

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.110 
get that trimmed down and you see there
really<00:03:00.170> isn't<00:03:00.410> that<00:03:00.590> much<00:03:00.770> trim<00:03:01.370> loss<00:03:01.580> on<00:03:02.060> a

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
really isn't that much trim loss on a

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.240 
really isn't that much trim loss on a
mistake<00:03:02.989> like<00:03:03.200> this<00:03:03.440> a<00:03:03.650> lot<00:03:03.830> of<00:03:03.980> this<00:03:04.070> you'd

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
mistake like this a lot of this you'd

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.650 
mistake like this a lot of this you'd
have<00:03:04.280> to<00:03:04.520> be<00:03:04.640> trimming<00:03:05.000> off<00:03:05.120> whether<00:03:05.360> it<00:03:05.540> would

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
have to be trimming off whether it would

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.470 
have to be trimming off whether it would
dry<00:03:05.900> aged<00:03:06.110> or<00:03:06.440> wet<00:03:06.680> aged<00:03:06.970> and<00:03:07.970> we're<00:03:08.090> gonna<00:03:08.180> get

dry aged or wet aged and we're gonna get

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.890 
dry aged or wet aged and we're gonna get
in<00:03:08.630> here<00:03:08.870> between<00:03:09.050> these<00:03:09.650> bones<00:03:10.160> then<00:03:10.900> when

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
in here between these bones then when

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.000 
in here between these bones then when
cut<00:03:12.230> out<00:03:12.410> our<00:03:12.590> five<00:03:13.600> cowboy<00:03:14.600> steaks<00:03:14.989> if<00:03:15.860> you

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
that it's about half the thickness of

that it's about half the thickness of
these<00:03:22.310> steaks<00:03:22.640> because<00:03:22.850> they<00:03:23.720> run<00:03:23.930> each<00:03:23.959> of

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
these steaks because they run each of

if you're dry aging a bone-in rib at
home<00:03:31.700> you're<00:03:32.239> obviously<00:03:32.390> not<00:03:32.810> going<00:03:33.019> to<00:03:33.080> be

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
home you're obviously not going to be

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.479 
home you're obviously not going to be
able<00:03:33.230> to<00:03:33.380> cut<00:03:33.560> those<00:03:33.739> apart<00:03:34.130> so<00:03:34.280> you're<00:03:34.400> gonna

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
able to cut those apart so you're gonna

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.630 
able to cut those apart so you're gonna
end<00:03:34.730> up<00:03:34.880> with<00:03:35.600> some<00:03:35.870> really<00:03:36.640> significantly

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
demonstrate in just a second there we go

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.950 
demonstrate in just a second there we go
yeah<00:03:55.890> pretty<00:03:56.340> easily<00:03:56.610> for<00:03:57.030> finger<00:03:57.390> steaks<00:03:57.690> I'd

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
yeah pretty easily for finger steaks I'd

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.560 
yeah pretty easily for finger steaks I'd
say<00:03:59.000> and<00:04:00.000> so<00:04:00.750> this<00:04:00.900> gives<00:04:01.170> us<00:04:01.700> five<00:04:02.700> cowboy

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570
