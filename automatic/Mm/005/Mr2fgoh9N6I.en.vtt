different time but for these assault

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.580 
different time but for these assault
rifles<00:01:42.100> submachine<00:01:42.280> guns<00:01:42.910> and<00:01:43.300> stuff<00:01:43.590> you

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
rifles submachine guns and stuff you

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.230 
rifles submachine guns and stuff you
will<00:01:44.740> be<00:01:44.950> using<00:01:45.160> quick<00:01:45.580> draw<00:01:45.790> on<00:01:45.850> red<00:01:46.090> dot

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
will be using quick draw on red dot

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.810 
will be using quick draw on red dot
sight<00:01:46.510> and<00:01:46.720> what<00:01:47.350> these<00:01:47.530> would<00:01:47.740> do<00:01:47.950> is<00:01:48.220> you

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
sight and what these would do is you

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.730 
sight and what these would do is you
could<00:01:48.970> start<00:01:49.450> by<00:01:49.570> aiming<00:01:49.930> at<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.050> body<00:01:50.440> and

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
could start by aiming at the body and

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.270 
could start by aiming at the body and
moving<00:01:51.610> up<00:01:51.820> now<00:01:52.810> if<00:01:53.080> that's<00:01:53.110> not<00:01:53.530> working<00:01:53.860> for

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
moving up now if that's not working for

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.780 
moving up now if that's not working for
you<00:01:54.460> another<00:01:55.360> really<00:01:55.870> really<00:01:56.410> good<00:01:56.590> way<00:01:56.800> is<00:01:57.100> to

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
you another really really good way is to

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.920 
you another really really good way is to
do<00:01:57.940> a<00:01:58.270> laser<00:01:59.130> laser<00:02:00.130> sight<00:02:00.510> or<00:02:01.510> whatever<00:02:01.780> it's

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
do a laser laser sight or whatever it's

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.430 
do a laser laser sight or whatever it's
called<00:02:01.990> laser<00:02:02.530> whatever<00:02:03.070> and<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:05.020> will<00:02:05.170> help

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
called laser whatever and that will help

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.300 
called laser whatever and that will help
you<00:02:05.680> have<00:02:05.920> a<00:02:05.950> tiny<00:02:06.400> little<00:02:07.800> where<00:02:08.800> you<00:02:08.890> can<00:02:09.040> aim

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
you have a tiny little where you can aim

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.010 
you have a tiny little where you can aim
down<00:02:09.580> that<00:02:09.880> are<00:02:10.060> not<00:02:10.330> aimed<00:02:10.540> down<00:02:10.750> where<00:02:10.929> you

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
down that are not aimed down where you

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.380 
down that are not aimed down where you
can<00:02:11.140> hit<00:02:11.290> fire<00:02:11.560> you<00:02:12.310> just<00:02:12.490> hit<00:02:12.700> our<00:02:12.880> aim<00:02:13.120> at<00:02:13.270> the

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
can hit fire you just hit our aim at the

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.940 
can hit fire you just hit our aim at the
head<00:02:13.600> it<00:02:13.720> sprays<00:02:14.110> everywhere<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:14.680> will<00:02:14.770> hit

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
head it sprays everywhere it will hit

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.150 
head it sprays everywhere it will hit
his<00:02:15.100> head<00:02:15.280> go<00:02:15.520> get<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.700> headshot<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.920> that<00:02:17.920> is

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
his head go get a headshot and that is

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.230 
his head go get a headshot and that is
probably<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.610> most<00:02:18.670> effective<00:02:19.420> way<00:02:19.720> but<00:02:21.240> I

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
probably the most effective way but I

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.680 
probably the most effective way but I
use<00:02:23.020> either<00:02:23.320> way<00:02:23.800> for<00:02:25.140> forgetting<00:02:26.140> gold<00:02:26.560> so

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
use either way for forgetting gold so
