00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:31.530
 Download these two files 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:39.660
 unzip and now these 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:51.840
 and copy the replacement in this folder run 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:53.710
 this file is launched client site 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.910
 developers choose this 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.949
 again we press everyone we see the list 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.079

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.650
 people it is a lot of people but 21 people 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:11.020

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:13.170
 gta can play up to 30 people see 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.590
 what happens next is now 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.380
 multipower at the program development stage 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.890
 where most people will also be possible 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:34.510
 stand up and watch and on the website of the series 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:36.640
 server allow 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:42.229
 select the folder with the game 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:44.510
 but I have already chosen error selection error 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.700
 because I have now installed a crack 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.800

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.210

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.020
 same in this 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:13.560

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:31.690
 by nature we need to remove 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:38.130
 who breathed two files so api and 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:40.840
 two of these 9 files are deleted and now 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:47.760
 We throw the files that were the 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.760
 files that will be in the archive replacement 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:58.510
