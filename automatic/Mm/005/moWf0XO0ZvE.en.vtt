00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
here is what it looks like it's very

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.229

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
pretty actually just as like a very

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.580 
pretty actually just as like a very
simple<00:03:31.630> like<00:03:31.780> if<00:03:31.900> you<00:03:32.019> didn't<00:03:32.290> want<00:03:32.440> to<00:03:32.500> wear

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
simple like if you didn't want to wear

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.960 
simple like if you didn't want to wear
any<00:03:32.739> makeup<00:03:32.769> that<00:03:33.160> day<00:03:33.340> but<00:03:33.400> typically<00:03:33.940> you

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
any makeup that day but typically you

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.180 
any makeup that day but typically you
use<00:03:34.329> this<00:03:34.540> to<00:03:35.170> enhance<00:03:35.709> the<00:03:35.890> color<00:03:36.070> of

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
use this to enhance the color of

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.610 
use this to enhance the color of
eyeshadow<00:03:36.910> and<00:03:37.239> help<00:03:37.930> make<00:03:38.110> it<00:03:38.230> last<00:03:38.380> longer

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
eyeshadow and help make it last longer

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
much to compare it by because this is

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.770
