00:00:02.013 --> 00:00:04.013
 Peace be upon you 

00:00:04.714 --> 00:00:06.714
 Today we operate a hidden pocket 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.820
 Sometimes we need a hidden pocket 

00:00:17.422 --> 00:00:19.422
 For example if we go to the market 

00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:28.233
 So that we do not open the bag every time 

00:00:41.573 --> 00:00:43.573
 Point out the height, height and pocket size 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.900
 So that our hand can easily enter 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.960
 On the hand 

00:01:00.534 --> 00:01:02.534
 Strengthen the place by hand or machine 

00:01:02.534 --> 00:01:03.034
 At the beginning and end 

00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.533
 Then we open the tailor 

00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:08.033
 We keep the edges 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.860
 Then we open the sewing place 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.380
 Or palm on one hand 

00:01:32.053 --> 00:01:34.053
 Then cut the pocket: 

00:01:52.853 --> 00:01:54.853
 Approximately 2/3 

00:01:58.114 --> 00:02:00.114
 Cut it down, because it will come down with a show 

00:02:07.154 --> 00:02:09.154
 from here : 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.760
 So 

00:02:17.354 --> 00:02:19.354
 Here I do a small arc 

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:22.473
 From here I proved him by sewing 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.960
 This is a pocket shape 

00:02:37.136 --> 00:02:39.136
 It becomes streamlined 

00:02:39.136 --> 00:02:39.860
 Put it on the cloth 

00:02:43.974 --> 00:02:45.974
 Consists of two pieces 

00:02:51.998 --> 00:02:53.998
 Its color resembles the color of the original cloth 

00:02:58.817 --> 00:03:00.817
 Of cloth waste 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.380
 for example 

00:03:15.213 --> 00:03:17.213
 Knit it 

00:03:21.893 --> 00:03:23.893
 Turn it over 

00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:35.881
 Bind it on two layers of cloth 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.380
 So 

00:03:54.895 --> 00:03:56.895
 Look at the cap that you made 

00:03:58.536 --> 00:04:00.536
 Open from both sides 

00:04:01.673 --> 00:04:03.673
 Folded and threaded 

00:04:12.813 --> 00:04:14.813
 Then put hand wool and liner destination 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.480
 If the two layers wool become thick 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.137
 From the front of the wool 

00:04:27.373 --> 00:04:29.373
 For they appear to the eye 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.600
 So 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.600
 From above, fix it on the garment 

00:04:43.713 --> 00:04:45.713
 It became a comfortable pocket 

00:04:45.713 --> 00:04:47.299
 To put stuff 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.500
 And to warm the hand
