00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
together use remote mounted antennas for

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.390 
together use remote mounted antennas for
more<00:00:40.540> reliable<00:00:40.839> performance<00:00:41.199> than<00:00:42.010> the<00:00:42.160> audio

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
more reliable performance than the audio

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.460 
more reliable performance than the audio
technica<00:00:42.640> 2000<00:00:43.570> is<00:00:43.690> definitely<00:00:44.199> the<00:00:44.320> way<00:00:44.440> to

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
technica 2000 is definitely the way to

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.310 
technica 2000 is definitely the way to
go<00:00:44.620> the<00:00:45.430> out<00:00:45.460> of<00:00:45.640> Technica<00:00:46.059> 2000<00:00:46.690> has<00:00:46.839> a<00:00:46.870> metal

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
go the out of Technica 2000 has a metal

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.799 
go the out of Technica 2000 has a metal
case<00:00:47.559> it<00:00:48.369> does<00:00:48.580> not<00:00:48.610> have<00:00:48.940> a<00:00:48.970> plastic<00:00:49.510> case<00:00:49.659> so

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
case it does not have a plastic case so

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:51.149 
case it does not have a plastic case so
the<00:00:49.900> metal<00:00:50.170> case<00:00:50.409> gives<00:00:50.710> you<00:00:50.830> a<00:00:50.860> better

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.159 
the metal case gives you a better

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:53.880 
the metal case gives you a better
protection<00:00:51.460> it's<00:00:52.269> a<00:00:52.360> better<00:00:52.570> product<00:00:52.989> and<00:00:53.379> its

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
protection it's a better product and its

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.859 
protection it's a better product and its
rack<00:00:54.159> mountable<00:00:54.640> so<00:00:55.119> you<00:00:55.210> can<00:00:55.420> take<00:00:55.629> two<00:00:55.839> of

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:55.869 
rack mountable so you can take two of

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:57.119 
rack mountable so you can take two of
these<00:00:56.049> and<00:00:56.350> put<00:00:56.470> them<00:00:56.619> together

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
these and put them together

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:59.270 
these and put them together
another<00:00:57.940> critical<00:00:58.390> factors<00:00:58.839> it<00:00:59.019> has

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
another critical factors it has

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.520 
another critical factors it has
removable<00:01:00.280> antennas<00:01:01.030> on<00:01:01.390> a<00:01:01.449> nice<00:01:01.720> BNC

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
removable antennas on a nice BNC

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.649 
removable antennas on a nice BNC
connector<00:01:03.129> it's<00:01:03.549> not<00:01:03.699> a<00:01:03.729> fixed<00:01:04.210> mount<00:01:04.449> or

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
connector it's not a fixed mount or

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.149 
connector it's not a fixed mount or
screwin<00:01:05.170> type<00:01:05.470> connection

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
screwin type connection

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.880 
screwin type connection
it's<00:01:06.790> a<00:01:06.939> BNC<00:01:07.299> so<00:01:07.930> if<00:01:08.049> you're<00:01:08.200> going<00:01:08.380> to<00:01:08.470> set<00:01:08.770> it

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
it's a BNC so if you're going to set it

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.530 
it's a BNC so if you're going to set it
up<00:01:08.979> you<00:01:09.130> know<00:01:09.220> you<00:01:09.310> start<00:01:09.670> out<00:01:09.790> just<00:01:10.150> set<00:01:10.360> it<00:01:10.450> on

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
up you know you start out just set it on

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.899 
up you know you start out just set it on
a<00:01:10.600> counter<00:01:11.110> or<00:01:11.320> that<00:01:11.530> it<00:01:11.950> works<00:01:12.220> great<00:01:12.520> but<00:01:12.790> if

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
a counter or that it works great but if

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.340 
a counter or that it works great but if
you're<00:01:13.030> going<00:01:13.180> to<00:01:13.330> rack<00:01:13.540> it<00:01:13.720> up<00:01:13.840> you<00:01:14.049> can't

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
you're going to rack it up you can't

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.590 
you're going to rack it up you can't
just<00:01:14.650> leave<00:01:14.890> these<00:01:15.130> antennas<00:01:15.729> in<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:16.420> rack

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
just leave these antennas in the rack

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.600 
just leave these antennas in the rack
you<00:01:16.900> have<00:01:17.110> to<00:01:17.259> remote<00:01:17.560> mount<00:01:17.860> them<00:01:18.130> so<00:01:18.400> here's

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
you have to remote mount them so here's

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:19.440 
you have to remote mount them so here's
how<00:01:18.759> you<00:01:18.790> do<00:01:19.060> that

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
how you do that

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.650 
how you do that
you<00:01:19.930> take<00:01:20.140> these<00:01:20.320> antennas<00:01:20.920> off<00:01:21.100> and<00:01:21.880> you

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
you take these antennas off and you

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.500 
you take these antennas off and you
connect<00:01:23.110> it<00:01:23.320> to<00:01:23.370> an<00:01:24.370> antenna<00:01:24.790> distribution

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
connect it to an antenna distribution

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.860 
connect it to an antenna distribution
and<00:01:25.630> fire<00:01:25.870> no<00:01:26.080> controls<00:01:26.560> on<00:01:26.770> the<00:01:26.920> front<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:28.780> go

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
and fire no controls on the front you go

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.690 
and fire no controls on the front you go
ahead<00:01:29.050> and<00:01:29.170> connect<00:01:29.500> up<00:01:29.650> to<00:01:29.680> four<00:01:30.070> receivers

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
ahead and connect up to four receivers

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.490 
ahead and connect up to four receivers
you<00:01:31.000> can<00:01:31.150> see<00:01:31.300> there's<00:01:31.540> two<00:01:31.720> connections<00:01:32.290> for

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
you can see there's two connections for

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.500 
you can see there's two connections for
each<00:01:32.590> receiver<00:01:33.100> here<00:01:33.400> one<00:01:33.670> two<00:01:33.880> three<00:01:34.180> four

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
each receiver here one two three four

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.930 
each receiver here one two three four
and<00:01:34.840> then<00:01:34.870> two<00:01:35.770> connections<00:01:36.310> for<00:01:36.550> your<00:01:36.670> remote

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
and then two connections for your remote

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.120 
and then two connections for your remote
mount<00:01:37.210> antennas<00:01:37.780> so<00:01:38.470> the<00:01:38.590> remote<00:01:38.920> mount

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
mount antennas so the remote mount

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.520 
mount antennas so the remote mount
antennas<00:01:39.610> you<00:01:39.790> simply<00:01:40.120> use<00:01:40.300> an<00:01:40.480> antenna<00:01:40.840> cable

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
antennas you simply use an antenna cable

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.830 
antennas you simply use an antenna cable
and<00:01:41.800> go<00:01:42.550> ahead<00:01:42.790> and<00:01:42.970> put<00:01:43.120> your<00:01:43.150> remote<00:01:43.600> mount

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
and go ahead and put your remote mount

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.560 
and go ahead and put your remote mount
antennas<00:01:44.350> further<00:01:44.740> away<00:01:45.100> out<00:01:45.370> and<00:01:45.790> up<00:01:46.180> so<00:01:46.450> they

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
antennas further away out and up so they

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.120 
antennas further away out and up so they
have<00:01:46.720> clear<00:01:47.080> line-of-sight<00:01:47.350> to<00:01:47.740> the

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
have clear line-of-sight to the

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.030 
have clear line-of-sight to the
transmitter<00:01:48.900> the<00:01:49.900> antennas<00:01:50.350> that<00:01:50.380> you'd<00:01:50.740> use

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
transmitter the antennas that you'd use

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.010 
transmitter the antennas that you'd use
for<00:01:51.070> that<00:01:51.430> are<00:01:51.700> over<00:01:51.909> here<00:01:52.180> will<00:01:52.540> walk<00:01:52.720> over

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
for that are over here will walk over

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.960 
for that are over here will walk over
this<00:01:53.170> way<00:01:53.229> and<00:01:53.620> you<00:01:53.710> can<00:01:53.890> see<00:01:54.130> we<00:01:54.850> have<00:01:54.940> a

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
this way and you can see we have a

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.990 
this way and you can see we have a
paddle<00:01:55.450> mount<00:01:55.630> antenna<00:01:56.110> for<00:01:56.979> high<00:01:57.220> gain<00:01:57.580> so<00:01:57.909> if

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
paddle mount antenna for high gain so if

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.789 
paddle mount antenna for high gain so if
I'm<00:01:58.090> at<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.360> back<00:01:58.600> of<00:01:58.810> an<00:01:58.900> auditorium<00:01:59.470> I<00:01:59.650> can

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
I'm at the back of an auditorium I can

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.560 
I'm at the back of an auditorium I can
aim<00:01:59.950> these<00:02:00.130> up<00:02:00.400> to<00:02:00.549> the<00:02:00.670> platform<00:02:01.180> we<00:02:01.360> have<00:02:01.479> an

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
aim these up to the platform we have an

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.870 
aim these up to the platform we have an
amplified<00:02:02.200> antenna<00:02:02.470> and<00:02:03.010> one<00:02:03.640> that<00:02:03.729> we<00:02:03.850> don't

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
amplified antenna and one that we don't

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.140 
amplified antenna and one that we don't
see<00:02:04.330> here<00:02:04.570> is<00:02:04.630> a<00:02:04.750> half<00:02:05.200> wave<00:02:05.560> antenna<00:02:06.040> which<00:02:06.820> is

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
see here is a half wave antenna which is

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.330 
see here is a half wave antenna which is
much<00:02:07.750> less<00:02:07.990> expensive<00:02:08.560> than<00:02:08.590> these<00:02:08.830> but<00:02:09.159> gives

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
much less expensive than these but gives

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.759 
much less expensive than these but gives
you<00:02:09.459> higher<00:02:09.700> gain<00:02:10.119> don't<00:02:10.989> let's<00:02:11.200> go<00:02:11.319> back<00:02:11.500> here

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
you higher gain don't let's go back here

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.350 
you higher gain don't let's go back here
you<00:02:11.830> don't<00:02:12.159> want<00:02:12.430> to<00:02:12.519> use<00:02:12.670> these<00:02:12.970> small

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
you don't want to use these small

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.570 
you don't want to use these small
quarter<00:02:14.230> wavelength<00:02:14.440> antennas<00:02:15.250> they<00:02:15.400> don't

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
quarter wavelength antennas they don't

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.220 
quarter wavelength antennas they don't
have<00:02:15.730> a<00:02:15.790> ground<00:02:16.120> plane<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.750> half<00:02:16.959> wave

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
have a ground plane the half wave

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.280 
have a ground plane the half wave
antenna<00:02:17.650> is<00:02:17.799> a<00:02:17.830> taller<00:02:18.220> antenna<00:02:18.819> and<00:02:19.269> so<00:02:19.870> go

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
antenna is a taller antenna and so go

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.229
