fiber<00:04:32.760> wick<00:04:32.970> to<00:04:33.120> me<00:04:33.300> but<00:04:33.660> of<00:04:33.810> course<00:04:34.050> it's<00:04:34.170> not

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
fair comparison as this is only $7.99 or

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.360 
fair comparison as this is only $7.99 or
actually<00:04:37.380> I<00:04:37.440> think<00:04:37.590> is<00:04:37.680> like<00:04:37.800> ten<00:04:38.010> dollars

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
actually I think is like ten dollars

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.940 
actually I think is like ten dollars
which<00:04:38.490> is<00:04:38.640> a<00:04:38.670> lot<00:04:38.910> of<00:04:38.940> money<00:04:39.560> and<00:04:40.560> then<00:04:40.770> juice

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
which is a lot of money and then juice

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.590 
which is a lot of money and then juice
almost<00:04:41.510> $23<00:04:42.510> so<00:04:43.550> it's<00:04:44.550> a<00:04:44.700> good<00:04:44.850> mascara<00:04:45.270> I<00:04:45.390> gave

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600

it's<00:04:56.370> Exxon<00:04:56.760> MacLean<00:04:57.710> extensions<00:04:58.710> this<00:04:59.130> one

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
it's Exxon MacLean extensions this one

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.270 
it's Exxon MacLean extensions this one
actually<00:05:00.780> does<00:05:01.350> the<00:05:01.410> same<00:05:01.620> thing<00:05:01.830> as<00:05:01.950> far<00:05:02.160> as

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
actually does the same thing as far as

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.920 
actually does the same thing as far as
giving<00:05:02.520> you<00:05:02.580> length<00:05:02.820> but<00:05:03.420> it<00:05:03.540> doesn't<00:05:03.780> have

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
giving you length but it doesn't have

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.360 
giving you length but it doesn't have
the<00:05:03.960> fiber<00:05:04.260> assignment<00:05:04.740> the<00:05:04.860> way<00:05:04.950> this<00:05:05.160> does

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
the fiber assignment the way this does

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.400 
the fiber assignment the way this does
so<00:05:05.970> it's<00:05:06.090> a<00:05:06.120> pretty<00:05:06.300> cool<00:05:06.510> concept<00:05:06.780> one<00:05:07.290> that

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
so it's a pretty cool concept one that

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.020 
so it's a pretty cool concept one that
takes<00:05:07.590> some<00:05:07.710> getting<00:05:07.920> used<00:05:08.100> to<00:05:08.220> but<00:05:08.670> I<00:05:08.910> do

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
takes some getting used to but I do

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.700 
takes some getting used to but I do
