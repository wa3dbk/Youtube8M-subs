 that is, above below we put under the foot under 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.090
 under the left foot is not under the right because 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:24.470
 it will not be necessary to put it like this 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:26.400

 one is not left and right door let's start with 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:11.840
 right position and and should be so 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:11.840

 we build these and we keep still very important 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.120
 it is very important that the hand does not lay on 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.540
 guitar is such an option so that it does not 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.700
 it was like this 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:48.080
 we have to imagine what we keep in 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:52.880
 hand apple usually i just 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:55.010

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:19.280
 now you can lower your hand a little 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:23.840
 raise so that it is convenient here we are 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.690
 leave her here living and here 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.780
 vice versa 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:32.360
