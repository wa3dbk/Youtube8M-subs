00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:17.200
 tennis published by sega edited 2 years ago 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.270
 virtua tennis 2009 with the intention of 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.859
 offer a delivery per year as it has been 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.140
 eluded the possible continuity that 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:25.060
 could offer this 2009 delivery and it's going 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.869
 to look for the previous one with what this 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.640
 stress virtua tennis 4 unlike your 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.470
 direct rival virtual tennis 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.750
 has always been characterized as being more 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.870
 most affordable arcade for all kinds of 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:41.350
 players and more spectacular with plays 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.090
 sometimes impossible the evolution that 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.860
 represents this new tennis delivery 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.870
 sega is much greater than what we have 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.020
 seen so far in this generation of 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.760
 consoles and this we indicate 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.010
 referring to his technical facet to his 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.449
 gameplay to their game modes and to the 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.910
 application of new technologies 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.940
 how are the 3d and the functions of move 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.160
 and kinect the roster of tennis players is more 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.009
 counting with interesting and 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.140
 current top players there are 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.030
 others to unlock and in ps3 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.280
 we also found tennis players 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.680
 exclusive as well as two mini-games 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.270
 added from the first shot of 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.040
 contact and we already realize the 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.659
 greatness of this delivery the 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.909
 representation of the players is 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.030
 hyperrealistic and they all have 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.100
 excellent own animations to know 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.360
 use their attributes and skills not 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.940
 they will be of great help to leave 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.830
 victorious in the clashes every 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.110
 effective movement that we make in addition 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.720
 of points do not fill apart from the bar 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.450
 of concentration the most original novelty 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.250
 that is contributed to the series will be filled 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.429
 faster if we do more 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.619
 movements of our player 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:50.020
 once filled it will keep us about 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.630
 seconds ready to be used before 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.490
 if it's empty if we activate it, we'll do 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.409
 a special movement and in which 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.050
 we will see our player in the first 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.690
 flat executing a blunt blow to 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.680
 slow motion to appreciate all the 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.800
 details of his movement 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.080
 a pure visual spectacle especially in 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.390
 3d 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.490
 this movement can be countered 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.160
 so we should use it thoroughly 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.750
 all the blows included this one 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.570
 perform using the four buttons 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.700
 main to each one we can give you more 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.980
 or less power if we press more or 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.130
 less time the button corresponding to 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.620
 hit before running the control with 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.590
 move is very good like the away with 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.920
 kinect not so much 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.690
 the matches are fast dynamic 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.980
 television factor powered by the 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.290
 different cameras that we can 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.690
 select the setting of the audience 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.750
 judges and others manages to get us as never 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.250
 before in a tennis match with respect to 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.750
 the game modes are offered to us in the 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.610

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.220
 crazy novel mini-games with 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.989
 review of some more other classics and 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.090
 the arcade mode in which we will have to 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.230
 overcome 5 matches on five tracks 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.700
 different rivals increasingly hard 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.370
 but the main mode is the championship 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.319
 world in him we will create our 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.290
 character trying not to have at most 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.810
 high of the spp along four 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.420
 seasons in this mode is where it's done 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.739

 boxes that the board shows us 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.799
 game that represent the different 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:24.660
 areas of the world map we will learn to 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.480
 enhance our movements playing 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.340
 minigames to training matches 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.860

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.129
 etc 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.110
 each game in this mode is different 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:42.540

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.970
 results we will access some boxes u 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.940

 equalized or create venues for groups 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.810
 although in this last option it will not affect 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.090
 our virtual global ranking has 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.280
