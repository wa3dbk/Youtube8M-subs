00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.160
 well beyond that it was a decision 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.529
 we were preparing a 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.630
 new album and the invitation came from sony 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:25.220
 not the front row concept that's a 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.279
 concept that we respect so very much 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.529
 is the greatest of the artists who have 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.450
 recorded a first row sometimes have 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.710
 more of trajectory age I say more years 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.440
 of trajectory that we are of age 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.280
 so the truth is we are not saying 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.280
 that are great but but the truth is 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.260
 what was 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.050
 very special for us and it was a 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.420
 honor that they are and invited us to 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.519
 be part of such a special concept 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.620
 as big as a first row and at 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.420
 do something with such responsibility in 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.920
 we prepare a lot because 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.629
 it sounds a lot easier than it is 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.379
 record a live disc or disc 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:04.540
 then we spent two years writing 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.330
 new songs because it includes seven 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.570
 unpublished themes and then also re 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.770
 making versions then yes it was very 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.259
 industrious for us but 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.600
 definitely the result has been the 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.610
 most rewarding in the world and good to me 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.100
 we love the challenges then when 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.740
 we knew we were going to prepare for 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.130
 record a live concert as well what 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.679
 we wanted to get as close as possible 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.200
 perfectly right for that time 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:34.119
 to record the concert we can 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.580
 focus more on interpretation and 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.250
 live more the moment not be 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.050
 worrying about the details not for 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.729
 there this arrangement is not keeping us 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.560
 well we are not going to change this guitar 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.860
 we wanted to have it as prepared 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.229
 possible and we something in something that 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.689
 we were a little foolish no moment of ya 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.820
 see the result we wanted to rescue the 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.159
 interpretation beyond perfection 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.079
 not beyond seeing the details not 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.789
 we said although it is a little imperfect 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.009
 we want to give people the 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:06.579
 experience of a live concert and 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.619
 that's what we did and we were super 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.979
 happy with the result we are already a 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.979
 little bit 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.470
 they did not hurt us anymore because now 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.690
 record a disc of the other format no longer 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.360
 you will not feel the same anymore because 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.910
 to the fans that there were fans who traveled from 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.130
 Spain Central America South America 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.650
 United-Mexico not within the Republic 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.050
 Mexican and be there celebrate our 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.620
 12 years of career 12 years of success with 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.170
 they were all stuffed in a box in a 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.970
 disco and that's great to get as I 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.400
 I think if you say what your legacy is 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.940
 it's the best you've done in your 12 years 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.480
 of the race without doubt is therefore the summary 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.480
 this first row 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.510
 good in it we have a need for 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.760
 be composing of being talking about what 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.319
 what is happening to us and at the moment of 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.010
 choose the single that they are and have 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.660
 chosen singles new unpublished 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.330
 obviously for us it is a compliment 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.940
 that are betting on the new thing that 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.680
 we are doing now we are not no 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.200
 we entered thinking that they were going to enter 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.599
 seven new songs or 8 or 6 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.220
 basically we are preparing 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.370
 a new album and the best song in 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.380
 work we have them then basically 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.579
 we are not we put is we put this 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.410
 then we said because we a 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.930
 balance for just what you're 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.950
 saying no, it's just important 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.690
 celebrate the past but also 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.760
 present the new present 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.560
 and it has been great that now our 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.569
 new single that is what I learned from you 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:42.209
 it is also an unpublished song then 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.209
 that for us moves us very much
