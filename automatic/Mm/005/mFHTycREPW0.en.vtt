and<00:03:18.210> there's<00:03:18.420> something<00:03:18.810> about<00:03:19.080> storytelling

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
and there's something about storytelling

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.300 
and there's something about storytelling
that<00:03:20.730> comes<00:03:21.210> out<00:03:21.450> when<00:03:22.410> you<00:03:22.560> have<00:03:22.770> animals

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
that comes out when you have animals

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.040 
that comes out when you have animals
whether<00:03:23.550> you<00:03:23.730> like<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:23.940> or<00:03:24.120> not<00:03:24.270> whether

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
whether you like it or not whether

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:37.680 
whether you like it or not whether
you're<00:03:25.260> embarrassed<00:03:25.620> of<00:03:25.770> it<00:03:25.890> or<00:03:26.010> not

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690
