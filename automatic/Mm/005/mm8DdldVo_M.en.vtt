00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:48.610

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.209 

oh<00:00:52.690> no<00:00:53.690> I<00:00:53.719> think<00:00:54.079> if<00:00:54.530> he<00:00:54.620> doesn't<00:00:54.920> like<00:00:55.040> the

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
oh no I think if he doesn't like the

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:57.939 
oh no I think if he doesn't like the
pitch<00:00:55.430> he<00:00:56.300> doesn't<00:00:56.600> hit<00:00:56.719> it<00:00:56.809> off<00:00:56.930> this<00:00:57.050> way<00:00:57.290> if

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
pitch he doesn't hit it off this way if

00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.439 
pitch he doesn't hit it off this way if
it's<00:00:58.100> a<00:00:58.160> bad<00:00:58.370> pitch<00:00:58.670> but<00:00:59.030> if<00:00:59.059> it's<00:00:59.210> a<00:00:59.269> good

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
it's a bad pitch but if it's a good

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.850 
it's a bad pitch but if it's a good
