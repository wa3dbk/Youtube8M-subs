just focused on the houses because that

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.000 
just focused on the houses because that
was<00:03:38.430> new<00:03:38.670> and<00:03:38.940> they're<00:03:39.750> medium<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.440> low<00:03:40.680> end

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.319 
was new and they're medium to low end
apartment<00:03:41.610> so<00:03:41.730> they're<00:03:41.850> not<00:03:41.940> going<00:03:42.000> to<00:03:42.180> be<00:03:42.239> as

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
apartment so they're not going to be as

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.210 
apartment so they're not going to be as
good<00:03:42.450> as<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.780> high<00:03:43.290> life<00:03:43.530> update<00:03:43.680> so<00:03:44.040> I<00:03:44.070> don't

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
good as the high life update so I don't

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.410 
good as the high life update so I don't
really<00:03:44.250> see<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.610> reason<00:03:44.850> to<00:03:44.940> check<00:03:45.090> those<00:03:45.269> out

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
really see the reason to check those out

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.360 
really see the reason to check those out
but<00:03:45.600> they<00:03:45.660> might<00:03:45.840> be<00:03:46.049> you<00:03:46.829> know<00:03:46.920> pretty<00:03:47.190> good

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.890 
but they might be you know pretty good
it's<00:03:47.579> worth<00:03:47.760> I<00:03:48.030> guess<00:03:48.180> it's<00:03:48.329> worth<00:03:48.480> checking

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
it's worth I guess it's worth checking

means<00:05:59.100> that<00:05:59.340> probably<00:06:00.030> the<00:06:00.690> to<00:06:00.960> box<00:06:01.200> method

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
means that probably the to box method

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.260 
means that probably the to box method
for<00:06:01.860> the<00:06:01.890> money<00:06:02.100> which<00:06:02.310> is<00:06:02.340> proudly<00:06:02.880> patch
