00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
interesting situations and the game

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:38.929 
interesting situations and the game
wasn't<00:01:38.009> really<00:01:38.250> written<00:01:38.430> with<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> whole<00:01:38.820> lot

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
wasn't really written with a whole lot

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.429 
wasn't really written with a whole lot
of<00:01:39.030> depth<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.930> characters<00:01:40.290> aren't

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
of depth to it so the characters aren't

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.990 
of depth to it so the characters aren't
really<00:01:40.680> likable<00:01:41.220> they<00:01:41.460> are<00:01:41.579> really<00:01:41.850> that

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
really likable they are really that

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.460 
really likable they are really that
interesting<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.780> story<00:01:42.990> just<00:01:43.079> kind<00:01:43.380> of

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
interesting and the story just kind of

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.170 
interesting and the story just kind of
goes<00:01:43.590> nowhere<00:01:43.950> there<00:01:44.670> are<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.759> few<00:01:44.880> blown
