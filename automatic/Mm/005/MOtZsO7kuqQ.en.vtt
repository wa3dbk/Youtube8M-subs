and<00:00:35.700> you're<00:00:36.329> going<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.540> fold<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.930> fabric<00:00:37.260> in

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
and you're going to fold the fabric in

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.530 
and you're going to fold the fabric in
half<00:00:37.410> having<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.399> front<00:00:38.610> sides<00:00:38.910> facing<00:00:39.270> each

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
half having the front sides facing each

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.139 
half having the front sides facing each
other<00:00:39.750> just<00:00:40.290> like<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.790> and<00:00:41.790> you're<00:00:41.879> going<00:00:42.000> to

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
it's going to have two pieces to it and

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:54.979 
it's going to have two pieces to it and
you're<00:00:54.030> just<00:00:54.149> going<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.360> tape<00:00:54.629> them<00:00:54.809> together

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
you're just going to tape them together

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.099 
you're just going to tape them together
in<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.469> center<00:00:56.090> now<00:00:57.090> we<00:00:57.149> just<00:00:57.510> need<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.750> pin<00:00:57.989> it

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
in the center now we just need to pin it

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.969 
in the center now we just need to pin it
on<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.920> fabric<00:01:02.960> you're<00:01:03.960> going<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.500> cut<00:01:04.860> it

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
on to the fabric you're going to cut it

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.219 
on to the fabric you're going to cut it
out<00:01:05.129> once<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.640> then<00:01:05.820> cut<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.150> out<00:01:06.299> again<00:01:06.600> so

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
out once and then cut it out again so

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.960 
out once and then cut it out again so
that<00:01:07.380> way<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.530> have<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.710> total<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.280> four<00:01:08.670> pieces

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
that way you have a total of four pieces

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.080 
that way you have a total of four pieces
just<00:01:09.420> like<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.750> see<00:01:09.930> right<00:01:09.960> here<00:01:10.909> the<00:01:11.909> next

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
just like you see right here the next

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.870 
just like you see right here the next
step<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.750> take<00:01:12.990> two<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.830> sides<00:01:14.130> put

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
step is to take two of the sides put

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.810 
step is to take two of the sides put
them<00:01:15.000> together<00:01:15.180> with<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.720> front<00:01:15.960> facing<00:01:16.229> and

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
them together with the front facing and

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.340 
them together with the front facing and
you're<00:01:17.820> going<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.060> sew<00:01:18.390> just<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.900> straight

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
you're going to sew just a straight

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:28.399 
you're going to sew just a straight
stitch<00:01:19.650> right<00:01:20.310> across<00:01:20.580> there<00:01:27.080> and<00:01:28.080> that's

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
stitch right across there and that's

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.859 
stitch right across there and that's
what<00:01:28.619> it's<00:01:28.740> going<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.040> look<00:01:29.280> like<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.869> you're

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
what it's going to look like and you're

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.899 
what it's going to look like and you're
going<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.200> do<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.470> for<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.979> other<00:01:32.189> two<00:01:32.490> sides

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
going to do that for the other two sides

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.380 
going to do that for the other two sides
as<00:01:33.150> well<00:01:34.130> now<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.340> we<00:01:35.460> have<00:01:35.640> both<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:35.939> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
as well now that we have both of the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.899 
as well now that we have both of the
sides<00:01:36.810> sewn<00:01:37.500> together<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:38.070> middle<00:01:38.369> we're

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
sides sewn together the middle we're

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.899 
sides sewn together the middle we're
going<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.270> sew<00:01:39.509> them<00:01:39.750> together<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.909> one

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
going to sew them together and one

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.760 
going to sew them together and one
little<00:01:42.119> trick<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.750> have<00:01:42.840> that's<00:01:43.470> going<00:01:43.680> to

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
little trick that I have that's going to

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.219 
little trick that I have that's going to
help<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.340> at<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.640> end<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.420> process<00:01:45.720> when

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
help you at the end of the process when

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.469 
help you at the end of the process when
you're<00:01:46.409> flipping<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:47.100> right<00:01:47.250> side<00:01:47.490> out<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.909> to

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
you're flipping it right side out is to

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.060 
you're flipping it right side out is to
attach<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.960> little<00:01:49.140> piece<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.439> string<00:01:49.740> or

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
attach a little piece of string or

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.090 
attach a little piece of string or
ribbon<00:01:50.570> inside<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.590> make<00:01:52.770> sure<00:01:52.799> you're

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
ribbon inside of it and make sure you're

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.590 
ribbon inside of it and make sure you're
not<00:01:53.189> actually<00:01:53.610> sewing<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.210> in

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
not actually sewing it in

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.319 
not actually sewing it in
I'm<00:01:54.659> just<00:01:55.200> securing<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.740> with<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:56.000> safety<00:01:57.000> pin

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
I'm just securing it with a safety pin

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.630 
I'm just securing it with a safety pin
and<00:01:57.570> then<00:01:58.229> when<00:01:58.710> you're<00:01:58.860> done<00:01:59.009> you'll<00:01:59.369> pull

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
and then when you're done you'll pull

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.330 
and then when you're done you'll pull
that<00:02:00.119> string<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.409> will<00:02:01.619> flip<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.189> right

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
that string and that will flip it right

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
that string and that will flip it right
side<00:02:02.399> out<00:02:02.700> for<00:02:03.060> you

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
side out for you

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.859 
side out for you
now<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.200> next<00:02:04.469> step<00:02:04.799> after<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:06.630> put

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
now the next step after that is to put

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.520 
now the next step after that is to put
the<00:02:07.140> other<00:02:07.320> side<00:02:08.300> face<00:02:09.300> down<00:02:09.360> on<00:02:10.020> top<00:02:10.259> so<00:02:10.500> that

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
the other side face down on top so that

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.510 
the other side face down on top so that
way<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.950> Front's<00:02:11.250> are<00:02:11.340> facing<00:02:11.730> again

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
way the Front's are facing again

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.640 
way the Front's are facing again
and<00:02:12.610> then<00:02:13.240> you're<00:02:13.780> just<00:02:13.900> going<00:02:14.080> to<00:02:14.230> pin<00:02:14.500> it

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
and then you're just going to pin it

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.440 
and then you're just going to pin it
together<00:02:14.860> so<00:02:15.640> that<00:02:15.670> way<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.030> know<00:02:16.270> it's

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
together so that way you know it's

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.200 
together so that way you know it's
secure<00:02:16.990> and<00:02:17.140> not<00:02:17.320> going<00:02:17.590> anywhere<00:02:17.860> when<00:02:18.730> you

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
secure and not going anywhere when you

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.290 
secure and not going anywhere when you
start<00:02:20.020> to<00:02:20.110> sell<00:02:20.320> it<00:02:20.700> now<00:02:21.700> you're<00:02:21.940> going<00:02:22.180> to

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
sell all the sides together except these

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.270 
sell all the sides together except these
two<00:02:25.150> ends<00:02:25.870> leave<00:02:26.020> those<00:02:26.230> unsewn<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:27.130> you'll

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.200 

after<00:02:40.840> you<00:02:40.930> have<00:02:41.080> it<00:02:41.200> all<00:02:41.350> pulled<00:02:41.860> out<00:02:42.210> the

after you have it all pulled out the

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.590 
after you have it all pulled out the
next<00:02:43.420> step<00:02:43.660> is<00:02:43.810> to<00:02:44.110> sew<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.710> ends<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:46.330> that<00:02:46.360> way

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
next step is to sew the ends so that way

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.090 
next step is to sew the ends so that way
they're<00:02:46.780> closed<00:02:47.080> we're<00:02:47.410> just<00:02:47.590> going<00:02:47.740> to<00:02:47.770> fold

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
they're closed we're just going to fold

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.340 
they're closed we're just going to fold
them<00:02:48.280> in<00:02:48.520> like<00:02:48.760> that<00:02:48.790> it<00:02:49.270> helps<00:02:49.870> if<00:02:49.990> you<00:02:50.110> iron

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
them in like that it helps if you iron

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.590 
them in like that it helps if you iron
it<00:02:50.740> too<00:02:51.310> that<00:02:51.610> makes<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:51.940> a<00:02:52.000> lot<00:02:52.150> easier<00:02:52.570> for

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600
