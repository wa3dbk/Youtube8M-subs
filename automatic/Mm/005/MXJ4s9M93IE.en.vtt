00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.540
 hello gangsters with you pandan if you 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.540
 closely followed past videos 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.270
 for past eyes have heard that 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.410
 in the comments we found this with you 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.699
 a kind of battle for who can 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.189
 convince the Duma because there it is very 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.230
 strong hero well briefly repeat yes 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.179
 he has a great blog design 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.919
 Natural would he have built 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.449
 Razik and of course he can be very 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.740
 universal for what you can 2 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.539
 times on rivet ability to take 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.240
 get there regin get camp 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.080
 a centaur well and a shorter great hero in 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.880
 the amount of five pieces 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.490
 the more excellent it is probably one of 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.370
 Are the top midone heroes uniquely one 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.800
 can anyone win from rebik to medon 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.360
 long we had discussions 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.640
 options offered you offered pizza and 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.740
 options but the strongest at this 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.260
 moment the hero against the house turned out there 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.720
 is black doom they just have no 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.700
 chances against this guy who doesn't 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.170
 a long time ago they added a tattoo because 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.900
 he has these wild illusions that 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.970
 there is no way to kill even ordinary ones 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.850
 mad illusions great ult 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.670
 ability to switch from melee 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.270
 for far shorter chances just no 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.770
 well, quite at the end when already 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.520
 terrorlade was supposed to die he 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.079
 hp changes and as a result dum dies and if 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.920
 the ability to kill a terlabled course 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:24.659
 block his opportunity at least 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.369
 send off the doom before but not 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.369
 always it turns out especially with five 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.939
 1 to 1 you can be a home for design 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.050
 Lesha then the other four will go 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.210
 straight 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.950
 right behind you is actually terrorblade 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.290
 probably strong think stronger still very 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.530
 many heroes in which to offer 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.740
 so in the comments I offer you in 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.380
 this time come up with a control of the terrorblade 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.260
 and we will play a game that defeat the theater 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.380
 playo now we have a new one 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.000
 new super villain let's say so from myself i 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.370
 probably would offer again some 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.760
 mass stanner like sven but if 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:06.060
 you remember from vein thought lost then 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.220
 there are also rubles, change is possible 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.980
 lose but it does not mean that the scene is so 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.460
 so good and strong okay thanks for 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.460
 viewing 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.950
