00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
go about measuring it and what happens

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.300 
go about measuring it and what happens
if<00:02:42.240> a<00:02:42.360> bike<00:02:42.570> fails<00:02:42.930> let's<00:02:43.500> go<00:02:43.680> inside<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.010> tent

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310

now with Mattie Omata
Technical<00:02:48.060> Coordinator<00:02:48.270> at<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.380> UCI<00:02:49.860> now<00:02:50.100> I

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
Technical Coordinator at the UCI now I

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.340 
Technical Coordinator at the UCI now I
say<00:02:50.640> what<00:02:50.850> exactly<00:02:51.030> are<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.660> guys<00:02:51.870> checking

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
say what exactly are the guys checking

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.050 
say what exactly are the guys checking
for<00:02:52.620> knees<00:02:52.860> time<00:02:53.130> child<00:02:53.430> bites<00:02:53.640> before<00:02:53.790> the

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
for knees time child bites before the

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.870 
for knees time child bites before the
start<00:02:54.300> yeah<00:02:54.480> we<00:02:54.720> check<00:02:54.990> different<00:02:55.880> parameter

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
start yeah we check different parameter

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.170 
start yeah we check different parameter
the<00:02:57.420> first<00:02:57.660> one<00:02:57.900> is<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.290> setup<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.910> so<00:03:00.060> there

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
the first one is the setup the so there

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.000 
the first one is the setup the so there
must<00:03:00.270> be<00:03:00.450> always<00:03:00.750> on<00:03:00.960> time<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.260> so<00:03:01.800> you<00:03:01.830> have<00:03:01.980> a

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
must be always on time and so you have a

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.580 
must be always on time and so you have a
pterence<00:03:02.400> of<00:03:02.610> three<00:03:02.940> degree<00:03:03.270> so<00:03:04.020> we<00:03:04.170> check<00:03:04.440> the

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
pterence of three degree so we check the

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.410 
pterence of three degree so we check the
setup<00:03:04.800> and<00:03:05.580> after<00:03:05.880> we<00:03:06.000> check<00:03:06.210> different

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
setup and after we check different

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.220 
setup and after we check different
dimensions<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:08.490> the<00:03:09.300> distance<00:03:09.630> between

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
dimensions so the the distance between

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.200 
dimensions so the the distance between
the<00:03:10.530> table<00:03:10.890> say<00:03:11.160> that<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.520> bottom<00:03:11.670> brackets

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
the table say that the bottom brackets

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.140 
the table say that the bottom brackets
the<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:13.170> distance<00:03:14.130> between<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.820> bottom

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
the the distance between the bottom
