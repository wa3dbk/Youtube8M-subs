00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
I'm back down to 500 but it's a very

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.830 
I'm back down to 500 but it's a very
swinging<00:00:46.620> game<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.480> pretty<00:00:48.480> had<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.690> few

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
swinging game so pretty had a few

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.319 
swinging game so pretty had a few
mistakes<00:00:48.989> never<00:00:49.559> met<00:00:49.770> schreib<00:00:50.219> know<00:00:50.760> I'm

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
mistakes never met schreib know I'm

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.340 
mistakes never met schreib know I'm
counting<00:00:51.690> like<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.899> worst-case<00:00:52.230> scenario

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
counting like the worst-case scenario

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.090 
counting like the worst-case scenario
three<00:00:52.980> bits<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.520> far<00:00:53.789> today<00:00:54.140> so<00:00:55.140> every<00:00:55.980> day

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
three bits so far today so every day

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.099 
three bits so far today so every day
make<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.340> few<00:00:56.550> mistakes<00:00:56.760> but<00:00:57.180> they've<00:00:57.899> probably

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
make a few mistakes but they've probably

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.290 
make a few mistakes but they've probably
done<00:00:58.230> total<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.859> about<00:00:58.920> fifteen<00:00:59.850> bets<00:01:00.000> for<00:01:00.210> the
