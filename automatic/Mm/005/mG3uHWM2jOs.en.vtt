00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
you can kill people you can get in cars

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.679 
you can kill people you can get in cars
you<00:01:34.829> can<00:01:34.950> shoot<00:01:35.159> out<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.579> vehicles<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.509> can

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
you can shoot out of vehicles you can

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.120 
you can shoot out of vehicles you can
pretty<00:01:36.869> much<00:01:36.930> do<00:01:37.229> anything<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.680> would<00:01:37.979> do

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
pretty much do anything you would do

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.890 
pretty much do anything you would do
otherwise<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:39.000> really<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.420> only<00:01:39.450> thing<00:01:39.659> that

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
otherwise so really the only thing that

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.690 
otherwise so really the only thing that
ends<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.320> glitch<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.799> either<00:01:41.009> dying<00:01:41.430> or

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
ends this glitch is either dying or

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.219 
ends this glitch is either dying or
putting<00:01:41.939> your<00:01:42.119> phone<00:01:42.270> away<00:01:42.390> like<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.899> said<00:01:43.079> as

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.960 
putting your phone away like I said as
long<00:01:43.470> as<00:01:43.590> your<00:01:43.710> phone<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.100> out<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.579> on<00:01:44.850> the

long as your phone is out and on the

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.789 
long as your phone is out and on the

never come after you you can even be in
a<00:01:48.630> tank<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.049> can<00:01:49.259> be<00:01:49.380> exploding<00:01:49.920> tons<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.369> cop

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
a tank you can be exploding tons of cop

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.700 
a tank you can be exploding tons of cop
cars<00:01:50.579> doing<00:01:51.240> whatever<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.720> want<00:01:51.869> they<00:01:52.439> will

a<00:01:54.990> very<00:01:55.200> cool<00:01:55.439> useful<00:01:55.979> glitch<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:57.030> imagine

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
a very cool useful glitch and I imagine

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.539 
a very cool useful glitch and I imagine
that<00:01:58.020> rockstars<00:01:58.439> probably<00:01:58.979> gonna<00:01:59.100> patch<00:01:59.340> this

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
that rockstars probably gonna patch this

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.980 
that rockstars probably gonna patch this
one<00:01:59.610> you<00:02:00.060> know<00:02:00.149> they<00:02:00.299> leave<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.780> lot<00:02:00.869> of

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
one you know they leave a lot of

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.929 
one you know they leave a lot of
harmless<00:02:01.380> ones<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.770> game<00:02:01.950> but<00:02:02.219> this<00:02:02.700> isn't

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
harmless ones in the game but this isn't

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.399 
harmless ones in the game but this isn't
very<00:02:03.180> harmless<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.810> could<00:02:04.049> definitely<00:02:04.170> see

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
very harmless I could definitely see

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.560 
very harmless I could definitely see
this<00:02:04.649> being<00:02:04.829> abused<00:02:05.219> in<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.430> future<00:02:05.790> maybe

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
this being abused in the future maybe

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.240 
this being abused in the future maybe
even<00:02:06.840> when<00:02:06.960> heists<00:02:07.409> come<00:02:07.649> out<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.829> don't<00:02:08.039> know

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
even when heists come out I don't know

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.740 
even when heists come out I don't know
if<00:02:08.280> people<00:02:08.610> will<00:02:08.729> be<00:02:08.849> able<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.179> avoid<00:02:09.390> wanted

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
if people will be able to avoid wanted

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.750 
if people will be able to avoid wanted
levels<00:02:10.050> there<00:02:10.319> so<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.920> wouldn't<00:02:11.340> expect<00:02:11.520> this

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
levels there so I wouldn't expect this

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.580 
levels there so I wouldn't expect this
to<00:02:11.910> last<00:02:12.120> too<00:02:12.840> long<00:02:12.870> but<00:02:13.080> you

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
to last too long but you

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.750 
to last too long but you
while<00:02:13.860> it's<00:02:14.010> in<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.160> game<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.459> might<00:02:14.550> as<00:02:14.670> well

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
while it's in the game you might as well

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.000 
while it's in the game you might as well
give<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.180> try<00:02:15.209> so<00:02:15.959> if<00:02:16.080> that<00:02:16.200> guy's<00:02:16.410> as<00:02:16.709> always

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010
