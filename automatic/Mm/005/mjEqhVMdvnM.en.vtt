00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.720
 May winter nights give me 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.280
 some magical sheets made of you 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.280
 that your beautiful naked body transport us 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.320
 to a desert salt where the light is hidden. 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.000
 Let your fingers wrap the flame 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.800
 of the treasure that is born when you are 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.040
 that breeze full of calm 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.280
 Let us see the sky that some of us describe. 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:16.000
 We have a pending destination and it is time, simply 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:25.200
 burn with your sigh all the cold that in my desire is described. 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:35.520
 Drink from my hot water, a surprisingly different palate 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.480
 cross the core of the sun, let's get rid of love. 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.160
 It's normal what I feel 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.520
 if in a distant mirage 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.160
 I see your eyes and awake 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.880
 of a dream full of illusions and traps. 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.120
 There are songs that eclipse us 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.600
 looking for worldly dreams 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.600
 there are corners that need 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.800
 of a memory where you feel smells full of eagerness. 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.840
 We have a pending destination and it is time, simply 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:00.440
 burn with your sigh all the cold that in my desire is described. 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:11.080
 Drink from my hot water, a surprisingly different palate 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.200
 cross the core of the sun, let's get rid of love.
