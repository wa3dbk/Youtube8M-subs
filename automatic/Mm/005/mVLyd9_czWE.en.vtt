00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
a what's up guys I'm Kay PhD here and

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.390 
a what's up guys I'm Kay PhD here and
today<00:00:06.000> I'm<00:00:06.060> going<00:00:06.150> to<00:00:06.210> be<00:00:06.299> talking<00:00:06.569> about<00:00:06.660> 4k

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:07.400 
today I'm going to be talking about 4k

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.890 
today I'm going to be talking about 4k
explained<00:00:08.400> so<00:00:08.610> you've<00:00:08.700> probably<00:00:08.849> heard<00:00:09.150> 4k

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
explained so you've probably heard 4k

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.270 
explained so you've probably heard 4k
tossed<00:00:10.260> around<00:00:10.559> quite<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.769> bit<00:00:10.860> in<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.099> past

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
tossed around quite a bit in the past

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.830 
tossed around quite a bit in the past
couple<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.670> weeks<00:00:11.940> or<00:00:12.240> months<00:00:12.599> especially

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
couple of weeks or months especially

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.539 
couple of weeks or months especially
during<00:00:13.290> CES<00:00:13.500> at<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.009> beginning<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:14.370> January

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
during CES at the beginning of January

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:15.379 
during CES at the beginning of January
this<00:00:14.969> year

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
this year

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.080 
this year
4k<00:00:16.080> has<00:00:16.350> been<00:00:16.560> sort<00:00:16.830> of<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:16.949> buzzword<00:00:17.430> but<00:00:17.970> what

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
4k has been sort of a buzzword but what

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.300 
4k has been sort of a buzzword but what
is<00:00:18.180> 4k<00:00:18.390> mean<00:00:18.930> exactly<00:00:19.380> well<00:00:19.980> there's<00:00:20.160> not<00:00:20.279> a

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
is 4k mean exactly well there's not a

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.859 
is 4k mean exactly well there's not a
whole<00:00:20.460> lot<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.640> technically<00:00:21.210> explain<00:00:21.689> but

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
whole lot to technically explain but

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.300 
whole lot to technically explain but
there<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.170> lot<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.560> so<00:00:22.769> 4k<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.279> a

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
there is a lot to it so 4k is a

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.980 
there is a lot to it so 4k is a
resolution<00:00:23.760> really<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.390> it's<00:00:24.510> measured<00:00:24.840> in

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
resolution really and it's measured in

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.540 
resolution really and it's measured in
pixels<00:00:25.199> just<00:00:25.650> like<00:00:25.740> every<00:00:25.949> other<00:00:25.980> resolution

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
pixels just like every other resolution

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.429 
pixels just like every other resolution
starting<00:00:27.150> at<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.420> smallest<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:28.109> can<00:00:28.140> see

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
a 1280 by 720 we call it a 720p display

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
slightly bigger display is typically

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.170 
slightly bigger display is typically
somewhere<00:00:39.989> around<00:00:40.110> 1440<00:00:41.010> by<00:00:41.040> 900<00:00:41.430> somewhere

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
somewhere around 1440 by 900 somewhere

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.740 
somewhere around 1440 by 900 somewhere
around<00:00:42.270> there

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
around there

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.690 
around there
then<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.290> get<00:00:43.379> up<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.920> larger<00:00:44.309> desktop

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
then you get up to the larger desktop

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.190 
then you get up to the larger desktop
displays<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.329> these<00:00:45.420> are<00:00:45.570> usually<00:00:45.750> around

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
displays and these are usually around

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.459 
displays and these are usually around
1920<00:00:47.010> by<00:00:47.399> 1080<00:00:48.000> these<00:00:48.510> are<00:00:48.690> called<00:00:48.899> 1080p

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
1920 by 1080 these are called 1080p

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.979 
1920 by 1080 these are called 1080p
displays<00:00:49.860> 4k<00:00:50.760> displays<00:00:51.270> are<00:00:51.539> somewhere

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
displays 4k displays are somewhere

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.729 
displays 4k displays are somewhere
around<00:00:52.430> 4000<00:00:53.430> pixels<00:00:53.579> across<00:00:53.940> by<00:00:54.559> 2000<00:00:55.559> pixels

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
around 4000 pixels across by 2000 pixels

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.410 
around 4000 pixels across by 2000 pixels
down<00:00:56.100> now<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.370> say<00:00:56.550> somewhere<00:00:56.879> around<00:00:56.940> that

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
down now I say somewhere around that

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.660 
down now I say somewhere around that
because<00:00:57.719> 4k<00:00:57.960> actually<00:00:58.530> varies<00:00:59.010> there<00:00:59.309> isn't

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
because 4k actually varies there isn't

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.369 
because 4k actually varies there isn't
an<00:00:59.789> exact<00:01:00.210> standard<00:01:00.690> yet<00:01:00.870> but<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.109> closest

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
an exact standard yet but the closest

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.990 
an exact standard yet but the closest
thing<00:01:01.469> we<00:01:01.590> have<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.949> standard<00:01:02.309> for<00:01:02.460> 4k<00:01:02.640> is

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
thing we have to a standard for 4k is

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.600 
thing we have to a standard for 4k is
called<00:01:03.420> UHD<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.409> UHD<00:01:04.890> stands<00:01:05.129> for<00:01:05.280> ultra-high

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
called UHD and UHD stands for ultra-high

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.440 
called UHD and UHD stands for ultra-high
definition<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.990> 3840<00:01:07.560> by<00:01:08.130> 2160<00:01:08.820> that

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
definition and that is 3840 by 2160 that

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.450 
definition and that is 3840 by 2160 that
is<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.990> lot<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.320> pixels<00:01:10.590> there<00:01:10.860> are<00:01:10.920> more<00:01:11.040> pixels

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
is a lot of pixels there are more pixels

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.060 
is a lot of pixels there are more pixels
on<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> 4k<00:01:12.060> display<00:01:12.240> than<00:01:13.020> there<00:01:13.170> are<00:01:13.350> seconds

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
on a 4k display than there are seconds

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.490 
on a 4k display than there are seconds
in<00:01:14.220> three<00:01:14.729> months<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.360> if<00:01:16.140> you're<00:01:16.320> going<00:01:16.409> to

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
in three months so if you're going to

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.020 
in three months so if you're going to
try<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.680> count<00:01:16.920> all<00:01:17.130> these<00:01:17.250> pixels<00:01:17.670> you're

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
try to count all these pixels you're

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.190 
try to count all these pixels you're
going<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.270> take<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> while<00:01:18.659> now<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:18.900> terms<00:01:19.080> of

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
going to take a while now in terms of

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.780 
going to take a while now in terms of
pixel<00:01:19.560> density<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.220> already<00:01:20.520> did<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.670> video

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
pixel density I already did a video

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.340 
pixel density I already did a video
about<00:01:20.970> pixel<00:01:21.360> density<00:01:21.689> but<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:21.960> already<00:01:22.080> know

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
about pixel density but we already know

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.109 
about pixel density but we already know
that<00:01:22.380> basically<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.400> higher<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.850> pixel

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
that basically the higher the pixel

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.700 
that basically the higher the pixel
density<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.630> display<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.290> better<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.680> looks

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
density of a display the better it looks

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.890 
density of a display the better it looks
the<00:01:26.100> more<00:01:26.130> clear<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.030> more<00:01:27.210> sharp<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.720> looks

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
the more clear the more sharp it looks

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.450 
the more clear the more sharp it looks
because<00:01:28.110> there<00:01:28.500> are<00:01:28.619> more<00:01:28.770> pixels<00:01:29.159> for<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.400> to

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
because there are more pixels for you to

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.730 
because there are more pixels for you to
look<00:01:29.610> at<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:30.060> make<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.420> image<00:01:30.659> look<00:01:30.840> good<00:01:31.049> so

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
look at to make the image look good so

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.130 
look at to make the image look good so
this<00:01:32.430> also<00:01:32.640> depends<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.360> distance<00:01:33.990> you

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
this also depends on the distance you

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.560 
this also depends on the distance you
are<00:01:34.170> viewing<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:35.159> item<00:01:35.610> from<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.150> we'll

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
are viewing that item from so we'll

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.060 
are viewing that item from so we'll
start<00:01:36.750> off<00:01:36.900> with<00:01:37.079> smartphones<00:01:37.619> if<00:01:37.979> you're

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
start off with smartphones if you're

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.219 
start off with smartphones if you're
looking<00:01:38.280> at<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.430> 1280<00:01:39.060> by<00:01:39.210> 720<00:01:39.509> display<00:01:40.049> a

looking at a 1280 by 720 display a

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.719 
looking at a 1280 by 720 display a
couple<00:01:40.770> inches<00:01:40.890> from<00:01:41.130> your<00:01:41.220> face<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.610> don't

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
couple inches from your face you don't

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.249 
couple inches from your face you don't
really<00:01:41.850> use<00:01:42.119> your<00:01:42.240> smartphone<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.659> far<00:01:43.110> away

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
really use your smartphone that far away

really use your smartphone that far away
from<00:01:43.320> your<00:01:43.500> face<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.220> really<00:01:44.549> need<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.790> to

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
from your face so you really need it to

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.789 
from your face so you really need it to
be<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> high<00:01:45.329> pixel<00:01:45.780> density<00:01:45.840> because<00:01:46.409> I'm

be a high pixel density because I'm

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.350 
be a high pixel density because I'm
pretty<00:01:47.070> close<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.490> can<00:01:47.640> see<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.820> lot<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.090> pixels

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
pretty close I can see a lot of pixels

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.760 
pretty close I can see a lot of pixels
of<00:01:48.540> his<00:01:48.630> bed<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.049> given<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.380> we<00:01:49.530> hold<00:01:49.680> these

it further from your face doesn't have

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.429 
it further from your face doesn't have

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
to be quite as high a pixel density so

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.780 
to be quite as high a pixel density so
if<00:02:01.560> you're<00:02:01.710> looking<00:02:01.829> at<00:02:01.979> maybe<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.280> 15-inch

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
if you're looking at maybe a 15-inch

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.450 
if you're looking at maybe a 15-inch
laptop<00:02:03.240> with<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.600> 1440<00:02:04.290> by<00:02:04.320> 900<00:02:04.649> resolution

laptop with that 1440 by 900 resolution

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.830 
laptop with that 1440 by 900 resolution
you<00:02:05.579> are<00:02:05.610> looking<00:02:06.000> at<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.119> pixel<00:02:06.360> density<00:02:06.810> of

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
you are looking at a pixel density of

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.040 
you are looking at a pixel density of
about<00:02:07.710> 120<00:02:08.520> PPI<00:02:08.849> which<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.390> good<00:02:09.539> because<00:02:09.750> it's

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
about 120 PPI which is good because it's

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.270 
about 120 PPI which is good because it's
already<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.410> know<00:02:10.530> 2<00:02:10.590> feet<00:02:10.770> away<00:02:10.979> from<00:02:11.190> your

already you know 2 feet away from your
face<00:02:11.459> now<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.180> can't<00:02:12.540> really<00:02:12.660> see<00:02:12.900> how

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
face now so you can't really see how

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.040 
face now so you can't really see how
pixels<00:02:13.440> at<00:02:13.560> 120<00:02:14.070> PPI<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:14.820> 120<00:02:15.630> is<00:02:15.720> pretty<00:02:15.930> good

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
pixels at 120 PPI so 120 is pretty good

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.420 
pixels at 120 PPI so 120 is pretty good
for<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.260> laptop<00:02:16.440> when<00:02:16.800> you<00:02:16.830> get<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.070> a<00:02:17.100> huge

away from like a 1080p 55 inch TV you

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.610 
away from like a 1080p 55 inch TV you
get<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.500> pixel<00:02:22.920> density<00:02:23.400> of<00:02:23.430> 40<00:02:24.390> 40<00:02:24.990> PPI<00:02:25.320> now

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
get to a pixel density of 40 40 PPI now

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.080 
get to a pixel density of 40 40 PPI now
that<00:02:25.770> seems<00:02:26.010> low<00:02:26.280> because<00:02:26.550> you<00:02:26.700> know<00:02:26.880> we<00:02:27.000> were

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
that seems low because you know we were

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.330 
that seems low because you know we were

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
those pixels at 40 PPI so it's a really

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.660 
you had to get up like all the way up to
the<00:02:55.020> TV<00:02:55.350> and<00:02:55.380> look<00:02:55.650> at<00:02:55.830> it<00:02:55.950> from<00:02:56.220> a<00:02:56.340> couple<00:02:56.520> of

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
the TV and look at it from a couple of

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.250 
the TV and look at it from a couple of
inches<00:02:56.790> away<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.420> then<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:57.810> can<00:02:57.930> see<00:02:58.050> all<00:02:58.080> the

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
inches away and then you can see all the

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.700 
inches away and then you can see all the
pixels<00:02:58.620> with<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.040> 4k<00:02:59.340> TV<00:02:59.550> you<00:03:00.240> will<00:03:00.390> actually

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
pixels with a 4k TV you will actually

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.860 
pixels with a 4k TV you will actually
never<00:03:01.710> be<00:03:02.010> able<00:03:02.130> to<00:03:02.250> see<00:03:02.610> those<00:03:03.150> red<00:03:03.480> green<00:03:03.720> and

blue pixels a 4k 55 inch TV comes in

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.040 
blue pixels a 4k 55 inch TV comes in
over<00:03:07.800> a<00:03:07.830> hundred<00:03:07.980> PPI<00:03:08.970> which<00:03:09.540> means<00:03:09.750> you<00:03:09.900> can

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
over a hundred PPI which means you can

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.500

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
looking it's almost like a little bit

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.920 
looking it's almost like a little bit
below<00:03:44.550> that<00:03:44.670> level<00:03:45.000> of<00:03:45.300> looking<00:03:45.630> through<00:03:45.870> a

below that level of looking through a

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.979 
below that level of looking through a
window<00:03:46.050> it's<00:03:46.950> just<00:03:47.190> sort<00:03:47.700> of<00:03:47.850> a<00:03:48.030> surreal<00:03:48.630> sort

of<00:03:49.080> realism<00:03:49.500> you<00:03:49.530> get<00:03:49.830> especially<00:03:50.430> if<00:03:50.520> you

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
of realism you get especially if you

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.550 
of realism you get especially if you
have<00:03:50.700> a<00:03:50.730> high<00:03:50.910> frame<00:03:51.270> rate<00:03:51.540> a<00:03:51.660> really<00:03:52.050> good<00:03:52.200> 4k

the<00:03:56.100> first<00:03:56.310> problem<00:03:56.940> with<00:03:57.300> 4k<00:03:57.690> TVs<00:03:58.080> is<00:03:58.290> that

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
the first problem with 4k TVs is that

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.010 
the first problem with 4k TVs is that
they're<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.280> little<00:03:59.459> bit<00:03:59.580> expensive<00:03:59.940> okay<00:04:00.840> not

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
they're a little bit expensive okay not

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.750 
they're a little bit expensive okay not
a<00:04:01.050> little<00:04:01.350> bit<00:04:01.470> expensive<00:04:01.860> they<00:04:02.010> are<00:04:02.040> really

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
a little bit expensive they are really

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.910 
a little bit expensive they are really
expensive<00:04:03.030> not<00:04:03.360> six<00:04:03.900> seven<00:04:04.350> thousand<00:04:04.709> dollars

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
expensive not six seven thousand dollars

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.550 
expensive not six seven thousand dollars
I'm<00:04:05.070> talking<00:04:05.430> new<00:04:05.790> car<00:04:06.090> twenty<00:04:06.870> five<00:04:07.050> thousand

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
I'm talking new car twenty five thousand

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.949 
I'm talking new car twenty five thousand
thirty<00:04:08.100> thousand<00:04:08.610> US<00:04:08.850> dollars<00:04:08.880> expensive<00:04:09.810> so

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
thirty thousand US dollars expensive so

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.690 
thirty thousand US dollars expensive so
these<00:04:10.110> are<00:04:10.350> crazy<00:04:10.700> out-of-this-world

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
these are crazy out-of-this-world

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.550 
these are crazy out-of-this-world
expensive<00:04:12.390> right<00:04:12.570> now<00:04:12.600> but<00:04:12.959> again<00:04:13.110> we<00:04:13.380> saw

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
expensive right now but again we saw

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.740 
expensive right now but again we saw
them<00:04:13.739> on<00:04:13.800> a<00:04:13.860> show<00:04:14.190> floor<00:04:14.519> at<00:04:14.730> CES<00:04:15.239> for<00:04:15.269> the<00:04:15.510> past

them on a show floor at CES for the past

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.599 
them on a show floor at CES for the past
two<00:04:15.989> years<00:04:16.019> that's<00:04:16.859> kind<00:04:17.100> of<00:04:17.160> where<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.400> sort

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
two years that's kind of where the sort

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.370 
two years that's kind of where the sort
of<00:04:17.669> innovation<00:04:18.090> starts<00:04:18.359> and<00:04:18.690> maybe<00:04:19.230> in

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
of innovation starts and maybe in

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.720

another<00:04:19.620> two<00:04:19.830> or<00:04:19.950> three<00:04:20.100> years<00:04:20.310> it'll<00:04:20.519> be<00:04:20.669> in

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
another two or three years it'll be in

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:21.770 
another two or three years it'll be in
our<00:04:20.790> living<00:04:21.090> rooms<00:04:21.239> but<00:04:21.390> the<00:04:21.479> other<00:04:21.600> problem

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
our living rooms but the other problem

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.140 
our living rooms but the other problem
with<00:04:22.350> 4k<00:04:22.680> at<00:04:23.100> least<00:04:23.250> right<00:04:23.460> now<00:04:23.490> if<00:04:23.940> you<00:04:24.030> want

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
with 4k at least right now if you want

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.580 
with 4k at least right now if you want
to<00:04:24.210> call<00:04:24.330> it<00:04:24.390> a<00:04:24.450> problem<00:04:24.690> is<00:04:25.110> that<00:04:25.380> there<00:04:25.500> is

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
to call it a problem is that there is

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.690 
to call it a problem is that there is
barely<00:04:25.830> any<00:04:25.979> 4k

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
barely any 4k
