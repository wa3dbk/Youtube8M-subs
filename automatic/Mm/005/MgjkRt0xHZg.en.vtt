now we have a basic site here birdsong

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.340 
now we have a basic site here birdsong
FM<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:14.969> if<00:00:15.360> we<00:00:15.480> look<00:00:15.630> in<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.870> source<00:00:16.049> code

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
FM and if we look in the source code

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.349 
FM and if we look in the source code
you'll<00:00:16.590> see<00:00:16.830> there<00:00:17.070> are<00:00:17.100> numerous<00:00:17.400> JavaScript

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
you'll see there are numerous JavaScript

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.120 
you'll see there are numerous JavaScript
CSS<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.500> images

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
CSS and images

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.849 
CSS and images
we'll<00:00:20.430> call<00:00:20.640> these<00:00:20.850> assets<00:00:21.359> so<00:00:22.350> our<00:00:22.470> assets

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
we'll call these assets so our assets

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.529 
we'll call these assets so our assets
are<00:00:23.010> currently<00:00:23.310> loaded<00:00:23.670> from<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.910> website<00:00:24.119> host

are currently loaded from a website host

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.029 
are currently loaded from a website host
which<00:00:24.810> means<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.560> they're<00:00:25.680> going<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.890> load

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
which means that they're going to load

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.099 
which means that they're going to load
slower<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.880> we<00:00:27.060> hosted<00:00:27.420> them<00:00:27.570> on<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.720> CDN

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
slower that we hosted them on a CDN

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.589 
slower that we hosted them on a CDN
we'll<00:00:29.070> cover<00:00:29.279> how<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.550> easily<00:00:29.849> implement<00:00:30.539> a

the record name in this case is CD n

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.050 
the record name in this case is CD n
birdsong<00:02:35.910> FM<00:02:36.480> so<00:02:36.870> we'll<00:02:37.020> set<00:02:37.260> this<00:02:37.380> here<00:02:38.060> and
