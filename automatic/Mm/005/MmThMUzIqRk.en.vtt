was if you can see this but it's real
smooth<00:03:54.190> and<00:03:54.370> indented<00:03:54.940> right<00:03:55.120> here<00:03:55.330> kind<00:03:55.870> of

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
smooth and indented right here kind of

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.069 
smooth and indented right here kind of
like<00:03:56.080> where<00:03:56.230> your<00:03:56.349> thumb<00:03:56.620> would<00:03:56.739> fit<00:03:58.079> it's

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
just a stone that's really smooth

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.860 
just a stone that's really smooth
polished<00:04:02.530> and<00:04:02.920> fits<00:04:03.160> your<00:04:03.340> hand

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
another real smooth flat stone got some

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.839 
another real smooth flat stone got some
pecking<00:04:08.019> going<00:04:08.980> on<00:04:09.130> right<00:04:09.340> there

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
pecking going on right there

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.199 
pecking going on right there
here's<00:04:10.840> that<00:04:11.140> I<00:04:11.880> don't<00:04:12.880> know<00:04:12.940> what<00:04:13.060> to<00:04:13.180> call

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
here's that I don't know what to call

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.449 
here's that I don't know what to call
this<00:04:14.130> this<00:04:15.130> is<00:04:15.340> some<00:04:15.549> sort<00:04:15.790> of<00:04:15.880> a<00:04:16.000> preform<00:04:17.459> but

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
this this is some sort of a preform but

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.069 
this this is some sort of a preform but
it's<00:04:18.760> interesting<00:04:19.090> if<00:04:19.540> you<00:04:19.600> can<00:04:19.780> see<00:04:19.930> the

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
it's interesting if you can see the

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.129 
it's interesting if you can see the
bands<00:04:20.350> on<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:20.979> slate<00:04:21.280> here<00:04:21.579> but<00:04:22.389> they<00:04:22.690> really

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
bands on the slate here but they really

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:27.240 
bands on the slate here but they really
follow<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.770> contours<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:26.530> shape<00:04:26.800> that<00:04:26.830> they

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
follow the contours the shape that they

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.020 
follow the contours the shape that they
made<00:04:27.460> or<00:04:28.060> that<00:04:28.210> they<00:04:28.330> were<00:04:28.389> making<00:04:28.660> I<00:04:28.960> guess

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
made or that they were making I guess

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.290 
made or that they were making I guess
but<00:04:32.100> it's<00:04:33.100> really<00:04:33.250> interesting<00:04:33.639> this<00:04:34.030> thing

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
but it's really interesting this thing

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:43.440 
but it's really interesting this thing
was<00:04:35.130> being<00:04:36.130> shaped<00:04:36.610> I<00:04:41.910> looked<00:04:42.910> at<00:04:43.030> this<00:04:43.180> end

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
was being shaped I looked at this end

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.360 
was being shaped I looked at this end
just<00:04:43.660> to<00:04:43.720> see<00:04:43.960> if<00:04:44.050> I<00:04:44.169> might<00:04:44.410> if<00:04:44.740> there<00:04:45.039> was<00:04:45.160> some

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
just to see if I might if there was some

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.150 
just to see if I might if there was some
sort<00:04:45.580> of<00:04:45.700> a<00:04:45.820> bit<00:04:46.260> that<00:04:47.260> was<00:04:47.410> being<00:04:47.650> polished

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
sort of a bit that was being polished

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.500 
sort of a bit that was being polished
and<00:04:48.400> if<00:04:49.120> it<00:04:49.330> was<00:04:50.490> it's<00:04:51.490> really<00:04:51.669> been<00:04:52.210> chopped

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
and if it was it's really been chopped

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:58.469 
and if it was it's really been chopped
all<00:04:52.720> to<00:04:52.870> hack<00:04:56.370> this<00:04:57.370> side<00:04:57.610> has<00:04:57.820> some<00:04:58.000> smoothing

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
all to hack this side has some smoothing

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:05.520 
all to hack this side has some smoothing
going<00:04:58.780> on<00:04:59.310> this<00:05:00.310> side<00:05:03.510> almost<00:05:04.510> like<00:05:04.660> scalloped

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
going on this side almost like scalloped

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:12.570 
going on this side almost like scalloped
and<00:05:08.010> I<00:05:09.010> don't<00:05:09.940> know<00:05:10.060> if<00:05:10.180> those<00:05:10.330> are<00:05:10.539> all<00:05:11.580> plow

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
and I don't know if those are all plow

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.839 
and I don't know if those are all plow
marks<00:05:13.030> there's<00:05:13.360> some<00:05:13.599> really<00:05:14.580> seemed<00:05:15.580> to<00:05:15.700> be

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
marks there's some really seemed to be

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:19.440 
marks there's some really seemed to be
deliberate<00:05:17.700> gurus<00:05:18.700> going<00:05:18.970> on<00:05:19.150> in<00:05:19.240> there<00:05:19.419> but

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
deliberate gurus going on in there but

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.589 
deliberate gurus going on in there but
it's<00:05:19.750> a<00:05:19.870> big<00:05:20.139> thing<00:05:20.169> whatever<00:05:20.620> it<00:05:20.950> is<00:05:21.450> but<00:05:22.450> I'm

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:22.599 
it's a big thing whatever it is but I'm

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:25.360 
it's a big thing whatever it is but I'm
sure<00:05:22.810> it<00:05:22.930> wasn't<00:05:23.110> finished

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
sure it wasn't finished

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:31.510 
sure it wasn't finished
then<00:05:25.970> here's<00:05:26.570> the<00:05:26.750> point<00:05:27.050> I<00:05:27.139> found<00:05:30.370> kind<00:05:31.370> of<00:05:31.430> a
