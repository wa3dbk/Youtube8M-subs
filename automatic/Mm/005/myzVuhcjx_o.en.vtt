00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:46.290 

my<00:04:36.470> time<00:04:37.009> is<00:04:37.370> up<00:04:37.580> but<00:04:38.500> loss<00:04:39.580> so<00:04:40.580> we'll<00:04:40.970> be<00:04:41.180> dude

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
it is true the Magna code has brought

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.960 
it is true the Magna code has brought
all<00:04:49.669> the<00:04:50.030> crystals<00:04:50.449> to<00:04:50.690> know<00:04:50.840> the<00:04:51.110> Jen's<00:04:51.409> to<00:04:51.710> me

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
all the crystals to know the Jen's to me

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.600 
all the crystals to know the Jen's to me
ultimate<00:04:52.970> power<00:04:53.000> is<00:04:53.539> mine<00:04:53.620> the<00:04:54.620> world<00:04:54.889> as<00:04:55.400> we

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.980 

the<00:06:18.930> time<00:06:19.259> crystals<00:06:20.040> could<00:06:20.850> not<00:06:21.120> hold<00:06:21.509> itself

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
the time crystals could not hold itself

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:31.670 
the time crystals could not hold itself
together<00:06:22.370> we<00:06:23.370> were<00:06:23.580> lucky<00:06:24.270> to<00:06:24.449> escape<00:06:30.410> give<00:06:31.410> me
