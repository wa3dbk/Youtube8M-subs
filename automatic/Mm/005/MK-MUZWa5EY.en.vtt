 have an account created must connect 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.080
 and then once the file will be 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.640
 already thanks to this torrent file 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.680
 he wants the file to be downloaded 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.810
 via bittorrent we can then the 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.090
 transcribe as an iso file into 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.390
 twilight worlds install it and will 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.110

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.959
 ask him and it's actually 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.049
 an iso file 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:32.600

 can all closed you just go 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.700
 the daemon tools has already realized 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.739
 completely free software I am 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.769
 always only two in the simple of a 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.470
 free feel complicated we take it 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.060
 in add an image 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.870
 we will then look for it well I 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.250
 will do as if I were on my 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.680
 office he went out put a little bit we'll 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.280
 so look where he is yes to 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:02.230
 save and normally we will 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.940
 to take in it is to oblige on 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.290
 we're going to shout at the catalog 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.209
 of images it plays in the catalog in 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.860
 double click on it 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:14.060
 hop there is disassemble rising price is 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.580
 so of world of life that we can 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.750
 then close it and there would you 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.400
 ask for the file from a stage the 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.260
 folder listing station where the 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.610
 you click on install the game 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.190
 settle down it takes a while 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.299
 when he takes it I believe about 25 to 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.980
 30 minutes to settle 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.600
 its winds and no but the game is 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.190
 really 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.840
 even it's really huge 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.790
 so I speak in his facilities 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.670
 since it is already installed if you 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.470
 give up the hair 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.600
 so here's after you did that yourself 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.790
 go back to twilight worlds and there 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.350
 you think well right click on the 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.490
 part of the bottom right click makes us 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.840
 disassemble all drives 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.240
 because in fact he every time in 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.860
 the pc he 'll stay here but who will 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.570
 leave the virtual cd installed 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.280
 so it's not necessary because I step 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.500
 you go number 3 10 to propose 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.080
