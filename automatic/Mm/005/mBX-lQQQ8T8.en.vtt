00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.140 
Gunners and it really gives me that
flexibility<00:04:36.900> because<00:04:37.080> again<00:04:37.680> we<00:04:38.639> have<00:04:38.790> a<00:04:38.820> set

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
flexibility because again we have a set

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.470 
flexibility because again we have a set
list<00:04:39.470> but<00:04:40.470> John<00:04:40.850> might<00:04:41.850> change<00:04:42.180> it<00:04:42.330> on<00:04:42.419> the

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
list but John might change it on the

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.110 
list but John might change it on the
spur<00:04:42.720> of<00:04:42.750> the<00:04:42.840> moment<00:04:43.020> I<00:04:43.230> wouldn't<00:04:43.590> know<00:04:43.740> and

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
spur of the moment I wouldn't know and

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.909 
spur of the moment I wouldn't know and
my<00:04:45.120> guitar<00:04:45.180> tech<00:04:45.720> Billy<00:04:46.020> gosser<00:04:46.530> wouldn't<00:04:46.830> be

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
my guitar tech Billy gosser wouldn't be

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.920 
my guitar tech Billy gosser wouldn't be
ready<00:04:47.160> so<00:04:47.910> we're<00:04:48.090> caught<00:04:48.300> in<00:04:48.330> a<00:04:48.510> quandary

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
ready so we're caught in a quandary

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.320 
ready so we're caught in a quandary
sometimes<00:04:49.470> and<00:04:49.830> this<00:04:50.070> solves<00:04:50.550> a<00:04:50.639> problem<00:04:50.669> so

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
sometimes and this solves a problem so

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.540 
sometimes and this solves a problem so
you<00:04:51.600> know<00:04:52.470> he<00:04:52.590> wants<00:04:52.860> to<00:04:52.950> do<00:04:53.070> a<00:04:53.100> tomb<00:04:53.340> in<00:04:53.460> the

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
you know he wants to do a tomb in the

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.710 
you know he wants to do a tomb in the
key<00:04:53.729> of<00:04:53.760> a<00:04:54.419> no<00:04:55.290> problem
