drag out one of the designers earlier on
the<00:01:02.359> early<00:01:02.870> prototypes<00:01:03.469> didn't<00:01:03.829> have<00:01:03.980> this

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
the early prototypes didn't have this

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.310 
the early prototypes didn't have this
really<00:01:04.610> sharp<00:01:04.850> creasing<00:01:05.540> on<00:01:05.660> the<00:01:05.750> side<00:01:05.990> and

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320

creases<00:01:13.820> into<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:14.150> aluminium<00:01:14.360> they've<00:01:15.110> also

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
creases into the aluminium they've also

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.630 
creases into the aluminium they've also
admitted<00:01:15.830> that<00:01:15.950> that<00:01:16.040> was<00:01:16.160> actually<00:01:16.280> quite

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
admitted that that was actually quite

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.700 
admitted that that was actually quite
hard<00:01:16.850> to<00:01:16.970> do<00:01:17.210> but<00:01:17.660> anyway<00:01:17.960> the<00:01:18.200> car<00:01:18.440> looks

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
hard to do but anyway the car looks

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
hard to do but anyway the car looks
better<00:01:18.950> for<00:01:19.370> it

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
better for it

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.090 
better for it
now<00:01:20.120> the<00:01:20.690> other<00:01:20.810> key<00:01:21.020> thing<00:01:21.260> about<00:01:21.350> about<00:01:21.950> this

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
now the other key thing about about this

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.030 
now the other key thing about about this
car<00:01:22.430> is<00:01:22.690> this<00:01:23.690> hexagon<00:01:24.350> theme<00:01:24.650> I<00:01:24.830> don't<00:01:24.980> know

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
car is this hexagon theme I don't know

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.740 
car is this hexagon theme I don't know
whether<00:01:25.190> you've<00:01:25.310> noticed<00:01:25.700> or<00:01:25.820> not<00:01:25.880> but<00:01:26.210> pretty

somewhere<00:01:29.150> so<00:01:29.330> you've<00:01:29.510> got<00:01:29.690> hexagons<00:01:30.230> in<00:01:30.260> the

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
somewhere so you've got hexagons in the

somewhere so you've got hexagons in the
wing<00:01:30.620> mirrors<00:01:30.920> shape<00:01:31.160> you've<00:01:31.640> got<00:01:31.790> a<00:01:31.820> hexagon

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
wing mirrors shape you've got a hexagon

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.180 
wing mirrors shape you've got a hexagon
in<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:32.870> rear<00:01:33.050> shade<00:01:33.320> you<00:01:33.470> got<00:01:33.590> hexagons<00:01:34.070> on

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
in the rear shade you got hexagons on

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.500 
in the rear shade you got hexagons on
the<00:01:34.310> engine<00:01:34.640> cover<00:01:34.670> with<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.180> number<00:01:35.420> of

the engine cover with the number of
cylinders<00:01:36.020> on<00:01:36.230> it

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 
cylinders on it

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.230 
cylinders on it
you've<00:01:37.160> got<00:01:37.280> hexagons<00:01:37.790> all<00:01:37.910> over<00:01:38.150> the
