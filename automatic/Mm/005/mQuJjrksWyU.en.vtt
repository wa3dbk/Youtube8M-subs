there are some interesting theory points

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:12.940 
there are some interesting theory points
that<00:01:11.930> we<00:01:11.990> can<00:01:12.140> take<00:01:12.259> a<00:01:12.290> look<00:01:12.380> at<00:01:12.619> in<00:01:12.770> dear

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
that we can take a look at in dear

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.950 
that we can take a look at in dear
Prudence<00:01:13.310> one<00:01:13.880> is<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:14.240> chord<00:01:14.450> progression

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
Prudence one is the chord progression

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.240 
Prudence one is the chord progression
well<00:01:15.170> actually<00:01:15.500> before<00:01:15.680> we<00:01:15.830> get<00:01:15.920> to<00:01:16.009> the<00:01:16.070> chord

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
well actually before we get to the chord

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.170 
well actually before we get to the chord
progression<00:01:16.610> we<00:01:16.670> could<00:01:16.790> talk<00:01:16.880> about<00:01:16.910> the

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
progression we could talk about the

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.030 
progression we could talk about the
tuning<00:01:17.509> it's<00:01:17.630> in<00:01:17.750> drop<00:01:17.990> D<00:01:18.229> tuning<00:01:18.259> and<00:01:18.830> this<00:01:18.920> is

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
tuning it's in drop D tuning and this is

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.650 
tuning it's in drop D tuning and this is
a<00:01:19.070> common<00:01:19.460> so<00:01:19.610> the<00:01:19.700> 6th<00:01:19.970> string<00:01:20.150> is<00:01:20.270> tuned<00:01:20.450> down

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
a common so the 6th string is tuned down

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:29.350 
a common so the 6th string is tuned down
to<00:01:20.869> be

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.350 

for<00:01:30.230> simple<00:01:30.650> chords<00:01:30.980> although<00:01:31.670> there's<00:01:31.910> some

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
for simple chords although there's some

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.640 
for simple chords although there's some
unusual<00:01:32.750> ways<00:01:32.870> of<00:01:33.050> fingering<00:01:33.380> them

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.350 

right<00:01:39.400> hand<00:01:39.640> dear<00:01:40.030> Prudence<00:01:40.390> it<00:01:40.690> is<00:01:41.260> so<00:01:41.880> i<00:01:42.880> want

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
right hand dear Prudence it is so i want

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.150 
right hand dear Prudence it is so i want
to<00:01:43.390> say<00:01:43.540> regular<00:01:43.900> it<00:01:44.290> is<00:01:44.470> regular<00:01:44.800> I<00:01:44.890> want<00:01:45.070> to

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
to say regular it is regular I want to

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.650 
to say regular it is regular I want to
say<00:01:45.250> simple<00:01:45.580> but<00:01:45.730> it's<00:01:45.850> not<00:01:46.030> really<00:01:46.210> simple

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
say simple but it's not really simple

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.300 
say simple but it's not really simple
but<00:01:46.990> it<00:01:47.110> is<00:01:47.230> very<00:01:47.320> regular<00:01:47.890> and<00:01:48.040> so<00:01:48.160> that's

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
but it is very regular and so that's

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.400 
but it is very regular and so that's
what<00:01:48.520> we're<00:01:48.640> trying<00:01:48.790> to<00:01:48.910> do<00:01:49.060> here<00:01:49.090> is<00:01:49.410> Travis

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
what we're trying to do here is Travis

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.740 
what we're trying to do here is Travis
picking<00:01:50.770> has<00:01:51.220> your<00:01:51.430> thumb<00:01:51.670> alternating<00:01:52.600> back

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
picking has your thumb alternating back

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.290 
picking has your thumb alternating back
and<00:01:52.780> forth<00:01:53.200> between<00:01:53.410> two<00:01:53.890> base<00:01:54.130> notes<00:01:54.460> in<00:01:55.210> a

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
and forth between two base notes in a

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.850 
and forth between two base notes in a
lot<00:01:55.450> of<00:01:55.540> time<00:01:55.690> so<00:01:56.140> we've<00:01:56.500> looked<00:01:56.620> at<00:01:56.740> the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
lot of time so we've looked at the

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.050 
lot of time so we've looked at the
finger-picking<00:01:57.220> we've<00:01:57.520> talked<00:01:57.730> about<00:01:57.850> some

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
finger-picking we've talked about some

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.850 
finger-picking we've talked about some
of<00:01:58.180> the<00:01:58.240> chord<00:01:58.450> shapes<00:01:58.750> here's<00:01:59.500> how<00:01:59.740> we're

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
of the chord shapes here's how we're

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.380 
of the chord shapes here's how we're
going<00:01:59.950> to<00:02:00.040> put<00:02:00.130> it<00:02:00.220> all<00:02:00.310> together<00:02:00.460> the<00:02:01.060> intro

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
going to put it all together the intro

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.700 
going to put it all together the intro
so<00:02:01.510> again<00:02:01.690> we<00:02:01.780> have<00:02:01.930> to<00:02:02.050> have<00:02:02.170> this<00:02:02.290> pattern

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
so again we have to have this pattern

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.410 
so again we have to have this pattern

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
down I'm just playing a D chord now but

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.030 
down I'm just playing a D chord now but
let's<00:02:04.540> talk<00:02:04.750> again<00:02:04.900> briefly<00:02:05.290> in<00:02:05.770> case<00:02:05.920> you
