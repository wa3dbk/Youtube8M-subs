no it's the wrong lab coat I don't like

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.500 
no it's the wrong lab coat I don't like
long<00:00:11.240> lab<00:00:11.510> coats<00:00:11.840> because<00:00:12.110> you<00:00:12.230> can't<00:00:13.510> you

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:14.510 
long lab coats because you can't you

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.490 
long lab coats because you can't you

the components in the bacterium that are

the components in the bacterium that are
very<00:01:03.769> unusual<00:01:04.180> what<00:01:05.180> you<00:01:05.799> have<00:01:06.799> to<00:01:07.010> do<00:01:07.190> is<00:01:07.600> in

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
very unusual what you have to do is in

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.180 
very unusual what you have to do is in
the<00:01:08.810> past<00:01:09.050> you<00:01:09.350> had<00:01:09.560> to<00:01:09.590> turn<00:01:09.920> this

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
the past you had to turn this

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.460 
the past you had to turn this
mechanically<00:01:10.760> but<00:01:11.420> now<00:01:11.660> you've<00:01:12.020> got<00:01:12.230> its

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
mechanically but now you've got its

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.230 
mechanically but now you've got its
motor<00:01:12.770> driven<00:01:13.130> so<00:01:13.880> that<00:01:14.210> your<00:01:15.370> block<00:01:16.370> here<00:01:16.820> is

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
motor driven so that your block here is

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.730 
motor driven so that your block here is
put<00:01:17.660> in<00:01:17.840> a<00:01:17.960> Chuck<00:01:18.730> mounted<00:01:19.730> here<00:01:20.150> and<00:01:20.360> then<00:01:21.200> you

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
put in a Chuck mounted here and then you

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.540 
put in a Chuck mounted here and then you
have<00:01:21.770> this<00:01:22.400> glass<00:01:22.730> knife<00:01:23.210> and<00:01:23.630> you<00:01:24.080> have<00:01:24.550> water

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
have this glass knife and you have water

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.700 
have this glass knife and you have water
if<00:01:26.060> we<00:01:26.120> can<00:01:26.570> get<00:01:26.990> a<00:01:27.020> little<00:01:27.320> water<00:01:27.680> there<00:01:28.220> and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
if we can get a little water there and

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.750 
if we can get a little water there and
the<00:01:30.710> sections<00:01:31.340> that<00:01:32.150> you<00:01:32.600> cut<00:01:33.010> will<00:01:34.010> float<00:01:34.460> off

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
the sections that you cut will float off

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:41.230 
the sections that you cut will float off
on<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:36.770> surface<00:01:37.340> of<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:38.890> water<00:01:39.890> and<00:01:40.340> then

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
on the surface of the water and then

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.980 
on the surface of the water and then
when<00:01:41.900> that's<00:01:42.110> done<00:01:42.520> you<00:01:43.520> take<00:01:43.850> a<00:01:44.180> suitable

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
when that's done you take a suitable

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.800 
when that's done you take a suitable
dyes<00:01:45.260> in<00:01:46.190> this<00:01:46.460> instance<00:01:46.940> the<00:01:47.090> blue<00:01:47.300> one<00:01:47.780> that

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
dyes in this instance the blue one that

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.400 
dyes in this instance the blue one that
will<00:01:48.170> make<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:48.680> bacteria<00:01:49.220> go<00:01:49.430> blue<00:01:50.080> this<00:01:51.080> one

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
will make the bacteria go blue this one

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.860 
will make the bacteria go blue this one
which<00:01:51.860> will<00:01:52.100> make<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.520> plant<00:01:52.790> cells<00:01:53.180> go<00:01:53.510> red

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870 
which will make the plant cells go red

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.840 
which will make the plant cells go red
and<00:01:54.430> then<00:01:55.430> you<00:01:55.940> look<00:01:56.690> at<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:57.340> slide<00:01:58.340> with<00:01:58.820> the

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
and then you look at the slide with the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.380 
and then you look at the slide with the
sections<00:01:59.600> on<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:00.740> slide<00:02:01.040> under<00:02:01.730> a<00:02:01.909> good

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
sections on the slide under a good

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.860 
sections on the slide under a good
microscope<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:03.409> the<00:02:03.830> image<00:02:04.370> then<00:02:04.790> with<00:02:05.570> luck

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
microscope and the image then with luck

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.089 
microscope and the image then with luck
appears<00:02:06.800> on<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.460> screen<00:02:07.850> and<00:02:08.229> so<00:02:09.229> in<00:02:09.590> this

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
appears on the screen and so in this

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:16.780 
appears on the screen and so in this
case<00:02:11.080> we<00:02:12.080> have<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:13.550> plant<00:02:14.450> cells<00:02:15.370> here<00:02:16.370> you

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
case we have the plant cells here you

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.260 
case we have the plant cells here you
see<00:02:17.120> a<00:02:17.420> plus

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
see a plus

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.650 
see a plus

polysaccharide<00:03:10.530> that<00:03:10.560> I<00:03:10.950> talked<00:03:11.280> about<00:03:11.690> which

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
polysaccharide that I talked about which

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.830 
polysaccharide that I talked about which
the<00:03:12.990> bacterium<00:03:13.770> produces<00:03:14.460> the<00:03:14.790> green<00:03:15.390> plant

the bacterium produces the green plant
is<00:03:16.200> very<00:03:16.860> good<00:03:17.490> at<00:03:17.640> lots<00:03:17.850> of<00:03:18.090> things<00:03:18.390> but<00:03:18.780> one

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
is very good at lots of things but one

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.890 
is very good at lots of things but one
of<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.620> thing<00:03:19.830> that<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.250> plant<00:03:20.640> cannot<00:03:21.210> do<00:03:21.510> by

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
of the thing that a plant cannot do by

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.230 
of the thing that a plant cannot do by
itself<00:03:22.380> is<00:03:22.740> to<00:03:22.980> fix<00:03:23.220> nitrogen<00:03:24.020> the<00:03:25.020> only

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
itself is to fix nitrogen the only

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
organisms that fix nitrogen in the world

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.550 
organisms that fix nitrogen in the world
are<00:03:29.400> bacteria<00:03:30.209> and<00:03:30.890> these<00:03:31.890> bacteria<00:03:32.820> normally

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
to health I was very surprised that it

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.939 
to health I was very surprised that it
