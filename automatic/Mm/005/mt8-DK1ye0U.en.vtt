00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
the nine broken bolts that we're in the

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.950 
the nine broken bolts that we're in the
roller<00:00:53.989> frame<00:00:55.239> pull<00:00:56.239> them<00:00:56.449> out<00:00:56.569> I<00:00:56.629> guess<00:00:56.839> I

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
roller frame pull them out I guess I

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.299 
roller frame pull them out I guess I
should<00:00:57.139> have<00:00:57.199> made<00:00:57.350> a<00:00:57.379> video<00:00:57.559> doing<00:00:58.010> it<00:00:58.100> but<00:00:58.249> it

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
should have made a video doing it but it

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.410 
should have made a video doing it but it
was<00:00:58.460> too<00:00:58.489> pissed<00:00:58.940> to<00:00:59.389> pin<00:00:59.569> it<00:00:59.719> um<00:01:00.530> you<00:01:01.339> take<00:01:02.239> the

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
was too pissed to pin it um you take the

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.730 
was too pissed to pin it um you take the
center<00:01:02.719> punch<00:01:02.960> in<00:01:03.170> and<00:01:03.319> punch<00:01:03.350> the<00:01:04.100> hole<00:01:04.280> and

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
center punch in and punch the hole and

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.649

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
center and then you can drill it with

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.200 
center and then you can drill it with
the<00:01:11.540> bigger<00:01:11.750> drill<00:01:12.110> and<00:01:12.760> take<00:01:13.760> an<00:01:13.910> easy<00:01:14.060> out

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
the bigger drill and take an easy out

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.760 
the bigger drill and take an easy out
see<00:01:14.630> if<00:01:14.660> you<00:01:14.780> can<00:01:14.900> get<00:01:15.020> it<00:01:15.140> loose<00:01:15.320> a<00:01:15.590> lot<00:01:15.710> of

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
see if you can get it loose a lot of

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.140 
see if you can get it loose a lot of
times<00:01:15.980> you<00:01:16.100> got<00:01:16.190> to<00:01:16.340> heat<00:01:16.460> it<00:01:16.610> so<00:01:16.760> usually<00:01:17.030> what

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
times you got to heat it so usually what

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.450 
times you got to heat it so usually what
I<00:01:17.180> do<00:01:17.270> is<00:01:17.510> drill<00:01:17.690> a<00:01:17.720> small<00:01:17.930> hole<00:01:18.110> then<00:01:18.590> take<00:01:19.310> the

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
I do is drill a small hole then take the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.210 
I do is drill a small hole then take the
torch<00:01:19.730> and<00:01:20.000> just<00:01:20.750> heat<00:01:21.590> it<00:01:21.710> up<00:01:21.800> and<00:01:22.010> blow<00:01:22.190> a

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
torch and just heat it up and blow a

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.830 
torch and just heat it up and blow a
hole<00:01:22.490> through<00:01:22.520> make<00:01:23.030> make<00:01:23.330> a<00:01:23.360> hole<00:01:23.600> little

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
hole through make make a hole little

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.180 
hole through make make a hole little
bigger<00:01:23.990> with<00:01:24.260> the<00:01:24.350> torch<00:01:24.590> that<00:01:24.860> heats<00:01:25.100> the

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
bigger with the torch that heats the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.620 
bigger with the torch that heats the
bolt<00:01:25.430> up<00:01:25.610> makes<00:01:25.820> it<00:01:25.940> loose<00:01:26.060> usually<00:01:26.360> put<00:01:26.510> the

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
bolt up makes it loose usually put the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.540 
bolt up makes it loose usually put the
easy-out<00:01:26.870> in<00:01:27.200> I<00:01:27.470> use<00:01:28.250> a<00:01:28.510> tap<00:01:29.510> tool<00:01:30.520> because<00:01:31.520> you

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
easy-out in I use a tap tool because you

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.430 
easy-out in I use a tap tool because you
can<00:01:31.670> put<00:01:31.970> equal<00:01:32.510> pressure<00:01:32.750> on<00:01:32.960> it<00:01:33.080> instead<00:01:33.350> of

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
can put equal pressure on it instead of

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.960 
can put equal pressure on it instead of
a<00:01:33.530> wrench<00:01:33.740> on<00:01:33.950> there<00:01:34.160> I<00:01:34.190> just<00:01:34.460> put<00:01:34.640> that<00:01:34.790> on

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
a wrench on there I just put that on

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.150 
a wrench on there I just put that on
there<00:01:35.150> and<00:01:35.180> if<00:01:36.110> you<00:01:36.290> can<00:01:36.470> get<00:01:36.620> it<00:01:36.710> working<00:01:36.830> back

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
there and if you can get it working back

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.620 
there and if you can get it working back
and<00:01:37.310> forth<00:01:37.550> when<00:01:37.790> it's<00:01:37.970> hot<00:01:38.090> it'll<00:01:38.300> they'll

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
and forth when it's hot it'll they'll

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.070 
and forth when it's hot it'll they'll
usually<00:01:38.840> go<00:01:39.080> ahead<00:01:39.230> and<00:01:39.470> come<00:01:39.620> on<00:01:39.770> out<00:01:40.120> I<00:01:41.120> had<00:01:42.050> a

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
usually go ahead and come on out I had a

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.040 
usually go ahead and come on out I had a
couple<00:01:42.320> bad<00:01:42.560> rollers<00:01:43.040> and<00:01:43.220> they<00:01:43.340> were<00:01:44.050> watered

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
couple bad rollers and they were watered

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.900 
couple bad rollers and they were watered
