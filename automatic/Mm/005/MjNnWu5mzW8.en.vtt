our King legends

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.280 
our King legends
scheme<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.890> mean<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:38.970> like<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.330> concept<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.110> this

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
scheme I mean I like the concept of this

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.040 
scheme I mean I like the concept of this
game<00:01:40.730> it's<00:01:41.730> very<00:01:41.820> similar<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.810> other

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
game it's very similar to this other

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.650 
game it's very similar to this other
game<00:01:43.320> they<00:01:43.500> play<00:01:43.710> before<00:01:43.890> which<00:01:44.370> I<00:01:44.640> have<00:01:45.420> on<00:01:45.450> my

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
game they play before which I have on my

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.480 
game they play before which I have on my
channel<00:01:45.690> it's<00:01:46.080> like<00:01:46.260> a<00:01:46.290> Chinese<00:01:46.740> game<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.220> tried

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
channel it's like a Chinese game I tried

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.300 
channel it's like a Chinese game I tried
a<00:01:47.760> lot<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.510> long<00:01:48.660> time<00:01:48.900> ago<00:01:49.170> game<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.070> almost

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
a lot a long time ago game is almost

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.030 
a lot a long time ago game is almost
exactly<00:01:50.730> the<00:01:51.090> same<00:01:51.120> except<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:52.470> game<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.920> in

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
exactly the same except this game is in

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.130 
exactly the same except this game is in
English<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:54.030> does<00:01:54.240> have<00:01:54.510> a<00:01:54.540> ton<00:01:55.110> of

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
English and it does have a ton of

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:04.040 
English and it does have a ton of
framerate<00:01:55.830> problems<00:02:01.280> I<00:02:02.630> mean<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.720> like<00:02:03.900> the

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
framerate problems I mean I like the

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.100 
framerate problems I mean I like the
concept<00:02:04.350> with<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.770> game<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.760> if<00:02:06.300> they<00:02:06.690> fix<00:02:06.960> the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
concept with the game is if they fix the

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.680 
concept with the game is if they fix the
lag<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:07.530> would<00:02:07.770> be<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:07.980> good<00:02:08.220> game<00:02:08.690> especially

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
lag this would be a good game especially

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.180 
lag this would be a good game especially
once<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.230> start<00:02:10.500> partying<00:02:10.920> with<00:02:11.040> other

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
once you start partying with other

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.740 
once you start partying with other
players<00:02:11.490> should<00:02:12.270> get<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.480> lot<00:02:12.720> more

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
players should get a lot more

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:24.350 
players should get a lot more
interesting

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.490 

muscle<00:02:25.360> guessing<00:02:25.630> skin<00:02:25.840> will<00:02:26.020> have<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.260> lot<00:02:26.470> of

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
muscle guessing skin will have a lot of

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.250 
muscle guessing skin will have a lot of
in-app<00:02:26.830> purchases<00:02:27.400> at<00:02:27.580> this<00:02:27.730> blue<00:02:28.060> mobile<00:02:28.510> and

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
in-app purchases at this blue mobile and

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.800 
in-app purchases at this blue mobile and
guessing<00:02:29.710> this<00:02:29.860> can<00:02:30.040> be<00:02:30.160> kind<00:02:30.280> of<00:02:30.400> expensive

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
guessing this can be kind of expensive

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.890 
guessing this can be kind of expensive
such<00:02:31.810> as<00:02:31.960> might<00:02:32.200> guess<00:02:33.270> they<00:02:34.270> just<00:02:34.450> made<00:02:34.660> it<00:02:34.780> to

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
such as might guess they just made it to

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.420 
such as might guess they just made it to
the<00:02:34.990> main<00:02:35.170> town<00:02:35.380> I'm<00:02:35.590> like<00:02:35.800> already<00:02:36.040> at<00:02:36.220> level

the main town I'm like already at level

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.520 
the main town I'm like already at level
11<00:02:36.490> so<00:02:37.000> you<00:02:37.060> do<00:02:37.240> level<00:02:37.780> pretty<00:02:37.990> fast<00:02:38.200> this<00:02:38.350> game

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
11 so you do level pretty fast this game

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.220 
11 so you do level pretty fast this game

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
this game though the problem of course

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.470 
this game though the problem of course
is<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.440> framerate<00:03:26.680> lag<00:03:27.070> like<00:03:27.430> I'm<00:03:28.330> pretty

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
is the framerate lag like I'm pretty

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.450 
is the framerate lag like I'm pretty
sure<00:03:28.660> everyone<00:03:29.140> here<00:03:29.500> is<00:03:29.530> experiencing<00:03:30.280> the

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.460 
sure everyone here is experiencing the

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.850 
sure everyone here is experiencing the
same<00:03:30.640> thing<00:03:30.940> I'm<00:03:31.120> surprised<00:03:31.540> people<00:03:31.900> are

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
same thing I'm surprised people are

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.760 
same thing I'm surprised people are
still<00:03:33.070> playing<00:03:33.310> like<00:03:33.580> I<00:03:33.760> guess<00:03:33.970> like<00:03:34.470> when<00:03:35.470> it

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
still playing like I guess like when it

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:36.900 
still playing like I guess like when it
comes<00:03:35.860> to<00:03:36.040> games<00:03:36.220> like<00:03:36.370> this<00:03:36.490> people<00:03:36.790> don't

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910

just want to level up I don't know why

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.600 
just want to level up I don't know why
people<00:03:41.650> just<00:03:43.470> it<00:03:44.470> was<00:03:44.590> just<00:03:44.620> like<00:03:44.920> leveling<00:03:45.460> up

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.190 
probably assume that who mobile will
probably<00:03:51.910> fix<00:03:52.180> this<00:03:52.890> performance<00:03:53.890> problem<00:03:55.200> no

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
probably fix this performance problem no

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.110 
probably fix this performance problem no
they<00:03:56.350> want<00:03:56.500> to<00:03:56.590> when<00:03:57.190> a<00:03:57.220> head<00:03:57.430> start<00:03:57.670> his<00:03:57.880> game
