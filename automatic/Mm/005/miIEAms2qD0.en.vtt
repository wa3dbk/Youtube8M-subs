00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.500 

my<00:00:38.530> best<00:00:38.800> friend<00:00:39.160> his<00:00:39.640> name<00:00:39.670> was<00:00:39.970> Dave<00:00:40.180> and

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
my best friend his name was Dave and

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.660 
my best friend his name was Dave and
Dave<00:00:41.079> was<00:00:41.290> interested<00:00:41.770> in<00:00:41.829> playing<00:00:42.010> my<00:00:42.370> horn

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
Dave was interested in playing my horn

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.270 
Dave was interested in playing my horn
because<00:00:42.910> it<00:00:43.840> was<00:00:43.989> a<00:00:44.020> Bach<00:00:44.290> Stradivarius<00:00:45.100> it

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
because it was a Bach Stradivarius it

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.790 
because it was a Bach Stradivarius it
was<00:00:45.400> the<00:00:45.520> same<00:00:45.760> model<00:00:45.940> as<00:00:46.210> his<00:00:46.420> horn<00:00:46.720> but<00:00:47.559> mine

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
was the same model as his horn but mine

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.369 
was the same model as his horn but mine
was<00:00:48.070> 30<00:00:48.489> or<00:00:48.610> 35<00:00:49.210> years<00:00:49.239> old<00:00:49.690> and<00:00:49.930> his<00:00:50.200> was

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
was 30 or 35 years old and his was

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.920 
was 30 or 35 years old and his was
brand-new<00:00:50.800> so<00:00:51.460> we<00:00:51.610> swapped<00:00:51.879> horns<00:00:52.330> i<00:00:52.570> couldnt

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
brand-new so we swapped horns i couldnt

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.000 
brand-new so we swapped horns i couldnt
believe<00:00:52.989> how<00:00:53.170> well<00:00:53.379> that<00:00:53.530> horn<00:00:53.739> played

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
believe how well that horn played

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.040 
believe how well that horn played
compared<00:00:54.610> to<00:00:54.699> mine<00:00:54.910> because<00:00:55.720> they<00:00:55.840> were<00:00:55.930> the

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
compared to mine because they were the

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.110 
compared to mine because they were the
exact<00:00:56.410> same<00:00:56.620> model<00:00:56.860> he<00:00:57.280> gave<00:00:57.430> me<00:00:57.580> my<00:00:57.699> horn<00:00:57.910> back

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
exact same model he gave me my horn back

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.689 
exact same model he gave me my horn back
and<00:00:58.330> he<00:00:58.390> said<00:00:58.570> man<00:00:58.839> your<00:00:59.650> horn<00:00:59.890> plays<00:01:00.160> terrible

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
and he said man your horn plays terrible

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.640 
and he said man your horn plays terrible
that's<00:01:01.210> really<00:01:01.960> what<00:01:02.110> got<00:01:02.140> me<00:01:02.379> started

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.650 
that's really what got me started

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.070 
that's really what got me started
thinking<00:01:03.100> about<00:01:03.190> the<00:01:04.059> physics<00:01:04.479> of<00:01:04.750> how

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
thinking about the physics of how

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.380 
thinking about the physics of how
trumpets<00:01:05.619> are<00:01:05.740> designed<00:01:06.070> I<00:01:06.310> really<00:01:07.030> wanted<00:01:07.300> to

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
trumpets are designed I really wanted to

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.969 
trumpets are designed I really wanted to
understand<00:01:07.780> why<00:01:08.050> these<00:01:08.110> two<00:01:08.470> instruments

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
understand why these two instruments

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.340 
understand why these two instruments
would<00:01:09.130> play<00:01:09.430> so<00:01:09.789> different<00:01:10.210> the<00:01:10.810> transition

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
would play so different the transition

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.760 
would play so different the transition
from<00:01:11.729> playing<00:01:12.729> on<00:01:12.910> that<00:01:13.060> old<00:01:13.360> trumpet<00:01:13.899> to

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
from playing on that old trumpet to

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.490 
from playing on that old trumpet to
where<00:01:14.950> I<00:01:14.979> am<00:01:15.130> today<00:01:15.160> really<00:01:15.789> came<00:01:16.000> from

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
where I am today really came from

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.639 
where I am today really came from
experiments

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
experiments

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:20.490 
experiments
I<00:01:17.680> took<00:01:18.100> trumpets<00:01:18.759> apart<00:01:19.119> and<00:01:19.390> then<00:01:19.600> I<00:01:19.720> saw<00:01:20.320> how

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
I took trumpets apart and then I saw how

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.840 
I took trumpets apart and then I saw how
they<00:01:20.619> were<00:01:20.649> put<00:01:20.920> together<00:01:21.009> and<00:01:21.369> I<00:01:21.430> measured

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
they were put together and I measured

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.120 
they were put together and I measured
all<00:01:21.970> the<00:01:22.000> components<00:01:22.720> as<00:01:22.899> detailed<00:01:23.890> as<00:01:24.039> I

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
all the components as detailed as I

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.240 
all the components as detailed as I
could<00:01:24.539> the<00:01:25.539> artistic<00:01:25.960> side<00:01:26.380> of<00:01:26.649> building

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
could the artistic side of building

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.430 
could the artistic side of building
trumpet<00:01:27.640> really<00:01:27.910> comes<00:01:28.119> down<00:01:28.180> to<00:01:28.440> really

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
trumpet really comes down to really

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.200 
trumpet really comes down to really
understanding<00:01:30.009> how<00:01:30.399> to<00:01:30.430> do<00:01:30.729> metalwork

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
understanding how to do metalwork

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.359 
understanding how to do metalwork
forming<00:01:31.899> and<00:01:32.080> fabrication<00:01:32.680> with<00:01:32.830> your<00:01:32.979> hands

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
forming and fabrication with your hands

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.790 
forming and fabrication with your hands
as<00:01:33.970> well<00:01:34.240> as<00:01:34.390> machining<00:01:34.960> because<00:01:35.170> on<00:01:35.440> my<00:01:35.590> side

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
as well as machining because on my side

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.370 
as well as machining because on my side
of<00:01:35.890> things<00:01:36.100> I<00:01:36.910> machine<00:01:37.539> a<00:01:37.570> lot<00:01:37.840> of<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.050> parts

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
of things I machine a lot of the parts

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.789 
of things I machine a lot of the parts
and<00:01:38.530> then<00:01:38.830> incorporating<00:01:39.789> the<00:01:40.619> final<00:01:41.619> hand

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
and then incorporating the final hand

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.100 
and then incorporating the final hand
touches<00:01:42.280> and<00:01:42.580> all<00:01:42.759> the<00:01:42.850> artistic<00:01:43.390> things<00:01:43.930> with

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
touches and all the artistic things with

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.200 
touches and all the artistic things with
them<00:01:44.320> I've<00:01:44.920> gone<00:01:45.189> through<00:01:45.250> so<00:01:45.640> many<00:01:45.729> trumpets

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
them I've gone through so many trumpets

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.620 
them I've gone through so many trumpets
in<00:01:46.509> my<00:01:46.900> in<00:01:47.500> my<00:01:47.530> time<00:01:47.890> over<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:48.970> last<00:01:49.000> 20-some

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
in my in my time over the last 20-some

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.230 
in my in my time over the last 20-some
years<00:01:49.659> and<00:01:50.140> I<00:01:50.890> haven't<00:01:51.100> really<00:01:51.640> found<00:01:51.880> the

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
years and I haven't really found the

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.789 
years and I haven't really found the
right<00:01:52.450> horn<00:01:52.900> I<00:01:53.170> mean<00:01:53.380> there<00:01:53.530> was<00:01:53.619> always

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
right horn I mean there was always

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.789 
right horn I mean there was always
something<00:01:54.729> a<00:01:55.299> little<00:01:55.810> off<00:01:55.960> about<00:01:56.020> each<00:01:56.590> one

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
something a little off about each one

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.469 
something a little off about each one
that<00:01:56.890> I<00:01:56.950> would<00:01:57.040> have<00:01:57.310> and<00:01:57.610> then<00:01:57.909> the<00:01:58.270> more<00:01:58.450> I

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
that I would have and then the more I

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.600 
that I would have and then the more I
started<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:58.990> listen<00:01:59.470> and<00:01:59.860> to<00:02:00.220> think<00:02:00.430> about

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
started to listen and to think about

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.460 
started to listen and to think about
music<00:02:00.700> on<00:02:01.090> a<00:02:01.119> more<00:02:01.360> professional<00:02:01.930> level<00:02:02.049> I

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
music on a more professional level I

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.039 
music on a more professional level I
started<00:02:03.430> to<00:02:03.520> think<00:02:03.549> about<00:02:04.030> my<00:02:04.360> sound

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
started to think about my sound

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.620 
started to think about my sound
and<00:02:05.200> how<00:02:05.439> I<00:02:05.860> wanted<00:02:06.280> to<00:02:06.340> be<00:02:06.430> different<00:02:06.630> Joshua

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
and how I wanted to be different Joshua

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.300 
and how I wanted to be different Joshua
when<00:02:07.840> he<00:02:07.960> contacted<00:02:08.170> me<00:02:08.560> to<00:02:08.770> have<00:02:08.890> a<00:02:08.920> trumpet

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
when he contacted me to have a trumpet

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.360 
when he contacted me to have a trumpet
built<00:02:09.780> he<00:02:10.780> was<00:02:10.929> looking<00:02:11.230> for<00:02:11.470> a<00:02:11.500> specific<00:02:11.920> type

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
built he was looking for a specific type

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.710 
built he was looking for a specific type
of<00:02:12.430> sound<00:02:12.790> and<00:02:13.770> for<00:02:14.770> his<00:02:14.890> for<00:02:15.520> his<00:02:15.640> music<00:02:16.060> he

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
of sound and for his for his music he

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.589 
of sound and for his for his music he
wanted<00:02:16.870> something<00:02:17.290> that<00:02:17.470> really<00:02:18.099> has<00:02:18.370> a<00:02:18.670> vocal

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
wanted something that really has a vocal

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.589 
wanted something that really has a vocal
type<00:02:19.780> sound<00:02:20.170> so<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:20.860> built<00:02:21.340> his<00:02:21.640> trumpet<00:02:22.030> to

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
type sound so I built his trumpet to

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.130 
type sound so I built his trumpet to
sound<00:02:22.630> more<00:02:23.050> like<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.800> beautiful<00:02:24.730> big<00:02:25.720> dark

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
sound more like a beautiful big dark

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.550 
sound more like a beautiful big dark
voice<00:02:26.970> over<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.090> next<00:02:28.480> six<00:02:28.780> months<00:02:28.989> we<00:02:29.260> did<00:02:29.530> a

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
voice over the next six months we did a

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.850 
voice over the next six months we did a
lot<00:02:29.709> of<00:02:29.739> coordinating<00:02:30.280> as<00:02:30.580> far<00:02:30.819> as<00:02:31.830> how<00:02:32.830> I

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
lot of coordinating as far as how I

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.860 
lot of coordinating as far as how I
wanted<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.310> be<00:02:33.550> built<00:02:33.819> and<00:02:34.209> he<00:02:34.450> gave<00:02:34.630> me<00:02:34.720> a<00:02:34.750> lot

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
wanted to be built and he gave me a lot

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.039 
wanted to be built and he gave me a lot
of<00:02:34.930> perspective<00:02:35.319> because<00:02:35.920> he<00:02:36.400> has<00:02:36.550> a<00:02:36.580> very

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
of perspective because he has a very

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.890 
of perspective because he has a very
scientific<00:02:38.049> and<00:02:38.290> engineering<00:02:38.799> point<00:02:39.610> of<00:02:39.760> view

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
scientific and engineering point of view

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.870 
scientific and engineering point of view
as<00:02:40.900> well<00:02:41.140> as<00:02:41.350> an<00:02:41.470> amazing<00:02:41.890> horn<00:02:42.130> player<00:02:42.310> too<00:02:42.610> so

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
as well as an amazing horn player too so

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.360 
as well as an amazing horn player too so
he's<00:02:43.510> like<00:02:43.690> the<00:02:43.720> package<00:02:44.200> deal<00:02:44.470> where<00:02:44.980> science

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
he's like the package deal where science

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.100 
he's like the package deal where science
meets<00:02:45.430> sound<00:02:45.910> has<00:02:46.360> kind<00:02:46.600> of<00:02:46.660> been<00:02:46.750> our<00:02:46.870> tagline

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
meets sound has kind of been our tagline

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.380 
meets sound has kind of been our tagline
for<00:02:47.590> years<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:48.100> we<00:02:48.940> have<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.090> different

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
for years and we have a different

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.000 
for years and we have a different
approach<00:02:49.600> to<00:02:49.870> design<00:02:50.140> and<00:02:50.319> brass<00:02:50.440> instruments

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
approach to design and brass instruments

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.400 
approach to design and brass instruments
and<00:02:51.160> that's<00:02:51.370> really<00:02:51.610> incorporating

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
and that's really incorporating

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.289 
and that's really incorporating
acoustics<00:02:53.410> and<00:02:53.680> modern<00:02:54.280> technology<00:02:54.850> into<00:02:55.209> the

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
acoustics and modern technology into the

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.479 
acoustics and modern technology into the
design<00:02:55.630> and<00:02:55.900> building<00:02:56.140> of<00:02:56.290> trumpets<00:02:56.709> when<00:02:57.340> he

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
design and building of trumpets when he

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.520 
design and building of trumpets when he
was<00:02:57.670> building<00:02:57.970> my<00:02:58.120> trumpet<00:02:58.540> he<00:02:58.900> came<00:02:59.290> up<00:02:59.410> with

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
was building my trumpet he came up with

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.979 
was building my trumpet he came up with
a<00:02:59.560> combination<00:02:59.830> of<00:03:00.250> two<00:03:00.459> different<00:03:00.489> a<00:03:01.480> lead

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
a combination of two different a lead

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.930 
a combination of two different a lead
pipe<00:03:02.170> and<00:03:02.319> a<00:03:02.410> bell<00:03:02.590> that<00:03:03.250> when<00:03:03.640> you<00:03:03.700> put<00:03:03.849> them

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
pipe and a bell that when you put them

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.699 
pipe and a bell that when you put them
together<00:03:04.060> they<00:03:04.360> sound<00:03:04.690> really<00:03:04.840> really<00:03:05.530> dark

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
together they sound really really dark

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.360 
together they sound really really dark
and<00:03:06.330> I<00:03:07.330> when<00:03:08.200> I<00:03:08.230> when<00:03:08.530> I<00:03:08.560> played<00:03:08.830> the<00:03:08.950> horn<00:03:09.130> I

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
and I when I when I played the horn I

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.009 
and I when I when I played the horn I
thought<00:03:09.609> gosh<00:03:10.000> this<00:03:10.239> almost<00:03:10.540> sounds<00:03:10.750> like<00:03:10.989> a

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
thought gosh this almost sounds like a

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.259 
thought gosh this almost sounds like a
tuba<00:03:11.380> like<00:03:11.560> a<00:03:11.590> small<00:03:11.950> tuba<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:12.430> it<00:03:13.180> was

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
tuba like a small tuba and it was

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:22.710 
tuba like a small tuba and it was
perfect<00:03:13.660> it's<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:13.989> perfect<00:03:14.049> it's<00:03:14.410> way

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.210 

when<00:03:23.720> you<00:03:23.840> play<00:03:24.020> trumpet<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.590> most<00:03:24.770> important

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
when you play trumpet the most important

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.460 
when you play trumpet the most important
thing<00:03:25.400> is<00:03:25.610> the<00:03:25.850> sound<00:03:26.180> it<00:03:26.840> kind<00:03:27.080> of<00:03:27.140> goes<00:03:27.260> back

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
thing is the sound it kind of goes back

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.680 
thing is the sound it kind of goes back
to<00:03:27.530> just<00:03:27.950> being<00:03:28.070> human<00:03:28.460> like<00:03:29.390> when<00:03:29.540> my<00:03:29.660> mom

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
to just being human like when my mom

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.440 
to just being human like when my mom
would<00:03:29.990> call<00:03:30.110> me<00:03:30.260> for<00:03:30.410> breakfast<00:03:30.770> here<00:03:31.450> sounded

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
would call me for breakfast here sounded

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.810 
would call me for breakfast here sounded
like<00:03:32.570> her<00:03:32.750> tone<00:03:32.990> and<00:03:33.410> so<00:03:34.220> I<00:03:34.250> think<00:03:34.340> about<00:03:34.640> that

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
like her tone and so I think about that

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.150 
like her tone and so I think about that
with<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:35.000> trumpet<00:03:35.330> is<00:03:35.480> when<00:03:35.780> I<00:03:35.810> play<00:03:36.010> how<00:03:37.010> are

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
with the trumpet is when I play how are

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.370 
with the trumpet is when I play how are
people<00:03:37.280> going<00:03:37.580> to<00:03:37.670> remember<00:03:38.210> that<00:03:38.390> versus<00:03:39.260> how

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
people going to remember that versus how

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.890 
people going to remember that versus how
many<00:03:39.740> notes<00:03:40.040> that<00:03:40.190> I<00:03:40.280> play<00:03:40.490> or<00:03:40.730> how<00:03:41.420> high<00:03:41.630> did<00:03:41.690> I

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
many notes that I play or how high did I

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.150 
many notes that I play or how high did I
play<00:03:42.110> it's<00:03:42.320> more<00:03:42.530> or<00:03:42.620> less<00:03:42.650> leaving

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
play it's more or less leaving

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.660 
play it's more or less leaving
remembering<00:03:43.970> the<00:03:44.090> sound<00:03:44.390> I<00:03:48.670> think

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
remembering the sound I think

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.430 
remembering the sound I think
traditionally<00:03:50.450> in<00:03:50.510> the<00:03:50.540> past<00:03:50.600> trumpets<00:03:51.320> are

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
traditionally in the past trumpets are

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.100 
traditionally in the past trumpets are
always<00:03:51.680> known<00:03:51.890> as<00:03:52.040> this<00:03:52.240> really<00:03:53.240> high-pitched

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
always known as this really high-pitched

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.850 
always known as this really high-pitched
loud<00:03:54.970> blaring<00:03:55.970> instruments<00:03:56.960> that<00:03:57.500> can<00:03:57.680> almost

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
loud blaring instruments that can almost

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.340 
loud blaring instruments that can almost
sound<00:03:58.160> like<00:03:58.190> tinfoil<00:03:58.760> the<00:03:59.480> horn<00:03:59.750> itself<00:03:59.960> the

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
sound like tinfoil the horn itself the

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.220 
sound like tinfoil the horn itself the
way<00:04:00.440> he<00:04:00.620> belted<00:04:00.980> actually<00:04:01.430> really<00:04:01.670> supports

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
way he belted actually really supports

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.100 
way he belted actually really supports
the<00:04:03.230> darker<00:04:03.680> and<00:04:04.240> the<00:04:05.240> spectrum<00:04:05.660> I<00:04:05.750> said<00:04:05.930> give

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
the darker and the spectrum I said give

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:13.070 
the darker and the spectrum I said give
me<00:04:06.140> the<00:04:06.290> darkest<00:04:06.650> you<00:04:06.770> got<00:04:06.950> I'll<00:04:07.730> take<00:04:07.760> it

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.560 

there<00:04:14.080> are<00:04:14.170> actually<00:04:14.440> 81<00:04:14.980> pieces<00:04:15.459> in<00:04:15.670> this

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
there are actually 81 pieces in this

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.379 
there are actually 81 pieces in this
simplest<00:04:17.019> trumpet<00:04:17.410> that<00:04:17.440> I<00:04:17.590> build<00:04:17.889> so<00:04:18.340> I

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
simplest trumpet that I build so I

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.460 
simplest trumpet that I build so I
fabricate<00:04:19.389> and<00:04:19.540> build<00:04:19.720> almost<00:04:20.109> every<00:04:20.320> single

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
fabricate and build almost every single

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:46.200 
fabricate and build almost every single
piece<00:04:30.810> the<00:04:44.280> magic<00:04:45.280> really<00:04:45.520> happens<00:04:45.700> when<00:04:46.090> we

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
piece the magic really happens when we

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.200 
piece the magic really happens when we
put<00:04:46.389> all<00:04:46.479> these<00:04:46.600> parts<00:04:46.900> together<00:04:47.080> and<00:04:48.210> find

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
put all these parts together and find

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.210 
put all these parts together and find
that<00:04:49.479> everything<00:04:49.930> fits<00:04:50.139> perfect<00:04:50.650> and<00:04:50.860> then<00:04:51.130> I

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
that everything fits perfect and then I

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.650 
that everything fits perfect and then I
can<00:04:51.370> put<00:04:51.550> it<00:04:51.639> in<00:04:51.729> the<00:04:51.820> soldering<00:04:52.120> booth<00:04:52.389> and

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
can put it in the soldering booth and

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.840 
can put it in the soldering booth and
then<00:04:53.200> the<00:04:53.290> rest<00:04:53.470> is<00:04:53.620> soldering<00:04:54.070> and<00:04:54.340> cleaning

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
then the rest is soldering and cleaning

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.550 
then the rest is soldering and cleaning
it<00:04:54.940> up<00:04:55.090> when<00:04:55.660> it's<00:04:55.810> all<00:04:55.930> finished<00:04:55.960> and<00:04:56.500> I

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
it up when it's all finished and I

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.760 
it up when it's all finished and I

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
finally get to play it and test it out

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.560 
finally get to play it and test it out
yeah<00:04:59.770> it's<00:04:59.979> a<00:05:00.100> great<00:05:00.250> feeling<00:05:00.520> because<00:05:01.000> so

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
yeah it's a great feeling because so

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.120 
yeah it's a great feeling because so
much<00:05:01.720> time<00:05:02.020> and<00:05:02.229> energy<00:05:02.320> has<00:05:02.620> been<00:05:02.770> putted

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
much time and energy has been putted

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.670 
much time and energy has been putted
into<00:05:03.820> building<00:05:04.210> that<00:05:04.330> one<00:05:04.540> horn<00:05:04.840> every<00:05:05.139> one<00:05:05.560> of

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
into building that one horn every one of

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.260 
into building that one horn every one of
them<00:05:05.800> is<00:05:05.950> different<00:05:06.130> so<00:05:06.460> it's<00:05:06.639> it's<00:05:07.000> a<00:05:07.090> lot<00:05:07.240> of

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
them is different so it's it's a lot of

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.740 
them is different so it's it's a lot of
fun

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
fun

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.730 
fun
this<00:05:08.740> horn<00:05:09.010> particularly<00:05:09.690> supports<00:05:10.740> that

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
this horn particularly supports that

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.560 
this horn particularly supports that
individualism<00:05:12.430> and<00:05:12.760> I<00:05:13.090> think<00:05:13.330> it<00:05:13.450> really

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
individualism and I think it really

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.180 
individualism and I think it really
comes<00:05:13.870> from<00:05:13.930> his<00:05:14.169> craftsmanship<00:05:14.500> as<00:05:15.010> well

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
comes from his craftsmanship as well

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.040 
comes from his craftsmanship as well
that<00:05:16.289> he's<00:05:17.289> able<00:05:17.500> to<00:05:18.510> really<00:05:19.510> listen<00:05:19.690> to<00:05:19.930> what

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
that he's able to really listen to what

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.830 
that he's able to really listen to what
the<00:05:20.110> player<00:05:20.320> wants<00:05:20.590> and<00:05:21.389> him<00:05:22.389> being<00:05:22.539> a<00:05:22.660> player

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
the player wants and him being a player

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.930 
the player wants and him being a player
as<00:05:23.080> well<00:05:23.260> it's<00:05:23.650> so<00:05:23.800> easy<00:05:24.070> for<00:05:24.340> him<00:05:24.460> to<00:05:24.639> connect

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
as well it's so easy for him to connect

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.270 
as well it's so easy for him to connect
with<00:05:25.090> the<00:05:25.180> idea<00:05:25.510> his<00:05:26.229> connection<00:05:26.710> to<00:05:26.740> the<00:05:27.010> to

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
with the idea his connection to the to

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.640 
with the idea his connection to the to
the<00:05:27.370> instrument<00:05:27.820> itself<00:05:28.080> makes<00:05:29.080> it<00:05:29.229> easy<00:05:29.380> for

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
the instrument itself makes it easy for

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.680 
the instrument itself makes it easy for
him<00:05:29.860> to<00:05:29.919> understand<00:05:30.400> me<00:05:30.580> for<00:05:31.300> me<00:05:31.389> playing

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
him to understand me for me playing

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:32.430 
him to understand me for me playing
trumpet

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
trumpet

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.590 
trumpet
there's<00:05:32.680> more<00:05:32.979> of<00:05:33.070> a<00:05:33.160> connection<00:05:33.700> there<00:05:33.910> when

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
there's more of a connection there when

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.870 
there's more of a connection there when
I<00:05:34.630> perform<00:05:34.870> like<00:05:35.350> that<00:05:35.590> then<00:05:36.190> I<00:05:36.310> can<00:05:36.460> express

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
I perform like that then I can express

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.550 
I perform like that then I can express
whatever's<00:05:37.660> happening<00:05:38.020> so<00:05:38.260> if<00:05:38.380> I'm

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
whatever's happening so if I'm

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.200 
whatever's happening so if I'm
frustrated<00:05:39.430> about<00:05:39.550> something<00:05:39.669> we're<00:05:40.180> really

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
frustrated about something we're really

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.420 
frustrated about something we're really
excited<00:05:40.720> I<00:05:41.020> can<00:05:41.260> just<00:05:41.410> let<00:05:41.620> all<00:05:41.800> that<00:05:41.950> out<00:05:42.130> and

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
excited I can just let all that out and

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.700 
excited I can just let all that out and
for<00:05:42.910> me<00:05:43.030> it's<00:05:43.180> just<00:05:43.240> a<00:05:43.419> personal<00:05:43.840> experience<00:05:44.229> I

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
for me it's just a personal experience I

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.000 
for me it's just a personal experience I
think<00:05:45.160> art<00:05:45.550> is<00:05:45.910> really<00:05:46.840> nothing<00:05:47.139> more<00:05:47.350> than<00:05:47.410> an

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
think art is really nothing more than an

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.279 
think art is really nothing more than an
expression<00:05:48.789> of<00:05:48.970> really<00:05:49.600> what<00:05:49.780> you're<00:05:49.900> feeling

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:50.289 
expression of really what you're feeling

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:51.600 
expression of really what you're feeling
and<00:05:50.470> thinking<00:05:50.620> and<00:05:50.979> what<00:05:51.130> you<00:05:51.250> want<00:05:51.400> to<00:05:51.460> bring

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
and thinking and what you want to bring

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.629 
and thinking and what you want to bring
into<00:05:51.850> the<00:05:51.880> world<00:05:51.970> art<00:05:52.750> is<00:05:53.080> I<00:05:53.770> believe<00:05:54.039> the

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 
into the world art is I believe the

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:57.960 
into the world art is I believe the
human<00:05:55.000> voice<00:05:55.150> or<00:05:55.930> the<00:05:56.320> human<00:05:56.710> eye<00:05:56.919> or<00:05:56.950> its<00:05:57.460> it

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
human voice or the human eye or its it

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:03.119 
human voice or the human eye or its it
embodies<00:05:58.539> all<00:05:58.780> the<00:06:00.060> embodies<00:06:01.110> all<00:06:02.110> the<00:06:02.349> senses

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:03.129 
embodies all the embodies all the senses

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:04.229 
embodies all the embodies all the senses
and<00:06:03.189> I<00:06:03.279> think<00:06:03.520> that<00:06:03.699> that's<00:06:03.819> what's<00:06:04.089> beautiful

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:04.239 
and I think that that's what's beautiful

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:06.479 
and I think that that's what's beautiful
about<00:06:04.539> our<00:06:04.869> is<00:06:05.080> that<00:06:05.319> it's<00:06:05.499> the<00:06:05.770> true<00:06:05.919> flexion

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:06.489 
about our is that it's the true flexion

00:06:06.489 --> 00:06:09.929 
about our is that it's the true flexion
it's<00:06:06.939> the<00:06:07.149> true<00:06:07.330> history<00:06:07.449> book<00:06:07.869> I<00:06:08.939> probably

00:06:09.929 --> 00:06:09.939 
it's the true history book I probably

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:12.659 
it's the true history book I probably
play<00:06:10.449> about<00:06:10.659> two<00:06:10.899> hours<00:06:11.050> a<00:06:11.199> day<00:06:11.289> and<00:06:11.679> I

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:12.669 
play about two hours a day and I

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:14.639 
play about two hours a day and I
probably<00:06:13.239> play<00:06:13.419> in<00:06:13.569> 15<00:06:13.959> to<00:06:14.139> 30<00:06:14.349> minute

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:14.649 
probably play in 15 to 30 minute

00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:16.409 
probably play in 15 to 30 minute
sessions<00:06:15.039> just<00:06:15.610> in<00:06:15.759> between<00:06:15.909> building

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
sessions just in between building

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:19.109 
sessions just in between building
trumpets<00:06:16.779> so<00:06:17.349> it's<00:06:17.739> a<00:06:17.830> great<00:06:18.069> feeling<00:06:18.369> and<00:06:18.909> I
