hello I wanted to show you guys my
newest<00:00:10.700> xbox<00:00:11.180> three

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
newest xbox three

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.570 
newest xbox three
built<00:00:13.139> this<00:00:13.799> is<00:00:14.010> enough

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
built this is enough

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.630 
built this is enough
our<00:00:14.640> 17-inch<00:00:15.269> unit<00:00:15.570> it's<00:00:15.780> less<00:00:16.170> than<00:00:16.640> two

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
our 17-inch unit it's less than two

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.690 
our 17-inch unit it's less than two
inches<00:00:17.790> thick<00:00:17.940> like<00:00:18.360> most<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.779> them<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.050> do

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:19.700 
inches thick like most of them that I do

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.359 
inches thick like most of them that I do
its<00:00:20.900> construction<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:22.439> pretty<00:00:22.830> much<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.040> same

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
its construction is pretty much the same

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.370 
its construction is pretty much the same
of<00:00:23.610> the<00:00:23.759> other<00:00:23.910> ones<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.300> I've<00:00:24.420> done<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.900> the

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
of the other ones that I've done the the

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.160 
of the other ones that I've done the the
wiring<00:00:25.800> wise<00:00:25.950> at<00:00:26.160> least<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.640> did<00:00:27.180> beef<00:00:27.660> up<00:00:27.900> the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
wiring wise at least I did beef up the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.870 
wiring wise at least I did beef up the
aluminum<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.099> this<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.369> made<00:00:29.520> of<00:00:29.669> it's<00:00:29.820> a

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
aluminum that this is made of it's a

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.670 
aluminum that this is made of it's a
little<00:00:30.060> bit<00:00:30.150> thicker<00:00:30.330> aluminum<00:00:30.900> all<00:00:31.350> the<00:00:31.590> way

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
little bit thicker aluminum all the way

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.560 
little bit thicker aluminum all the way
around<00:00:31.770> so<00:00:32.189> it's<00:00:32.309> much<00:00:32.489> stronger<00:00:32.790> doesn't<00:00:33.449> add

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
around so it's much stronger doesn't add

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.869 
around so it's much stronger doesn't add
much<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.230> weight<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:34.830> I<00:00:35.040> think<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.640> helps

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
much to the weight so I think that helps

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.930 
much to the weight so I think that helps
out<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.300> lot<00:00:36.420> plus<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.440> went<00:00:38.160> with<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:38.550> black

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
out a lot plus I went with this black

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.060 
out a lot plus I went with this black
brush<00:00:39.720> finish<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.350> looks<00:00:40.470> like<00:00:40.710> black

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
brush finish that looks like black

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.700 
brush finish that looks like black
anodized<00:00:41.690> aluminum<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.870> really<00:00:43.530> like<00:00:43.680> that

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
anodized aluminum I really like that

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.329 
anodized aluminum I really like that
finish<00:00:44.960> this<00:00:45.960> one<00:00:46.199> also<00:00:46.379> has<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.830> bigger<00:00:47.040> hard

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:47.339 
finish this one also has the bigger hard

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.520 
finish this one also has the bigger hard
drive<00:00:47.400> in<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.879> it's<00:00:48.030> got<00:00:48.089> the<00:00:48.420> 320<00:00:49.110> gig<00:00:49.290> hard

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
drive in it it's got the 320 gig hard

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.410 
drive in it it's got the 320 gig hard
drive<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:50.269> I<00:00:51.799> put<00:00:52.799> a<00:00:53.010> full<00:00:53.580> graphic<00:00:54.059> on<00:00:54.210> top

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
drive and I put a full graphic on top

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.439 
drive and I put a full graphic on top
here<00:00:54.629> instead<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.440> paint<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:56.580> want<00:00:57.269> with<00:00:57.360> this
