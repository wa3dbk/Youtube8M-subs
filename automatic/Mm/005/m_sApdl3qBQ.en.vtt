00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.130 
and make sure that none of them are fake
obviously<00:02:22.640> because<00:02:23.510> that<00:02:23.660> would<00:02:23.780> be<00:02:23.930> a

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
obviously because that would be a

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.360 
obviously because that would be a
 move<00:02:24.769> and<00:02:24.920> then<00:02:25.010> that<00:02:25.160> wouldn't

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
 move and then that wouldn't

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.220 
 move and then that wouldn't
help<00:02:25.489> me<00:02:25.700> out<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:26.030> he<00:02:26.269> at<00:02:26.510> all<00:02:26.660> because<00:02:27.140> I

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
help me out and he at all because I

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.839 
help me out and he at all because I
doesn't<00:02:27.769> matter<00:02:27.950> how<00:02:28.040> many<00:02:28.069> subscribers<00:02:28.340> I

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849
