00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.000
 petrol by hand 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:13.369
 Are you sure that you fill in the real 95 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.619
 additive manufacturers offers it 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:24.270
 do by yourself 92 plus octane-corrector 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.860
 improves fuel quality improves 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.990
 octane number 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.990
 but the question is whether it will kill moto 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.720
 accidentally pour the surrogate tank on 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.180
 any even branded west so far 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.890
 dishonest tankers boost 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.210
 octane number adding to fuel 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.090
 prohibited additives 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.620
 what is sold in our country 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.220
 enough 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.750
 falsified gasoline is ford 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.580
 another conversation that the bodies 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.410
 state control who 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.050
 would be called to control the quality 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.900
 fuel is absent as a tank rector 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.470
 worth 150 rubles enough for 50 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.880
 liters and so everything is 92 plus for the bank 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.700
 it is three rubles per liter 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.530
 it turns out not cheaper 95 but suddenly it 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.119
 improve fuel quality but before 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.930
 give put tank let's try 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:19.140
 sort out the lab we took three 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.140
 additives from the tank tails German and 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.720
 American for 180 rubles and the Russian 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.110
 for 150 on banks of american and 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.260
 Russian additives 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:34.360
 German version contains three 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.040
 manganese carbonyl metal is correct a 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.440
 add fuel containing metal 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.630
 connection is forbidden from gasoline 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.270
 soot appears on the candles 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.890
 and the additive components are deposited as 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.320
 resins on valves and cylinders 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.020
 engine that quickly leads to expensive 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.430
 repair from such gasoline rises 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.840
 exhaust temperature 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.640
 burning neutralizer look like this 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.890
 choose satanic sales agent if gasoline 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.100
 contains not given and I wonder how much 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.200
 here markers may be dose 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.990
 slightly my strictly according to the instructions 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.230
 added additives to regular 92 petrol 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.970
 all samples will examine certified 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.280
 laboratories at the Russian 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.270
 Sponge State University 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.880
 oh fact the regulations are very hard 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.910
 the presence of metal chronic additives 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.780
 more than two pi pi um this is already bad 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.780
 affects work 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.130
 wherever we add nothing there 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.440
 no metals in gasoline from German 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.010
 additive is really manganese 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.860
 only its concentration is 100 times greater 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.020
 what is necessary that is, this additive can 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.100
 kill the engine and it offers us 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:53.400
 make your own gasoline hands with 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.090
 American additive manganese 50 times 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.850
 more norms 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.760
 fuel with Russian octane corrector we 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.770
 found a triple normal gland besides 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.680
 after a day the abyss and German 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:09.230
 additive darkened on the bottom formed a 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:12.470
 myself and if all this gets into the engine 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.629
 get ready cream 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.300
 before the cars appeared gasoline 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.080
 was just a byproduct when 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.330
 kerosene production 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.910
 almost no one needs green day 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.629
 burned or thrown away only a little 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.760
 leave for primus caps 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:32.489
 Hello, I need an antiseptic for 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.160
 wound treatment recommend new tools 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.840
 petrol 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.840
 this gasoline has side effects 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.720
 here to paint how is metal 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.440
 may be at least octane number 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.610
 will be more 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.340
 this is a four stroke single cylinder 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.050
 gasoline engine and growth 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.540
 designed specifically for 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.849
 determine the exact octane number 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.769
 gasoline 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:04.380
 the installation shows the moment of detonation and 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:07.110
 compression ratio in the cylinder move along 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:12.180
 these parameters are given octane number 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:14.900
 our 92 petrol without additives turned out to be 93 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.590
 it says here that the Ottawa number is gasoline 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.900
 may increase by 56 units 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.700
 98 do it yourself German additive 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.930
 increased octane number 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.850
 but not by 6 but only by 2 units 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:33.780
 American added only half a unit 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.729
 Russian one 70s promise 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:41.639
 noticeably raise the octane number 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:43.889
 turned out to be a hoax these additives kill 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.610
 motor and neutralizer add them 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.610
 expensive and stupid 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.800
 better not to risk giving a little 92 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.050
 gasoline and hold down to proven 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.170
 refueling it turns out that to protect against 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:02.040
 poorly 95 gasoline can not be 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:05.290
 but you can err 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.180
 buy gasoline for road stocks or for 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.710
 laboratory expertise and necessary 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.710
 be sure to keep the check
