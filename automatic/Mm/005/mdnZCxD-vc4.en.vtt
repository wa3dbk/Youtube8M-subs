00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:09.799
 here's an interesting thing if you do 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.230
 I used to ride a good car then 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:14.179
 the old wreck does not want to sit down if 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.400
 I used to drink a good coffee on the 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:20.570
 soluble doesn't even look and how in 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:23.090
 all clothes alcohol phone salary 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.690
 all good things have to be paid but sometimes 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.580
 not as much as the most affordable 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:31.280
 full-frame SLR from nick to 610 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.830
 glancing at the carcass or picked up 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.410
 hard to believe that this is a new model all 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.020
 exactly like the predecessors up to 600 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.750
 grip ergonomics control buttons 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.920
 Yes, you yourself see the body is made of 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.900
 magnesium alloy 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.290
 but a small amount of polycarbonate on 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.550
 front of you can find it 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.470
 dust and water proof of course torments him 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.470
 so if in my hand some 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.540
 up to 3 or d4 is not worth it but at the same time I 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.820
 snow and light rain ran out with him 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.520
 everything works fine in the hands of the camera 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.620
 lies just amazingly rubberized 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.210
 inserts prevent slipping and 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.340
 protruding elements provide 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.469
 strong grip on shocks 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.359
 or too sharp movements true i 

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:13.759
 I hope not to climb through the gum 

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:16.729
 six months or a year of active operation 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:19.549
 behind the mirror is 24 megapixel 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.189
 full frame matrix and yes it is the same 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:25.340
 as in the d600 is responsible for speed 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.799
 expeed 3 processor and yes it's the same as 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.380
 and predecessors well what does it give us on 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.329
 practice entertainment with not noticeable only 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.880
 minor device began to take off 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:37.490
 in frames all the bullets that half of the frame 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.829
 By the way, such a shooting appeared 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.689
 at 3 frames per second, but with 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.020
 compare with the legendary film 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.549
 something that the competitors he failed 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.590
 the possibilities of photographing have not changed 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.359
 dynamic range is enough for 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.579
 most standard and not very 

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:54.740
 situations we even if you experience 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.899
 flaw can get into the menu and 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.819
 enable extension result you 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.469
 pleasantly surprised value 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:03.619
 photosensitivity is in 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:06.859
 range from 100 to 6000 4 but available 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.409
 expansion from 50 to 25600 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:10.670
 face with the value of noise and soap 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:13.490
 really low 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.160
 36,400 but can safely be removed for 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.380
 reinsurance of course the enemy if 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.120
 try then survive adequate shot 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.190
 possible from higher values 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.890
 as usual we print the same 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.050
 a4 snapshot to see which 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.100
 the same limit of sensitivity in nikon 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.170
 d610 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:36.170
 and compare it to our reference 100 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:38.180
 units 800 1603 200 up in principle 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.940
 You can safely skip everything here 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.269
 almost the same as with the standard soap 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:47.540
 there is no noise there is no detail 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.819
 there is at 6,400 a slight 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.950
 noise but chalice in detail practically 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.080
 imperceptibly you can print freely 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.709
 large formats and do not worry that you 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.519
 for spit 12800 is quite a working if 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.000
 arms straight 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:05.000
 print a4 if the curves align and 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.739
 anyway printed nod 4 soap no 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.370
 my grandmother in the editor 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.310
 cope 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.290
 on 25600 of course you can print but 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.840
 only after literate rights kirov and 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.790
 pastor but dabble in size all the same 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.340
 there is no photographic opportunity 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.209
 guns will be able to satisfy videographers 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.359
 of all stripes 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.230
 full HD is written in 24 25 and 30 frames 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.840
 per second 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.790
 all this with progressive scan 60 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.340
 frames per second is available only came 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.989
 line scan nowhere and 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.720
 ports for connecting an external microphone 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.030
 and the output under the headphones because so write 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.609
 sound quality will be much easier and 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.340
 lovers of timelapse video is also a gift 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:45.650
 the function is built right into the carcass and here we are 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.600
 we select the main issue so what 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.299
 same difference between up to 610 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.519
 and d600 there is another important nuance 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:56.120
 which is simply impossible to believe 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:57.290
 you sit for sure better sit down okay 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.120
 can not sit down 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.400
 change aperture in la view in mode 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.160
 video filming is still impossible although in 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.709
 the same nikon d800 all works on hurray in 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.540
 What is the problem I do not understand though the photo 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.720
 mode, you can change the value without 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.350
 problems to take or not to take this 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.840
 question 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.209
 what do you think is the most affordable 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.430
 full-time callipers and start 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.370
 perfect product does not exist but 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.620
 tattoo as close as possible profit 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.810
 do to it considering all the previous about 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.520
 sin nikon d610 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.520
 I don't know who else but I already wanted
