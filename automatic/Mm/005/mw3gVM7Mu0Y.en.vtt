00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 it's everyone was ps 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.240
 today we meet again for the test 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.340
 of two products the mouse pad g440 and 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.340
 the g300 mouse 3 it's gone 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.550
 m 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.670
 so we received two products from 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.140
 from logitech 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.480
 as I wanted to say a mouse pad 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.240
 to house four hundred and forty- one mice 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.580
 g300 3 the link is in the description 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.680
 if ever you are interested during this 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.450
 test I will not dwell too much on the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.580
 mouse pad itself what I 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.370
 you had already introduced it to teeth 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.870
 live on call of duty on my machine 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.760
 from today's stream of blow we're going 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.620
 talk more specifically about the mouse the 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.080
 g300 three months all i can you 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.090
 to say for now that it's a 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.760
 mouse quality dies in any case 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.770
 that's undeniable I think she 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.540
 adapt more easily to 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.560
 little hands so if you have any 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.840
 big tomorrow maybe it's not 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.090
 the model that should be favored 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.240
 interesting aspect is that we can 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.680
 choose the color from 16.8 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.170
 millions of colors 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.330
 nothing but that yes so it's true that 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.550
 it can be nice to 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.860
 customize 6 buttons are 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.220
 programmable on the mouse so if you 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.470
 are like me 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.270
 a bit of fps a bit of call of duty 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.300
 on pc it can be really very 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.320
 practice and then even at the level of 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.630
 the elite in video me I use it 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.680
 a lot also because it is possible 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.170
 to memorize three different profiles 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.480
 from the logitech software that he 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.740
 provides at the same time so that's true 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.360
 that you have possibility for example 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.180
 that's what I did to switch from one 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.190
 gaming mode with the keys configured 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.720
 for call of duty for example and I 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.930
 switches to another profile that will 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.720
 more oriented for editing on my 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.180
 video editing software 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.729
 if a versatile mouse that I 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.760
 think it's undeniable again a 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.860
 times and I have been 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.590
 impressed also with the resistance of 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.900
 the mouse because when I have them 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.330
 received I saw the thing I told myself that 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.310
 does not look very very very very thick 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.590
 resistant and ultimately so if these 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.830
 resistant so in time better so 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.360
 a versatile resistant mouse with 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.000
 as I told you three profiles 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.400
 different that can be configured 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.910
 with six buttons on the mice which 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.650
 is not bad 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.140
 a negative point that I found is 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.810
 maybe the absence of side flu 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.000
 to add a grip 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.430
 additional to the mouse at the level of 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.650
 ribs and if like me you have them 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.500
 hands that slips you regret maybe 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.390
 the problem of having the mouse slip 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.860
 a bit of hands but on the contrary if 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.540
 never do you have no human who read 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.200
 I think I would not meet this 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.150
 problem 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.840
 so that's a detail you'll find in 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.450
 the description the link of the g300 3 by 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.640
 logitech and a link to buy it 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.900
 if you're interested, that's it 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.010
 everything to me he's everyone 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.010
 is at the next lease 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.490
