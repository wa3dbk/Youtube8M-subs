00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.500
 the Rennes stadium remains on four 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.350
 winless matches and will try to 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.270
 beat Saint-Etienne 5th of Saint Etienne 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.500
 who are they on two successful without having 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.200
 cashed any goal 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.110
 it's okay for the greens right now at 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.670
 confirm on the reindeer field 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.500
 who have won only one of 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.619
 their last nine meetings 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.270
 it's time to react and yet it's 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.730
 Saint-Etienne who has the first balloon 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.720
 interesting attacked with this superb 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.890
 breakthrough and the ball in the surface of 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.110
 repair for erding 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.570
 erding who manages to dribble and the 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.850
 squared shot saved by costil erding 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.180
 who played reindeer at the beginning of the season 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.070
 transferred at the end of the summer transfer window 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.460
 he had even scored a goal with the 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:01.570
 at least in August the response of 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.400
 breton with this ball on the side the 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.330
 possibility of center to take over the 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.920
 head of silvio romero first goal for 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.840
 the Argentine striker arrived this season 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.299
 at reindeer he was expected he had not 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.050
 not yet much illustrated and here it is 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:19.240
 who opens the scoring in the 33rd minute a 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:23.620
 head very well placed and Rennes stadium 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:26.140
 which leads 1-0 against Saint-Etienne to the 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.060
 half time reindeer retains 1-0 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.650
 Saint-Etienne did not know how to react 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.120
 stéphanois rather disappointing 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:38.100
 the well- focused bretons are in 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.100
 train a good performance 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.340
 Saint-Etienne has all the abilities 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.550
 to return but philippe montanier 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.790
 the reindeer coach finally seems 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.380
 reap the benefits of his work 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.090
 balloon recovered by the Rennes in 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.740
 the focused interesting opportunities for 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:59.310
 romero yet he was saved by 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.310
 ruffier the 2 0 was close 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.939
 the Rennes who continue to insist on 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.440
 provide a lot of opportunities with 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.880
 pitroipa at the beginning of this action the 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.430
 Burkinabe who can play in the surface 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.400
 balloon that comes back on kadir then on 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.060
 Roman Alessandrini at close range 2 0 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.790
 for reindeer 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:24.550
 in the 55th minute and the second goal of the 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.870
 season for roman alessandrini a lot 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.959
 support for the ball carrier 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.060
 much later in the ideas and that 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.800
 ends with a goal as defense 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.800
 Saint-Etienne was completely outdated 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.500
 the Rennes stadium that continue to 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.110
 insist St. Etienne has a lot of trouble 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:49.510
 to come back can be here with françois 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:51.640
 cleric for the center recessed on the 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.450
 center at the second post test on the 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.840
 cross-bar 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:03:00.010
 what an opportunity for yohan mollo finally 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.480
 a clear opportunity for the very greens 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.819
 little success since the ball is 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.540
 then deviated unintentionally by 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:10.090
 the arm of roman danzé reindeer had 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.329
 hot but continues to play from the front 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:16.180
 with this magnificent center of alessandrini 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.109
 for sylvinho romero the to play for 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.269
 the Argentine striker 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:22.389
 he scores his first two goals in 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.639
 league 1 in the same game 68th minute 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:27.510
 already makes 3 0 for reindeer 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.510
 the score is very heavy 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.210
 Saint-Etienne is completely beaten and 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.270
 will have the merit of playing until 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:43.570
 tip with brandao that can center in 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.940
 withdrawal the striking of cohade is deflected and 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.220
 return to mevlut erding which marks 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.090
 against his former team in the 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.920
 stoppage of the match 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.100
 third goal of the season under the 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.420
 jersey of saint-etienne for erding 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.260
 a narrowing gap that does not change 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.210
 nothing 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.790
 the victory is well deserved in the end 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.790
 for 3-1 reindeer against Saint-Etienne
