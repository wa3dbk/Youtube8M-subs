00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.120 

hi<00:00:01.380> this<00:00:01.740> cherry<00:00:02.490> tree<00:00:02.580> is<00:00:02.879> now<00:00:03.440> on<00:00:04.440> a<00:00:04.500> fifty

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
hi this cherry tree is now on a fifty

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.550 
hi this cherry tree is now on a fifty
years<00:00:05.250> of<00:00:05.400> honing<00:00:05.609> this<00:00:06.600> is<00:00:06.779> thunder<00:00:07.290> a<00:00:07.319> very

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
years of honing this is thunder a very

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.280 
years of honing this is thunder a very
nice<00:00:07.830> ship<00:00:08.130> v-shape<00:00:09.000> so<00:00:09.780> this<00:00:09.960> year<00:00:10.170> is

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
nice ship v-shape so this year is

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.430 
nice ship v-shape so this year is
basically<00:00:10.530> involving<00:00:12.080> reducing<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.200> height

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
basically involving reducing the height

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.379 
basically involving reducing the height
of<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.860> tree<00:00:14.190> containing<00:00:14.549> between<00:00:15.210> the

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
of the tree containing between the

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.970 
of the tree containing between the
unnatural<00:00:15.719> area<00:00:17.840> so<00:00:18.840> as<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.170> can<00:00:19.260> see<00:00:19.350> last

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
unnatural area so as you can see last

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.640 
unnatural area so as you can see last
year<00:00:20.570> was<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.600> much<00:00:21.869> closer<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.590> the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
year was a much closer this is the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.250 
year was a much closer this is the
largest<00:00:23.010> group<00:00:23.310> I'm<00:00:23.490> just<00:00:23.699> pruning<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:25.080> an

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
largest group I'm just pruning it to an

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.189 
largest group I'm just pruning it to an
outwards<00:00:25.800> growing<00:00:26.220> but<00:00:26.869> just<00:00:27.869> basically

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
outwards growing but just basically

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.400 
outwards growing but just basically
reducing<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.010> height<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.390> clan<00:00:30.660> system

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.310 

this<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.649> nice<00:00:34.920> height<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:36.120> harvest<00:00:37.110> when<00:00:37.290> is

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
this is nice height to harvest when is

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.479 
this is nice height to harvest when is
floating<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.930> this<00:00:39.930> all<00:00:40.309> smaller<00:00:41.309> the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
floating so this all smaller the

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.979 
floating so this all smaller the
branches<00:00:41.969> throwing<00:00:42.780> our<00:00:42.930> only<00:00:43.230> only<00:00:43.739> leads

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
branches throwing our only only leads

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.600 
branches throwing our only only leads
it's<00:00:45.989> not<00:00:46.350> really<00:00:46.890> essential<00:00:47.489> for<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.149> plants

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
it's not really essential for the plants

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.360 
it's not really essential for the plants
between<00:00:51.379> material<00:00:52.379> at<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.800> if<00:00:53.100> you're

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
between material at this if you're

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.099 
between material at this if you're
always<00:00:53.760> growing<00:00:54.239> but

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:07.240 

so<00:01:01.109> that's<00:01:01.440> why<00:01:01.620> it's<00:01:03.439> really<00:01:04.439> not<00:01:05.280> much<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.489> do

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
so that's why it's really not much to do

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.620 
so that's why it's really not much to do
it's<00:01:08.250> just<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.580> matter<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.850> waiting<00:01:09.060> for<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
it's just a matter of waiting for the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.530 
it's just a matter of waiting for the
end<00:01:10.100> for<00:01:11.100> picking<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.909> fruits

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.680 

and<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:17.650> prefer<00:01:18.610> this<00:01:18.760> shape<00:01:19.030> is<00:01:19.180> totally<00:01:19.450> a

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
and I prefer this shape is totally a

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.960 
and I prefer this shape is totally a
sun-like<00:01:20.170> and<00:01:20.590> go<00:01:20.770> right<00:01:21.070> into<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.490> middle<00:01:21.520> of

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
sun-like and go right into the middle of

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:22.850 
sun-like and go right into the middle of
the<00:01:22.120> tree

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
the tree

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.850 
the tree
it<00:01:23.860> provides<00:01:24.610> good<00:01:24.880> airflow<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:26.350> cherry

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
it provides good airflow and cherry

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.590 
it provides good airflow and cherry
really<00:01:27.310> likes<00:01:27.550> it<00:01:27.760> they<00:01:27.910> don't<00:01:27.970> like<00:01:28.180> it<00:01:28.300> too

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
really likes it they don't like it too

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:38.190 
really likes it they don't like it too
moist<00:01:28.840> to<00:01:29.230> them<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:36.510> moving<00:01:37.510> on<00:01:37.660> to<00:01:37.690> the<00:01:37.870> next

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
moist to them so moving on to the next

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.810 
moist to them so moving on to the next
three<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:39.700> one<00:01:39.910> is<00:01:40.620> let<00:01:41.620> me<00:01:41.650> see<00:01:42.040> the<00:01:42.490> third

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
three this one is let me see the third

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.460 
three this one is let me see the third
year<00:01:43.060> of<00:01:43.090> pruning<00:01:43.600> this<00:01:43.870> will<00:01:44.020> be<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:44.230> third

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
year of pruning this will be the third

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.040 
year of pruning this will be the third
year<00:01:44.500> of<00:01:44.740> pruning<00:01:45.330> so<00:01:46.330> the<00:01:46.450> first<00:01:46.690> time<00:01:46.870> right

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
year of pruning so the first time right

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.550 
year of pruning so the first time right
I<00:01:47.410> just<00:01:47.740> chopped<00:01:48.190> it<00:01:48.220> up<00:01:48.370> there<00:01:49.000> and<00:01:49.270> in<00:01:49.390> a<00:01:49.780> lot

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
I just chopped it up there and in a lot

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.710 
I just chopped it up there and in a lot
of<00:01:50.590> three<00:01:50.860> branches<00:01:51.370> to<00:01:51.550> grow<00:01:51.729> out<00:01:51.910> and<00:01:52.150> in<00:01:52.600> the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
of three branches to grow out and in the

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.790 
of three branches to grow out and in the
next<00:01:52.930> year<00:01:53.050> allowed<00:01:53.590> about<00:01:54.220> five<00:01:54.550> branches

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
next year allowed about five branches

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.860 
next year allowed about five branches
and<00:01:56.800> this<00:01:57.280> one<00:01:57.460> I<00:01:57.490> pre-cut<00:01:57.850> agreed<00:01:58.360> to<00:01:58.660> show

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
and this one I pre-cut agreed to show

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.560 
and this one I pre-cut agreed to show
you<00:01:58.930> how<00:01:59.260> not<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.770> cut<00:02:00.160> it<00:02:00.340> you<00:02:01.030> want<00:02:01.240> to<00:02:01.330> branch

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
you how not to cut it you want to branch

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.310 
you how not to cut it you want to branch
to<00:02:01.720> be<00:02:01.810> going<00:02:01.990> out<00:02:02.229> that<00:02:02.500> way<00:02:02.710> not<00:02:03.040> into<00:02:03.820> the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
to be going out that way not into the

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.800 
to be going out that way not into the
bush<00:02:05.320> so<00:02:05.620> just<00:02:05.830> snip<00:02:06.310> it<00:02:06.460> off<00:02:06.520> there<00:02:06.790> to<00:02:07.690> an

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
bush so just snip it off there to an

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:17.780 
bush so just snip it off there to an
outward<00:02:08.200> growing<00:02:08.530> branch<00:02:14.100> so<00:02:15.100> this<00:02:15.310> level<00:02:15.520> up

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
outward growing branch so this level up

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.440 
outward growing branch so this level up
it<00:02:18.790> will<00:02:19.240> be<00:02:19.390> about<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.380> height<00:02:20.650> that<00:02:20.890> I

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
it will be about the height that I

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.150 
it will be about the height that I
prefer<00:02:22.450> them<00:02:22.570> to<00:02:22.630> be<00:02:22.780> so<00:02:23.170> I'm<00:02:23.350> just<00:02:23.620> pulling<00:02:24.010> it

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
prefer them to be so I'm just pulling it

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.949 
prefer them to be so I'm just pulling it
now<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:24.880> an<00:02:25.060> outward<00:02:25.540> growing<00:02:26.010> runt<00:02:27.780> so<00:02:28.780> by

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
now to an outward growing runt so by

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.090 
now to an outward growing runt so by
doing<00:02:29.020> this<00:02:29.470> it<00:02:30.340> forces<00:02:30.850> the<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:32.560> back<00:02:32.769> stage

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
doing this it forces the the back stage

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.150 
doing this it forces the the back stage
to<00:02:33.310> throw<00:02:33.910> a<00:02:33.940> new<00:02:34.300> branch<00:02:34.660> which<00:02:35.050> will<00:02:35.350> grow<00:02:35.860> a

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
to throw a new branch which will grow a

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.220 
to throw a new branch which will grow a
bit<00:02:36.489> further<00:02:36.850> up<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:39.730> that<00:02:40.450> one<00:02:40.630> is<00:02:40.660> facing

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
bit further up so that one is facing

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.390 
bit further up so that one is facing
outwards<00:02:41.440> so<00:02:41.890> just<00:02:42.130> trim<00:02:42.580> it<00:02:42.760> just<00:02:42.790> above<00:02:43.420> it

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
outwards so just trim it just above it

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.990 
outwards so just trim it just above it
like<00:02:45.400> that

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.150 

and<00:02:51.000> it's<00:02:51.180> not<00:02:51.270> really<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.600> lot<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:51.870> do<00:02:52.160> after

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
and it's not really a lot to do after

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.820
