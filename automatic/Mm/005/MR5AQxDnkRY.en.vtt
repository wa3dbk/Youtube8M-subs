wouldn't be there I know we played them
once<00:02:30.580> when<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:30.790> was<00:02:30.850> in<00:02:30.970> Dallas<00:02:31.150> I<00:02:31.360> mean<00:02:31.510> a<00:02:31.750> very

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
once when I was in Dallas I mean a very

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.910 
once when I was in Dallas I mean a very
very<00:02:32.260> good<00:02:32.440> offense<00:02:32.860> I<00:02:33.160> mean<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:35.590> I<00:02:35.650> think<00:02:35.680> I'm

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
very good offense I mean and I think I'm

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.860 
very good offense I mean and I think I'm
the<00:02:36.040> perfect<00:02:36.250> player<00:02:36.580> to<00:02:37.360> fit<00:02:37.540> what<00:02:37.690> they<00:02:37.810> do

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
the perfect player to fit what they do

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.570 
the perfect player to fit what they do
and<00:02:38.530> I<00:02:38.680> think<00:02:38.920> that's<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:39.130> reason<00:02:39.280> why<00:02:39.459> they

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
and I think that's the reason why they

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.860 
and I think that's the reason why they
made<00:02:40.540> this<00:02:40.660> deal<00:02:42.090> they<00:02:43.090> just<00:02:43.150> ignored<00:02:43.600> spread

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
made this deal they just ignored spread

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:44.400 
made this deal they just ignored spread
the<00:02:43.959> floor

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
the floor

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.140 
the floor
they<00:02:44.890> use<00:02:45.040> their<00:02:45.220> base<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.550> road<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:45.940> rim

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
they use their base the road to the rim

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.350 
they use their base the road to the rim
and<00:02:46.360> make<00:02:46.480> plays<00:02:46.690> at<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:46.900> rim<00:02:48.030> no<00:02:49.030> they<00:02:49.150> need

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
and make plays at the rim no they need

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.780

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.580 
doors those guys development and you
know<00:03:47.370> three<00:03:48.370> years<00:03:48.400> from<00:03:48.700> now<00:03:48.820> those<00:03:49.180> two

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
know three years from now those two

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.140 
know three years from now those two
we'll<00:03:50.040> probably<00:03:50.190> really<00:03:50.520> do<00:03:50.640> some<00:03:50.790> damage<00:03:50.819> in

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
we'll probably really do some damage in

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.400 
we'll probably really do some damage in
the<00:03:51.209> Eastern<00:03:51.480> Conference<00:03:51.900> and<00:03:52.020> I<00:03:52.200> think

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
the Eastern Conference and I think

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.800 
the Eastern Conference and I think
that's<00:03:52.560> what<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.830> goal<00:03:52.950> is<00:03:53.480> no<00:03:54.480> they<00:03:54.599> got<00:03:54.720> to

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
that's what the goal is no they got to

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.120 
that's what the goal is no they got to
get<00:03:54.900> some<00:03:55.020> more<00:03:55.110> pieces<00:03:55.470> here<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:55.770> there<00:03:55.920> too

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
get some more pieces here and there too

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.130 
get some more pieces here and there too
to<00:03:56.670> complement<00:03:57.239> those<00:03:57.360> guys<00:03:57.630> that<00:03:57.840> I<00:03:57.930> think

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
to complement those guys that I think

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.170 
to complement those guys that I think
those<00:03:58.319> guys<00:03:58.500> are<00:03:58.709> the<00:03:58.770> future<00:03:58.980> and<00:03:59.370> it's

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
those guys are the future and it's

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.780 
those guys are the future and it's
pretty<00:04:00.630> bright
