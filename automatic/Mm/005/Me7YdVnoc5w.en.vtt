00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.360 

so<00:04:24.020> before<00:04:24.320> I<00:04:24.350> was<00:04:24.470> even<00:04:24.590> done<00:04:24.889> editing<00:04:25.070> the

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
so before I was even done editing the

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.909 
so before I was even done editing the
video<00:04:25.580> I<00:04:25.850> already<00:04:26.210> upgraded<00:04:26.570> it<00:04:26.810> again<00:04:27.080> now<00:04:27.889> I

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
video I already upgraded it again now I

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:29.770 
video I already upgraded it again now I
can<00:04:28.250> sit<00:04:28.430> down<00:04:28.550> by<00:04:28.729> itself<00:04:29.000> because<00:04:29.240> before<00:04:29.570> it

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
can sit down by itself because before it

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.840 
can sit down by itself because before it
was<00:04:29.810> very<00:04:30.800> difficult<00:04:30.979> to<00:04:31.220> sit<00:04:31.430> down<00:04:31.580> it<00:04:31.759> would

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
was very difficult to sit down it would

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.120 
was very difficult to sit down it would
always<00:04:31.940> fall<00:04:32.180> over<00:04:32.479> and<00:04:32.840> not<00:04:33.500> counting<00:04:33.860> I<00:04:33.949> can

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
always fall over and not counting I can

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.629 
always fall over and not counting I can
use<00:04:34.280> it<00:04:34.430> as<00:04:34.550> a<00:04:35.350> stationary<00:04:36.350> tripod<00:04:36.860> whenever<00:04:37.520> I

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
use it as a stationary tripod whenever I

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.790 
use it as a stationary tripod whenever I
set<00:04:38.060> it<00:04:38.150> down<00:04:38.860> so<00:04:39.860> that's<00:04:40.039> kind<00:04:40.220> of<00:04:40.280> handy<00:04:40.820> and

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
set it down so that's kind of handy and

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.159 
set it down so that's kind of handy and
I<00:04:42.880> was<00:04:43.880> gonna<00:04:44.000> put<00:04:44.090> a<00:04:44.240> tee<00:04:44.419> right<00:04:44.630> here<00:04:44.840> and

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
I was gonna put a tee right here and

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:46.839 
I was gonna put a tee right here and
have<00:04:45.380> it<00:04:45.410> go<00:04:45.590> over<00:04:45.770> here<00:04:45.949> would<00:04:46.130> have<00:04:46.220> a<00:04:46.280> 90

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:46.849 
have it go over here would have a 90

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:49.300 
have it go over here would have a 90
degree<00:04:47.259> connector<00:04:48.259> but<00:04:48.770> I<00:04:48.800> just<00:04:49.039> found<00:04:49.130> an

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
degree connector but I just found an

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.790 
degree connector but I just found an
arrow<00:04:49.490> in<00:04:49.669> the<00:04:49.789> woods<00:04:49.970> and<00:04:50.440> taped<00:04:51.440> that<00:04:51.590> on

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
arrow in the woods and taped that on

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.910 
arrow in the woods and taped that on
there<00:04:51.979> that<00:04:52.130> works<00:04:52.310> good
