similar<00:03:00.689> to<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.919> XL<00:03:01.919> 10<00:03:02.159> now<00:03:02.459> you<00:03:02.519> have<00:03:02.909> an

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
similar to the XL 10 now you have an

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.330 
similar to the XL 10 now you have an
application-specific<00:03:03.750> spider<00:03:04.620> okay<00:03:05.040> it's

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
application-specific spider okay it's

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.879 
application-specific spider okay it's
not<00:03:05.489> fully<00:03:05.819> programmable<00:03:06.389> it's<00:03:07.260> configurable

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889 
not fully programmable it's configurable

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.610 
not fully programmable it's configurable
but<00:03:08.760> there<00:03:08.879> are<00:03:09.000> some<00:03:09.299> accessory<00:03:10.109> loops<00:03:10.409> if

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
but there are some accessory loops if

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.899 
but there are some accessory loops if
you<00:03:10.739> don't<00:03:10.919> use<00:03:11.069> all<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.340> i/o<00:03:11.459> so<00:03:11.669> you<00:03:11.849> know

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
you don't use all the i/o so you know

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:13.429 
you don't use all the i/o so you know
the<00:03:12.000> little<00:03:12.180> freedom<00:03:12.599> and<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.870> application

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:13.439 
the little freedom and the application

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.490 
the little freedom and the application
specific<00:03:13.889> controller<00:03:14.220> now<00:03:14.430> so<00:03:15.120> this<00:03:15.269> will
