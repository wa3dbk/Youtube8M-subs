the training wall and thinking about Ben
how<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:35.579> would<00:00:35.910> train<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.360> horse<00:00:36.690> for<00:00:36.899> a

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
how you would train a horse for a

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.869 
how you would train a horse for a
puissance<00:00:37.320> net<00:00:37.620> now<00:00:37.829> one<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.370> first<00:00:38.550> steps

you<00:00:39.000> go<00:00:39.180> through<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:40.260> well<00:00:41.070> in<00:00:41.579> my<00:00:41.790> instance

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
you go through and well in my instance

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.119 
you go through and well in my instance
with<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.510> my<00:00:42.809> poisonous<00:00:43.260> horse<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.590> was<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.950> bit

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
with the my poisonous horse it was a bit

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.729 
with the my poisonous horse it was a bit
of<00:00:44.219> luck<00:00:44.250> really<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.450> decided<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.500> put<00:00:46.620> him

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
of luck really and I decided to put him

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.920 
of luck really and I decided to put him
in<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.890> police<00:00:47.280> on<00:00:47.489> class<00:00:47.760> one<00:00:47.969> time<00:00:48.210> because<00:00:48.660> he

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
in a police on class one time because he

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.840 
in a police on class one time because he
was<00:00:49.110> not<00:00:49.500> jumping<00:00:49.890> as<00:00:50.039> well<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.489> normal

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
was not jumping as well in the normal

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.810 
was not jumping as well in the normal
classes<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.600> we<00:00:52.440> found<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.890> he<00:00:52.949> he<00:00:53.370> loved<00:00:53.579> it

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
classes and we found that he he loved it

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.639 
classes and we found that he he loved it
and<00:00:53.969> enjoyed<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.480> he<00:00:54.629> was<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:55.199> was<00:00:55.350> where<00:00:55.559> his

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
and enjoyed it he was that was where his

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.540 
and enjoyed it he was that was where his
expertise<00:00:56.280> like<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:58.050> think<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:59.070> train<00:00:59.520> a

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
expertise like so and I think to train a

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.220 
expertise like so and I think to train a
horse<00:00:59.730> for<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.120> wall<00:01:00.359> you'd<00:01:00.570> have<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:01.050> try

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
horse for a wall you'd have to just try

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.020 
horse for a wall you'd have to just try
them<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.590> see<00:01:02.010> if<00:01:02.039> they're<00:01:02.250> brave<00:01:02.460> enough<00:01:02.760> to

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
them and see if they're brave enough to

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.929 
them and see if they're brave enough to
to<00:01:03.690> want<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.989> do<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.229> now<00:01:04.799> obviously<00:01:05.339> we're

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
to want to do it now obviously we're

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.789 
to want to do it now obviously we're
here<00:01:06.119> at<00:01:06.299> home<00:01:06.510> with<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.020> if<00:01:07.260> we're<00:01:07.590> trained

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
here at home with you if we're trained

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.140 
here at home with you if we're trained
for<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.010> Poisson<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.490> obviously<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.939> ring

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
for a Poisson so obviously in the ring

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.910 
for a Poisson so obviously in the ring
we're<00:01:09.390> looking<00:01:09.659> for<00:01:09.930> as<00:01:10.140> high<00:01:10.409> as<00:01:10.470> they<00:01:10.710> can<00:01:10.770> go

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
we're looking for as high as they can go

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.920 
we're looking for as high as they can go
you<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.670> don't<00:01:12.030> suppose<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.299> necessarily<00:01:12.720> do

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
you I don't suppose you necessarily do

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.300 
you I don't suppose you necessarily do
that<00:01:13.080> at<00:01:13.200> home<00:01:13.229> you're<00:01:13.860> just<00:01:14.070> looking<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
that at home you're just looking the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.950 
that at home you're just looking the
method<00:01:14.640> getting<00:01:15.030> over<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.330> wall<00:01:15.360> getting

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
method getting over the wall getting

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.499 
method getting over the wall getting
them<00:01:16.049> used<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.380> absolutely<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.520> mean<00:01:17.610> my

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
them used to it absolutely I mean my

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.910 
them used to it absolutely I mean my
poisonous<00:01:18.960> horse<00:01:19.170> at<00:01:19.350> home<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.740> would

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
poisonous horse at home I would

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.800 
poisonous horse at home I would
concentrate<00:01:20.340> on<00:01:20.580> more<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.060> approach<00:01:21.479> I

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
concentrate on more of the approach I

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.320 
concentrate on more of the approach I
would<00:01:21.930> get<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.259> nice<00:01:22.740> sort<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.369> strong<00:01:23.759> together

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
would get a nice sort of strong together

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.380 
would get a nice sort of strong together
canter<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.560> suits<00:01:25.830> him<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:27.060> keep<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
canter that that suits him and keep the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.090 
canter that that suits him and keep the
same<00:01:27.570> pace<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.049> whole<00:01:28.229> way<00:01:28.380> down<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.920> wall

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
same pace the whole way down to the wall

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.530 
same pace the whole way down to the wall
and<00:01:29.400> then<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.880> would<00:01:29.970> put<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.150> little<00:01:30.360> bit<00:01:30.479> more

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
and then I would put a little bit more

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.330 
and then I would put a little bit more
pressure<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:31.110> him<00:01:31.290> just<00:01:31.530> at<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.740> last<00:01:31.890> minute

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
pressure on him just at the last minute

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.980 
pressure on him just at the last minute
to<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:33.000> get<00:01:33.150> sort<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.420> big<00:01:33.570> bursts<00:01:33.810> of

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
to to get sort of the big bursts of

energy to get over over it what sort of
position<00:01:36.630> would<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.140> be<00:01:37.290> looking<00:01:37.380> for<00:01:37.740> where

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
position would you be looking for where

position would you be looking for where
are<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.250> looking<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.579> take<00:01:38.610> off<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> wall

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
are you looking to take off to a wall

are you looking to take off to a wall
like<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:40.070> standard<00:01:41.070> jump<00:01:41.579> would<00:01:41.700> be<00:01:41.880> sort

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
like this a standard jump would be sort

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.940 
like this a standard jump would be sort
of<00:01:42.119> two<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.450> my<00:01:42.600> paces<00:01:43.110> away<00:01:43.320> from<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.799> wall

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
of two of my paces away from the wall

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.649 
of two of my paces away from the wall
which<00:01:44.159> would<00:01:44.340> be<00:01:44.549> kind<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.450> don't<00:01:45.509> know

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
which would be kind of I don't know

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.010 
which would be kind of I don't know
where<00:01:45.869> where<00:01:46.110> I'm<00:01:46.259> stood<00:01:46.500> here<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:48.020> everybody

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
where where I'm stood here and everybody

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.929 
where where I'm stood here and everybody
has<00:01:49.229> different<00:01:49.259> opinions<00:01:50.070> some<00:01:50.310> am<00:01:50.490> with<00:01:50.820> this

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
has different opinions some am with this

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.670 
has different opinions some am with this
horse<00:01:51.149> in<00:01:51.299> particular<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.840> think<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.470> it's

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
horse in particular I think that it's

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.530 
horse in particular I think that it's
better<00:01:52.920> with<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.220> little<00:01:53.520> bit<00:01:53.670> more<00:01:53.850> room<00:01:54.060> like

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
better with a little bit more room like

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.510 
better with a little bit more room like
I<00:01:54.659> would<00:01:54.780> jump<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.020> normal<00:01:55.350> fence<00:01:55.560> if<00:01:56.189> we're

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
I would jump a normal fence if we're

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.550 
I would jump a normal fence if we're
talking<00:01:56.700> training<00:01:57.479> at<00:01:57.600> home<00:01:57.810> how<00:01:58.140> much<00:01:58.290> time

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
talking training at home how much time

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.980 
talking training at home how much time
do<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:58.680> spend<00:01:58.909> going<00:01:59.909> over<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.119> wall<00:02:00.270> and

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
do you spend going over the wall and

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.740 
do you spend going over the wall and
well<00:02:01.200> I'm<00:02:01.290> I'm<00:02:01.619> lucky<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.040> have<00:02:02.189> probably<00:02:02.790> he's

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
well I'm I'm lucky I have probably he's

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.899 
well I'm I'm lucky I have probably he's
a<00:02:03.780> bit<00:02:04.020> older<00:02:04.350> now<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.500> think<00:02:04.710> he's<00:02:05.009> 16<00:02:05.460> but<00:02:05.700> he

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
a bit older now I think he's 16 but he

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.779 
a bit older now I think he's 16 but he
is<00:02:06.270> one<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.140> best<00:02:07.680> police<00:02:07.890> on<00:02:08.099> horses<00:02:08.489> and

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
is one of the best police on horses and

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.660 
is one of the best police on horses and
and<00:02:09.360> he<00:02:10.080> never<00:02:10.259> sees<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.500> jump<00:02:10.830> from<00:02:11.069> one<00:02:11.430> show

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
and he never sees a jump from one show

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.430 
and he never sees a jump from one show
to<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:12.000> next<00:02:12.300> he<00:02:12.390> doesn't<00:02:12.660> do<00:02:12.810> any<00:02:13.110> other

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
to the next he doesn't do any other

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.370 
to the next he doesn't do any other
shows<00:02:13.590> in<00:02:13.860> between<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.780> would<00:02:15.900> jump<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.230> few

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
shows in between and I would jump a few

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.040 
shows in between and I would jump a few
small<00:02:16.680> offenses<00:02:16.950> on<00:02:17.310> him<00:02:17.580> maybe<00:02:18.030> three<00:02:18.840> weeks

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
the wall maybe one time the week before

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.270 
the wall maybe one time the week before
he<00:02:24.810> would<00:02:24.930> go<00:02:24.990> to<00:02:25.170> either<00:02:25.680> horse<00:02:25.950> of<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.160> issue

or Belfast or Olympia and if everything
was<00:02:29.280> good

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
was good

going up there over 7 foot 3 7 foot 4

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.200 
going up there over 7 foot 3 7 foot 4
what's<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:41.160> like<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.520> a<00:02:41.550> feeling<00:02:41.940> for<00:02:42.120> you

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
what's that like is a feeling for you

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.350 
what's that like is a feeling for you
and<00:02:42.830> it's<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:43.950> great<00:02:44.130> feeling<00:02:44.370> of<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:44.670> jump<00:02:45.090> clear

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
and it's a great feeling of a jump clear

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.250 
and it's a great feeling of a jump clear
obviously<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.470> I<00:02:47.400> think<00:02:48.270> a<00:02:48.600> lot<00:02:48.960> of<00:02:48.990> people

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
obviously and I think a lot of people

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.080 
obviously and I think a lot of people
have<00:02:49.350> asked<00:02:49.590> me<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:49.740> and<00:02:50.100> I<00:02:50.580> think<00:02:50.880> it's<00:02:51.000> all

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
have asked me that and I think it's all

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.880 
have asked me that and I think it's all
depends<00:02:51.630> on<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:52.110> horse<00:02:52.290> you're<00:02:52.470> sitting<00:02:52.800> on

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
depends on the horse you're sitting on

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.570 
depends on the horse you're sitting on
that<00:02:53.820> horse<00:02:54.120> for<00:02:54.540> this<00:02:54.720> job<00:02:55.110> would<00:02:55.470> be<00:02:55.680> would

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
that horse for this job would be would

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.610 
that horse for this job would be would
be<00:02:56.730> like<00:02:56.910> driving<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.570> Ferrari<00:02:57.900> for<00:02:58.140> instance<00:02:58.500> I

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
be like driving a Ferrari for instance I

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.410 
be like driving a Ferrari for instance I
can<00:02:58.680> already<00:02:58.980> come<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.490> the<00:02:59.820> height<00:03:00.030> attack

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420

now knowing that he hasn't jumped it for
a<00:03:02.700> year<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.150> he<00:03:03.300> will<00:03:03.390> just<00:03:03.540> pop<00:03:03.690> over<00:03:03.930> it<00:03:04.140> like
