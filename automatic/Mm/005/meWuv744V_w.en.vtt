00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.570
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.429
 mac skill video tutorial 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.029
 today I was talking about hazell 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.250
 so this is an application that serves to 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.930
 automate the storage of your files 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.529
 so he's a great housekeeper 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.599
 you can test 14 days for free 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.949
 all functions are active 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.830
 there is even if it's a demo is not there 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.660
 of limit and if after 14 days 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.219
 the app you like so it takes 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.480
 buy a license that costs roughly 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.559
 28 dollars so start with 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.420
 download the demo 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:47.190
 so that's what I did so at her 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.320
 ranks in system preferences 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:55.620
 so here and by default is she going to you 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.020
 propose to create rules for the 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.640
 folder downloads 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.989
 so this is a very good idea since 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.290
 anyway this accommodation 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.939
 this is the folder where will be stored 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.080
 different types of files and we have 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.590
 forget about it, that is to say 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.869
 after a while 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.159
 all the files pile up and that 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.280
 takes up space on the disk for 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.650
 nothing today so we will create 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.210
 rules so the first one is going to be for 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.520
 the pictures and the second for the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.290
 files for applications you have 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.610
 downloaded so we'll start all of 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.880
 next here by clicking the plus button 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.540
 to create a rule for images 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.540
 downloaded so I name it 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.070
 so never put a condition for 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.750
 who if I choose that all 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.910
 conditions even if we only have one evening 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.620
 unique for it to work so I 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:54.479
 will choose the file type in 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:57.860
 kind and an image the type of file and 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.750
 images so that's going to integrate different 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:04.380
 different types the images jpeg png 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:08.869
 tiff etc and I'm going to ask him for them 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:13.020
 move move to my folder 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:17.670
 images that is in the house 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:21.800
 so I select the images folder and 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.820
 I will add a small action 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.500
 me what I what I like 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.989
 cazelles it's kim is that I can 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.680
 to see at a glance or is it 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.260
 he intervened 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:36.390
 so I decide to add a label 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:38.310
 or an officer keyword that he would act 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:44.820
 so I choose one or a label 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:45.989
 blue and I'm doing ok so I'm going to go 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:53.220
 in my downloads folder so 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:54.780
 here this images so according to the rule 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.190
 that I restore it goes but moved 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.910
 in the image folder and assign them 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:05.400
 a blue label so I'm going to activated 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.540
 at zell and I will ask to apply 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.420
 rules for the record 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.870
 downloads 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:17.670
 so here it is it's done it move me 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.500
 the images two folders download 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.330
 to the images folder and as you the 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.600
 see there will be well assign a 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.970
 blue label so the rule I have 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.180
 defined for downloaded images 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:33.780
 works I'm going back to 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.100
 download is here so I have three 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.590
 disk images so three applications 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:42.799
 I downloaded and I will create a 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:47.880
 new rule for this type of file 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:49.739
 so I click on the button + I'm going 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.670
 name it app I will name 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:55.709
 marc and the application then the 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.989
 applications for mac in general happens 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:01.410
 in the format dng so disk image 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:06.030
 but it can be a package 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:13.430
 example so here i'm going to put that the 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:16.530
 type and disk image I will add 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:20.910
 a second condition 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:24.450
 and I go this time choose 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.970
 the extension and I'm going to type point pkg 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:30.360
 so for packages like here I have 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.889
 two conditions I can not rule 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.090
 would not work if I say that all 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.860
 these conditions must be met in order to 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.100
 that it works so I'm going m if 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.730
 one of these conditions 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:45.810
 happens the rule can apply 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:48.860
 so I will choose to open these 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:53.400
 files with the default application 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:57.030
 and to do a thorough cleaning 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:01.490
 I'm going to ask him to move the 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:09.690
 files uploaded to trash 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:11.729
 so here everything is good I'm doing ok and I 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.930
 will activate the rule again 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:16.190
 manually otherwise he does it 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.190
 automatically regularly 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:27.390
 So here it works 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:29.220
 inm opens the disk images and suddenly 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.310
 I just have to install the 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.310
 applications 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.690
 so there are two who have 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.590
 worked this of skype does not have 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.730
 worked but maybe the 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:44.020
 download was not correct but 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.440
 in any case it worked so at 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.419
 every time 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.210
 from now that I'm downloading 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:54.190
 the application dying there to the disk image 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:57.910
 so she climbs on the desk and in 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:59.950
 premium it moves me the files 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.440
 uploaded to trash 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.540
 you see it here since anyway 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:07.050
 I do not need it anymore so I can 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:09.820
 now install my apps 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.990
 quietly so that was it 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.430
 two rules for the record 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.960
 downloads so you can establish 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:17.020
 rules for all records that 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.360
 you want and in the number 33 of 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.610
 mac skill so you'll see more 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.220
 examples of rules do not hesitate to 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.630
 to consult 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:27.760
 so that was a little tutorial 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:30.130
 to introduce you to zell so that's 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:33.250
 really a great app so 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:34.210
 please install and 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.860
 test since you can do it 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.750
 free for 14 days 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.050
 and honestly it will save you a lot 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:43.530
 of manipulations you will 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:45.100
 automate the storage of your files 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:48.180
 here I wish you a good 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.180
 continuation on your mac
