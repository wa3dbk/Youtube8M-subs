00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.010 
pitcher plants we don't usually start
selling<00:02:12.000> them<00:02:12.150> till<00:02:12.330> they're<00:02:12.480> about<00:02:12.720> three

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
selling them till they're about three

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.770 
selling them till they're about three
years<00:02:13.140> old

so<00:02:15.780> this<00:02:15.900> is<00:02:15.990> our<00:02:16.080> propagation<00:02:16.740> room<00:02:16.920> right

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
so this is our propagation room right

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.980 
so this is our propagation room right
here<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.700> can<00:02:17.850> see<00:02:17.880> seeds<00:02:18.330> of<00:02:18.570> American

these actually don't do anything for the

these actually don't do anything for the
closing<00:03:06.060> of<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.330> trap<00:03:06.570> what<00:03:06.840> they<00:03:06.930> do<00:03:06.989> is<00:03:07.200> they

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
closing of the trap what they do is they

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.050 
closing of the trap what they do is they
force<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.800> insects<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.280> get<00:03:08.520> to<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.700> nectar

that's<00:03:09.360> right<00:03:09.510> on<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:09.690> inside<00:03:10.050> so<00:03:11.040> we're

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
that's right on the inside so we're

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.770 
that's right on the inside so we're
gonna<00:03:11.250> give<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.489> shot<00:03:11.700> here

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.090 

and<00:03:15.780> now<00:03:15.990> it's<00:03:16.110> gonna<00:03:16.230> take<00:03:16.380> about<00:03:16.500> five<00:03:16.860> or

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
and now it's gonna take about five or

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.160 
and now it's gonna take about five or
six<00:03:17.280> days<00:03:17.460> of<00:03:17.730> putting<00:03:17.850> acids<00:03:18.360> and<00:03:18.480> enzymes<00:03:18.600> in

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
six days of putting acids and enzymes in

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.680 
six days of putting acids and enzymes in
between<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.530> surface<00:03:19.860> of<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.070> leaf<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.690> it

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
between the surface of the leaf and it

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.840 
between the surface of the leaf and it
just<00:03:22.050> slowly<00:03:22.410> dissolves<00:03:23.070> it<00:03:23.220> sucks<00:03:23.580> up<00:03:23.730> all

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
just slowly dissolves it sucks up all

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.500 
just slowly dissolves it sucks up all
the<00:03:23.910> fertilizers<00:03:24.570> it<00:03:24.720> needs<00:03:26.180> so<00:03:27.180> this<00:03:27.330> is<00:03:27.450> an

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
the fertilizers it needs so this is an

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.210 
the fertilizers it needs so this is an
