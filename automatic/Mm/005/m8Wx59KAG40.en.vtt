00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.770
 hello everybody is once again said 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.130
 retreating and following up its 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.530
 training without going down today to vote on duty 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.990
 of the relationship cycle with a male 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.230
 so it's not that leaking song so 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.769
 is either a fixed or floating male 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.869
 there are two ways to do this is people 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.019
 will then be able to secure the mast 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.500
 tool and make it a search 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.290
 sure that they can manufacture the 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.570
 home with both the male and the 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.050
 floating or standing flat 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.640
 of that hard male national né 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.370
 then for it so we will be 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:50.520
 using here we are using this 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.899
 cycle is the budget cycle of 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.910
 with a male 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.579
 so if the trial with a male 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.609
 requires today 84 z 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.250
 heffner is the basic st that we are 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.379
 accustomed to using the zé is the final position 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.930
 in thread absolute 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.030
 efe here the imf is not that 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.530
 speed shift is step of the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.900
 thread then, right? 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:18.750
 Congratulations, Aquino, where you went to make thread 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:20.700
 although it is the f60 the advance is here in the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.430
 case will be the thread step 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.040
 Congratulations here make a right thread 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.590
 then this speed cuts what defines 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.790
 the tool of this type that this option 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:42.899
 will work so much for the male fixed people 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:46.920
 right rigid is the fixed snag will start 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:56.130
 here doing will start doing then 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:02:00.509
 that first here with a male with 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:05.670
 male is basically for me is always 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:08.759
 here is the same function 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.670
 I did not press here a speed of 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.580
 spin down because now 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:18.989
 we take a male baby extension of 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.970
 sakineh speed that is 120 and the direction 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.280
 what about the turn of the plate that we go 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.720
 being one of 13 and 14 years inside the rock 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.840
 if it's right and left 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.290
 Congratulations here is very low speed 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:37.319
 and driving at constant speed that 97 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:40.350
 energy 97 position jesus is x 00 10 from 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:43.560
 today 84 z - without you 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:46.140
 I'll do it if he was inside . 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.410
 thread well feel also today 80 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.470
 those linked to this fraction that in this 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.720
 and professional voting equipment that 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:01.080
 it was very simple to make us go 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:05.959
 To do this is very quickly the hurricane. 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:12.630
 So, what about the programs you already have here? 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:17.760
 make a rice fraction which is now 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:38.310
 need Afurada then draw using 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:40.519
 and you are putting that is mine 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.519
 program 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:54.739
 the tools to ask just one 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.739
 tool 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:08.610
 it happens that not only the fixed male 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.620
 right we have here is that I have not 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.980
 this more floating option fixed here 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.049
 na in this madonna but we will use a mash 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.290
 It's so we can follow 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.290
 right here 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.640
 jake a little lower than 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.260
 I had your program here but I'm going 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.940
 take it from here you would not do 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:01.169
 What else did I do then? 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:06.750
 put the right program here then 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:11.190
 it's g34 we'll be wearing so macho 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:15.870
 it is floating that it is then the option that 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:17.639
 male that it is at this moment that people 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:21.210
 want to add that there is this male 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:24.539
 I put it here, you can only do the test ok 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:27.020
 has been diffused from a subtype of 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:27.020
 catch him 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:39.600
 This is the macho is chic here in the 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.940
 future it is nec of the sertões in case 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.610
 but serves as a demonstration here as 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:49.600
 example is very simple just put it 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:56.710
 You 're going to advance here right? 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:58.270
 in the event of knocking at the end that nothing 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.850
 material that already has to be punctured with 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:04.300
 it so very simple 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:08.530
 the result is that changes little thing Not Made 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:11.740
 the program is seen from scratch, right? 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:17.919
 we did on this front is what you have in 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:22.150
 program here sr 123 06 and 10 grandchildren and 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:24.330
 four cnc is the same program now I go 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:32.050
 put another that is not 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:34.690
 in the same sequence it will not even go 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:38.849
 change little that now fixes well 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.849
 here then is not this the future before 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:54.729
 hence after the tool the people 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:57.760
 m 5000 puts me one thing that is now 

00:06:54.729 --> 00:07:03.610
 the same thing there that basic sequence 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:04.900
 there to deposit 1 and 29 in low rotation 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:10.560
 certain 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:13.060
 basically voting 8400 121.238 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.789
 would turn off the deflation cycle of 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:18.490
 positioning judgment and end and the 

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:31.120
 blocks remember well to put this here 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:34.060
 and here also 9 will make it stand and 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.889
 now floating right 

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.849
 You will see the same thing as 

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:42.830
 it works is a thing in the circus 

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:45.349
 Let's do that already in the sequence here. 

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:46.849
 will notice the difference, right? 

00:07:45.349 --> 00:07:49.969
 we do not have here you can float 

00:07:46.849 --> 00:07:51.349
 ante is a fixed but the program if there is 

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:54.939
 This cycle is just here. 

00:07:51.349 --> 00:07:57.889
 knowing to cross and that 's the one I see 

00:07:54.939 --> 00:08:00.409
 thus 

00:07:57.889 --> 00:08:02.360
 the theme of the floating future that 

00:08:00.409 --> 00:08:06.499
 different here in the sequence just repair 

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:10.179
 that just so people have hope 

00:08:06.499 --> 00:08:10.179
 liked and until the next
