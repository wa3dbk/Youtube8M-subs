00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello and welcome to a new one 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.819
 follow it in career mode jo it 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.210
 goes back to stand today 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.460
 napoli the table night and lazio rome 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.110
 in the cup at two very interesting 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.150
 I think games and there is an equal 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.730
 pretty good if you do not quite 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.470
 - but quite interesting news because 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.420
 I became so our contract should be so 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.279
 slowly sorted out and on the 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.560
 Transfer list is packed is yes 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.820
 anyway quite so eventful just 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.949
 with us on the transfermarkt on the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.910
 internal because even there it looks like 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.710
 Of course we go but we look 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.410
 Of course, now in the game 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.620
 went off where the pure in the us 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.540
 first scene for as rom and makino 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.700
 of now they are always very nice 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.579
 retrieves the out then the 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.260
 distance shot arequipa namely casting 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.870
 he has no problems and can hit the ball 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.230
 clarify was there's an attack 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.730
 by cavani for ssc napoli on wagners 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.579
 and then this very good technique of 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.340
 learning office castaner cassettes makes it 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.829
 will quickly bring the ball now 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.420
 equal to lorenzi the winner cashed in 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.040
 the camp still starts today 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.630
 even now it tries with the hard 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.900
 shot and future with the margin and 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.619
 then it is soon in 11 16 anja den 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.450
 movie minute almost the 1 0 for a is rom 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.610
 after that really very interesting 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.140
 unfortunately did of la gazette only opponent 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.460
 and then they decide in the 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.020
 and then it goes on 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.490
 again for as rom and florence already the 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.799
 attack and then this one 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.759
 very good shot of machir but so far 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.470
 Besides 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.470
 Of course Napoli has the 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.700
 chance over the ball now very high 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.829
 brings guest was there you actually think 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.990
 the ball is already gone but was that 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.420
 but there is still gold project in 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.939
 forests and can also relax him 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.040
 then wants to hold on and determine 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.479
 sometimes tear something up again 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.250
 and try this shot and 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.159
 Tastings there and doing it very well 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.990
 In addition corner the manufactured came but there is 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.850
 again Germany in the gate on 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.259
 ball and can be the next 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.030
 watch the scene like it was again for 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.500
 hissing storm and very interesting 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.939
 shot probably hold the thing 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.670
 not on direct that deducts again and 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.009
 then they'll roll in the rollers and stuff 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.590
 it says after 40 minutes 1 0 for aachen 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.380
 between made and on it goes in 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.300
 the 2 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.970
 time and time there is a nato attack 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.770
 which is interrupted by florenz la 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.960
 gazette is always on florence now 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.190
 very good interaction and florence them 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.090
 tried on the shot meets only the 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.800
 post 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.570
 and then you have the right ball 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.930
 Do not jump directly to teammates 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.580
 continue on stream now here on 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.010
 pass by but not easy 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.720
 again on Cyprus and he looks 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.850
 the thing out and push things on the left 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.130
 over that was the thirtieth tim 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.970
 weak foot you can see right yes that 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.620
 that was a bit too easy 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.850
 actually that things keep quiet 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.640
 could have been harmful since the game 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.340
 owner klaus of this distance is that 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.750
 hard to do, but yes, too 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.120
 Defense is not really good and 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.800
 we continue into the next scene 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.590
 again everything went almost exclusively 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.910
 a direction and de rossi drags the 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.250
 ball forward can be here 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.780
 push away the ball straight down 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.700
 he is already on the gazette 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.830
 two separate bit involved 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.570
 was definitely on the rossi again 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.900
 and again testing and then you can 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:13.390
 clarify ball 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.730
 napoli again dumitru carlo on the 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.580
 back on the right and then on 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.510
 very good pass and yes how to get it 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.550
 I can actually do that 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.020
 That said, that did not really bother me 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.850
 Surprisingly that was already the 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.830
 race in belgrade in the ninetieth 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.540
 if desired and the connecting gate 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.960
 But yes, you can do that too 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.420
 already 202 in doublepack is now very much 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.730
 moderate game on both sides you have to 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.990
 a cheeper make more chances 93 or 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.940
 was then a good game of too 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.370
 also determine from the subjective 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.080
 seen and now is the cup 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.520
 but against lazio rom fall there are 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.890
 no good news because 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.240
 bags it looks will be preaching in the 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.830
 more specifically to Manchester City 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.260
 change 8,5 million 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.209
 too bad a pity because I have it sees it 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.490
 really liked that were very good player 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.410
 in midfield better than bradley found 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.120
 I florence is on the very good way 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.440
 really good 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.440
 to do the ossi too slowly 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.730
 lorenz is now 84 years old 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.990
 I show up at the end yes then times the 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.670
 always good of them all 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.230
 too bad it can not do anything 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.330
 bradley will definitely be his 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.239
 place in midfield probably over 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.830
 Of course the pianist hurt bitterly 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.480
 but let's see what comes out 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.930
 but also look something against now 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.580
 lazio rome in the cup so comes out and 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.920
 the first scene was for eduardo 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.930
 Ryan brings the ball and the 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.590
 first chance by header but luck he 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.050
 has the ball 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.060
 and there's no problem though rate 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.640
 then always lets here very well 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.650
 due to his through and then hardy 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.000
 Of course, the slide should be the ball 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.380
 there is of course still red 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.600
 card if one caught the opponent so 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.700
 learn or castan of course now 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.510
 Mostly put on after i butt 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.420
 so not anymore 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.390
 bitter bitter bitter but that would be me 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.190
 even just banned card and so on 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.140
 must roma with a player less 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.840
 play bavaria vom platz go ours 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.460
 left wing and for that I became so 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.070
 actually sorted out for 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.260
 Income and knew was now the 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.930
 chance for the free kick or not 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.520
 runs over it and then filed lewitt 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.890
 and that was a very good try 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.480
 gicquel kanoute which earned nothing 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.450
 but it could go on high, too 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.250
 because that's the ex-mom then right now 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.470
 this good grischa but because that remains 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.850
 on the ball in red on lulic the bossen yes 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.380
 again a very good quote but lulic 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.900
 stay on the ball and then this extra shot 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.670
 Talat and I do not even have one 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.280
 ansatzweise a clue how the yes not 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.900
 go inside comes on it goes florence 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.760
 is very nice in ballet here 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.460
 on bradley and then the shot well 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.230
 held but then after storm 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.420
 try with the header does that 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.770
 thing in again 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.420
 they are following pretty soon 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.620
 stumped strong but also the 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.540
 Bradley's protection was not like that 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.490
 weak and she definitely stops 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:53.010
 right where he needs to be does that 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.590
 to have a look in but have a look ahead 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.270
 at half-time for several I do not know 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.400
 also one 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.540
 yes mitterrands like it here is for 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.370
 luck nothing bad remains however 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.960
 left drewer on the right side can 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.240
 bring your rows and it was 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.220
 dangerous because gold return that way 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.080
 really sure except 1 new one red 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.210
 a gate could run better 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.550
 maybe in the second half there 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.320
 but also has the chance to win 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.820
 on the compensation by very different 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.220
 think over and then go to the ball 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.620
 Far left packing unbelievable 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.510
 helenius is leaving lazio here 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.820
 The dane who came in for Valdez 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:28.970
 somehow tries to get the ball into the goal 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.620
 steer gold so wonderful and held 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.990
 then actually the team could 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.030
 units but nothing earned again 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.550
 helios and salads interact and then 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.320
 was where this already so the yellow 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.240
 card has the first half and the 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.220
 then yes the tackling directly against the 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.140
 man for the chip ball could be said 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.360
 red again and that's incredible 

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.410
 two red cards so now in the 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.760
 last two minutes 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.290
 and again candreva has the 

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.720
 free kick situation is running again 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.950
 over and then the second man and does 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.870
 that makes a not very good 

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.980
 and on it goes again the chance 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.120
 Of course hardly now 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.950
 defender backside actually 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.690
 you have to be sure in paris comes 

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:05.900
 helenius is not behind 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.850
 at the gate with right past the right which is 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.340
 unbelievable what lazio has here 

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.750
 were really complete themselves 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.490
 surprisingly, especially his chance of 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:16.070
 you start completely 70 meters 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:18.410
 actually hewn off pretty well 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:22.220
 happy 8,1 or 40 already at his 

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:23.630
 eigentor was offensively really moderate 

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.680
 of course, after this red card as well 

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.280
 understandable if you are a player 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.160
 had less 

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.750
 but it must actually be better 

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.540
 the two red cards tied bitterly though 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:34.700
 perfectly justified it was just 

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:37.160
 not exactly smart or good 

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.600
 defended and so it is now in 

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.860
 the next cup round but first 

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.700
 is the league in the next episode 

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.700
 and till then
