00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
is this because on that cross we've

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.220

fine I mean the speed is were um rapid
fire<00:01:57.899> is<00:01:58.320> ok<00:01:59.040> but<00:01:59.630> you<00:02:00.630> don't<00:02:00.780> have<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:00.990> put<00:02:01.229> it

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
fire is ok but you don't have to put it

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.440 
fire is ok but you don't have to put it
something<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.549> don't<00:02:02.850> really<00:02:03.030> have<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.240> have

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
something you don't really have to have

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.069 
something you don't really have to have
and<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:04.229> fire<00:02:04.530> mode<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.189> automatic<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.899> you

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
and the fire mode is automatic that you

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.010 
and the fire mode is automatic that you
can't<00:02:07.320> change<00:02:07.619> from<00:02:08.450> automatic<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.539> fine<00:02:09.780> I

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
can't change from automatic is fine I

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.070 
can't change from automatic is fine I
think<00:02:10.739> burst<00:02:11.039> fire<00:02:11.400> wouldn't<00:02:12.090> be<00:02:12.239> like<00:02:12.450> good

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
think burst fire wouldn't be like good

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.110 
think burst fire wouldn't be like good
