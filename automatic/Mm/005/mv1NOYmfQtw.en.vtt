Hi! Today I`m making "Badambura". It`s national sweetness from Azerbaijan cuisine.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:34.080
2 eggs brake in a bowl, add pinch of salt

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.500
2 tablespoon sour cream

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:51.320
100 g sugar

00:00:52.506 --> 00:00:59.366
1/2 package vanilla

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.820
Pour in separate bowl 300 ml milk

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:11.920
 add 1 tablespoon dry yeast in it

00:01:12.713 --> 00:01:22.913
Mix ingredients

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.120
Now add to this mass some flour

00:01:36.778 --> 00:01:41.158
Totally for Badambura you need 800 g flour.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:02:01.840
Mix well

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.060
Ä°n a separate dish beat sour cream with eggs

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:14.940
add 50 g softened butter and beat again

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:19.659
Add mix of milk &amp; flouer mass to mix of sour cream &amp; egg

00:02:20.903 --> 00:02:25.743
Mix with tablespoon as mass is sticky

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:45.880
Slowly add rest of flour and mix well

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.160
Now just put dough on the table

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.140
Cover surface of dought with towel 

00:03:10.424 --> 00:03:17.184
You need to press down just once, then you can work with it

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.780
Divide dought into 2 equal parts

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:46.820
Each part divide into 10 equal parts

00:03:51.380 --> 00:04:00.840
Strew some flour on the table, run in each piece

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.780
apply some oil on the table

00:04:14.692 --> 00:04:17.872
now distribute rolled dough on the table

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.020
you should fix edges of dough

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.380
apply some softened  butter to surface

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.140
For lubricate you need 250 g butter, but you need to melt it beforehead

00:04:39.531 --> 00:04:42.011
Then put 2nd opened dough over 1st one

00:04:42.466 --> 00:04:46.026
fix edges, apply some butter

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.680
Badambura usually has 5 layers

00:04:56.369 --> 00:04:58.289
Do the same with other layers

00:04:59.611 --> 00:05:05.831
It`s the last layer

00:05:07.817 --> 00:05:11.517
Use minimum butter 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:32.320
Cut edge of dough and then make roll

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:05.380
Cut edges of roll, make roll from 2nd dough also

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.280
Filling: 250 g almonds, 250 g sugar

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.960
 12 grain cardamon

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:26.880
Now I`m cutting roll into pieced and forming "Badambura"

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.860
You should hide edge of dough

00:06:47.880 --> 00:07:08.460
Make deepening, add some filling then merge edges

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:24.840
Now put them in oven-tray, you can cook them even with or without baking paper. Just you need to apply paper/oven-tray some butter

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:34.100
Cooked Badamburas can be whitish or yellowish

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:41.080
