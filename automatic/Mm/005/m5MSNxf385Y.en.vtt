00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.520
 and very good to all of us kids we are in 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:10.600
 minecraft but this time I bring you a 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.580
 textures pack and good as you are 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.280
 seeing from now on adventures and 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:19.120
 also the map the official hour map 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.640
 of adventures the real good we're going to 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.580
 put a player 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.070
 adventure time and here we are kids 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.610
 as you can see 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.610
 finish 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.360
 if you see that it looks a bit like that 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.250
 blurry is normal because I have a pack 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.020
 of 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.870
 so that the shadows and 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.250
 movement in the leaves and so on that yes 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.750
 I am interested also I can put it but 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.820
 I already say that you have to have very good 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.070
 very good computer graphics card if 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.590
 you do not see petado look that mine we 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.310
 evils and look a very tight so 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.740
 I will have to remove it but good 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:01.010
 in this gameplay what I'm going to do is 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.899
 talk about these textures this map 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.030
 that puts it in the description box 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:10.080
 to download both the skin 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:14.909
 as much as the map as the textures of 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:18.550
 hour of adventures is worth the one that erased 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:22.110
 you see me but it's very detailed everything 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.800
 it would not be as bad for me as it was for me 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.300
 let's see 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.940
 Well here we are again 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.310
 we are in 12.5 decide to go back 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.150
 but I will say that for now 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.280
 Adventures works in both versions 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.760
 but I've decided to wear it 12.5 because I 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.910
 is better and we are going to enter the map another 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.910
 time 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.170
 and here we are now if it's perfect and 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.340
 we have the time textures of 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.770
 adventures with our character as 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:58.660
 here we have it here we have end too 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:01.490
 we have the dog and we have several 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.650
 areas of the series is that I have not 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.659
 seen the series of everything in seen two or 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.600
 three chapters I've been watching for three days 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.190
 while generating the room does not 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.580
 is in something else and I start to see other 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.840
 adventures you have to notice and I said hey 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.400
 there has to be some minecraft to 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.970
 from now on adventures it seems that 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.709
 people are really enjoying it and I'm 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.400
 locked in this house the house of purpose 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.290
 let's get out of here 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.550
 as you can see the textures are super 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.930
 similar to what the series is worth 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.140
 look at everything we are going to go to 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.140
 Water 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.280
 and good we go to the rest and good what is it 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.790
 I wanted to teach you 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.130
 the mountains to everything is that it's the same as 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.850
 draw and that in time of adventures like 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:54.270
 we can see our menu rosita we have 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.310
 different good different objects 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.160
 textures on the objects as we can see 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.540
 they have changed them to those that are very 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.569
 well they are very animated in pretty well 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:09.129
 or the clipper here we are with the sword 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.129
 the authentic sword 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.880
 our 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.710
 the triplet clipper not the adventures 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:32.260
 the archers 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.260
 with different textures 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.450
 so that it would be out of my life 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.790
 and as you can see is very similar to time 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.790
 of dragon adventures all 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.030
 so no kids here you can see 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.050
 that if final the whole house of purpose 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.750
 everything just like now of adventures and nothing 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.690
 I hope you like it and maybe I will encourage 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.000
 keep going up pack so to speak of 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.140
 this style not of some series or something 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.390
 what 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.690
 not a series or some movie or something 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.940
 well and upload the textures the pack and everything 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.040
 so nothing if you like the idea because 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.080
 you know and I do not expect you to like it because 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.480
 you can take advantage if you want 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.390
 do a series of hours of adventures 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.459
 it would be pretty good and very original as well 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:25.100
 that nothing here I leave the material and we 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.100
 we see in upcoming videos and until another
