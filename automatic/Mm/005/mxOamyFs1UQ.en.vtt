00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:27.780 
specification wise they are a very very

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.690 
specification wise they are a very very
bland<00:00:28.110> car<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.530> Germans<00:00:28.920> are<00:00:29.190> renowned<00:00:29.580> for

that<00:00:29.940> but<00:00:30.090> build<00:00:30.300> quality<00:00:30.540> is<00:00:30.930> second<00:00:31.440> to<00:00:31.560> none

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
that but build quality is second to none

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.220 
that but build quality is second to none
it's<00:00:32.759> an<00:00:32.879> automatic<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.660> that's<00:00:33.839> one<00:00:34.019> good

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
it's an automatic so that's one good

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.989 
it's an automatic so that's one good
plus<00:00:34.499> point<00:00:34.739> because<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.129> manuals<00:00:35.460> are<00:00:35.670> not

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:35.999 
plus point because the manuals are not

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:38.090 
plus point because the manuals are not
particularly<00:00:36.420> favoured<00:00:37.410> now<00:00:37.710> in<00:00:37.949> the

piece of advice is always look for an
auto<00:00:48.749> as<00:00:49.260> they<00:00:49.589> do<00:00:49.649> keep<00:00:49.949> better<00:00:50.129> money<00:00:50.399> so

the four but it's lost it over five
years<00:00:55.559> which<00:00:55.859> is<00:00:55.979> the<00:00:56.100> key<00:00:56.280> thing<00:00:56.519> if<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:56.999> look

00:00:57.169 --> 00:00:57.179 
years which is the key thing if you look

00:00:57.179 --> 00:00:59.059 
years which is the key thing if you look
on<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> depreciation<00:00:57.719> ladder<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.589> cost<00:00:58.949> of

on the depreciation ladder the cost of

ownership on these two vehicles the

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.160 
ownership on these two vehicles the
Mercedes<00:01:00.929> is<00:01:01.079> by<00:01:01.260> far<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.559> one<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.949> own<00:01:02.300> so<00:01:03.300> in

Mercedes is by far the one to own so in

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.350 
Mercedes is by far the one to own so in
terms<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.710> sort<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:04.949> running<00:01:05.280> costs<00:01:05.700> how<00:01:06.210> would

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
terms of sort of running costs how would

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.080 
terms of sort of running costs how would
they<00:01:06.479> compare<00:01:07.490> petrol<00:01:08.490> wise<00:01:08.670> really

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
they compare petrol wise really

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.219 
they compare petrol wise really
obviously<00:01:09.420> you're<00:01:09.600> going<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.750> what<00:01:10.079> you'll

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
obviously you're going to what you'll

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.380 
obviously you're going to what you'll
find<00:01:10.409> with<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.799> six<00:01:11.130> six-cylinder<00:01:12.090> versus

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
find with the six six-cylinder versus

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.760 
find with the six six-cylinder versus
the<00:01:12.479> four-cylinder<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.259> this<00:01:13.409> one<00:01:13.560> will<00:01:13.619> be<00:01:13.740> a

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
the four-cylinder so this one will be a

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.410 
the four-cylinder so this one will be a
little<00:01:13.920> bit<00:01:14.189> heftier<00:01:14.549> on<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> old<00:01:14.969> petrol

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
little bit heftier on the old petrol

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.270 
little bit heftier on the old petrol
running<00:01:16.110> costs<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.469> service<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.100> if<00:01:17.189> you

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
running costs and service and if you

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.190 
running costs and service and if you
were<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.460> take<00:01:17.670> these<00:01:17.820> two<00:01:18.180> dealers<00:01:18.689> back<00:01:18.960> to

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
were to take these two dealers back to

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.779 
were to take these two dealers back to
the<00:01:19.500> two<00:01:19.680> vehicles<00:01:19.829> back<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.219> the<00:01:20.310> respective

the two vehicles back to the respective
dealers<00:01:21.210> you'll<00:01:21.600> find<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.960> Mercedes<00:01:22.530> cost<00:01:22.950> of

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
dealers you'll find the Mercedes cost of

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.679 
dealers you'll find the Mercedes cost of
ownership<00:01:23.219> on<00:01:23.579> servicing<00:01:24.060> will<00:01:24.270> be<00:01:24.450> slightly

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
ownership on servicing will be slightly

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.020 
ownership on servicing will be slightly
higher<00:01:24.960> than<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.259> Ford<00:01:25.590> but<00:01:26.549> there<00:01:26.700> again<00:01:26.909> it

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
higher than the Ford but there again it

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.370 
higher than the Ford but there again it
will<00:01:27.119> pay<00:01:27.299> dividends<00:01:27.750> because<00:01:28.079> of<00:01:28.200> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
will pay dividends because of the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.959 
will pay dividends because of the
residual<00:01:28.799> value<00:01:28.950> when<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.340> come<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.640> sell<00:01:29.820> it

refinement for superb comfort but why do

refinement for superb comfort but why do
they<00:03:11.590> make<00:03:11.769> cars<00:03:12.130> just<00:03:12.489> so<00:03:12.700> bland<00:03:13.319> inside<00:03:14.319> this

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
they make cars just so bland inside this

has<00:03:14.920> always<00:03:15.100> been<00:03:15.370> one<00:03:15.519> of<00:03:15.549> the<00:03:15.670> criticisms

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
has always been one of the criticisms

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.240 
has always been one of the criticisms
for<00:03:16.450> me<00:03:16.599> about<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:17.170> c-class<00:03:17.799> range<00:03:18.069> in

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
for me about the c-class range in

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.879 
for me about the c-class range in
particular<00:03:18.549> now<00:03:19.329> this<00:03:19.480> is<00:03:19.630> a<00:03:19.660> c200<00:03:20.410> elegance

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
particular now this is a c200 elegance

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.640 
particular now this is a c200 elegance
so<00:03:21.370> it's<00:03:21.519> not<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.880> bass<00:03:22.090> classic<00:03:22.540> range<00:03:23.019> which

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
so it's not the bass classic range which

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.470 
so it's not the bass classic range which
gets<00:03:23.950> practically<00:03:24.670> nothing<00:03:25.090> on<00:03:25.209> it<00:03:25.239> this

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
gets practically nothing on it this

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.809 
gets practically nothing on it this
should<00:03:25.750> have<00:03:26.019> a<00:03:26.230> few<00:03:26.889> bits<00:03:27.069> and<00:03:27.220> bobs<00:03:27.310> on<00:03:27.700> it

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
should have a few bits and bobs on it

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.089 
should have a few bits and bobs on it
but<00:03:28.420> it<00:03:28.540> hasn't<00:03:28.810> particularly<00:03:29.500> there's<00:03:29.919> no

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
but it hasn't particularly there's no

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:32.490 
but it hasn't particularly there's no

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
air conditioning there is a stereo but

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.589 
air conditioning there is a stereo but
it's<00:03:32.620> not<00:03:32.889> a<00:03:33.069> sort<00:03:33.340> of<00:03:33.370> quality<00:03:33.849> stereo<00:03:34.120> system

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
it's not a sort of quality stereo system

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.390 
it's not a sort of quality stereo system
that<00:03:34.720> you<00:03:34.810> will<00:03:34.959> expect<00:03:35.410> to<00:03:35.590> find<00:03:35.919> on<00:03:36.099> a<00:03:36.160> car

pedal<00:04:50.930> which<00:04:51.620> actually<00:04:52.070> takes<00:04:52.340> a<00:04:52.430> bit<00:04:52.580> of

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
pedal which actually takes a bit of

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.010 
pedal which actually takes a bit of
getting<00:04:52.699> used<00:04:52.940> to<00:04:53.210> because<00:04:53.360> it<00:04:53.510> can<00:04:53.690> be<00:04:53.780> quite

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
getting used to because it can be quite

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.839 
getting used to because it can be quite
sticky<00:04:54.560> when<00:04:54.710> you<00:04:54.830> first<00:04:55.039> put<00:04:55.370> your<00:04:55.400> foot<00:04:55.669> down

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:55.849 
sticky when you first put your foot down

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:57.520 
sticky when you first put your foot down
and<00:04:56.090> you<00:04:56.150> sort<00:04:56.539> of<00:04:56.570> just<00:04:56.750> have<00:04:56.900> to<00:04:57.020> gently

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
and you sort of just have to gently

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.140 
and you sort of just have to gently
gently<00:04:57.710> and<00:04:57.949> that<00:04:58.070> it's<00:04:58.190> like<00:04:58.370> you<00:04:58.909> lurch

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
gently and that it's like you lurch

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.659 
gently and that it's like you lurch
forward<00:04:59.449> a<00:04:59.780> little<00:04:59.990> bit<00:05:00.229> anyway<00:05:00.349> so<00:05:01.099> this<00:05:01.250> 200

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
forward a little bit anyway so this 200

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.850 
forward a little bit anyway so this 200
model<00:05:01.970> has<00:05:02.090> got<00:05:02.150> 136<00:05:03.139> brake<00:05:03.380> horsepower

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
model has got 136 brake horsepower

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.149 
model has got 136 brake horsepower
engine<00:05:04.220> so<00:05:04.430> it's<00:05:04.610> way<00:05:05.300> way<00:05:05.599> down<00:05:05.870> on<00:05:06.380> the<00:05:06.440> 2.9

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:07.159 
engine so it's way way down on the 2.9

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:09.670 
engine so it's way way down on the 2.9
v6<00:05:07.760> in<00:05:07.970> the<00:05:08.090> Scorpio<00:05:08.659> there<00:05:09.260> are<00:05:09.380> lots<00:05:09.560> of

other different engines in the c-class
range<00:05:11.539> from<00:05:12.020> the<00:05:12.199> 180<00:05:12.740> through<00:05:13.490> the<00:05:13.580> 200

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
range from the 180 through the 200

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.249 
range from the 180 through the 200
there's<00:05:14.330> a<00:05:14.389> 2.2<00:05:15.139> 2.4<00:05:16.270> 2.3<00:05:17.270> engines<00:05:17.720> some<00:05:18.169> of

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:18.259 
there's a 2.2 2.4 2.3 engines some of

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:20.439 
there's a 2.2 2.4 2.3 engines some of
these<00:05:18.349> are<00:05:18.530> in<00:05:18.610> production<00:05:19.610> now<00:05:19.759> and<00:05:19.940> some<00:05:20.150> not

also<00:05:21.380> the<00:05:21.500> 2.8<00:05:22.130> v6<00:05:22.430> the<00:05:23.090> one<00:05:23.240> to<00:05:23.389> look<00:05:23.509> for

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
also the 2.8 v6 the one to look for

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.960 
also the 2.8 v6 the one to look for
maybe<00:05:23.900> that's<00:05:24.229> the<00:05:24.349> best<00:05:24.620> of<00:05:24.800> the<00:05:24.889> range<00:05:25.130> plus

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
maybe that's the best of the range plus

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.469 
maybe that's the best of the range plus
2.5<00:05:27.190> diesel<00:05:28.190> engines<00:05:28.580> 2<00:05:28.909> which<00:05:29.300> offer
