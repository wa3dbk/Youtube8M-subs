00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
I go ahead and check for updates but I

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.170 
I go ahead and check for updates but I
don't<00:01:25.979> have<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.159> system<00:01:26.640> automatically

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
don't have the system automatically

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.940
