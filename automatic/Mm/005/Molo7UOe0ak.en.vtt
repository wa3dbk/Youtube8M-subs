00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:07.100
 together the videorecensione of xiaomi 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.660
 minute pro I want to offer you one 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.910
 selection of five interesting aspects 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.740
 of my software you have entered 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.509
 inside this smartphone are 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.939
 five characteristics that I have 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.740
 surprised by their simplicity and for the 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:21.380
 fact that often are not found on 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.000
 the most famous terminals we start the 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.560
 more interesting and curious locations 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.539
 we find almost all of the miniseries 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.070
 in the system settings 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.080
 let's get inside them and let's scroll 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.210
 up to the additional settings of the 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.760
 additional settings compared to those 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.850
 we say defined as main that 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.640
 above all they are actually additional 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.649
 compared to almost standard settings 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.300
 we all have a lot of phones here 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.800
 customization opportunities that 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.079
 I want to show the one related to 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.590
 capacitive buttons in fact they are 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.840
 three back home and multitasking with though 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.000
 still the graphic of the menu key ad 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.190
 burgers and all these buttons 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.170
 can be customized 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.170
 the same multitasking menu can 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.460
 just become the menu button as you are 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.860
 did in the old versions of android 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.540
 and you can also choose the 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.920
 behavior of the three buttons to one 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.420
 long press 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.240
 first of all we can define the period 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.090
 of time of this pressure precisely 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.770
 extended from 0.5 seconds to 2 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.320
 seconds but then you can choose which ad 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.500
 example the button for multitasking monsters 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.180
 the application menu with medium 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.490
 second pressure or the key 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.500
 home become key to launch google 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.619
 now that the back one allows to close 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.720
 the application currently not open 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.240
 only you can also choose either 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.750
 switch the light on or off as desired 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.850
 and also for how long to keep it on 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.880
 I chose the lighting wind 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.020
 the setting always that is always coming back 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.399
 back is another 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.380
 customization is always relative 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.500
 let's say buttons ie those at 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.079
 headphone buttons very often 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.280
 we buy caps that they have 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:02.200
 this remote control with buttons in the 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.560
 part 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.149
 let's say central and not always headphones 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.550
 let's say food these buttons work 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.230
 on all phones with mine and not both 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.120
 of this problem we are going to connect 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.160
 our headphones at the top 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.030
 of the terminal and doing this comes 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.040
 the opportunity to 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.530
 customize the behavior of 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.569
 these buttons the choices are two yes 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.550
 can choose which buttons to control 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.330
 volume or reproduction 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.510
 musical 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.400
 choosing one of the two options is possible 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.780
 then go to assign buttons 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.299
 by preventing 1 he understands 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.580
 automatically that this below is the 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.989
 negative button is that one 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.560
 central always allow to put 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.120
 paused not only in this one 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.780
 screen we also will bring it to 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.170
 quench the audio equalizer between 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.560
 which some equalizers designed for 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:59.230
 headphones especially those of xiao mi 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.510
 themselves including the 2 tracks that they are 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.890
 very good cheap headphones 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.420
 you can buy them for about 15 20 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.340
 euro that we reviewed just 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.350
 a few days ago on reed ball and that 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.650
 so I suggest you go and see 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.579
 find the link in the tab here 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.069
 of the top right corner of youtube 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:17.139
 or in description we go back 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.299
 we leave the headphones also connected for 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.769
 go see other settings a lot 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.790
 very curious this really not me 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.350
 I expect 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.410
 it is called reading mode and it is 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.920
 practically a version of fluxx and the 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:33.160
 well-known software for mac and windows computers 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.440
 and linux that allows you to use the 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.900
 best computer in the evening when maybe 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.769
 you don't want to be blinded by the display 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:45.040
 the same thing is carried on the 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.780
 our shop minute pro in named 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.280
 precisely this mode of reading 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.889
 mode can be activated is 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.660
 disabled at will as you see it 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:55.569
 screen acquires a color a 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.940
 a little more yellow the value we say 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.690
 of the effect can also be 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.810
 customized now to show you 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.639
 best I will keep it very high and it can 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.250
 also go to choose whether to have a 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:08.319
 global range a global local range 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.870
 means that we will do the activation 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.100
 us manually by pressing this button 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.830
 instead activation 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.080
 in the local it always happens in the moment in 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.420
 which a certain application comes from 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.650
 activated and we have a list from 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.480
 which to choose the applications 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.420
 in this case we prefer to do the 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.010
 try with cpu z 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.840
 I 'm going to open it and as you see 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.090
 the is automatically applied 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.470
 reading filter is a very very thing 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.880
 comfortable 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.990
 let's go back to the menu for a while 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.940
 settings to let you see that too 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.760
 if one were a Chinese user it could 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.050
 also have the opportunity to do 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.370
 update the list when physically 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.290
 through the network then all the 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.360
 applications of their say store 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.580
 online compatible with the mode 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.710
 reading would automatically activate it 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.760
 the moment we go to it 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.260
 use this reading mode is 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.080
 very interesting in our third 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:05.320
 I prefer my fourth aspect 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.920
 favorite of the mini one and sorry it's not 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.320
 in chrome 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.480
 unfortunately never in the system browser 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.520
 system browser as you see is 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.710
 all dark in this case because why 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.650
 having used the phone last night 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.020
 I could enable the pardon 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.850
 night mode 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.380
 maybe now he is not seeing us almost 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.460
 nothing here is finally back in the 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.140
 day mode 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.020
 you can choose to enable one 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.790
 mode suitable for the evening with 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.790
 very low backlight e 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:35.830
 especially texts that change based 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.420
 to the background therefore in this case not 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.770
 we have more black on white but white on 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.710
 black is really a very feature 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:45.370
 very comfortable and something that is not 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:47.320
 often present on other phones 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.620
 companies and hole is very very particular 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.210
 because based is not a thing of the site 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.740
 web but it's something that makes its own 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.580
 the browser automatically and that is 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:59.490
 universal therefore very very practical 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.660
 we close by going into the settings 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.850
 this is defined as security 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.340
 application as often is present on 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:08.470
 other Chinese terminals that allows with 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.000
 a by pressing this button 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.040
 start the whole series of scans on 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.820
 terminals there is a memory cleaner 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.790
 there's a 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.470
 a data counter that allows 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.240
 just to keep an eye on and there is consumption 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.510
 a very complete black list for 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.490
 avoid unwanted people there 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.200
 can send messages or there 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.870
 can call there is a check 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.400
 the classic is advanced in the battery 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.260
 antivirus 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.640
 we want to understand what viruses are able to 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.460
 take on their phones but 

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.980
 above all there is a feature that 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:42.020
 will come on android will come on android 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.850
 ran next months with android m but that 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.050
 here the control of the is already present 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.790
 permits 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.240
 the permits are divided into two 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:51.440
 autostart categories are applications 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.820
 to which we want to give the opportunity 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.310
 to start automatically 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:57.740
 when switching on the terminal a lot 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:59.660
 convenient to disable them to keep an eye on 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.590
 consumption and then we have the permits 

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.120
 individual 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.800
 in practice one can choose one 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.930
 whatever application we choose 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.240
 facebook which is known for the amount of 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:10.880
 permits that you go to get and there yes 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.130
 they can allow access to 

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.770
 certain characteristics as well as deny 

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:18.290
 in this case I don't want that ad 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:20.210
 example facebook can access mine 

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.370
 camera to the phone's camera 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:24.910
 so I'm going to deny this opportunity 

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:27.710
 but if maybe I want to give him access 

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:29.540
 to the audio so I can the microphone 

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:34.820
 also choose the prompt option that 

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:36.230
 allows us to ask ourselves each time whether to give 

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.800
 or not the permission to access the 

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.600
 microphone 

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.250
 this is the very very convenient function 

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.160
 very very complete maybe even 

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:45.770
 more complete than the controller of 

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:49.430
 android m permissions 

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:50.390
 this was show minute pro and his new 

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:52.430
 high 6 

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:54.260
