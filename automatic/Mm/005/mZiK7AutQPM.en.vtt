00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
recorder instead of my imovie that i

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.730 
recorder instead of my imovie that i
usually<00:01:18.630> use<00:01:18.659> because<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.200> wouldn't<00:01:19.500> let<00:01:19.590> me

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
usually use because it wouldn't let me

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.539 
usually use because it wouldn't let me
import<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.640> windows<00:01:21.150> media<00:01:21.950> file<00:01:22.950> into

import the windows media file into

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.140 
import the windows media file into
imovie<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.570> edit<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.200> I'm<00:01:25.640> without<00:01:26.640> lack<00:01:27.000> of

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
imovie to edit so I'm without lack of

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.200 
imovie to edit so I'm without lack of
quality<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:28.250> so<00:01:29.250> i<00:01:29.579> think<00:01:29.640> i'm<00:01:30.000> going<00:01:30.119> to

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
quality that is so i think i'm going to

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.190 
quality that is so i think i'm going to

vulnerable I get a one-shot headshot on
that<00:04:21.130> data<00:04:22.170> people<00:04:23.170> say<00:04:23.500> that<00:04:24.040> this<00:04:24.400> gun<00:04:24.700> is

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
that data people say that this gun is

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.530 
that data people say that this gun is
very<00:04:25.120> all<00:04:25.510> over<00:04:25.870> the<00:04:25.990> place<00:04:26.430> with<00:04:27.430> its<00:04:27.700> power

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
very all over the place with its power

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:34.020 
very all over the place with its power
like<00:04:29.290> one<00:04:29.530> shot<00:04:29.830> to<00:04:30.070> shot<00:04:30.340> to<00:04:30.550> shot<00:04:30.820> so<00:04:31.450> on<00:04:33.030> but

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
like one shot to shot to shot so on but

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.240 
like one shot to shot to shot so on but
it's<00:04:34.210> because<00:04:34.510> of<00:04:34.540> the<00:04:34.750> range<00:04:34.990> if<00:04:35.920> they're

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
it's because of the range if they're

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.130 
it's because of the range if they're
further<00:04:36.520> away<00:04:36.790> with<00:04:37.120> a<00:04:37.150> sniper<00:04:37.390> rifle<00:04:37.600> you'll

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
further away with a sniper rifle you'll

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.160 
further away with a sniper rifle you'll
notice<00:04:38.560> that<00:04:38.770> it<00:04:39.670> is<00:04:39.820> two<00:04:40.120> shots<00:04:40.480> of<00:04:40.630> free<00:04:40.870> shot

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
notice that it is two shots of free shot

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.920 
notice that it is two shots of free shot
because<00:04:42.130> battlefield<00:04:42.940> 3<00:04:43.210> is<00:04:43.420> much<00:04:43.690> more

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
because battlefield 3 is much more

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.600 
because battlefield 3 is much more
realistic<00:04:44.110> than<00:04:44.500> your<00:04:44.800> standard<00:04:45.010> shooters

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
realistic than your standard shooters

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.690 
realistic than your standard shooters
such<00:04:45.820> as<00:04:45.970> ecology<00:04:47.010> they<00:04:48.010> actually<00:04:48.220> took<00:04:48.640> a

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
such as ecology they actually took a

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.960 
such as ecology they actually took a
range<00:04:49.030> into<00:04:49.900> to<00:04:50.620> effect<00:04:51.010> Oh<00:04:51.340> into

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
range into to effect Oh into

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.060 
range into to effect Oh into
consideration<00:04:52.750> about<00:04:53.350> how<00:04:53.680> many<00:04:53.890> bullets

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
consideration about how many bullets

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.900 
consideration about how many bullets
should<00:04:54.520> take<00:04:55.110> but<00:04:56.110> yeah<00:04:56.590> medium<00:04:57.370> to<00:04:57.550> like

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
should take but yeah medium to like

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.840 
should take but yeah medium to like
close<00:04:58.180> to<00:04:58.240> medium<00:04:58.750> range<00:04:58.990> one<00:04:59.620> shot<00:04:59.980> long

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850
