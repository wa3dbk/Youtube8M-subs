00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.839
 hello together i want you in one 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.450
 show how to nico with the video 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.519
 means so-called look puff means 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.830
 the basic idea behind it I already have 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:20.090
 something is prepared here are my four 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:23.130
 hypo clones and my name nico me 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.760
 put me on the taste space 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:30.420
 Say if I go into the settings 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.949
 then here's your selection on space 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.010
 can also feel like other keys for 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.079
 I take it for nico find gamblers with 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.190
 so not my own, not that 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.059
 mass have 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.530
 Step and I have my focus 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.780
 that one then still urgently use 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.390
 must be groups 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.910
 So I have a total of two groups 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:57.140
 none are all my mikus I use 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:01:00.120
 here for the buttons dgnb here 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.090
 control group pg and b around these groups 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.830
 to be 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.420
 I mark the desired group hold 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.850
 Press the control button and press 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:15.000
 then my said key and the cannons 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:16.710
 My way here and that is as I said 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.030
 space and then I still do it 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.640
 a group g 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:26.070
 there are all my boys that's that 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.659
 most important thing you have to master so 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.650
 between these groups back and forth 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.869
 Jump then you need it for it 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.909
 Of course, a sight that likes to have 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.360
 I'm here on my mouse 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.250
 otherwise I have my items 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.829
 actually all of them touch me though 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.600
 find it handy to look at the mouse 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.250
 That's why this is a slot 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.990
 I have that on the mouse and he is 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.350
 also really only there for the action 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.260
 the act otherwise is with me one 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.260
 button 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:03.320
 So the thought is this following 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:05.200
 guys are my group bÃ¼hrer 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:11.060
 for a meter 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:12.800
 Check out space and the flashing is 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.090
 anywhere I've ever been a 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.430
 really bad example chosen 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.050
 Namely centaur thought I am 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.520
 press b 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:26.090
 Juhu vom with all my boys change 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:29.090
 to pass a crowd that's it 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.520
 slow what I did so 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.300
 i took my group b 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.650
 then with tap away click click click 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.070
 click click 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.800
 let the boys check I prefer 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.580
 here every day and not hurt 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.010
 clicks off because from left to right 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:52.000
 it makes more sense 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.290
 You have to do that with scepter four times 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.520
 carry out 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.959
 I honestly have no plan like that 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.080
 many times have I just pressed 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.080
 I 'm just going crazy 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.909
 So really hammered on the keys 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.799
 what he does then and that's why 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.890
 I find space such a handy key 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.989
 this is after you have all yours - said 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.480
 profiles press space change on my 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:26.640
 Nico in the blink then to the said 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:30.340
 place where you want to go down as always to 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.230
 nearest to push bring is 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.180
 a very nice story because you 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.250
 So that's really nice with nico 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.079
 in service could be the problem 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.530
 that anywhere else in the length to 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:43.599
 After all, if you are always in Dachshund you dachshund 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.220
 this in this huge group on the way 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.239
 you do not really have that 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.359
 surprise effect 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:51.640
 if here is an enemy if I am one 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:54.640
 opponent stands so come with all 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:59.170
 running up here and then her my networks 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.849
 to throw or something he has one 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.620
 possibility to escape mainly because 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:07.530
 the net is not easy either 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.530
 the goal is to hit the target 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.880
 yes that's the basic principle of blink 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.380
 Profession I recommend it to everyone like me 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.090
 this is just in such a lobby 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.540
 or just in a word game 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.540
 try 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.370
 just to develop for it in villingen 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.110
 it's not really that way 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:42.380
 hard and improved rico general 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:45.060
 a really that surprise effect 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.510
 I can use again example I know 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.100
 because it has become must to the grave a 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.510
 stay down I take my group b 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.440
 zack zack zack away shows my 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:59.400
 main problem in there and there I was even 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.540
 too slow and one knew that 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.750
 it still happend that you are 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.940
 your main stair so even quasi 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.220
 blogging afterwards you can go on 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.200
 so play with the usual level 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.300
 is your work the nets or just calling 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.470
 then again with your main with him 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.750
 elected 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:20.150
 won one says mine 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.810
 I hope that's halfway understandable 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.430
 been 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.430
 this is how blinkers work
