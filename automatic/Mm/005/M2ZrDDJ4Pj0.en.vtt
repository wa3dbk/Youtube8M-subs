00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.260
 whatever your goal is to build 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.639
 muscle or improve your health 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.320
 protein plays a very important role 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:12.700
 important in nutrition the excuse 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.380
 listen to so many times that the 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.480
 protein alone is enough to enlarge your 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.310
 muscles does not make much sense many 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.020
 scientific studies assure that if the 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.820
 adequate protein your body could 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.710
 suffer serious health problems so 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.510
 that getting a fitness body would be 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.670
 impossible we have to be clear that the 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.320
 protein is fundamental this provides 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.359
 the base where the tissues are built 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.640
 muscle and helps fat loss 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.440
 that said there is a lot of confusion in 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.120
 around this nutrient we do not mean 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.160
 to protein shakes but to the 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.840
 protein in general many wonder 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.670
 what is the exact amount of protein 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.379
 what is needed which are the best 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.450
 protein sources what is the amount 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.670
 of protein that can be eaten in each 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.010
 food today in this video we will clarify 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.469
 the most common doubts and myths of this 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.329
 powerful macronutrient let's start with 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.340
 the typical statement that the body 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.960
 You can only use 30 grams of 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.940
 protein by thom and is that opinion 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.710
 public seems to comment that you can not 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.900
 pass a certain amount of proteins 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.100
 for food and there is a magic number and that 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.140
 that is the good limit 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.299
 this is not quite true though 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.250
 we personally do not recommend 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.770
 pass 100 grams of protein per 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.570
 food the body will process everything 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.220
 that you give him but not always in the way 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.500
 more optimal you will digest all the 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.270
 protein that you eat but not always 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.920
 it means that it's better once 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.690
 start your body with the process of 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.640
 muscle building known as 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.619
 protein synthesis will only use the 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.509
 protein that you need for this process 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.640
 eating more protein will not mean that 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.320
 you will increase protein synthesis or what 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.330
 which it comes to the same creation 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.520
 muscle you are simply giving to your 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.560
 body plus protein to digest itself is 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.330
 true that approximately 30 grams of 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.340
 protein food through 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.380
 multiple meals really helps the 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.119
 protein synthesis several times in the 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.770
 course of the day in this way the 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.720
 digestive system probably 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.700
 will work as necessary without forcing the 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.619
 processing of proteins that will not be 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.390
 used for the synthesis of proteins by 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.789
 what your body does process all the 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.799
 protein that you consume but you will only use the 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.899
 necessary for protein synthesis 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.850
 On the other hand, we have the speed in which 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.769
 protein synthesis is given and that 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.630
 many of us have thought between 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.200
 more proteins faster we will build 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.209
 muscles 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.980
 and this is true but only to a certain 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.900
 point not all the proteins that are 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.670
 consume on a diet go towards the 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.590
 protein synthesis once it is 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.420
 consume enough protein to 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.129
 activate protein synthesis the 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.170
 body will oxidize the rest of the 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.880
 proteins to execute another function 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.010
 then eating protein can 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.630
 build muscle faster but only 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.370
 even when the amount of 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.510
 proteins needed to activate the 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.510
 protein synthesis 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.620
 ah
