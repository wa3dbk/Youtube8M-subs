00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.600
 new territorial stained glass for 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.269
 android for those who have a 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.419

 any version and it's a tips or a 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:24.079
 trick for those who at a time no longer 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:26.179
 he likes and receives calls from 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:28.339
 any contact they have in their already 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.169
 be it from the facebook that is in the notebook 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:32.210
 of address in the simo in any 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.980
 have the phone already tells us in some 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.079
 moment you want us or at some time 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.239
 he does not want anyone to bother him and he wants 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.210
 turn it off there is a trick that you can 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.010
 do to make that contact each time 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.929
 he calls you what goes directly to what 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.460
 which is the voicemail new tasks and 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:48.859
 if you do not want to take the call you do not 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.100
 you take and for the most that calls and calls 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:54.500
 always called going to take what the 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.329
 phone go directly passed about 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.829
 seconds directly will take it to 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.129
 what is voicemail so if 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.559
 they want at some point to deactivate or 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.900
 activate this unlocking of some 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.760
 contact so that the call does not 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.980
 no call comes as they can 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.340
 do is remember that that differentiates the 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.420
 compu 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.939
 difference in dependence on the brand or 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.920
 the best reaction of your android from 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.619
 the operating system version of 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.670
 thunder but roughly 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.319
 practically everything is the configuration 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.509
 it is the same regardless of the version that 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:29.140
 have only a slight change in the 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.859
 configuration and for that then very easy 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.340
 we look for the contacts and I have it here in 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:37.829
 direct access 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.770
 we look for contacts and within contacts 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.170
 we look for I have here the list of 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.390
 facebook I will choose anyone like that 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.030
 that only by way of demonstration 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.219
 so no one will flinch that annoying 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.259
 here I'm just going to do I 'm going to choose 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:55.679
 anybody I will take for example to 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.450
 danielle we puncture as if we're going to 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:00.720
 avoid contact let's edit the 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.930
 contact does not worry is that I'm going to 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.680
 to delete the number in case you do not want 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:10.470
 post it good hide it better said and 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.070
 let's go to options options remember 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.050
 options and writing says block emitter 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.020
 call here is disabled and 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.300
 we just click and tell you 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.060
 yes we are sure to activate this 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.090
 it says here on that caller 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.430
 block calls go directly to 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.010
 what voice mailbox is so when it calls 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.050
 to that person for example daniel when 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.410
 He calls me every time he calls me 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.670
 go bad it sends you directly to what 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.640
 is looking for you so it's not going to get 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.670
 no call from this issuer is a 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.470
 trick very easy in case at some point 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.270
 they need you they do not want to receive 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.910
 No call from any contact in 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.959
 specific so you can do it I hope 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.930
 what is this this trick or this tip 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:03:00.670
 and how can they apply from bad to good 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.530
 way not also the way 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.050
