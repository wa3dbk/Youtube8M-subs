concepts<00:00:51.930> when<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:52.829> was<00:00:53.070> told<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.399> couldn't<00:00:53.610> run

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
concepts when I was told I couldn't run

concepts when I was told I couldn't run
you<00:00:54.690> know<00:00:54.780> for<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.020> my<00:00:55.110> first<00:00:55.289> whole<00:00:56.219> summer

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
training either and as a running back

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.799 
training either and as a running back
that's<00:00:58.590> all<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:58.949> do<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.250> run<00:00:59.539> to<00:01:00.539> meet<00:01:00.660> out<00:01:00.780> a

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
that's all I do is run to meet out a

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:11.340 
that's all I do is run to meet out a
foreign<00:01:01.109> concept<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.620> didn't<00:01:01.770> make<00:01:01.859> sense

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.530 

inside<00:01:12.350> a<00:01:12.380> chain

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.010 

and<00:01:16.080> touchdown<00:01:16.650> Washington<00:01:17.120> Redskins<00:01:18.120> things

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
and touchdown Washington Redskins things

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
and touchdown Washington Redskins things
that<00:01:20.360> don't<00:01:21.360> seem<00:01:21.690> to<00:01:21.840> make<00:01:21.960> sense<00:01:22.020> when<00:01:22.920> you

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
that don't seem to make sense when you

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
that don't seem to make sense when you
get<00:01:23.160> down<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.520> nitty<00:01:23.730> gritty<00:01:23.760> they

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
get down to the nitty gritty they

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.550 
get down to the nitty gritty they
actually<00:01:24.390> make<00:01:24.570> more<00:01:24.780> sense<00:01:25.020> than<00:01:25.290> what<00:01:25.410> you

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
actually make more sense than what you

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.710 
actually make more sense than what you
were<00:01:25.620> previously<00:01:25.830> were<00:01:26.100> doing<00:01:26.480> but<00:01:27.480> it's<00:01:27.600> been

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
were previously were doing but it's been

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.950 
were previously were doing but it's been
hard<00:01:27.930> just<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.260> wrap<00:01:28.470> your<00:01:28.620> mind<00:01:28.710> around<00:01:29.100> how

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
hard just to wrap your mind around how

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.510 
hard just to wrap your mind around how
basic<00:01:30.960> some<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.380> stuff<00:01:31.620> is<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.400> how

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
basic some of this stuff is and how

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.150 
basic some of this stuff is and how
simple<00:01:32.970> everything<00:01:33.240> seems<00:01:33.870> it<00:01:34.590> almost<00:01:34.920> seemed

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
simple everything seems it almost seemed

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.580 
simple everything seems it almost seemed
doesn't<00:01:35.430> seem<00:01:35.610> real<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.780> me<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.170> sometimes

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
doesn't seem real so to me it sometimes

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.630 
doesn't seem real so to me it sometimes
kind<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.950> having<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.370> kind<00:01:40.130> of<00:01:41.130> convincing

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
kind of having that kind of convincing

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.640 
kind of having that kind of convincing
myself<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.480> know<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.870> is<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> simple

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
myself that you know it is a simple

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.550 
myself that you know it is a simple
doing<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.980> same<00:01:44.220> thing<00:01:44.520> over<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.840> over<00:01:45.960> and

over<00:01:49.440> and<00:01:49.650> repeatedly<00:01:50.130> just<00:01:50.400> doing<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:50.970> and

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
over and repeatedly just doing it and

this<00:02:47.739> isn't<00:02:48.010> happening

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
this isn't happening

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.160 
this isn't happening
and<00:02:48.909> something's<00:02:49.299> not<00:02:49.359> going<00:02:49.629> wrong<00:02:49.900> but

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
and something's not going wrong but

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.660 
and something's not going wrong but
something<00:02:50.469> not<00:02:50.590> going<00:02:50.859> is<00:02:51.040> not<00:02:51.250> right<00:02:51.519> with

something not going is not right with

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.940 
something not going is not right with
this<00:02:51.760> training<00:02:52.209> as<00:02:52.810> opposed<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.290> saying<00:02:53.530> no

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
this training as opposed to saying no

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.110 
this training as opposed to saying no
this<00:02:54.250> isn't<00:02:54.459> happening<00:02:54.840> what<00:02:55.840> am<00:02:55.959> I<00:02:56.079> not<00:02:56.290> doing

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
this isn't happening what am I not doing

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.339 
this isn't happening what am I not doing
that's<00:02:58.120> that's<00:02:58.540> that's<00:02:58.689> hindering<00:02:59.019> this<00:02:59.230> from

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
that's that's that's hindering this from

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:00.990 
that's that's that's hindering this from
happening<00:02:59.500> so<00:02:59.919> I<00:03:00.370> think<00:03:00.459> a<00:03:00.639> lot<00:03:00.730> of<00:03:00.849> people

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
happening so I think a lot of people

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.949 
happening so I think a lot of people
could<00:03:01.120> be<00:03:01.150> discouraged<00:03:01.599> just<00:03:01.780> on<00:03:01.870> the

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
could be discouraged just on the

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.229 
could be discouraged just on the
personal<00:03:02.379> responsibility<00:03:02.470> that<00:03:03.159> the<00:03:03.849> amount

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
personal responsibility that the amount

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:05.909 
personal responsibility that the amount
of<00:03:04.359> responsibility<00:03:05.079> that<00:03:05.349> you<00:03:05.530> have<00:03:05.680> to<00:03:05.769> take

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:05.919 
of responsibility that you have to take

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:08.819 
of responsibility that you have to take
for<00:03:06.909> your<00:03:07.060> own<00:03:07.180> actions<00:03:07.419> and<00:03:07.870> for<00:03:08.319> the<00:03:08.409> results

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
that you do have but that you don't have

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.140 
that you do have but that you don't have

all these different things at the same
progression<00:03:53.049> I<00:03:53.409> made<00:03:53.680> in<00:03:53.889> the<00:03:54.099> training<00:03:54.489> and

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
progression I made in the training and

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.680 
progression I made in the training and
and<00:03:57.040> it<00:03:57.430> kind<00:03:57.609> of<00:03:57.669> goes<00:03:57.790> to<00:03:57.849> show<00:03:58.150> exactly<00:03:58.510> the

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
and it kind of goes to show exactly the

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.729 
and it kind of goes to show exactly the
level<00:03:59.049> of<00:03:59.139> complexity<00:03:59.590> and<00:03:59.859> the<00:03:59.949> level<00:04:00.220> of
