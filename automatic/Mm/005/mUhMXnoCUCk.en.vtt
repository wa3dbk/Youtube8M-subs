00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.349 
when we talk about chunk traffic we're
talking<00:00:04.020> about<00:00:04.110> those<00:00:04.950> big<00:00:05.339> flows<00:00:05.640> of<00:00:05.879> traffic

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
talking about those big flows of traffic

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.540 
talking about those big flows of traffic
that<00:00:06.660> move<00:00:06.899> over<00:00:07.230> appreciable<00:00:07.740> distances

now this duplication and this is only an

now this duplication and this is only an

example of some of the cases is very

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.730 
example of some of the cases is very
important<00:01:19.049> because<00:01:19.729> it<00:01:20.729> means<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.750> the

important because it means that the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.399 
important because it means that the

traffic there wouldn't matter if they
were<00:01:27.210> all<00:01:27.360> well<00:01:27.630> loaded<00:01:28.140> but<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.409> course

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
low loading of the routes is due to this

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.590 
low loading of the routes is due to this
duplication<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.490> I've<00:01:41.579> spoken<00:01:41.880> about<00:01:42.119> a

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
duplication that I've spoken about a

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.100 
duplication that I've spoken about a
duplication<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.649> which<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.310> course<00:01:45.110> results

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
duplication of which of course results

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.740 
duplication of which of course results
from<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.979> competitive<00:01:47.880> building<00:01:48.329> at<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.540> pet

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
from the competitive building at the pet

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.810 
from the competitive building at the pet
of<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.110> past<00:01:49.350> when<00:01:50.070> all<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.369> old<00:01:50.520> railway

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
of the past when all the old railway

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.670 
of the past when all the old railway
companies<00:01:51.390> wanted<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.930> get<00:01:52.079> into<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.500> main

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
companies wanted to get into the main

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.770 
companies wanted to get into the main
centres<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.549> carry<00:01:53.759> traffic<00:01:54.030> between<00:01:54.390> them

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
centres and carry traffic between them

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.940 
centres and carry traffic between them
and<00:01:56.090> this<00:01:57.090> adds<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.750> great<00:01:57.960> deal<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.649> cost

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
and this adds a great deal to the cost

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.760 
and this adds a great deal to the cost
of<00:01:59.189> railway<00:01:59.549> transport<00:02:00.119> because<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.530> roots

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
of railway transport because the roots

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.160 
of railway transport because the roots
are<00:02:01.950> expensive<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.729> maintain<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.600> if<00:02:04.049> we

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
are expensive to maintain and if we

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.670 
are expensive to maintain and if we
maintain<00:02:04.350> them<00:02:04.860> all<00:02:05.130> then<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.750> light<00:02:07.320> traffic

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
maintain them all then the light traffic

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.969 
maintain them all then the light traffic
on<00:02:08.069> many<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.700> them<00:02:09.000> has<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:10.020> bear<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.440> full

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
on many of them has to bear the full

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.110 
on many of them has to bear the full
cost

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
cost

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.450 
cost
I<00:02:13.489> think<00:02:14.489> that's<00:02:14.640> about<00:02:14.730> as<00:02:14.879> far<00:02:15.060> as<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.239> can<00:02:15.299> go
