going<00:00:57.600> down<00:00:57.750> rapidly<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.530> now<00:00:58.590> whether<00:00:59.340> words

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
going down rapidly and now whether words

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.490 
going down rapidly and now whether words
it<00:00:59.699> doesn't<00:01:00.000> have<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.449> powerful<00:01:00.809> attack<00:01:01.289> like

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.650 
it doesn't have a powerful attack like
that<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:02.489> all<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.059> sudden<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.359> see<00:01:03.510> these

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
that so all of a sudden I see these

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.840 
that so all of a sudden I see these
three<00:01:03.899> ninjas<00:01:04.379> getting<00:01:04.949> into<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.430> battle<00:01:05.760> as

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
three ninjas getting into the battle as

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.450 
three ninjas getting into the battle as
well<00:01:06.350> and<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.380> still<00:01:07.650> got<00:01:07.799> through<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.159> fight

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
well and I still got through that fight

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.130 
well and I still got through that fight
because<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.909> just<00:01:09.270> quickly<00:01:09.479> popped<00:01:09.900> my

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
because I just quickly popped my

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.890 
because I just quickly popped my
supercharge<00:01:10.770> as<00:01:10.950> soon<00:01:11.189> as<00:01:11.570> those<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.810> they

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
supercharge as soon as those and they

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.410 
supercharge as soon as those and they
just<00:01:13.110> start<00:01:13.290> attacking<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:15.000> seems<00:01:15.240> like<00:01:15.390> a

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
just start attacking and it seems like a

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.600 
just start attacking and it seems like a
three-way<00:01:15.689> battle<00:01:16.020> because<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.979> think<00:01:17.520> they

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
three-way battle because I think they

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.060 
three-way battle because I think they
were<00:01:17.670> also<00:01:18.150> fighting<00:01:18.869> whether<00:01:19.170> wizard<00:01:19.590> and

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
were also fighting whether wizard and

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.740 
were also fighting whether wizard and
they<00:01:20.189> were<00:01:20.310> also<00:01:20.820> getting<00:01:21.060> hit<00:01:21.299> by<00:01:21.479> whether<00:01:21.689> it

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
they were also getting hit by whether it

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.370 
they were also getting hit by whether it
was<00:01:22.970> anyway<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.210> decided<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.810> do<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.080> video

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
was anyway I decided to do this video

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.399 
was anyway I decided to do this video
because<00:01:25.799> if<00:01:26.700> you're<00:01:27.000> fighting<00:01:27.869> whether<00:01:28.140> was

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
because if you're fighting whether was

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.039 
because if you're fighting whether was
it<00:01:28.560> alone<00:01:28.920> or<00:01:29.490> just<00:01:29.549> any<00:01:30.210> quest<00:01:30.540> along<00:01:30.900> these

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
it alone or just any quest along these

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.950 
it alone or just any quest along these
rooftops<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.890> just<00:01:32.579> want<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.880> be<00:01:33.030> careful<00:01:33.630> not

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
rooftops you just want to be careful not

paths it's certain paths at depth so it
turns<00:02:18.140> out<00:02:18.319> that<00:02:18.489> they<00:02:19.489> are<00:02:19.760> part<00:02:20.090> of<00:02:20.269> T<00:02:20.870> for

turns out that they are part of T for

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.970 
turns out that they are part of T for
villain<00:02:21.680> operation<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:23.329> I<00:02:24.260> want<00:02:24.829> to<00:02:24.890> give

44<00:02:31.819> for<00:02:32.209> giving<00:02:32.599> that<00:02:32.750> answer

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:43.140 

I<00:02:40.800> guess<00:02:41.800> maybe<00:02:41.950> since<00:02:42.250> it's<00:02:42.430> part<00:02:42.790> of<00:02:43.000> an

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
I guess maybe since it's part of an

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.820 
I guess maybe since it's part of an
operation<00:02:44.850> maybe<00:02:45.850> it<00:02:46.120> takes<00:02:46.420> a<00:02:46.840> villain<00:02:47.650> group

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
operation maybe it takes a villain group

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.670 
operation maybe it takes a villain group
to<00:02:48.010> cue<00:02:48.280> this<00:02:48.430> up<00:02:48.490> in<00:02:48.970> order<00:02:49.270> for<00:02:49.630> them<00:02:50.500> to

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
to cue this up in order for them to

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.950 
to cue this up in order for them to
actually<00:02:50.830> spawn<00:02:51.430> so<00:02:52.090> maybe<00:02:52.300> that's<00:02:52.540> why<00:02:52.720> I'm

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
actually spawn so maybe that's why I'm

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.450 
actually spawn so maybe that's why I'm
having<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:53.350> hard<00:02:53.530> time<00:02:53.590> finding<00:02:54.010> them<00:02:54.280> right

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
having a hard time finding them right

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:09.710 
having a hard time finding them right
now

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.910 

you<00:03:10.720> know<00:03:10.840> what<00:03:11.020> I<00:03:11.319> should<00:03:11.650> try<00:03:11.800> rephrasing

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
you know what I should try rephrasing

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.809 
you know what I should try rephrasing
maybe<00:03:14.920> they'll<00:03:15.099> be<00:03:15.250> there<00:03:15.489> in<00:03:15.580> the<00:03:15.670> other

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
maybe they'll be there in the other

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:40.850 
maybe they'll be there in the other
phase

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.920

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.470 
think that's a sign of them okay let me
look<00:03:47.130> around<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:48.720> same<00:03:48.990> spots<00:03:49.380> as<00:03:49.560> before<00:03:50.480> and
