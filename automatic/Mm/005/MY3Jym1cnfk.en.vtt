00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 hey people welcome to 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.350
 I'm tinkering erfurt one source 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.680
 finally with the thousandfold 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.309
 requested green tutorial and indeed 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.380
 You have to implement German for the climate 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.240
 Of course, first of all, the front scort 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:21.930
 the front squat control that 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:23.670
 demonstrates inigo once no matter how now 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.210
 the bar is up to me 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.490
 wurscht 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.560
 important is that the squat in the 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.570
 friend kneel as upright as possible 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.059
 remains was every centimeter to you by 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.530
 leaning forward, the rod flies forward 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.630
 or wants to fly forward that is 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.520
 the l have to be up and best 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.329
 that the pole up on the shoulders 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.940
 lies down then squat nico 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.640
 can completely maintain tail 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.649
 He returns from the position again 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.480
 come out now we will come again 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.949
 Please come down and come first with the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.719
 ass up completely so that you understood you 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.489
 from flying down if he is now 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.930
 the fair is rather high and with 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.059
 would make a high weight 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.829
 that would not work because of the 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.420
 rod down the front falls yes and me 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.820
 my 40 kilos you can maybe still 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.840
 keep in reverse cologne 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.740
 120 kilos like me maybe 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.689
 Nobody can do it anymore 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.220
 stand on green and yellow when we die 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.049
 then we can have a front squat 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.530
 actually start in the kneeling 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.830
 give 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.080
 Please refuse and I work may 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.909
 you always in three variants yes, the first 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.490
 Variation is that I just so only 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.640
 the hip three color from the deficit 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.920
 position from this position just 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.439
 snap right up and up properly 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.610
 open to then implement weight 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.610
 and to advance the ending 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.380
 We work only from the first 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.900
 power position of that means first 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.010
 a power clean he is not 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.470
 completely squat but 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.290
 it now has a riddick, so to speak 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.000
 that means we go to the 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.310
 defensive and the knee wants to say 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.770
 after that, do not excel up 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.810
 Tear off the elbe and bring it down 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.340
 Go back to one for the squat 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.430
 then you would work from here 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.410
 that you start getting deeper and deeper or 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.810
 afterwards it is possible to crouch down 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.670
 he can catch it up again in 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.190
 the squat and then goes back later 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.370
 squat down when liquid 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.080
 works then you can catch deeper 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.209
 that is, from the position as a whole 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.310
 catch deeper and then later in 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.730
 The squats go out until you look, so to speak 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:41.670
 this position completely and now 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:43.730
 once a success in the early from the 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.230
 position complete and received 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.400
 our more weight one has all the more 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.470
 Of course you are forced then 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.390
 completely in the squat and in the 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.750
 to catch a squat 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:57.360
 next could make the slope and 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.820
 the slope I would start from 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.220
 above the knee 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.320
 In the end, Henkel is everything I became 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.790
 Do not touch the ground but turn around 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.799
 we have to clarify that now 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.170
 once the deficit position where we only 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.450
 the knees bent and then out of the 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.890
 hang over your knees and now we go 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.090
 from here the same ladder again 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.410
 high that implement it from here high 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.049
 then the same story parks him 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.500
 first then catch power clean deeper 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:27.030
 and always join the squat 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.549
 then I would go down 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.040
 under the knees because it is a very 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.910
 important ingredient is the 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.709
 hinzubekommen 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.900
 the rod on the knees first over 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.480
 to get without knees 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.359
 that means from here slowly over the 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.489
 Knee and then shows into the sales in the 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:46.170
 squat and get up again so and when 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.810
 one has mastered that then one can 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.380
 to start from the ground and start 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.319
 Here is the devil in detail looks 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.090
 worth it 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:59.530
 a devil here it will be interesting 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.249
 and it is very important that we 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:07.120
 really slow the weight on hit 

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:12.849
 coach berliner maik berger has apt 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:14.799
 just say go and that's exactly what 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:16.299
 Now important here is let that be you 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.039
 lifting the weight slowly and if you 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.759
 thinks that it is far too slow 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.430
 still too fast 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:24.130
 it has to be really slow that is 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:28.020
 you have three seconds left 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:33.720
 from the floor to the knee needed 21 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:35.820
 22 23 and then disengage and explode 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:40.630
 now there are two different ones 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:43.990
 School a school says we go 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.150
 kneel back and enter 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.889
 riddick by knees again 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.449
 thereby advance the upper body 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.690
 straighten up and then out of position 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:55.599
 The second school says tear up 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.300
 We go up and off the knee 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:00.250
 then pull your shoulders further 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.340
 behind so that continuous purchase of the 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.650
 Dumbbell is I say so tried 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.320
 from where her looks was better there 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.699
 elite world class fans who have it that way 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.020
 and they did it that way 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:12.520
 means there is no real here 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.590
 right or wrong 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.810
 He tried and looks where you are 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.759
 you should be better ultimately 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:22.690
 In any case, heed one thing and that 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:29.370
 lift slowly and then explode 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:29.370
 sometimes please completely clean from the ground 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:36.639
 that was raised very quickly by the 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:38.650
 Soil is because he is this morning 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:41.050
 already trained and 40 kilos easy 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.320
 nothing is slow for him again 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.320
 raise 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:55.060
 that was already trier tutorial 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:57.400
 Thank you very much that you are the 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.139
 knee bend dominates because if you the 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.240
 Do not squat and you then 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:05.099
 somehow so half uncontrolled the 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:07.240
 Steinen snowed on it and co because of that 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:08.830
 first learn how the frontcourt 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.500
 so does it ever the 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:14.680
 positioning the babel has that is 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.990
 important now at nico seen how nice 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.909
 from the forearm and upper arm forth the rod 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.070
 Perfect on top of the shoulder is attached 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:23.080
 I would be halfway mine 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.669
 forearms are a little longer and mine 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.849
 Agility in the wrist is not so good 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:29.949
 is and that means I have to 

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:33.130
 for example , pay attention and pay attention 

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:35.560
 that the bar is a bit wider 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.599
 because if I'm the tighter I grab 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.949
 the more I really need to grab 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:41.169
 grab something wider 

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:44.860
 and I have to pay attention to it 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:49.210
 that the fingers take that short 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:50.949
 Microphone to the side look if it 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:53.159
 now the microphone crash or star 

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:53.159
 plans 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:04.780
 For example, I already have one here 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:07.000
 the finger away and I have to extreme here 

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.650
 pay attention that my fingers turn 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.060
 stay and you see that looks at me 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:14.770
 already much tormented than at nico 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:19.990
 because of my super anatomical 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:22.200
 but only for this 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.350
 found frontcourt first 

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.510
 dominate 

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:27.610
 then we can go to the clean 

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:29.740
 start first off the slope of the 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:31.300
 deficit position works in the power 

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.460
 clean work by then down in the 

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.380
 fully get then passes into the hillside 

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.180
 knees below knees and then from 

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.650
 ground 

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.720
 what actually to the program like 

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:42.730
 either he does that with the rap 

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.920
 and kneel forward or work 

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:46.630
 just over the back that you 

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.490
 with the shoulders can pull more 

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.600
 you imagine your ball would be 

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:52.390
 have in the neck 

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.470
 so if you draw from here and 

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:55.270
 try with the shoulders to the rear 

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:58.240
 It's not such a thing to go 

00:07:55.270 --> 00:08:04.210
 but rather something that we like him out of 

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:05.230
 position the chain after me so 

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:07.000
 Hope you liked it 

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:08.170
 check my other videos but not 

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.820
