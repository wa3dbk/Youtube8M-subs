00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
a routine with myself only so that she

say like this is what we're going to do

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.589 
say like this is what we're going to do
I<00:02:10.560> try<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.099> do<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.550> same<00:02:11.790> process<00:02:11.849> in<00:02:12.510> the

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
I try and do the same process in the

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.600 
I try and do the same process in the
house<00:02:12.780> so<00:02:13.080> it's<00:02:13.230> like<00:02:13.410> she<00:02:13.950> now<00:02:14.190> knows<00:02:14.550> the

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
house so it's like she now knows the

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.270 
house so it's like she now knows the
routine<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:15.900> find<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.349> she<00:02:16.620> seems<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:17.099> be

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
routine and I find that she seems to be

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.250 
routine and I find that she seems to be
a<00:02:17.550> lot<00:02:18.000> more<00:02:18.180> settled<00:02:18.569> with<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.870> it's<00:02:19.080> like

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
a lot more settled with that it's like

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.339 
a lot more settled with that it's like
she<00:02:19.470> knows<00:02:19.709> what<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.069> plan<00:02:20.310> is<00:02:21.200> Nikki<00:02:22.200> also

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
she knows what the plan is Nikki also

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.290 
she knows what the plan is Nikki also
feels<00:02:22.709> that<00:02:22.830> Ophelia<00:02:23.370> gains<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.849> lot<00:02:24.030> from

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300
