can<00:02:02.700> have<00:02:02.850> more<00:02:03.149> Z<00:02:03.570> types<00:02:03.899> than<00:02:04.590> ten<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.310> ten<00:02:05.520> Z

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
can have more Z types than ten the ten Z

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.029 
can have more Z types than ten the ten Z
type<00:02:06.090> mark<00:02:06.450> would<00:02:06.719> be<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:07.649> there<00:02:07.890> are<00:02:07.950> only

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
type mark would be that there are only

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.120 
type mark would be that there are only
ten

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
ten

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.850 
ten
in<00:02:09.430> the<00:02:09.580> world<00:02:09.910> so<00:02:10.210> if<00:02:10.480> you<00:02:10.660> have<00:02:10.900> 11<00:02:11.470> you

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
in the world so if you have 11 you

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.530 
in the world so if you have 11 you
actually<00:02:12.130> have<00:02:12.250> more<00:02:12.460> than<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:13.090> other<00:02:13.270> dude

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
actually have more than the other dude

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.080 
actually have more than the other dude

though he said there were only 10 mate
and<00:02:56.650> that's<00:02:57.130> why<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.400> price<00:02:57.790> is<00:02:58.120> 10<00:02:58.420> million

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
they're lying if he has these dudes

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.460 
they're lying if he has these dudes
they're<00:03:03.640> like<00:03:03.820> buy<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.450> car<00:03:04.840> now<00:03:05.020> there<00:03:05.380> are

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
they're like buy the car now there are

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.800 
they're like buy the car now there are
only<00:03:05.530> 10<00:03:05.920> left<00:03:06.220> or<00:03:06.460> 9<00:03:06.640> left<00:03:06.970> or<00:03:07.210> whatever<00:03:07.420> and

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
only 10 left or 9 left or whatever and

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.450 
only 10 left or 9 left or whatever and
eventually<00:03:08.380> you<00:03:08.560> find<00:03:08.860> out<00:03:09.010> that<00:03:09.220> they're

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
eventually you find out that they're

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.280 
eventually you find out that they're
more<00:03:09.760> than<00:03:09.820> 10<00:03:10.300> so<00:03:10.510> the<00:03:10.630> price<00:03:10.900> is<00:03:11.140> actually

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
more than 10 so the price is actually

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.760 
more than 10 so the price is actually
not<00:03:11.800> correct<00:03:12.040> and<00:03:12.460> I<00:03:13.060> could<00:03:13.330> even<00:03:13.510> buy<00:03:13.810> more<00:03:14.290> Z

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
not correct and I could even buy more Z

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.640 
not correct and I could even buy more Z
types<00:03:15.100> after<00:03:15.610> I<00:03:15.640> bought<00:03:15.910> these<00:03:16.150> 12<00:03:16.630> so<00:03:17.230> I<00:03:17.260> don't

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
types after I bought these 12 so I don't

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.430 
types after I bought these 12 so I don't
know<00:03:17.740> how<00:03:17.920> long<00:03:18.130> I<00:03:18.190> could<00:03:18.940> keep<00:03:19.180> on<00:03:19.390> going<00:03:19.810> if<00:03:20.290> I

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
know how long I could keep on going if I

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.040 
know how long I could keep on going if I
had<00:03:20.590> a<00:03:20.620> billion<00:03:20.980> dollars<00:03:21.700> I<00:03:21.910> could<00:03:22.150> just<00:03:22.390> do

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
had a billion dollars I could just do

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.230 
had a billion dollars I could just do
this<00:03:23.230> all<00:03:23.290> day<00:03:23.530> long<00:03:23.770> by<00:03:24.280> Z<00:03:24.610> types<00:03:24.880> all<00:03:25.090> day

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
this all day long by Z types all day

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.210 
this all day long by Z types all day
long<00:03:25.450> then<00:03:25.660> destroy<00:03:26.140> them<00:03:26.380> buy<00:03:26.620> another<00:03:26.920> one

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.340 
long then destroy them buy another one
destroy<00:03:27.970> them<00:03:28.210> buy<00:03:28.390> another<00:03:28.630> one<00:03:28.870> I<00:03:29.050> think

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
destroy them buy another one I think

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.290 
destroy them buy another one I think
these<00:03:29.500> are<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.890> small<00:03:30.250> things<00:03:30.280> that<00:03:30.670> Rockstar

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
these are the small things that Rockstar

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.500 
these are the small things that Rockstar
actually<00:03:31.720> should<00:03:32.140> change<00:03:33.070> because<00:03:33.970> there's

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
actually should change because there's

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.660 
actually should change because there's
these<00:03:34.810> small<00:03:35.080> little<00:03:35.590> things<00:03:36.040> that's<00:03:36.400> what<00:03:36.640> I

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670

look<00:03:36.970> at<00:03:37.210> and<00:03:37.420> that<00:03:37.810> makes<00:03:38.230> a<00:03:38.530> game<00:03:38.890> a<00:03:39.130> really

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490 
look at and that makes a game a really

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.490 
look at and that makes a game a really
good<00:03:39.700> game<00:03:39.940> now<00:03:40.450> you<00:03:40.480> have<00:03:40.780> these<00:03:40.930> really

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
good game now you have these really

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.250 
good game now you have these really
small<00:03:41.830> and<00:03:42.490> little<00:03:42.880> things<00:03:43.090> for<00:03:43.750> example<00:03:44.170> when

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
small and little things for example when

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.230 
small and little things for example when

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
in a car you won't drown stuff like that

in a car you won't drown stuff like that
that's<00:03:48.310> that's<00:03:48.850> what<00:03:49.000> makes<00:03:49.330> a<00:03:49.510> game<00:03:49.720> perfect

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260

for me but then these things that you

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.780 
for me but then these things that you
can<00:03:52.840> only<00:03:52.990> buy<00:03:53.500> 10<00:03:53.860> and<00:03:54.070> you<00:03:54.220> can<00:03:54.370> actually<00:03:54.520> buy

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
can only buy 10 and you can actually buy

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.970 
can only buy 10 and you can actually buy
way<00:03:55.120> more<00:03:55.330> than<00:03:55.480> 10<00:03:55.750> that's<00:03:56.290> just<00:03:56.590> really

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
way more than 10 that's just really

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.820 
way more than 10 that's just really
simple<00:03:57.520> to<00:03:57.670> fix<00:03:57.880> it<00:03:58.120> I'm<00:03:58.420> pretty<00:03:59.200> sure<00:03:59.500> you<00:03:59.650> can

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
simple to fix it I'm pretty sure you can

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.610 
simple to fix it I'm pretty sure you can
just<00:04:00.040> put<00:04:00.190> a<00:04:00.220> lock<00:04:00.520> on<00:04:00.730> on<00:04:01.030> the<00:04:01.240> by<00:04:01.480> thing<00:04:01.900> for

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
just put a lock on on the by thing for

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.610 
just put a lock on on the by thing for
each<00:04:02.800> save<00:04:03.190> and<00:04:03.610> I'm<00:04:04.480> not<00:04:04.690> the<00:04:04.810> best<00:04:05.050> program

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
each save and I'm not the best program

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.740 
each save and I'm not the best program
or<00:04:05.860> anything<00:04:06.190> else<00:04:06.520> but<00:04:06.700> I<00:04:06.760> think<00:04:07.150> they<00:04:07.540> should

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
or anything else but I think they should

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.410 
or anything else but I think they should
have<00:04:07.780> put<00:04:08.140> put<00:04:08.620> this<00:04:08.770> in<00:04:09.010> if<00:04:09.220> they<00:04:09.400> stick<00:04:10.210> so

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
have put put this in if they stick so

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.720 
have put put this in if they stick so
