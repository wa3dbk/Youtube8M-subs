00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.810 
x it slows down and when it's chugs like
that<00:02:44.380> it<00:02:44.680> doesn't<00:02:44.710> make<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.310> graphics<00:02:45.730> look

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
that it doesn't make the graphics look

that it doesn't make the graphics look
very<00:02:46.150> appealing<00:02:46.300> because<00:02:46.810> you're<00:02:47.110> just

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
very appealing because you're just

very appealing because you're just
chugging<00:02:47.800> along<00:02:47.920> just<00:02:48.730> doesn't<00:02:49.090> make<00:02:49.450> it<00:02:49.600> look

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
chugging along just doesn't make it look

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.910

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.840 
know many people are going to hate me
for<00:03:50.590> saying<00:03:50.800> that<00:03:51.130> but<00:03:51.190> I<00:03:51.340> just<00:03:51.520> don't<00:03:51.700> think

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
for saying that but I just don't think

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.790 
for saying that but I just don't think
the<00:03:52.210> 3d<00:03:52.630> Sonic<00:03:53.020> and<00:03:53.170> this<00:03:53.260> game<00:03:53.470> is<00:03:53.650> well

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
the 3d Sonic and this game is well

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.710 
the 3d Sonic and this game is well
implemented<00:03:54.280> at<00:03:54.580> all<00:03:54.790> I<00:03:55.030> just<00:03:55.420> think<00:03:55.570> the

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
implemented at all I just think the

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.660 
implemented at all I just think the
controls<00:03:56.110> are<00:03:56.290> very<00:03:56.500> slippery<00:03:56.950> very<00:03:57.400> loose

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
controls are very slippery very loose

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.760 
controls are very slippery very loose
and<00:03:57.940> just<00:03:57.970> annoying<00:03:58.480> the<00:03:58.960> camera<00:03:59.320> angles<00:03:59.680> are

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
and just annoying the camera angles are

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.920 
and just annoying the camera angles are
just<00:03:59.950> terrible<00:04:00.280> and<00:04:00.730> the<00:04:01.150> level<00:04:01.420> designs<00:04:01.750> in

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
just terrible and the level designs in

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.320 
just terrible and the level designs in
the<00:04:02.020> beginning<00:04:02.440> are<00:04:02.590> good<00:04:02.920> but<00:04:03.400> later<00:04:03.640> on<00:04:03.760> they

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
the beginning are good but later on they

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.060 
the beginning are good but later on they
become<00:04:04.660> more<00:04:04.810> cumbersome<00:04:05.410> to<00:04:05.620> navigate

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
become more cumbersome to navigate

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.230 
become more cumbersome to navigate
through<00:04:06.280> because<00:04:06.580> there's<00:04:06.820> so<00:04:07.060> many

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
through because there's so many

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.150 
through because there's so many
obstacles<00:04:07.720> in<00:04:08.080> your<00:04:08.110> way<00:04:08.230> that<00:04:08.530> it's<00:04:08.650> like<00:04:08.770> hey

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
here's an enemy now it's just annoying

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.720 
here's an enemy now it's just annoying
it<00:04:16.630> really<00:04:16.989> is<00:04:17.109> that's<00:04:17.650> my<00:04:17.830> opinion<00:04:18.250> I<00:04:18.520> just

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
it really is that's my opinion I just

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.370 
it really is that's my opinion I just
don't<00:04:18.880> think<00:04:19.060> the<00:04:19.150> 3d<00:04:19.450> sonic<00:04:19.750> in<00:04:19.870> this<00:04:19.989> game<00:04:20.170> is

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
don't think the 3d sonic in this game is

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.140 
don't think the 3d sonic in this game is
all<00:04:20.650> that<00:04:20.799> great<00:04:21.040> I<00:04:21.220> mean<00:04:21.609> it's<00:04:21.760> not<00:04:21.880> even

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
all that great I mean it's not even

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.390 
all that great I mean it's not even
close<00:04:22.450> not<00:04:22.780> even<00:04:22.930> close<00:04:23.530> to<00:04:23.590> as<00:04:23.830> bad<00:04:24.130> as<00:04:24.370> a

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
close not even close to as bad as a

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.390 
close not even close to as bad as a
sonic<00:04:25.270> 06<00:04:25.530> but<00:04:26.530> it's<00:04:26.680> not<00:04:26.740> all<00:04:26.860> that<00:04:27.070> great<00:04:27.220> if

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
sonic 06 but it's not all that great if

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.070 
sonic 06 but it's not all that great if
I<00:04:27.520> had<00:04:27.640> to<00:04:27.730> give<00:04:27.850> a<00:04:27.880> score<00:04:28.180> just<00:04:28.480> to<00:04:28.630> the<00:04:28.720> 3d

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
I had to give a score just to the 3d

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.930 
I had to give a score just to the 3d
sonic<00:04:29.440> I<00:04:29.530> would<00:04:29.650> give<00:04:29.770> it<00:04:29.860> a<00:04:29.920> 5<00:04:30.190> and<00:04:30.490> I<00:04:30.790> would

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
sonic I would give it a 5 and I would

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.260 
sonic I would give it a 5 and I would
give<00:04:31.090> the<00:04:31.300> sonic<00:04:31.690> 2<00:04:32.200> d<00:04:32.350> 9<00:04:33.250> really<00:04:33.670> maybe<00:04:33.880> even<00:04:34.150> a

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
give the sonic 2 d 9 really maybe even a

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.290 
give the sonic 2 d 9 really maybe even a
9.5<00:04:34.900> to<00:04:35.110> be<00:04:35.200> honest<00:04:35.440> because<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:36.040> 2d<00:04:36.820> sonic<00:04:37.180> is

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
9.5 to be honest because the 2d sonic is

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.720 
9.5 to be honest because the 2d sonic is
amazing<00:04:37.810> 30<00:04:38.380> sonic<00:04:38.830> is<00:04:38.980> mediocre<00:04:39.550> in<00:04:39.610> my

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
amazing 30 sonic is mediocre in my

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.790 
amazing 30 sonic is mediocre in my

opinion what else do you have in the

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.800 
opinion what else do you have in the
game<00:04:41.980> well<00:04:42.430> in<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:42.640> campaign<00:04:43.150> of<00:04:43.360> the<00:04:43.450> game<00:04:43.600> or

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.750 
a story mode you have to go through a
bunch<00:04:46.750> of<00:04:46.900> acts<00:04:47.140> in<00:04:47.410> the<00:04:47.530> game<00:04:47.710> and<00:04:47.980> after<00:04:48.670> you

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
bunch of acts in the game and after you

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
the game and the bus fights are kind of

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.750 
the game and the bus fights are kind of
disappointing<00:04:54.190> but<00:04:54.370> they're<00:04:54.520> not

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
disappointing but they're not

and that could add some replay value if
you're<00:05:09.100> very<00:05:09.420> competitive<00:05:10.420> with<00:05:10.600> that<00:05:10.750> kind

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
you're very competitive with that kind

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.840 
you're very competitive with that kind
of<00:05:11.080> thing<00:05:11.260> but<00:05:11.650> to<00:05:11.710> me<00:05:11.890> I'm<00:05:12.130> just<00:05:12.430> not<00:05:12.580> the

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
of thing but to me I'm just not the

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.670 
of thing but to me I'm just not the
single<00:05:13.150> player<00:05:13.240> itself<00:05:13.570> is<00:05:13.720> about<00:05:13.870> the<00:05:14.020> five

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
single player itself is about the five

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.680 
single player itself is about the five
to<00:05:14.890> six<00:05:15.100> hours<00:05:15.190> long<00:05:15.520> and<00:05:15.760> for<00:05:16.150> a<00:05:16.180> fifty-dollar

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
to six hours long and for a fifty-dollar

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.560 
to six hours long and for a fifty-dollar
game<00:05:16.990> that's<00:05:17.680> not<00:05:17.860> really<00:05:18.370> great<00:05:19.330> and

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
game that's not really great and

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.720 
game that's not really great and
definitely<00:05:20.050> when<00:05:20.230> the<00:05:20.440> 3d<00:05:20.920> sonic<00:05:21.280> to<00:05:21.400> me<00:05:21.520> is

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 
definitely when the 3d sonic to me is

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.760 
definitely when the 3d sonic to me is
