00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.059
 Hello and welcome to the tv 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.400
 Today we will introduce you again 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.720
 fixed knife in front of selected 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.660
 this time we have the bear grylls 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.099
 and with live from the company Gerber the 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.900
 Knife is one of many products 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:21.670
 the gerber company together with the 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.130
 british tv presenter and survival 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.289
 expert bear grylls has developed ob 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.330
 the ultimate really the ultimate 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.810
 that's what we say in now 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.810
 our review 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.700
 as always, we first of all the 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.530
 technical data to the blade length 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.710
 the multi midnight is twelve 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.660
 centimeter she has a drop in form 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.200
 with a strong well controlled on 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:54.170
 lace and a medium-sized belly the 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:58.430
 blade is almost continuous 45 mm thick 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:01.180
 and 29 cm deep she is probably closed 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.850
 which improves the cutting performance 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:08.050
 Overall, the knife is 25 3 cm long 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.410
 the weight of the ultimate is naive 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.750
 244 grams 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.750
 it has a hidden l 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:26.220
 we come to the material the blade of 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.980
 Messers is made of 17m UV steel 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.290
 he is rust resistant owns one 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.200
 neat cut containing kite and one 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.120
 average sharpness has the surface 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.180
 a glass bead blasted the sound 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.430
 finish the handle of the knife is in 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.790
 essential for the inertia of a rubber 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.800
 similar material made with the 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.540
 a plastic scabbard becomes a knife 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.540
 and nylon fabric supplied 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.400
 so now in practice clearly that one 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.740
 fixed knife especially in the 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.140
 survival area coarser work 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.270
 Must be able to beat the sound 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.280
 you move the wood around the fire 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.610
 split or used in tree cases 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.350
 do not mind the gerber knife too 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.080
 work is no problem for that 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.420
 knife the weight of the birgit shoulder 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.180
 with live is big enough to be good 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.920
 results 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.989
 The handle material weakens the punches 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.560
 in addition, slightly off so that too 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.180
 longer hag working stay comfortable 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.040
 in the field of normal work comes 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.709
 you also get along well with the knife 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.480
 the partial wave grinding and the ball 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.489
 the sword beats here for good 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.730
 cutting performance and sufficient 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.380
 flexibility in handling only in 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.700
 the area of ​​fine work can do that 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.160
 do not convince the knife 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.290
 the dominant wave cut is for it 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.630
 unfit and the front smooth 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.959
 klingenthal barely offers a straight cut 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.959
 surface 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.410
 Let's go to the conclusion on the 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.050
 operability 1 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.120
 The knife is good in the hand offers 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.750
 sufficient space and grabbed a nuisance 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.640
 balances the grip of the 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.530
 Materials and a glove provide for 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.380
 sufficient security in dealing with the 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.180
 The knife can be easily removed by knife 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.190
 right and left-handed use 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.750
 the scabbard allows the knife 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.600
 accordingly to plug 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.490
 The knife sits in the scabbard too 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.220
 thanks to a velcro band very much 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.830
 Certainly, the Vague offers 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.750
 three additional functions on the 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.940
 backside is in a fold with alpine 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.670
 emergency signals a small survival 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.200
 guide by birgit 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.740
 If you fold the disc, it offers 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.060
 access to a diamond sharpener 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.060
 Also, at the bottom of the scabbard 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.040
 a fire jet can be attached to it 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.140
 to create follow and create a fire 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.580
 spark 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.920
 The knife works for this to work 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.860
 on the top a small section 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.510
 with a sharp edge as well 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.870
 owns the knife at the handguard two 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.510
 holes so the ultimate live can be easy 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.370
 be used as heavy 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.650
 the lower end of the handle consists of 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.360
 solid stainless steel and can crack 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.780
 used by nuts and the like 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.669
 become 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.950
 Here is also a wrist strap 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.790
 attached with a signal whistle 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.790
 is provided 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.900
 we come to the conclusion that gerbers 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.110
 Ultimately it works very well with one 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.669
 word describe mediocrity it is in 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.199
 many areas neither very good 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.720
 especially bad 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:44.340
 the stall is okay but can cut something 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.360
 sanctity and sharpness only concerned 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.660
 conditionally convincing 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.100
 mediocrity in practice scores points 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.199
 knives in the field of coarser work 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.990
 but falls in normal and above all 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:56.970
 Fine work too hard for reason 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.100
 the dominant wave is hardly 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:03.000
 smooth and straight cutting surface provides 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.800
 so here too mediocre for the accessories 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.539
 convinced us the included fire 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.460
 stole the clean on the scabbard 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:09.990
 however, it is not appropriate 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.729
 Also placed there diamond 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.800
 sharper this is namely for 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.570
 serrated and thus 50 percent 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.699
 the blade is not suitable 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.889
 in the manual you will find many 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:21.870
 useful tips about how to deal with the 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:24.120
 knife blade signaling a plane 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.190
 why then the blade of the knife but 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.070
 math and not shiny is white well 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.910
 only limited therefore is the accessories 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.780
 you already suspect it just mediocre 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.580
 Nevertheless, we could do the knife 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.169
 at least to get started 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.750
 it is still much better 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:42.139
 as some survival knives from the 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.400
 internet or the army shop around the corner 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:47.039
 however, the price of the knife fits 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.060
 from 150 euro so not to the 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:50.039
 offered services 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.750
 He does not let himself go anymore 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:55.639
 to describe the word mediocre but 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.639
 rather outrageous with the word
