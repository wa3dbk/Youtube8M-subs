table<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.680> mean<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:28.950> would<00:01:29.070> be<00:01:29.100> interesting<00:01:29.460> to

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
table I mean it would be interesting to

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.399 
table I mean it would be interesting to
see<00:01:30.000> if<00:01:30.420> he<00:01:30.570> could<00:01:30.780> pick<00:01:30.960> up<00:01:31.110> some<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.350> the
