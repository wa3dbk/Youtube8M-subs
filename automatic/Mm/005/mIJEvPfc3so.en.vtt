over

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.740 
over
I<00:01:44.210> think<00:01:45.110> Rashid<00:01:47.890> no<00:01:48.890> she<00:01:49.340> is<00:01:49.490> offensive<00:01:50.390> you

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
I think Rashid no she is offensive you

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.780 
I think Rashid no she is offensive you
know<00:01:50.810> I<00:01:50.900> think<00:01:51.110> he<00:01:51.290> he<00:01:52.190> has<00:01:52.310> untapped

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
know I think he he has untapped

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.430 
know I think he he has untapped
potential<00:01:53.270> when<00:01:53.420> it<00:01:53.510> comes<00:01:53.690> to<00:01:53.900> you<00:01:54.110> know<00:01:54.140> and

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
potential when it comes to you know and

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.110 
potential when it comes to you know and
it<00:01:54.560> turns<00:01:54.740> it<00:01:54.830> off<00:01:55.070> into<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.490> one<00:01:55.640> person

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
it turns it off into the one person

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.540 
it turns it off into the one person
outside<00:01:56.570> of<00:01:56.750> Kenny<00:01:57.020> that<00:01:57.230> way<00:01:57.350> up<00:01:57.470> so<00:01:58.430> i<00:01:58.460> think

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
outside of Kenny that way up so i think

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.150 
outside of Kenny that way up so i think
really<00:01:58.880> feed<00:01:59.210> off<00:01:59.380> of<00:02:00.380> Rashid<00:02:00.680> when<00:02:00.890> it<00:02:00.980> comes

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
really feed off of Rashid when it comes

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.180 
really feed off of Rashid when it comes
to<00:02:01.340> when<00:02:01.880> it<00:02:01.910> comes<00:02:02.120> to<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.360> off<00:02:03.010> no<00:02:04.010> he

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
to when it comes to the off no he

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.220 
to when it comes to the off no he
knocked<00:02:04.760> down<00:02:04.880> a<00:02:04.940> couple<00:02:05.030> shots<00:02:05.300> but<00:02:05.840> that

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
knocked down a couple shots but that

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.620 
knocked down a couple shots but that
