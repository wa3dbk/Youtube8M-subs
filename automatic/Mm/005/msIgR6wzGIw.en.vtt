this giant tablet doesn't have a

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
touchscreen so how does it actually feel

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.740 
touchscreen so how does it actually feel
to<00:02:16.250> use<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.280> tablet<00:02:17.610> or<00:02:17.910> smartphone<00:02:18.209> optimized

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
experience is a little bit on Android

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.540 
experience is a little bit on Android
4.4<00:02:27.599> KitKat<00:02:28.050> is<00:02:28.200> simply<00:02:28.590> not<00:02:28.800> made<00:02:29.099> for<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.340> TV

4.4 KitKat is simply not made for a TV
which<00:02:30.030> is<00:02:30.060> why<00:02:30.360> Google<00:02:30.540> opted<00:02:30.959> for<00:02:31.050> Android<00:02:31.410> TV

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
which is why Google opted for Android TV

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.780 
which is why Google opted for Android TV
but<00:02:32.550> it<00:02:33.540> actually<00:02:33.720> can<00:02:34.200> work<00:02:34.500> very<00:02:34.830> well<00:02:34.920> let's

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
but it actually can work very well let's

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.580 
but it actually can work very well let's

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
any other Android device now let's step

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.940 
any other Android device now let's step
back<00:04:33.390> a<00:04:33.570> little<00:04:33.660> bit<00:04:33.930> and<00:04:34.110> talk<00:04:34.320> about<00:04:34.350> touch

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
back a little bit and talk about touch

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.920 
back a little bit and talk about touch
functions<00:04:35.400> which<00:04:35.880> are<00:04:36.060> of<00:04:36.450> course<00:04:36.690> pretty

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
functions which are of course pretty

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.410 
functions which are of course pretty
much<00:04:37.020> absent<00:04:37.530> here<00:04:37.860> but<00:04:38.370> AC<00:04:38.550> Ryan<00:04:38.940> makes<00:04:39.270> this

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
much absent here but AC Ryan makes this

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.230 
much absent here but AC Ryan makes this
accessory<00:04:40.020> that<00:04:40.590> will<00:04:41.090> completely<00:04:42.090> change

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
accessory that will completely change

your experience they call it the vo

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.400 
your experience they call it the vo
navigator<00:04:45.360> and<00:04:45.630> it's<00:04:46.080> actually<00:04:46.380> a

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
navigator and it's actually a

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.370 
navigator and it's actually a
replacement<00:04:46.590> for<00:04:47.100> the<00:04:47.190> remote<00:04:47.780> it<00:04:48.780> looks

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
replacement for the remote it looks

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.040 
replacement for the remote it looks
pretty<00:04:50.220> much<00:04:50.280> almost<00:04:50.640> like<00:04:51.030> the<00:04:51.540> included

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
pretty much almost like the included

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.660 
pretty much almost like the included
remote<00:04:52.260> but<00:04:52.830> this<00:04:53.070> one<00:04:53.220> comes<00:04:53.550> with

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
remote but this one comes with

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.820 
remote but this one comes with
technology<00:04:54.330> inside<00:04:54.660> it's<00:04:54.900> a<00:04:55.170> six<00:04:55.440> axis

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
technology inside it's a six axis

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.700 
technology inside it's a six axis
gyroscope<00:04:56.490> that<00:04:56.990> allows<00:04:57.990> you<00:04:58.170> to<00:04:58.320> use<00:04:58.530> the

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
gyroscope that allows you to use the

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.340 
gyroscope that allows you to use the
remote<00:04:58.980> kind<00:04:59.340> of<00:04:59.460> like<00:04:59.640> a<00:04:59.670> Wii<00:05:00.180> controller<00:05:00.780> now

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
remote kind of like a Wii controller now

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:02.960 
remote kind of like a Wii controller now
this<00:05:01.800> changes<00:05:02.190> everything<00:05:02.310> it<00:05:02.580> makes<00:05:02.760> for<00:05:02.910> a

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
this changes everything it makes for a

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.450 
this changes everything it makes for a
much<00:05:03.300> more<00:05:03.540> intuitive<00:05:03.870> experience<00:05:04.310> all<00:05:05.310> you

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
much more intuitive experience all you

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.100 
much more intuitive experience all you
have<00:05:05.610> to<00:05:05.700> do<00:05:05.790> is<00:05:05.910> wave<00:05:06.330> their<00:05:06.570> remote<00:05:06.810> around

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
have to do is wave their remote around

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.690 
have to do is wave their remote around
and<00:05:07.350> you<00:05:07.590> will<00:05:07.680> see<00:05:07.740> that<00:05:08.100> the<00:05:08.190> cursor<00:05:08.460> moves

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
and you will see that the cursor moves

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.230 
and you will see that the cursor moves
