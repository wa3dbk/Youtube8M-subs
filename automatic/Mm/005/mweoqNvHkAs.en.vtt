00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.300 

yeah<00:01:11.670> Brent<00:01:11.970> Dale<00:01:12.120> industries<00:01:12.860> we<00:01:13.860> build<00:01:14.100> race

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
yeah Brent Dale industries we build race

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.910 
yeah Brent Dale industries we build race
cars<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.110> what<00:01:16.110> we<00:01:16.229> like<00:01:16.440> to<00:01:16.470> do<00:01:16.710> different

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
cars and what we like to do different

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.760 
cars and what we like to do different
than<00:01:17.310> some<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.180> competition<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.050> we<00:01:19.440> drive

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
than some of the competition is we drive

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.160 
than some of the competition is we drive
them<00:01:19.920> every<00:01:20.820> single<00:01:21.150> race<00:01:21.300> opportunity<00:01:22.020> we

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
them every single race opportunity we

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.870 
them every single race opportunity we
get<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.650> we<00:01:22.740> make<00:01:22.920> changes<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.369> them<00:01:23.610> every

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
get and we make changes to them every

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.240 
get and we make changes to them every
race<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.360> think<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.740> gives<00:01:25.979> us<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.220> huge

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
race I think that gives us a huge

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.090 
race I think that gives us a huge
advantage<00:01:26.580> over<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.240> competition

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.790 

Jonathan<00:01:32.030> my<00:01:32.150> brother<00:01:32.360> is<00:01:32.570> he<00:01:33.440> pushes<00:01:33.740> the

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
Jonathan my brother is he pushes the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.860 
Jonathan my brother is he pushes the
limits<00:01:34.100> of<00:01:34.159> our<00:01:34.280> vehicles<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:34.850> we<00:01:35.510> find<00:01:35.750> the

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
limits of our vehicles and we find the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.649 
limits of our vehicles and we find the
weaknesses<00:01:36.260> of<00:01:36.320> them<00:01:36.909> you<00:01:37.909> know<00:01:38.000> there's

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
weaknesses of them you know there's

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:39.670 
weaknesses of them you know there's
always<00:01:38.780> going<00:01:38.930> to<00:01:38.990> be<00:01:39.080> something<00:01:39.470> there<00:01:39.560> to

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
always going to be something there to

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.070 
always going to be something there to
improve<00:01:39.890> on<00:01:40.070> so<00:01:40.460> we<00:01:40.550> go<00:01:40.670> back<00:01:40.700> and<00:01:41.210> have<00:01:42.020> a

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
improve on so we go back and have a

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.510 
improve on so we go back and have a
whole<00:01:42.260> process<00:01:42.740> just<00:01:42.770> for<00:01:43.040> developing

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
whole process just for developing

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.340 
whole process just for developing
vehicles<00:01:43.760> and<00:01:44.360> making<00:01:44.600> every<00:01:44.900> single<00:01:45.050> one

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
vehicles and making every single one

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:52.270 
vehicles and making every single one
better<00:01:45.650> stronger<00:01:46.040> faster<00:01:50.740> we<00:01:51.740> don't<00:01:51.920> go<00:01:52.070> into

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
better stronger faster we don't go into

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.840 
better stronger faster we don't go into
a<00:01:52.369> race<00:01:52.640> without<00:01:53.950> 100%<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.130> ability<00:01:55.550> to<00:01:55.670> win

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
a race without 100% the ability to win

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.880 
a race without 100% the ability to win
which<00:01:56.330> is<00:01:56.360> why<00:01:56.990> we<00:01:57.170> didn't<00:01:57.410> start<00:01:57.590> out<00:01:57.740> in<00:01:57.860> a

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
which is why we didn't start out in a

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.460 
which is why we didn't start out in a
trophy<00:01:58.160> truck<00:01:58.430> for<00:01:58.729> one<00:01:58.910> we<00:01:59.840> needed<00:02:00.110> some<00:02:00.259> time

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
trophy truck for one we needed some time

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.740 
trophy truck for one we needed some time
under<00:02:00.770> our<00:02:00.800> belts<00:02:01.250> myself<00:02:01.700> and<00:02:01.970> my<00:02:02.090> brother<00:02:02.390> to

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
under our belts myself and my brother to

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.660 
under our belts myself and my brother to

drive other classes get familiar with

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.820 
drive other classes get familiar with
the<00:02:04.880> cars<00:02:05.149> and<00:02:05.479> build<00:02:06.020> them<00:02:06.259> to<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:06.500> best<00:02:06.710> of

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
the cars and build them to the best of

the cars and build them to the best of
their<00:02:07.009> ability<00:02:07.430> then<00:02:07.789> within<00:02:08.030> that<00:02:08.300> every

their ability then within that every
single<00:02:09.500> race<00:02:09.800> there's<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.280> different<00:02:10.550> strategy

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729
