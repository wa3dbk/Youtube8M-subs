 on a bone the first flirtation 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.039
 so yes it's kind of everything but 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.140
 said m you'll see why 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.970
 it is one that is without my parents 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.740
 got complicated in fact so he's 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.759
 easy enough to use at one time 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.660
 that you took the hand that's why 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.910
 that I'm going to show you how 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.950

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.620
 paul name of the mullahs 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.430
 it starts well how to install it and 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.739
 how to use it 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.120
 I succeeded then first of all there you 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.160
 will have to go on cydia the base 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.710
 what since otherwise it'll be hot a 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.260
 meaning so well we can not download it 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.940
 so yes it must and jacques lighter 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.070
 I forgot I specify what I forgot 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.690
 to specify therefore necessarily jacques 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.070
 lighter I had preloaded city 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.140
 fair blinds is so hoping that this 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.100
 not too long, that's perfect then 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.479
 now once you're in 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.330
 signed you have in your sources you 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.100
 put added http flash flash bronze 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.450
 ripaud date 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.070
 insanely of arkham commitment sees there 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.720
 once they install and you go 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.590
 in your research and you mark 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.590
 range player 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:32.369
 I said search here it is not 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:33.840
 too early unable so good I have the 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.990
 time to play the flute non comment 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.060
 it happens ah well here it is not too much 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.979
 early then just once that 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.280
 you have find you download on 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.140
 the on the source of nissan elie a 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.850
 scene I do not know how that's 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.040
 is pronounced 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.360
 the excuse month in 1.4 normally the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.430
 latest version it is the lapointe one 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.950
 point 5.4 so after that maybe at 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.000
 above it is not embarrassing but below 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.399
 Well, it's embarrassing because there's no 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.640
 small stuff in multi task 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.340
 background 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.560
 so once he has installed clears 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.600
 you 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.270
 wow once he will install you 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.800
 you render on your springboard and 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.970
 you launch this range player 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.230
 once this gameplay is restarted in 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.000
 do it go like this and there you 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.260
 click on the top right and he will come 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.630
 here you can put it anywhere 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.670
 you want and so once these 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.480
 have done well we will go on 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.370
 a fear pocket edition so no 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.780
 here on minecraft pocket edition so 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.990
 I'm pretty happy because I had 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.360
 a lot of returns 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.890
 asked what it was 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.120
 this little player range since it has 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.620
 left a lot of suspense in the 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.730
 previous video a little thing that moves 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.760
 like that no matter how 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.040
 it's pretty lonely or let's say so we're going 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.210
 go I'm going to create an old world on 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.930
 worth it by the way I was even spam 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:53.260
 and by twitter and craft hours have you 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.960
 I swoon no but and so then we 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.340
 is asking here ok maybe i'm going 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.910
 go down trees because it's not 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.790
 the top 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.290
 then by cons it's kind of 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.750
 glitch of duplication and better 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.370
 than the public and we can lose to 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.530
 items the ally no risk it's the 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.880
 must-must-all it takes to infinity 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.560
 two seconds compared to this old glitch 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.120
 shit for me to talk about it like 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.880
 that's true that I did not hurt 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.380
 but it's better like that so me 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.770
 I take wood so I see a point 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.420
 from them and I will take it at the e3 o'clock 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.739
 t4 of sand so I hope I'm going 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.330
 not spit if I spit should a 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.180
 little elite because I already spit from 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:32.470
 base but a more scotch with still 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.000
 with the trick make it so small 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.010
 crash re so then there I want 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.980
 multiply madird so I go in 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.870
 range player select application 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.190
 minecraft pocket edition g4 two hours 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.290
 so I'm looking for four cars identifies 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.000
 it's okay it's pretty fast 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.350
 frankly it's very fast 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.940
 that's it then I'm going to impose one for 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:00.270
 change the value so here I have 3 so 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.270
 I 'm going to search 3 up 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.720
 and then I go resting once 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.700
 that it will have fucking but it crashed to 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.420
 manassas not spit I was lucky 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:14.900
 so I almost raged and once again 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:22.699
 2 so I'm going to look for 2 up this is 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:26.540
 him 999 modifies end locke and normally 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:28.850
 it should be good here I am 99 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.940
 the more I really have to infinity what and 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.430
 as I blocked I have locke what eh 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.199
 well I would have 99 yet to infinity 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.050
 to infinity of infinity so you need 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:41.780
 at least one item a game I 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.310
 so rewrite so now we're going 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.289
 do it for the wood so for the wood 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.820
 rhyme simpler by the way I take it 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:49.070
 minimum 4 because otherwise it makes me 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.539
 spit like my ipad and fucking jew 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.760
 and that bugs and simple crazy I do 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.590
 than to spit since just now 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.990
 in fact you need at least one block 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.430
 you are looking for a so me for example there 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:03.350
 for wood I have five I go in 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:06.979
 the best here is select aplicaciones 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.470
 minecraft pocket edition still crash 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.910
 thank you it makes me happy 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:14.510
 So here I have five we'll get 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:18.320
 five others who as usual all the 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:21.349
 time while Auto iron here now 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:26.419

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:29.349
 seek four ways the marrow and 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:37.070

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:39.650
 now I'm resting a name yes I 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.570
 resume the other sooner it's better to 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.760
 resume that of resting a second 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:50.720
 time 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:55.070
 that's up 5 now so i'm looking for 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:57.130
 it's one of the 3 so I 'll maybe in 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:06:00.530
 to rest in history to see if it changes 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:05.510
 certainly two up there so we'll 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:11.260
 change the two valu 14 9 9 modifies 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:16.840

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.280
 ndjock so here now it should 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.530
