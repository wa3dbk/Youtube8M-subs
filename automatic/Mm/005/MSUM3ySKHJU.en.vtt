00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:09.730 
this is one of the close Gobert planes

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.570 
this is one of the close Gobert planes
that<00:00:10.059> I<00:00:10.120> make

like

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.180 

these<00:00:21.360> are<00:00:21.600> really<00:00:21.930> cool<00:00:22.140> airplanes<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:23.010> use

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:23.190 
these are really cool airplanes I use

the<00:00:23.430> rubber<00:00:23.670> tires<00:00:25.130> starts<00:00:26.130> out<00:00:26.250> as<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> kit

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:27.290 
the rubber tires starts out as a kit

the rubber tires starts out as a kit
I've<00:00:28.290> elaborated<00:00:29.070> on<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.400> simplified<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.360> in

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.450 
I've elaborated on it simplified it in

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.720 
I've elaborated on it simplified it in
some<00:00:30.689> ways<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:33.020> use<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.230> spectrum<00:00:34.680> glass<00:00:35.400> an

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
some ways I use the spectrum glass an

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.200 
some ways I use the spectrum glass an
opal<00:00:36.330> art<00:00:36.480> glass<00:00:38.300> made<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.330> little<00:00:39.660> deal<00:00:40.350> on

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
opal art glass made a little deal on

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.060 
opal art glass made a little deal on
back<00:00:42.210> in<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.170> sits<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.590> little<00:00:43.710> bit<00:00:43.949> off

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
back in so that it sits a little bit off

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.930 
back in so that it sits a little bit off
the<00:00:44.100> ground

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
the ground

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.540

I<00:00:45.260> got<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.290> hanger<00:00:46.770> right<00:00:46.949> here<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.460> can

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
I got a hanger right here so you can

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.280 
I got a hanger right here so you can
hang<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.120> flight<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.780> looks<00:00:49.020> like<00:00:49.080> it's

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
hang it in flight so it looks like it's

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.900 
hang it in flight so it looks like it's
dive-bombing<00:00:49.920> get<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.400> out<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.670> way<00:00:50.790> up

this plane is green and white the body

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.280 
this plane is green and white the body
it's<00:02:01.400> got<00:02:01.670> to<00:02:01.820> move<00:02:01.940> the<00:02:02.120> whale<00:02:02.270> really<00:02:02.780> slow

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
it's got to move the whale really slow

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.160 
it's got to move the whale really slow
and<00:02:03.590> off<00:02:03.980> Sun<00:02:04.340> you've<00:02:04.520> changed<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.030> image<00:02:05.170> now

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
and off Sun you've changed the image now

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.660
