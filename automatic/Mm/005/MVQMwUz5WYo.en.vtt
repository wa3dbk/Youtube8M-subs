00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello to everything so the subject of the day it 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.770
 is going to be the diets and only a 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.840
 regime so the tuna diet that for 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.259
 me so this is my favorite diet so 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.570
 I tried a lot it's really 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.070
 the one I prefer 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.220
 Of course every time regime 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.289
 each pair with the one that suits him 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.850
 the better so by the way if you want 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.760
 that I give others do not hesitate I 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.710
 really have a whole collection 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.029
 where do I start my story my 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.769
 story is that I just gave birth 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.840
 so my third pÃ©pettes 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.180
 there are two and a half months so the first 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.879
 month I lost 13 pounds so the team 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.530
 Agro 16 perfect the second month I 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.469
 lost two pounds so I do not know 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.640
 how did I succeed besides so what 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.770
 which makes me a total weight loss 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.969
 15 kg and it's true that since two 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.950
 three weeks I resumed my life 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.399
 normal so it's true that I no longer 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.440
 too lost and so I do not fit in anymore 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.410
 in nothing so to choose either I am 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.059
 buy a new wardrobe or I 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.110
 resume the regime so I think that a 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:07.260
 diet will cost me no cheaper so 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.920
 the tuna diet i will register you 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.119
 at the bottom because if there are some who are 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.680
 motivated that they want to do it 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.810
 with me I say more we are crazy 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.610
 the more we laugh at the level of comments 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.330
 so we can really support ourselves 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.370
 motivation notice weight loss and 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.670
 moments of weakness since we know 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.890
 all that happens during the diet 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.930
 the tuna diet what do you say it's to 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.820
 the base on seven days so I 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.310
 continues until I have lost the 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.670
 desired weight we lose on average so 2 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.500
 kg per week which is pretty good 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.060
 if we go back to the gym 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.280
 lose more and if we take 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.110
 food supplements ena style 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.050
 all products that we finally find 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.250
 badly if we lose even more I'll go 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.710
 give a simple example this is to 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.250
 to say that after my second I was riding 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.930
 to 120 kg so good pounds of pregnancy 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.860
 I made diabetes eat a little bit 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.810
 abused I let go and diet room 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.170
 of sports and supplements I managed to 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:12.100
 go down to 63 kg so so it works 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.420
 really if we have the motivation at the level 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.090
 complements so I tried to 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.910
 find what I took after my 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.770
 girl finally the second so I did 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.480
 all the pharmacies I failed to 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.730
 to find her since obviously I had 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.780
 forgot his name 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.340
 it would have been easier if I had it 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.340
 noted so I decided to buy some 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.610
 several and you make videos for 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:37.060
 to tell you with which finally for me I 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.100
 think lose the most so there is no 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.209
 of miracle cure one of course but 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.860
 really I think it is in the 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.810
 weight loss so the one I have 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.750
 started this morning as we are 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.239
 monday and the diet started so that's 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.250
 total 4 so I can not put 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.980
 the screen in the other direction I do not know 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.049
 how do we do so no these are these 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.120
 nutrium laboratory girl science who 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.670
 do that there are two pills a day 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.519
 learn in the morning that burns the 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.110
 calories and draining an excess and a 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.790
 evening so he mimics the storage of 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.560
 fats and track down the sugars so 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.989
 it's not magic but I really think 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.850
 that it helps 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.110
 the gym for me there it goes 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.370
 really not be possible because with 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.400
 three children I do not write the 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.140
 job so that's so so here's the 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.790
 diet 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.530

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:28.440
