them<00:02:22.250> and<00:02:22.370> that's<00:02:22.520> why<00:02:22.640> I've<00:02:22.760> decided<00:02:22.910> by

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
them and that's why I've decided by

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.770 
them and that's why I've decided by
having<00:02:23.570> opportunity<00:02:24.050> so<00:02:25.300> back<00:02:26.300> to<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.570> first
