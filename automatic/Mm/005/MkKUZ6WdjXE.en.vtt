start to blink the pattern is adjustable

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.810 
start to blink the pattern is adjustable
the<00:00:36.920> effects<00:00:37.920> are<00:00:38.100> just<00:00:38.130> a<00:00:38.430> bullet<00:00:38.579> just<00:00:38.640> about

the<00:00:42.629> recharge<00:00:43.320> ports<00:00:43.620> these<00:00:43.800> new<00:00:43.980> low<00:00:44.160> profile

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
the recharge ports these new low profile

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.049 
the recharge ports these new low profile
polymer<00:00:45.739> ports<00:00:46.739> they're<00:00:46.949> a<00:00:46.980> lot<00:00:47.250> more<00:00:47.489> durable

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
polymer ports they're a lot more durable

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.259 
polymer ports they're a lot more durable
than<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.359> metal<00:00:48.600> ones<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:50.090> lot<00:00:51.090> more

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
than the metal ones and a lot more

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.509 
than the metal ones and a lot more
reliable<00:00:51.780> as<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.320> metal<00:00:52.590> ones<00:00:52.739> conduct<00:00:53.280> and

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
reliable as the metal ones conduct and

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:55.340 
reliable as the metal ones conduct and
so<00:00:53.640> if<00:00:53.760> they<00:00:53.850> ever<00:00:53.940> fail<00:00:54.359> they<00:00:54.840> fail<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.320> big

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
so if they ever fail they fail in a big

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.349 
so if they ever fail they fail in a big
way<00:00:55.680> these<00:00:56.250> ones<00:00:56.489> if<00:00:56.609> they<00:00:56.640> fail<00:00:56.969> you're<00:00:57.210> not

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359 
way these ones if they fail you're not

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:58.700 
way these ones if they fail you're not
gonna<00:00:57.510> get<00:00:57.719> any<00:00:57.870> problems<00:00:58.230> with<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.410> battery

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
gonna get any problems with the battery

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.669 
gonna get any problems with the battery
pack<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.129> so<00:01:00.030> far<00:01:00.359> had<00:01:00.600> 100<00:01:01.050> installed<00:01:01.469> and

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
pack and so far had 100 installed and

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:04.729 
pack and so far had 100 installed and
had<00:01:01.769> a<00:01:01.949> single<00:01:02.219> problem<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:03.600> metal<00:01:03.899> ones<00:01:04.110> had

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
had a single problem the metal ones had

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.820 
had a single problem the metal ones had
about<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.480> 5%<00:01:06.480> return<00:01:06.780> rate<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.350> wasn't<00:01:07.680> great

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
about a 5% return rate it wasn't great

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.740 
about a 5% return rate it wasn't great
but<00:01:08.130> I'm<00:01:08.580> really<00:01:08.910> happy<00:01:09.210> with<00:01:09.450> these<00:01:09.570> new

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
but I'm really happy with these new

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.530 
but I'm really happy with these new
recharge<00:01:10.170> ports<00:01:10.790> plus<00:01:11.790> they're<00:01:12.000> low<00:01:12.120> profile

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
recharge ports plus they're low profile

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.620 
recharge ports plus they're low profile
so<00:01:12.750> easy<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.230> hold<00:01:13.410> and<00:01:14.090> they<00:01:15.090> look<00:01:15.300> cool<00:01:15.510> up

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
so easy to hold and they look cool up

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.940 
so easy to hold and they look cool up
there<00:01:15.690> block<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.260> they<00:01:16.350> blend<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.770> really

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
wealth is on the hill

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.800 
wealth is on the hill
these<00:01:19.140> have<00:01:19.440> kill<00:01:20.130> kill<00:01:20.790> keys<00:01:21.030> they've<00:01:21.600> got

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
these have kill kill keys they've got

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.630 
these have kill kill keys they've got
the<00:01:21.960> recharge<00:01:22.290> course<00:01:22.530> they<00:01:22.710> got<00:01:22.830> 18<00:01:23.310> 650

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
the recharge course they got 18 650

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.120 
the recharge course they got 18 650
batteries<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.630> then<00:01:25.380> they've<00:01:25.590> got<00:01:25.620> blade

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
batteries and then they've got blade

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.470 
batteries and then they've got blade
plugs<00:01:27.920> and<00:01:28.920> they're<00:01:29.880> using<00:01:30.210> my<00:01:30.660> x2<00:01:31.650> 10<00:01:32.040> watt

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
plugs and they're using my x2 10 watt

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.970 
plugs and they're using my x2 10 watt
dual<00:01:33.480> color<00:01:33.630> LEDs<00:01:36.410> you<00:01:37.410> notice<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.860> the

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
dual color LEDs you notice that the

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.680 
dual color LEDs you notice that the
coupler<00:01:38.370> is<00:01:38.430> glowing<00:01:38.700> blue<00:01:39.120> that's<00:01:39.390> because

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
coupler is glowing blue that's because

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.870 
coupler is glowing blue that's because
there's<00:01:39.840> five<00:01:40.320> millimeter<00:01:40.770> accent<00:01:41.430> LEDs

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
there's five millimeter accent LEDs

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.730 
there's five millimeter accent LEDs
installed<00:01:42.330> there<00:01:43.970> and<00:01:45.260> so<00:01:46.260> these<00:01:46.410> are<00:01:46.590> on<00:01:46.710> a

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
installed there and so these are on a

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.620 
installed there and so these are on a
different<00:01:47.070> pattern<00:01:47.280> but<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.210> can<00:01:48.390> change

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
different pattern but you can change

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.440 
different pattern but you can change
them<00:01:48.840> there's<00:01:49.530> about<00:01:49.710> eight<00:01:50.010> different

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
them there's about eight different

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.470 
them there's about eight different
pre-selected<00:01:51.450> patterns<00:01:52.050> and<00:01:53.240> there's<00:01:54.240> ones

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 
pre-selected patterns and there's ones

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.000 
pre-selected patterns and there's ones
that<00:01:54.630> Idol<00:01:54.900> hung<00:01:55.140> one<00:01:55.620> for<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.010> lock-up<00:01:58.010> press

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
that Idol hung one for the lock-up press

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.410 
that Idol hung one for the lock-up press
the<00:01:59.130> auxiliary<00:01:59.400> switch<00:01:59.760> to<00:01:59.940> get<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> lot<00:02:00.300> of

the auxiliary switch to get a lot of
effect<00:02:01.610> tap<00:02:02.610> it

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.190 

and<00:02:07.430> you<00:02:07.640> play<00:02:07.880> Gloucester<00:02:08.509> block<00:02:10.960> now<00:02:11.960> I've

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
and you play Gloucester block now I've
