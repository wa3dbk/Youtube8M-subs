ultrasound of ultraviolet thing or

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.940 
ultrasound of ultraviolet thing or
whatever<00:02:31.300> so<00:02:31.810> instead<00:02:32.230> of<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.500> old<00:02:32.680> way<00:02:32.920> of

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
whatever so instead of the old way of

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.180 
whatever so instead of the old way of
taking<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.730> little<00:02:34.620> pokey<00:02:35.620> thing<00:02:35.830> and<00:02:36.070> and

taking the little pokey thing and and

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.610 
taking the little pokey thing and and
seeing<00:02:36.760> how<00:02:36.880> soft<00:02:37.180> it<00:02:37.360> was<00:02:37.510> this<00:02:37.840> can<00:02:38.140> actually

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
seeing how soft it was this can actually

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.350 
seeing how soft it was this can actually
measure<00:02:39.180> just<00:02:40.180> by<00:02:41.010> zapping<00:02:42.010> your<00:02:42.310> tooth<00:02:42.580> what

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
measure just by zapping your tooth what

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:50.480 
measure just by zapping your tooth what
level<00:02:43.780> of<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:45.700> give<00:02:46.360> you<00:02:46.930> watch<00:02:47.170> me<00:02:48.480> step<00:02:49.480> Bob

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
level of to give you watch me step Bob

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.449 
level of to give you watch me step Bob
and<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:52.870> goes<00:02:53.050> I'm<00:02:53.320> zeroed<00:02:53.740> like<00:02:53.980> nine<00:02:54.190> nine

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
and it goes I'm zeroed like nine nine

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.240 
and it goes I'm zeroed like nine nine
and<00:02:54.670> I'm<00:02:54.820> thinking<00:02:55.300> like<00:02:55.540> you<00:02:55.840> know<00:02:55.870> 99<00:02:56.860> good
