00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.559
 I'll do it a little bit differently, I'll 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.230
 do as a touch father and I go 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:19.369
 segment by product types 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.550

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.320
 strategies 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.840

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.220

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.570
 easier for those who are presenting 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.640

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.270

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.250
 a touch of June 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:52.110
 the first product is this in here 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.570

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.940
 crockery 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:00.120
 For sure this brand I have liked 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:05.519
 much of it and before I had bought the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:08.250
 tablet that was an idea and I needed 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.810
 exchange for this powder because it yields 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:17.939
 much more open longer than also 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.979
 it gets cheaper very cheap 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.710
 so to save on the purchase itself and 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:27.630
 I really liked what all the dishes are 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.750

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:58.670
