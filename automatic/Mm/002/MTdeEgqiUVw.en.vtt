we're<00:00:16.320> gonna<00:00:16.410> find<00:00:16.619> my<00:00:16.740> balance<00:00:19.609> it's<00:00:20.609> like

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
we're gonna find my balance it's like

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:29.720 
we're gonna find my balance it's like
the<00:00:20.910> triple<00:00:21.240> kingpin<00:00:21.869> effect<00:00:22.580> haha<00:00:23.580> oh<00:00:24.170> oh<00:00:28.730> how

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
the triple kingpin effect haha oh oh how

00:00:29.730 --> 00:01:05.959 
the triple kingpin effect haha oh oh how
would<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:30.029> like<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.210> learn<00:00:30.480> how<00:00:32.750> to<00:00:33.750> ollie

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:05.969 

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:10.609 

yeah<00:01:07.859> all<00:01:08.859> right<00:01:09.009> so<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.729> longboard<00:01:10.149> always

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
yeah all right so the longboard always

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.319 
yeah all right so the longboard always
very<00:01:11.619> different<00:01:11.979> from<00:01:12.070> this<00:01:12.250> paper<00:01:12.460> doll<00:01:12.789> with

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:13.329 
very different from this paper doll with

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:16.590 
very different from this paper doll with
the<00:01:13.359> skateboard<00:01:13.899> ollie<00:01:14.189> you're<00:01:15.450> relying<00:01:16.450> on

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
the skateboard ollie you're relying on

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.899 
the skateboard ollie you're relying on
the<00:01:16.719> tails<00:01:16.990> snap<00:01:17.409> against<00:01:17.859> the<00:01:17.950> ground<00:01:18.189> to

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
the tails snap against the ground to

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.870 
the tails snap against the ground to
generate<00:01:19.390> that<00:01:19.600> like<00:01:20.409> pop<00:01:20.709> and<00:01:21.039> then<00:01:21.640> you<00:01:21.700> roll

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
generate that like pop and then you roll

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.090 
generate that like pop and then you roll
your<00:01:22.000> front<00:01:22.240> foot

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
your front foot

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:31.190 
your front foot
it's<00:01:24.100> more<00:01:24.310> about<00:01:24.429> just<00:01:24.640> snapping<00:01:24.939> that<00:01:25.240> task

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.109 

so<00:01:32.200> longboard<00:01:32.799> ollie<00:01:33.039> on<00:01:33.219> a<00:01:33.250> skateboard

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
so longboard ollie on a skateboard

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.240 
so longboard ollie on a skateboard
without<00:01:34.899> letting<00:01:35.109> that<00:01:35.380> tail<00:01:35.679> snap<00:01:36.009> would

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
without letting that tail snap would

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.359 
without letting that tail snap would
look<00:01:36.429> something<00:01:36.610> like<00:01:36.819> this<00:01:37.890> see<00:01:38.890> I'm<00:01:39.069> just

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
look something like this see I'm just

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:40.919 
look something like this see I'm just
I<00:01:39.579> never<00:01:39.849> snapped<00:01:40.209> the<00:01:40.299> tail<00:01:40.479> against<00:01:40.780> the

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
I never snapped the tail against the

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:42.630 
I never snapped the tail against the
ground<00:01:41.079> it<00:01:41.349> just<00:01:41.380> it<00:01:41.979> gets<00:01:42.189> about<00:01:42.369> halfway

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
ground it just it gets about halfway

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.749 
ground it just it gets about halfway
down<00:01:43.000> and<00:01:43.270> then<00:01:43.390> that's<00:01:43.569> when<00:01:43.810> you<00:01:43.929> roll<00:01:44.649> back

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
down and then that's when you roll back

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.339 
down and then that's when you roll back
roll<00:01:45.759> your<00:01:45.939> front<00:01:46.179> foot<00:01:46.390> forward<00:01:46.810> at<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.140> same

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:47.349 
roll your front foot forward at the same

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:49.319 
roll your front foot forward at the same
time<00:01:47.560> and<00:01:47.770> that's<00:01:47.890> what<00:01:48.099> gives<00:01:48.280> it<00:01:48.369> lift

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329 
time and that's what gives it lift

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:53.609 
time and that's what gives it lift
motion<00:01:51.360> long<00:01:52.360> boards<00:01:52.780> generally<00:01:53.500> have

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
motion long boards generally have

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.339 
motion long boards generally have
shorter<00:01:53.920> tails<00:01:54.360> don't<00:01:55.360> really<00:01:55.750> snap<00:01:56.049> against

00:01:56.339 --> 00:01:56.349 
shorter tails don't really snap against

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:58.440 
shorter tails don't really snap against
the<00:01:56.500> ground<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.729> you<00:01:57.819> kind<00:01:58.030> of<00:01:58.090> have<00:01:58.270> to

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
the ground so you kind of have to

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.649 
the ground so you kind of have to
manufacture<00:01:58.780> an<00:01:59.289> ollie<00:01:59.469> you<00:01:59.799> by<00:02:00.479> pushing<00:02:01.479> down

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
manufacture an ollie you by pushing down

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.809 
manufacture an ollie you by pushing down
with<00:02:02.079> your<00:02:02.200> back<00:02:02.379> foot<00:02:02.649> but<00:02:03.189> also<00:02:03.489> pushing

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
with your back foot but also pushing

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:06.240 
with your back foot but also pushing
back<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:05.229> while<00:02:05.439> you're<00:02:05.590> pushing<00:02:05.739> down<00:02:06.069> and

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
back and while you're pushing down and

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.460 
back and while you're pushing down and
back<00:02:06.489> that's<00:02:07.360> when<00:02:07.599> you<00:02:07.719> drag<00:02:07.989> your<00:02:08.170> front

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
back that's when you drag your front

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.220 
back that's when you drag your front
foot<00:02:08.709> forward<00:02:09.209> creating<00:02:10.209> that<00:02:10.479> ollie<00:02:10.810> like

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
foot forward creating that ollie like

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.720 
foot forward creating that ollie like
motion<00:02:12.660> feels<00:02:13.660> a<00:02:13.780> lot<00:02:13.900> different<00:02:14.350> than<00:02:14.799> like

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
motion feels a lot different than like

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.360 
motion feels a lot different than like
the<00:02:16.060> street<00:02:16.299> deck<00:02:16.510> truth<00:02:17.290> decks<00:02:17.530> are<00:02:17.709> a<00:02:18.010> lot

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
the street deck truth decks are a lot

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.530 
the street deck truth decks are a lot
easier<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:19.060> ollie

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
easier to ollie

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.180 
easier to ollie
because<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.349> tail<00:02:20.530> snaps<00:02:20.829> against<00:02:21.069> the

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
because the tail snaps against the

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.759 
because the tail snaps against the
ground<00:02:21.840> with<00:02:22.840> these<00:02:22.989> you<00:02:23.200> really<00:02:23.440> have<00:02:23.650> to

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
ground with these you really have to

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.099 
ground with these you really have to
work<00:02:23.980> it<00:02:24.160> because<00:02:24.519> the<00:02:24.639> board's<00:02:24.970> heavier<00:02:25.359> tail

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:26.109 
work it because the board's heavier tail

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:28.440 
work it because the board's heavier tail
doesn't<00:02:26.349> snap<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:27.639> especially<00:02:28.030> with<00:02:28.329> the

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
doesn't snap and especially with the

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.890 
doesn't snap and especially with the
real<00:02:28.630> short<00:02:28.900> tails<00:02:30.209> really<00:02:31.209> difficult<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.780> get

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
real short tails really difficult to get

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.280 
real short tails really difficult to get
that<00:02:32.139> Ollie<00:02:33.329> subscribe<00:02:34.329> pushing<00:02:34.630> it<00:02:34.750> down<00:02:35.019> and

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
that Ollie subscribe pushing it down and

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.839 
that Ollie subscribe pushing it down and
back<00:02:35.470> while<00:02:35.829> sliding<00:02:36.160> and<00:02:36.519> rolling<00:02:36.819> your

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
back while sliding and rolling your

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.180 
back while sliding and rolling your
front<00:02:37.239> foot<00:02:37.419> forward<00:02:37.810> at<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.470> same<00:02:38.680> time<00:02:38.919> kind

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
front foot forward at the same time kind

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.449 
front foot forward at the same time kind
of<00:02:39.220> like<00:02:39.280> down<00:02:40.000> back<00:02:40.569> and<00:02:40.959> then<00:02:41.380> I<00:02:44.220> was<00:02:45.220> to<00:02:45.340> let

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
of like down back and then I was to let

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.460 
of like down back and then I was to let
this<00:02:45.700> snap<00:02:45.970> against<00:02:46.269> the<00:02:46.419> ground<00:02:46.599> I'd<00:02:47.200> have<00:02:47.380> to

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
this snap against the ground I'd have to

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.110 
this snap against the ground I'd have to
get<00:02:47.620> this<00:02:47.799> high<00:02:47.980> before<00:02:48.040> actually<00:02:48.790> getting<00:02:48.880> it

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
get this high before actually getting it

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.990 
get this high before actually getting it
to<00:02:49.150> plane<00:02:49.450> out<00:02:49.660> which<00:02:50.470> is<00:02:50.620> just<00:02:50.650> impossible<00:02:51.130> by

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
to plane out which is just impossible by

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.430 
to plane out which is just impossible by
using<00:02:52.209> this<00:02:52.450> method<00:02:52.630> of<00:02:52.959> ollieing<00:02:53.349> a

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
using this method of ollieing a

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.340 
using this method of ollieing a
longboard

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
longboard

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.000 
longboard
you<00:02:54.890> can<00:02:55.070> use<00:02:55.940> something<00:02:56.930> so<00:02:57.320> small<00:02:57.380> as<00:02:57.830> like

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
you can use something so small as like

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.130 
you can use something so small as like
the<00:02:58.160> nose<00:02:58.310> of<00:02:58.520> a<00:02:58.580> fat<00:02:58.790> tail<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.600> generate<00:02:59.990> an

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
the nose of a fat tail to generate an
