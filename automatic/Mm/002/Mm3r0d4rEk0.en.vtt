00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
things and finally comes out the idea I

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.520 
things and finally comes out the idea I
start<00:01:51.259> started<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.470> painting<00:01:53.040> with<00:01:53.280> no<00:01:53.549> idea

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
start started this painting with no idea

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:03.260 
start started this painting with no idea
neither<00:01:55.549> and<00:01:58.219> just<00:01:59.219> keep<00:02:00.149> doing<00:02:00.560> it<00:02:02.270> flappity

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
neither and just keep doing it flappity

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.410 
neither and just keep doing it flappity
here<00:02:04.259> on<00:02:05.189> modules<00:02:06.259> so<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.920> appetite<00:02:08.729> comes

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
here on modules so the appetite comes

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.860 
here on modules so the appetite comes
from<00:02:10.069> anything

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
from anything

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:20.770 
from anything
so<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.920> idea<00:02:13.550> is<00:02:13.910> that<00:02:18.459> make<00:02:19.459> sure<00:02:19.489> your<00:02:20.420> hand

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
so the idea is that make sure your hand

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.380 
so the idea is that make sure your hand
do<00:02:21.230> not<00:02:21.500> stop<00:02:22.269> and<00:02:23.269> just<00:02:23.330> draw<00:02:24.080> something<00:02:25.390> the

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
do not stop and just draw something the

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.770 
do not stop and just draw something the
idea<00:02:27.110> cannot<00:02:27.950> be<00:02:28.340> solved<00:02:29.060> out<00:02:29.530> you<00:02:30.530> cannot

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
idea cannot be solved out you cannot

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.320 
idea cannot be solved out you cannot
design<00:02:32.780> an<00:02:33.319> idea<00:02:34.299> just<00:02:35.299> think<00:02:35.930> of<00:02:36.170> an<00:02:36.739> idea<00:02:37.370> it

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
design an idea just think of an idea it

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.009 
design an idea just think of an idea it
is<00:02:38.510> not<00:02:38.810> practical<00:02:39.680> only<00:02:40.519> when<00:02:41.030> you<00:02:41.209> put<00:02:41.599> your

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
is not practical only when you put your

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:48.210 
is not practical only when you put your
hand<00:02:42.489> in<00:02:43.489> the<00:02:44.000> doing<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:45.470> ideas<00:02:46.130> become<00:02:46.750> real

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
hand in the doing the ideas become real

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.940 
hand in the doing the ideas become real
so<00:02:49.220> from<00:02:49.760> beginning<00:02:49.970> to<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.720> end<00:02:50.750> I<00:02:51.290> have<00:02:51.650> no

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
so from beginning to the end I have no

00:02:51.950 --> 00:03:12.130 
so from beginning to the end I have no
idea<00:02:52.549> for<00:02:53.420> this<00:03:06.549> by<00:03:07.549> practice<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:10.790> idea<00:03:11.480> comes

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
idea for this by practice the idea comes

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:19.660 
idea for this by practice the idea comes
from<00:03:13.209> practice<00:03:15.010> from<00:03:16.010> swings<00:03:17.530> like<00:03:18.670> anything

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
from practice from swings like anything

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:33.520 
from practice from swings like anything
else<00:03:20.889> just<00:03:26.980> idea<00:03:28.359> do<00:03:29.359> not<00:03:29.389> mind<00:03:30.849> what<00:03:32.470> is<00:03:33.470> the

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
else just idea do not mind what is the

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.020 
else just idea do not mind what is the
