add<00:03:41.459> in<00:03:41.729> loads<00:03:42.030> more<00:03:42.299> pace<00:03:42.569> which<00:03:42.780> we<00:03:42.930> haven't

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
add in loads more pace which we haven't

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.479 
add in loads more pace which we haven't
really<00:03:43.379> seen<00:03:43.530> he's<00:03:43.680> an<00:03:43.769> upgrade<00:03:44.069> or<00:03:44.189> novice

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
really seen he's an upgrade or novice

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:45.890 
really seen he's an upgrade or novice
for<00:03:44.699> me<00:03:44.759> straight<00:03:45.060> away<00:03:45.239> even<00:03:45.449> though<00:03:45.840> he

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
for me straight away even though he

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.089 
for me straight away even though he
plays<00:03:46.079> on<00:03:46.229> the<00:03:46.290> other<00:03:46.439> side<00:03:46.620> so<00:03:46.859> it<00:03:46.919> could<00:03:47.069> be

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
plays on the other side so it could be

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.520 
plays on the other side so it could be
Pedro<00:03:47.909> on<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.180> left<00:03:48.419> throwing<00:03:49.290> down<00:03:49.409> the

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
Pedro on the left throwing down the

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.740 
Pedro on the left throwing down the
right<00:03:49.799> silver<00:03:50.310> in<00:03:50.459> behind<00:03:50.729> agüero<00:03:51.120> that<00:03:51.569> gives

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
right silver in behind agüero that gives

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.039 
right silver in behind agüero that gives
us<00:03:51.870> a<00:03:52.159> whole<00:03:53.159> new<00:03:53.189> option<00:03:53.879> going<00:03:54.479> forward<00:03:54.599> and

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
us a whole new option going forward and

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.689 
us a whole new option going forward and
I<00:03:55.109> think<00:03:55.319> it's<00:03:55.439> quite<00:03:55.530> an<00:03:55.709> exciting<00:03:56.009> one<00:03:56.280> the

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:56.699 
I think it's quite an exciting one the

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:58.520 
I think it's quite an exciting one the
papers<00:03:57.209> as<00:03:57.299> well<00:03:57.419> saying<00:03:57.719> at<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.900> 18<00:03:58.229> million

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
papers as well saying at the 18 million

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.920 
papers as well saying at the 18 million
pounds<00:03:58.859> which<00:03:59.579> doesn't<00:03:59.879> seem<00:04:00.030> too<00:04:00.209> much<00:04:00.389> for<00:04:00.719> a

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
pounds which doesn't seem too much for a

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.649 
pounds which doesn't seem too much for a
really<00:04:01.290> really<00:04:01.319> good<00:04:01.680> player<00:04:01.949> but<00:04:02.699> Liverpool

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 
really really good player but Liverpool

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:05.330 
really really good player but Liverpool
seem<00:04:03.840> to<00:04:03.930> be<00:04:04.049> signing<00:04:04.680> everyone<00:04:05.069> and<00:04:05.189> quite

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
seem to be signing everyone and quite

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.429 
seem to be signing everyone and quite
quickly<00:04:05.489> so<00:04:05.759> I<00:04:06.180> don't<00:04:06.840> know<00:04:06.930> where<00:04:07.079> that<00:04:07.229> will

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439 
quickly so I don't know where that will

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:07.610 
quickly so I don't know where that will
go

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
go

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.890 
go
not<00:04:07.979> too<00:04:08.310> many<00:04:08.430> sources<00:04:09.150> are<00:04:09.389> reporting<00:04:09.479> it

not throwing a hat the ring for this one

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:29.960 
not throwing a hat the ring for this one
it's<00:04:29.159> been<00:04:29.310> brilliant<00:04:29.490> with<00:04:29.789> Southampton

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
it's been brilliant with Southampton

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.029 
it's been brilliant with Southampton
absolutely<00:04:30.780> brilliant<00:04:31.169> i<00:04:31.229> think<00:04:31.439> he's<00:04:31.770> that

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
absolutely brilliant i think he's that

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.040 
absolutely brilliant i think he's that
the<00:04:32.340> player<00:04:32.550> that<00:04:32.759> if<00:04:32.849> they<00:04:33.030> lose<00:04:33.300> will<00:04:33.930> have

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
the player that if they lose will have

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.600 
the player that if they lose will have
the<00:04:34.139> biggest<00:04:34.409> impact<00:04:34.560> on<00:04:34.979> them<00:04:35.159> he<00:04:35.520> was

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
the biggest impact on them he was

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.240 
the biggest impact on them he was
brilliant<00:04:35.789> last<00:04:36.060> season<00:04:36.389> he's<00:04:36.479> only<00:04:36.750> 25<00:04:37.500> but<00:04:38.189> I

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
brilliant last season he's only 25 but I

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.559 
brilliant last season he's only 25 but I
think<00:04:38.430> he'd<00:04:38.580> be<00:04:38.699> a<00:04:38.729> great<00:04:39.120> option<00:04:39.300> in<00:04:39.509> the

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:39.569 
think he'd be a great option in the

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:40.879 
think he'd be a great option in the
