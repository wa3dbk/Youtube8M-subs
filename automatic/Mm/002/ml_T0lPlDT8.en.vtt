the time when they fill up so you know
that's<00:00:26.130> nothing<00:00:26.340> but<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.670> pain<00:00:26.880> in<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.060> ass<00:00:27.300> so

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.020 
that's nothing but a pain in the ass so
um<00:00:27.990> hooked<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.710> couple<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.070> hoses<00:00:29.490> up<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.850> him

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.030 
um hooked a couple of hoses up to him

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.119 
um hooked a couple of hoses up to him
and<00:00:30.150> drained<00:00:30.870> them<00:00:31.020> into<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.289> condensate<00:00:31.830> pump

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.129 
and drained them into a condensate pump

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:34.190 
and drained them into a condensate pump
and<00:00:32.910> then<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.150> condensate<00:00:33.570> pump<00:00:33.840> will<00:00:33.960> just

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
and then the condensate pump will just

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.990 
and then the condensate pump will just
drain<00:00:34.470> out<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.710> condensate<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.520> just<00:00:35.790> dumps

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
drain out the condensate it just dumps

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.720 
drain out the condensate it just dumps
right<00:00:36.239> outside<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.690> wall<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.140> house

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
right outside the wall of the house

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.860 
right outside the wall of the house
there's<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.820> couple<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.180> ways<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.480> could've<00:00:39.750> did

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
there's a couple of ways I could've did

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.930 
there's a couple of ways I could've did
it<00:00:40.050> usually<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.650> like<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.949> dump<00:00:41.400> them<00:00:41.610> into<00:00:41.820> a

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
it usually I like to dump them into a

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.290 
it usually I like to dump them into a
drain<00:00:42.300> somewhere<00:00:42.809> in<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.050> house<00:00:43.400> but<00:00:44.400> seeing

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
drain somewhere in the house but seeing

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.450 
drain somewhere in the house but seeing
that<00:00:45.330> there<00:00:46.230> was<00:00:46.350> no<00:00:46.559> drain<00:00:46.920> down<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.400> the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
that there was no drain down in the

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.070 
that there was no drain down in the
basement<00:00:47.909> and<00:00:48.120> nothing<00:00:48.449> like<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.989> I

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
basement and nothing like that that I

over on here I'm going to bypass this

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:21.610 
over on here I'm going to bypass this

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.110 

well<00:03:22.620> some<00:03:22.920> of<00:03:23.069> the<00:03:23.129> dehumidifiers<00:03:23.819> don't

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
well some of the dehumidifiers don't

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.089 
well some of the dehumidifiers don't
have<00:03:24.329> tap<00:03:24.629> ins<00:03:24.870> where<00:03:25.379> you<00:03:25.500> can<00:03:25.650> tight<00:03:25.859> holes

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
have tap ins where you can tight holes

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:30.319 
have tap ins where you can tight holes
and<00:03:26.340> what<00:03:26.489> I<00:03:26.519> usually<00:03:26.760> do<00:03:27.180> is<00:03:27.420> I<00:03:29.150> get<00:03:30.150> this

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
and what I usually do is I get this

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.399 
and what I usually do is I get this
little<00:03:30.569> adapter<00:03:30.989> here<00:03:31.260> it's<00:03:32.129> 1/2<00:03:32.370> inch<00:03:33.019> IPS<00:03:34.019> by

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 
little adapter here it's 1/2 inch IPS by

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:36.679 
little adapter here it's 1/2 inch IPS by
holes<00:03:34.709> I<00:03:35.099> drill<00:03:35.700> a<00:03:35.730> hole<00:03:35.969> on<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.180> bottom<00:03:36.420> of

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:36.689 
holes I drill a hole on the bottom of

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:41.770 
holes I drill a hole on the bottom of
this<00:03:38.510> little<00:03:39.510> optical<00:03:40.319> connector<00:03:40.769> on<00:03:40.889> there

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
this little optical connector on there

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.839 
this little optical connector on there
all<00:03:42.780> right<00:03:43.079> drill<00:03:44.069> that<00:03:44.219> in<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.400> bottom<00:03:44.609> of

all right drill that in the bottom of
this<00:03:44.939> pan<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:45.689> put<00:03:46.139> this<00:03:46.260> thing<00:03:46.469> up<00:03:46.590> on<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:46.739> milk

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
this pan and put this thing up on a milk

this pan and put this thing up on a milk
crate<00:03:47.129> I've<00:03:47.849> done<00:03:48.060> that<00:03:48.209> a<00:03:48.239> couple<00:03:48.389> of<00:03:48.719> times

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
crate I've done that a couple of times

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.789 
crate I've done that a couple of times
you<00:03:51.629> know<00:03:51.750> then<00:03:52.109> when<00:03:52.200> you<00:03:52.319> tighten<00:03:52.530> it<00:03:52.680> up

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
you know then when you tighten it up

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.220 
you know then when you tighten it up
obviously<00:03:53.040> you<00:03:53.400> put<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.819> the<00:03:54.060> rubber<00:03:54.900> wash

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
obviously you put the the rubber wash

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.110 
obviously you put the the rubber wash
the<00:03:55.439> rubber<00:03:55.620> hose<00:03:55.859> wash<00:03:56.129> it<00:03:56.400> with<00:03:56.519> seal<00:03:56.849> right

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
the rubber hose wash it with seal right

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.009 
the rubber hose wash it with seal right
up<00:03:57.239> against<00:03:57.599> there<00:03:59.569> that's<00:04:00.569> another<00:04:00.780> way<00:04:00.989> of

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
up against there that's another way of

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.860 
up against there that's another way of
doing<00:04:01.139> it<00:04:01.879> but<00:04:02.879> if<00:04:03.000> you<00:04:03.120> do<00:04:03.269> that<00:04:03.419> you<00:04:03.659> got<00:04:03.780> to

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
doing it but if you do that you got to

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.330 
doing it but if you do that you got to
bring<00:04:03.989> it<00:04:04.139> and<00:04:04.439> put<00:04:04.590> it<00:04:04.680> up<00:04:04.769> on<00:04:04.889> a<00:04:04.919> milk<00:04:05.189> crate

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
bring it and put it up on a milk crate

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.250 
bring it and put it up on a milk crate
but<00:04:06.150> I<00:04:06.269> don't<00:04:06.419> need<00:04:06.540> that<00:04:06.780> here<00:04:06.989> with<00:04:07.109> these

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
but I don't need that here with these

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.629 
but I don't need that here with these
the<00:04:07.530> way<00:04:07.650> these<00:04:07.709> are<00:04:07.950> set<00:04:08.129> up<00:04:10.280> all<00:04:11.280> right<00:04:11.430> so<00:04:11.459> I

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639
