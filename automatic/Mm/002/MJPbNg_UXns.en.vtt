00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.580
 consider the types of breathing upper breathing 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.310
 only upper chest 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.890
 cells with such breathing lifted 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.780
 collarbone and shoulders 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.900
 swollen upper ribs diaphragm 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.730
 move very constrained and limited in 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.390
 light falls very small part 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.690
 air is the worst way of breathing so 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.340
 both wasted a lot of energy and 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.150
 in return, you practically do not get 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.150
 vitality 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.290
 this kind of breathing when sharply 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.580
 the chest of the rest of the body is rising 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.070
 remains motionless 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.820
 especially characteristic of women but 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.500
 many men suffer from this disadvantage 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.930
 average breathing is slightly better than 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:08.130
 upper breath but not enough 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.530
 well with average breathing work all 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.140
 ribs they move apart and chest and 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:17.100
 expands but the rest of the body 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:21.030
 still motionless external breathing 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.550
 better than upper mean but him too 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.280
 not enough 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:29.190
 although the one who breathes lower breathing 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.100
 undoubtedly much healthier than that 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.080
 who breathe the upper and middle at the bottom 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.720
 breath expands not so much chest 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.360
 how much the abdominal cavity while 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.150
 diaphragm lungs chest gets 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.680
 much more freedom light 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.420
 expand more 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.640
 and can absorb much more air 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.730
 than with upper and middle breathing it 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.030
 gives you the opportunity to learn and much 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.580
 more life energy 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.739
 full breath is a combination of all types 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.410
 respiration of the upper middle and lower 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:07.680
 it is at the same time breathing in all parts 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.250
 body with full breath we get 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.760
 maximum benefit 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.590
 applicable energy expended 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.170
 the diaphragm at the same time has complete freedom 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.810
 all muscles involved in breathing 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.640
 work in full force the chest 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.220
 freely expanding in all 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:27.280
 easy directions to the full 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.950
 fill with air if we even 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.860
 inhale not very much air but breathe 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.690
 with full breathing then the air is all 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.270
 equal will wash all lungs 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.060
 completely evenly distributed 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.640
 him and not giving rise to stagnation 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.800
 whereas with the upper middle and lower 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.150
 breath is filled with air only 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.350
 parts of the lungs 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.640
 and in the remaining parts stagnation 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.210
 full breathing is the most natural 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:57.640
 observe natural breathing 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.650
 and you'll see exactly what it breathes 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.650
 baby and animals
