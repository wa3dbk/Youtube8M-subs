00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.840
 Although, again, wonderful for football 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.400
 or other parties suitable we need 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.949
 for eggs milk butter cheese me 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.600
 recommend cellar probably without or 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.410
 Of course you can mozzarella as well 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.170
 others take 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.930
 garlic granules salt and pepper mail 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.950
 and ham from the ham gives 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.690
 I had it you can of course 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.050
 also buy slices or a piece and 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.930
 then cut yourself into a pot 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.870
 Let's add the milk you warm 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.579
 add the butter and heat for so long 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.039
 occasionally can also continue 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.879
 Stir until the butter is completely 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.309
 is melted 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.350
 then we switch off the stove plate and 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.830
 slowly add the flour well with the pot 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.619
 stir that in and then stir 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.710
 as long as we continue to at the end of a 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.020
 quite compact part came 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.340
 The dough is granted in a bowl 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.250
 Edit it with the whisk 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.920
 of the device and then insert individually and 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.659
 one by one the eggs are added on and on 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.820
 stir it and if that too 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.100
 fourth own is stirred in this case has 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.290
 about the consistency and color of 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.030
 porridge is now flavored with 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.960
 half a teaspoon of garlic 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:37.210
 granulate plenty of pepper and salt 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:41.320
 aftertaste again 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.270
 and then we give the cheese to the dough 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.740
 stir it is now suitable 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.600
 but a spoon is better for it 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.670
 the cheese a stir we proceed to 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.940
 ham as well as this too 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.470
 give and stir 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.570
 this is the dough ready we insert 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.830
 Baking tray with baking paper I take 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.630
 reusable but you can 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.030
 Of course, take normal and 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.220
 then portion it on the dough 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.380
 a little distance so each one very 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.149
 helped tablespoon of dough on top 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.820
 Baking paper gave me it was on 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.640
 end exactly 19 dough portions and then 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:19.450
 everything comes in the oven and that at 180 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.160
 degrees around 170 degrees for 20 to 25 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.130
 minutes depending on how dark yes you are 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.380
 want to have and I just like this 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.090
 Coloring is best I think it works 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.560
 one already looking at the water in the 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.570
 mouth together I'm not exaggerating 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.790
 really delicious 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.470
 I wish you a lot of fun with the 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.730
 preparation and then quite good appetite 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.470
 But you have another network 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.900
 For example, it is better to have spicy ones 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.850
 chickpeas or pizza poppers 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.600
 then just have a look 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.280
 videos into it 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.870
 I still have to say until the 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.870
 next time
