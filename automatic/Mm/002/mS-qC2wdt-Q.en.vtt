 red carpet

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.350
 know Belgians Berlin sealed off to 90 percent with Dr Berlin 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.930
 because you can almost 100 percent 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.129
 fly with Air Berlin that's the great 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.540
 SGD like for example morning at 9:30 am energy at 10 o'clock to Zurich 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.130
 both sides are very good service 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.190
 and because the price is right 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.069
 also important points 

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:04.350
 I am very satisfied let us know and what you want more than 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.210
 Customer Sabine Christiansen has been flying in Berlin for years 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.690
 how did that happen 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.460
 it is so i actually came to Mallorca when i came to 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.180
 the first on the body that was a long time ago 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.289
 Always there 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.289

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.390
 Today, everything is always with Air Berlin also refers the world to the 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.390
 oldest and hardest goal best 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.160
 We could not afford investors for Berlin and with one 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.310
 reliable carrier 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.240
 the son and superfund had written history in the past 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.909
 the law will make it even better. "That's bad in the end 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.510
 and Congratulations Air Berlin to this great success her guest 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:47.660
 at night 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.060
 Chancellor Angela Merkel 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.060
 best mood also with her 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.090
 The German Chancellor can barely visit a company 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.600
 without being confronted with billions of people 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.040
 That's why she has to be honored Chancellor 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.330
 but especially relaxing to attend a corporate event today 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.690
 the CD Dom guarantees are still to be asked for subsidies 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:20.150
 Klaus Wowereit reminded everyone how proud they are, it's a proud anniversary 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.689
 Air Berlin can be proud and he is very proud of her work 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:29.099
 launched Chancellor shone with expertise and wit 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.589
 A success-story 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:32.339
 the most possible 

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:34.559
 because Helmut Krenek 

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:37.939
 the today 1 s 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:40.119
 gave in her money 

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:42.669
 for a city at a time 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:44.209
 in the 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.789
 had an island location 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:48.189
 the others often 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:50.049
 from East and West 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.569
 so called 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.919
 the dream island in the red sea 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:57.249
 that was stupid east term for west berlin 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:02:58.459
 and 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.459
 consequently 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.449
 consequently 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:11.980
 a topic he did not hand was the first flight as well 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.099
 from Berlin-Tegel to Palma de Mallorca 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.580
 in the time of the cold war the war is a good internet connection 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.089
 However, then it quickly became clear Baris still many 

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:25.459
 Single interests there so a few 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.099
 we were one 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:32.779
 I may also say that we that thing is cool concept and I completely 

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:33.959
 especially 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.269
 Support they advanced at the German Esther society 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:38.249
 brought 

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:41.829
 as always it's about possessions rum around certain things but it is 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.449
 completely correct that with the climate protection Ernst means the first must 

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:48.359
 the flight routes so that they are as speedy as possible and Scrat the 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.239
 not and do not care about any responsibilities 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.069
 I promise you that we will do everything we can to achieve that 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.569
 the constitutional amendment in this legislative period still get done and 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.569
 in order to 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.459
 a lot of health the passion 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.279
