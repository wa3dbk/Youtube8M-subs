 video where as it has already done it 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.510
 really a tradition we're going to be 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.580
 giving very quickly and briefly the 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.929
 results of the mount in day 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.279
 today March 11, 2013 but 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.440
 go into matter as you always know 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.640
 the little job in the little box 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.810
 descriptions tammy lynn follow 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.480
 subscribing if they have passed the channel 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.519
 continues to shrink, like and well 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.420
 Ladies and gentlemen, let's go crazy 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:31.670
 happened today in the rock of the day the 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.660
 first the raw night mold of the day 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.370
 today speak opens precisely with a 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.370
 tribute to power who we know that 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.899
 he died in the in the week and that 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.629
 really what better way than 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.879
 was there the the where taker 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.579
 doing a little tribute to pappo 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.100
 see if he uses a little history 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.770
 of the angle to put a little flavor 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.260
 to the rivalry between pong and the where 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.199
 taker who well or obviously is 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.000
 pong who goes out to interrupt the 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.370
 ceremony where he wants you in the ring 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.880
 and then appears cane 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.370
 who attacks the very same time and then 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.220
 this is what is agreed to be the 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.860
 today's stellar main event 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.909
 then we have a fight the big show 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.609
 facing set bowling 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.789
 in the fight you really are nothing of the 

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:27.189
 another world really this vision process 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:29.710
 he takes it by disqualification and 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:33.130
 then he is assaulted backstage by 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.950
 the by the members of the shield and 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.439
 well this is obviously going to lead to a 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.429
 rivalry seems towards summary already 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:44.079
 putting together vision tips and randy orton 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:46.179
 I'm really not a fan of this but 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:48.310
 Well , that's what we have after 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:51.429
 let's go to the next fight that is dolph 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.310
 ziggler who who faced a 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:56.020
 of one of the half of the 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.670
 champions in pairs daniel bryan 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.469
 really one of the best fights of 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.110
 the night finally has a victory 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:04.209
 after doing a lot of time in modena 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.149
 in rotor sígler of the best of the 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:10.420
 let's go to what follows we have 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.340
 another alleged appearance of this guy 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.129
 fandango who would face 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.739
 tense and does not the same pull of 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:19.959
 two weeks ago let's go to what follows 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.910
 we have one we had a fight where 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.319
 really the new age out I'm going 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.160
 to be facing the robots 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.810
 school children 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.410
 there really is no fight 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:33.150
 in a test since it appears proposed and 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:36.459
 it ends up destroying the ex 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.560
 generation next world out and bars 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.349
 biblical and can be is the very same 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.510
 progress energy com combed expecting 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:47.910
 who accepts the triple h challenge for 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:50.920
 summary and number 29 just then 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.709
 says he is going to choose the stipulation 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.560
 of the fight we are going to see where we are 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.180
 take this the next two fights 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.819
 because they really are procedural fights 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.060
 mark henry defeat kofi kingston the 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:07.569
 next ryback smashes hitler and 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.120
 Well apparently this is the double w already 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.310
 the best goes wants in that direction mark 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.340
 henry against rival possibly in reason 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.700
 came the problem is that double w the 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.680
 I messed up in the booking since then mark 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.840
 my against ryback the truth is a fight 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.049
 worthy of a payment per event and therefore 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.530
 they had the great idea of ​​putting it in 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:31.750
 smackdown for this week but good 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.560
 let what if the champion 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.010
 heavy weights 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.680
 of the river once again defeats the champion 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.630
 of the us census antonio I go back to 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.540
 repeat the same thing that I said in the video of 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.150
 last week what a desire to do 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.670
 lose and lose the champion of the usa 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.849
 who does not really give one since it seems 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.920
 elimination chamber losing with of my 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.650
 losing with Alberto of the river losing 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.750
 with randy orton with ryback bad booking or 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.880
 I do not know where this is going, not after 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.890
 we have a randy orton fight and 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.840
 seamus facing the team the 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:09.790
 steelers the first ones take the fight 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.190
 and obviously afterwards they are attacked by 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.080
 the shield and well, this really 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.109
 I think it already makes it very clear where 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.910
 goes the double w in this respect not and 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:23.330
 then we have a 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.980
 an intervention in the segment of 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.590
 interviews of cristian and with call of 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:31.200
 haile crew where your 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.450
 guest is the one really one of the 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.600
 worst highlights in the story not 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.190
 they did nothing more than talk about the 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.490
 movies that have just starred 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.780
 this simply served to 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.960
 make promotion to movies 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.730
 really the double w is lost in 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.770
 the immensity does not have the slightest bitch 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.920
 idea of what to do with webber and this is 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.140
 the perfect example remember that of the 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.940
 nothing took away the title with kingston 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.590
 then they put a fight against 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.520
 a rivalry like dallas did not lead to 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.800
 nowhere 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.540
 then they apparently put it with a 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.760
 rivalry with james that is also not going to 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.920
 nowhere and now apparently from the 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.320
 nothing goes in a mess with the mici chris 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.200
 jericho since then bratman appeared to 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.210
 lux and said they are going to face jericho 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.850
 and the mix and the winner will face 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.220
 white see next week end in a 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.889
 new context such that it stays that 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.169
 well 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:27.060
 there's going to be a triple threat for the 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:30.150
 intercontinental title next 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:33.150
 This is a clear clear indication of 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.460
 that the double w does not have the slightest idea of 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.439
 what to do neither with yericó nor with the mix 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.810
 who was supposed to be after the 

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:41.430
 championship of the usa contras state ni 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.319
 with web art or with the title 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.520
 intercontinental and this really is a 

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:49.020
 sorry after jack swagger you really 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.419
 following his charter with Alberto del Río 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.009
 defeat without problems to faceless and 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:56.129
 then we go to what would come 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:59.069
 being the main event the champion a 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:06:01.560
 half of the champions in pairs that 

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:03.000
 take the victory with over 100 put 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.039
 here I really think that the booking was 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.699
 right obviously who gets the 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:11.279
 victory as a tribute to return this 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:13.889
 I really liked but it's time who 

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:16.469
 well he recovers after a day 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:19.800
 care and those who are posing in tribute 

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:22.789
 to have and then little recovers hits 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:26.009
 kane with the urn and you really 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:28.430
 the booking was good or with pierre 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:30.560
 d for the tribute to Paul to see but 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.330
 it ends up going strong with the hand in 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.520
 high after attacking who with the 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.650
 urn then that's how the world ends 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.600
 Today's raw raw really a 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.340
 modem inside that well I also think that 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.790
 Luchistic mind speaking left a lot 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.680
 to wish 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:45.380
 taking into account especially that 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:48.140
 we are twenty-three days of summary 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:51.410
 already 29 and then really half of the 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:53.270
 roster does not have stories for fights 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.460
 sure they add and that really is a 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.260
 shame but good keep writing follow 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:01.510
 passing the channel keep checking them 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.510
 like we are watching biker
