00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.850
 hello let's see how to make this mane 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.450
 layers 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:17.980
 first let's take 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.539
 lower part of the neck a section 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.119
 final 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.119
 what is going to be our table days 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.190
 we take 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.309
 from the middle area 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:42.820
 and we are going to make the cut to the length 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:47.289
 that we want and then we will join the 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:51.059
 laterals placing the straight hand since 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:51.059
 what we want is a mane 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.510
 another section 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.550
 and by the wick to the day that we have below 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:10.700
 we just have to follow the cut 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.700
 and so we will do the whole back 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.760
 and for the pin and we have going down 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.640
 also in sections taking a 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.640
 small part of what we have already cut 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.700
 to follow the length in the part of 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.030
 ahead 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.190
 and so we will do the two sides of the 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.190
 words 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.190
 but 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.240
 once we have all the long 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.540
 cut 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.820
 we take in the highest part a small 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.240
 section that will mark us the most layer 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.240
 force 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.660
 sections on all the lengths of the 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.880
 back to join as much as 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.750
 short that we have cut in the part 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.590
 superior with the longest of the length 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.590
 of the mane 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.010
 in this case we will go taking the section 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.370
 and placing your hands perpendicular to your 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.370
 Bank 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.190
 in distilled form we will already get 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.190
 breathe a bit that tip 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.069
 and having that 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.230
 As they would throw me out we are going to do 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.230
 all the back 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.570
 but 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:03.330
 to move on to do the same 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.819
 in the zone of the sideburns we are going to take 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.840
 the first wick we had made of 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.960
 the shortest layer to join it all the 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.590
 front part 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:19.390
 also in straight perpendicular to the base 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.610
 and we have 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.459
 the shortest length in that part 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:28.950
 front to continue with what we had 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.950
 cut in the back 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.600
 lorraine already had a fringe that 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:39.560
 I was letting grow earlier 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.860
 so let's take 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.260
 one length the shortest because we're going to 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.959
 make an ice cream price once 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.650
 marked helping us with what I already had 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:54.160
 her shorter we're going to catch what 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.350
 it would be the area of the bangs 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.440
 and as already explained in other 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:03.520
 videos we are going to bring everything to where it is 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:06.010
 the shortest wick of the fringe to go 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.370
 cutting and that we have a fringe of 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.370
 side 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.350
 and then we will unite what we have cut 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:32.370
 of the fringe with the parade until the 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:32.370
 length of the leg so both sides 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:41.979
 ah 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.849
 we begin to dry the hair removing 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.009
 well fine humidity 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:49.459
 in your case as that of volume I have 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:52.999
 applied first a spray to give 

00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:54.499
 volume in the root zone once 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:57.020
 that we have removed enough moisture 

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:58.520
 we started to work the hair myself 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.300
 this case started by the zone of 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:05.779
 bangs the area in front and I'll go 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:08.070
 marking the entire area of ​​the bangs and 

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:10.800
 the pins forward 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:14.430
 and then the whole back and of 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.520
 marking the tips a little bit so that 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.770
 I may be a little disheveled 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.880
 then you choose the final effect 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:25.330
 that you want to leave it 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.330
 disheveled 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:36.620
 the dictates down 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:36.620
 I hope you liked it until soon
