00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
huh but if you ever ask yourself if UFOs

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.409 
huh but if you ever ask yourself if UFOs
exist<00:04:29.979> how<00:04:30.460> come<00:04:30.639> we<00:04:30.729> don't<00:04:30.819> see<00:04:30.939> them<00:04:31.270> more

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
exist how come we don't see them more

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.219 
exist how come we don't see them more
often<00:04:31.629> mm-hmm<00:04:32.409> poaching<00:04:33.810> there's<00:04:34.810> there's<00:04:35.110> my

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
often mm-hmm poaching there's there's my

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:36.990 
often mm-hmm poaching there's there's my
theory<00:04:35.469> about<00:04:35.560> UFOs<00:04:36.069> is<00:04:36.250> that<00:04:36.370> they<00:04:36.460> do<00:04:36.520> exist

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
theory about UFOs is that they do exist

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.670 
theory about UFOs is that they do exist
but<00:04:37.539> they<00:04:37.599> do<00:04:37.750> come<00:04:38.110> from<00:04:38.139> other<00:04:38.469> dimensions

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
but they do come from other dimensions

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.140 
but they do come from other dimensions
so<00:04:39.189> as<00:04:39.280> soon<00:04:39.370> as<00:04:39.430> they<00:04:39.639> do<00:04:39.699> what<00:04:39.939> they're<00:04:40.060> going

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
so as soon as they do what they're going

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.300 
so as soon as they do what they're going
to<00:04:40.210> do<00:04:40.389> here<00:04:40.659> they<00:04:41.080> disappear<00:04:41.590> into<00:04:41.680> back<00:04:42.039> into

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
to do here they disappear into back into

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.649 
to do here they disappear into back into
another<00:04:42.520> dimension<00:04:42.669> that's<00:04:43.300> why<00:04:43.479> they're

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:43.659 
another dimension that's why they're

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:45.360 
another dimension that's why they're
never<00:04:43.810> seen<00:04:44.139> for<00:04:44.409> very<00:04:44.560> long<00:04:44.770> because<00:04:45.069> they're

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
never seen for very long because they're

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.249 
never seen for very long because they're
in<00:04:45.550> and<00:04:45.669> out<00:04:45.759> real<00:04:46.000> quick<00:04:46.240> it<00:04:46.990> can't<00:04:47.199> be

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:47.259 
in and out real quick it can't be

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:48.749 
in and out real quick it can't be
tracked<00:04:47.590> on<00:04:47.800> radar<00:04:47.860> or<00:04:48.370> anything<00:04:48.639> else

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:48.759 
tracked on radar or anything else

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:51.029 
tracked on radar or anything else
exactly<00:04:49.360> my<00:04:49.509> theory<00:04:49.810> and<00:04:50.020> I<00:04:50.710> mean<00:04:50.860> when<00:04:50.949> they

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
exactly my theory and I mean when they

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:52.499 
exactly my theory and I mean when they
visit<00:04:51.400> me<00:04:51.639> at<00:04:51.879> least<00:04:52.030> that's<00:04:52.150> what<00:04:52.240> they<00:04:52.360> tell

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509 
visit me at least that's what they tell

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:53.640 
visit me at least that's what they tell
me<00:04:52.569> they<00:04:52.780> say<00:04:52.900> Len<00:04:53.110> we<00:04:53.169> only<00:04:53.289> got<00:04:53.379> a<00:04:53.439> few

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
me they say Len we only got a few

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.559 
me they say Len we only got a few
minutes<00:04:53.770> and<00:04:54.129> that<00:04:54.400> that's<00:04:55.090> Steven<00:04:55.419> we'll

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:55.569 
minutes and that that's Steven we'll

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:57.059 
minutes and that that's Steven we'll
have<00:04:55.689> a<00:04:55.719> readout<00:04:55.930> you<00:04:56.349> know<00:04:56.500> that<00:04:56.710> we<00:04:56.800> want

00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:57.069 
have a readout you know that we want

00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:58.740 
have a readout you know that we want
that<00:04:57.099> Steven<00:04:57.490> Wright<00:04:57.610> album<00:04:57.909> and<00:04:58.060> that<00:04:58.180> bill

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
that Steven Wright album and that bill

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.290 
that Steven Wright album and that bill
hicks<00:04:58.960> album<00:04:59.289> don't<00:04:59.800> know<00:04:59.860> right<00:05:00.180> and<00:05:01.180> we're

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
hicks album don't know right and we're

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.219 
hicks album don't know right and we're
going<00:05:01.449> right<00:05:01.569> back<00:05:01.689> into<00:05:01.930> the<00:05:02.110> other

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
going right back into the other
