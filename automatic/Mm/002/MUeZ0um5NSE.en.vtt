00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.369
 they are waiting for me very well 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:16.049
 sound we keep a new video and good 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:17.699
 friends today I bring you a click 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.429
 that is completely new in 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.890
 cydia and well this is called simple passes 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:25.109
 code buttons which is a click 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.519
 applies to what is the screen 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.900
 locking your device 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.099
 once you download it you will be 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.349
 will leave a small tab 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.009
 configuration what is your application of 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.300
 settings 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.670
 let's go here on the tab 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.010
 configuration of this click 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.350
 as you can see here has here is that 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.290
 tweet as you can see simple peace with 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.570
 buttons and then we have that I still do not want 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.610
 I have activated only that I do not have 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.980
 activators the two options as they can 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.890
 see here in give us two options that 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.480
 we have we can put in this tweet and 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.660
 Well, these options are just very 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.680
 simple if you have some kind of 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.140
 password on your device at the time 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.550
 to unlock as this purpose works 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.189
 for that here as can be measured to 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.229
 height letter or we can hide what 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.750
 which are the letters and we can also 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.970
 hide in this case this one 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.430
 in the option to hide the letters and 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.680
 the numbers here the text let's see 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.380
 how this click works 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.830
 we slide and as you can see there we have 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.530
 what it is then this would be is to put 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.240
 the security code but now as 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.250
 you can see it no longer appears 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.170
 blank the pure circles and then this 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.270
 It would be a good option to have 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.670
 device a little more protected by 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.590
 so to say if we avoid this part of 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.300
 up here we can see that I made the hi 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.340
 letters that is only going us 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.570
 hide what the letters are but if 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.240
 we will see what are the 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.160
 numbers as you can see there is maybe 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.770
 I did not notice much of the difference but now 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.770
 I 'm going to show you how is this tweet 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.320
 by default there we again block the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.520
 device and we put back and then 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.920
 this is the effect that the 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.630
 device is by default and then as 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.820
 I like it is a click you can have on 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.680
 your device something like that say like a 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.690
 type up a little more a little 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.970
 more reliable and well as I tell you this is 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.259
 a completely new one in cydia and 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.730
 good as you can see this is a tweet 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.860
 which can be very useful for you 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.620
 device this switch is compatible 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.330
 for iphone and for ipad is not compatible 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.370
 for ipad so do not download it if 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.900

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.000
