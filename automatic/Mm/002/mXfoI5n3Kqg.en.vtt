today I'm going to show you how to
replace<00:00:01.230> the<00:00:01.290> hard<00:00:01.650> drive<00:00:01.979> in<00:00:02.129> your<00:00:02.250> macbook

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
replace the hard drive in your macbook

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.730 
replace the hard drive in your macbook
pro<00:00:02.939> you<00:00:03.419> have<00:00:03.540> two<00:00:03.750> options<00:00:03.959> one<00:00:04.470> is<00:00:04.560> you<00:00:04.650> can

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
pro you have two options one is you can

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.470 
pro you have two options one is you can
keep<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:05.009> same<00:00:05.250> type<00:00:05.609> of<00:00:05.640> hard<00:00:06.089> drive<00:00:06.299> that's

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
keep the same type of hard drive that's

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.089 
keep the same type of hard drive that's
in<00:00:06.660> there<00:00:06.810> now<00:00:07.020> and<00:00:07.319> just<00:00:07.500> increase<00:00:07.919> the

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
in there now and just increase the

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.980 
in there now and just increase the
capacity<00:00:08.670> of<00:00:08.790> it<00:00:08.940> this<00:00:09.389> is<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.599> cheaper

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
capacity of it this is the cheaper

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.470 
capacity of it this is the cheaper
option<00:00:10.019> or<00:00:10.620> you<00:00:10.800> can<00:00:10.950> upgrade<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.400> an<00:00:11.519> SSD<00:00:11.849> or<00:00:12.210> a

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
option or you can upgrade to an SSD or a

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.959 
option or you can upgrade to an SSD or a
solid-state<00:00:13.349> drive<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:14.099> SSDs<00:00:14.700> are<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.849> little

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
solid-state drive the SSDs are a little

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.550 
solid-state drive the SSDs are a little
bit<00:00:15.120> more<00:00:15.150> expensive<00:00:15.630> but<00:00:16.049> your<00:00:16.170> computer

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
bit more expensive but your computer

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.500 
bit more expensive but your computer
will<00:00:16.680> boot<00:00:16.830> in<00:00:16.949> half<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.310> time<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:18.090> programs

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
will boot in half the time the programs

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.269 
will boot in half the time the programs
will<00:00:18.720> load<00:00:18.869> faster<00:00:18.900> there's<00:00:19.710> no<00:00:19.890> moving<00:00:20.130> parts

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
will load faster there's no moving parts

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.670 
will load faster there's no moving parts
so<00:00:20.789> your<00:00:21.090> battery<00:00:21.539> will<00:00:21.810> last<00:00:21.840> longer<00:00:22.320> inside

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
so your battery will last longer inside

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.740 
so your battery will last longer inside
of<00:00:22.800> your<00:00:22.920> laptop<00:00:23.010> they<00:00:23.970> run<00:00:24.180> cooler<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.689> they

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
of your laptop they run cooler and they

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.720 
of your laptop they run cooler and they
also<00:00:24.900> run<00:00:25.170> quieter<00:00:25.680> but<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.130> will<00:00:26.310> link<00:00:26.490> both

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
also run quieter but I will link both

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.710 
also run quieter but I will link both

of<00:00:50.190> them<00:00:50.309> do<00:00:50.399> about<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.700> same<00:00:50.879> thing<00:00:51.090> just

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
of them do about the same thing just

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.510 
of them do about the same thing just
download<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.020> program<00:00:52.230> plug<00:00:53.010> your<00:00:53.160> new<00:00:53.280> hard

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520

below<00:01:06.119> as<00:01:06.240> well<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.840> let's<00:01:06.990> get<00:01:07.110> started

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
below as well so let's get started

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.960 
below as well so let's get started
remember<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.070> open<00:01:08.340> your<00:01:08.460> macbook<00:01:08.790> pro

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
remember that you open your macbook pro

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.820 
remember that you open your macbook pro
at<00:01:09.119> your<00:01:09.240> own<00:01:09.330> risk<00:01:09.510> there<00:01:10.170> are<00:01:10.290> 10<00:01:10.500> Phillips

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
at your own risk there are 10 Phillips

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.530 
at your own risk there are 10 Phillips
head<00:01:10.979> screws<00:01:11.280> located<00:01:11.820> around<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.090> back<00:01:12.299> edge

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
head screws located around the back edge

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.179 
head screws located around the back edge
of<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> computer<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.439> unscrew<00:01:13.770> all<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:14.040> those

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189
