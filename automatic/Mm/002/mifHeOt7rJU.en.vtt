00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 Well, in Kiev as in the west 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.779
 happening in Donetsk and its suburbs 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.580
 as if they donâ€™t notice much more active 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.650
 discuss the nightmarish Mariupol 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.139
 groundlessly accusing events 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.780
 shelling of the city of Russia, the United States and the European Union 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.490
 immediately began talking about tightening sanctions 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.740
 against our country security council 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.380
 he is going to an extraordinary meeting 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.390
 as the post would betray the son while not 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.310
 a single fact in favor of the Kiev version 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.130
 Moreover, there are details proving 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.109
 reverse our reporter Alexei Nikolaev 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.480
 monitors the situation as alexei 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.730
 a colleague's investigation is underway 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.290
 we know it is not even conclusions but only 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.940
 guess since Mariupol 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.100
 is under Ukrainian control 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.989
 silovik and all Russian attempts 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.750
 journalists to drive there is no success 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.850
 crowned as I remember the militia I 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.440
 proving their innocence to the shelling 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.420
 my fields were talking about what they were 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.340
 based in Novoazovsk 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.230
 Yes, if on the road it turns out somewhere 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.610
 forty six kilometers from group a 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.579
 you can explain this distance 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.710
 enough to get from there to Mariupol 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.600
 hail for example judging by the data from 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.640
 there are no open sources but some 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.590
 assumptions who may be implicated in 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.900
 this creepy story can be made here from 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.030
 of these video frames made by Ukrainian 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.860
 by journalists 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:21.140
 it was supposed to be another reportage with 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:21.140
 front of the frame of shelling destroyed homes 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.630
 and to death the frightened inhabitants who 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.310
 miraculously survived 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.270
 I was left without an apartment without a car 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.770
 I together in the shower and that's to say in 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.299
 some point in the lens of the local 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.280
 the TV company hits a man in 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.259
 camouflage with stripes and volunteer 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.250
 battalion of azov whose correspondent 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:44.200
 same wondered what happened a 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.640
 Mafai Samokhin dimly saw military 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.069
 which no again speaks no russian 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.819
 not Ukrainian lam asked not 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:50.590
 take a face 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:52.360
 and his comrade armed not only 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.580
 machine video camera fixes me 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.030
 what is happening and generally prefers 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.130
 be silent 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.319
 mercenary short phrase translators 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.420
 will define as american english a 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.880
 blogs one of the fighters and learns how 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.500
 Nazis from the United Kingdom Chris Swamp 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.200
 working with military units 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.269
 states is really an appearance 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.860
 foreigners in the city is very strange 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.780
 coincidence but the militia before 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.160
 found the bodies of foreign mercenaries 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.660
 armament something really hard 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.910
 call a simple coincidence 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.500
 like this new statement by western leaders 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.290
 that Russia needs to be strengthened 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.079
 pressure and introduce new sanctions where already 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.850
 so what else can be banned but 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.350
 hut obama has already threatened to shut off 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.720
 Russia from the international payment system 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.790
 draining 6 trillion dollars a day through 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.470
 it passes and that's if it's a trip 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.600
 what experts say will happen 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.980
 this may be the last drop in 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.840
 relations Russia and the United States 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.760
 but I donâ€™t think honestly that before 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.010
 thanks Alexey Alexey Nikolaev 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.230
 about new data shelling in Mariupol and 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.440
 new threats of the west against russia 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.440
 thank
