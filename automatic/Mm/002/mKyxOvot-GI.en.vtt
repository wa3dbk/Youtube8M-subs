00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
the prior game but what it ultimately

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.880 
the prior game but what it ultimately
did<00:03:26.210> was<00:03:26.450> cause<00:03:26.660> players<00:03:27.020> to<00:03:27.230> focus<00:03:27.590> more<00:03:27.860> on

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
acquiring them from playing now Jay went

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.550 
acquiring them from playing now Jay went
on<00:03:32.150> to<00:03:32.300> say<00:03:32.480> that<00:03:32.690> if<00:03:32.810> they<00:03:32.960> could<00:03:33.140> remove<00:03:33.380> the

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
that simple they're just not sure with

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.380 
that simple they're just not sure with
the<00:03:36.890> current<00:03:37.190> player<00:03:37.489> base<00:03:37.700> how<00:03:37.940> many<00:03:38.120> people
