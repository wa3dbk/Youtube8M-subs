00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
guitar for this one so here's here we go

00:01:41.429 --> 00:02:21.680 
guitar for this one so here's here we go
a<00:01:48.349> little<00:01:49.349> piano

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.090 

another<00:02:22.690> super<00:02:23.080> cool<00:02:23.230> feature<00:02:23.470> of<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.770> gr-55

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
another super cool feature of the gr-55

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.460 
another super cool feature of the gr-55
is<00:02:24.820> that<00:02:25.090> it<00:02:25.210> allows<00:02:25.450> you<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.870> tune<00:02:26.140> each

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
is that it allows you to tune each

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.380 
is that it allows you to tune each
string<00:02:26.890> individually<00:02:27.250> up<00:02:27.820> or<00:02:28.030> down<00:02:28.180> two

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
string individually up or down two

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.740 
string individually up or down two
octaves<00:02:28.600> so<00:02:29.200> you<00:02:29.710> can<00:02:29.890> do<00:02:29.980> any<00:02:30.130> kind<00:02:30.370> of

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
octaves so you can do any kind of

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.690 
octaves so you can do any kind of
alternate<00:02:31.750> tuning<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:33.340> would<00:02:33.490> be

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
alternate tuning that would be

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.390 
alternate tuning that would be
impossible<00:02:34.000> to<00:02:34.330> do<00:02:34.590> if<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:35.740> physically<00:02:36.130> were

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
impossible to do if you physically were

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.920 
impossible to do if you physically were
you<00:02:36.670> know<00:02:36.760> tuning<00:02:37.360> your<00:02:37.480> strings<00:02:37.720> because

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
you know tuning your strings because

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.390 
you know tuning your strings because
when<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.260> start<00:02:38.470> tuning<00:02:38.740> it<00:02:38.830> up<00:02:38.890> you<00:02:39.130> know<00:02:39.250> two

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
when you start tuning it up you know two

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.590 
when you start tuning it up you know two
octaves<00:02:39.820> they're<00:02:39.940> probably<00:02:40.090> going<00:02:40.300> to<00:02:40.390> pop

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
octaves they're probably going to pop

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.290 
octaves they're probably going to pop
the<00:02:41.170> strength<00:02:41.500> which<00:02:42.100> is<00:02:42.280> unfortunate<00:02:43.090> but

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
the strength which is unfortunate but

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.590 
the strength which is unfortunate but
