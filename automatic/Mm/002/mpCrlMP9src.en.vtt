00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
couple of years but he's probably know

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.580 
couple of years but he's probably know
will<00:01:23.790> win<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.060> championship<00:01:24.600> as<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:25.530> know

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
will win the championship as you know

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.490 
will win the championship as you know
that<00:01:25.710> I'm<00:01:25.830> like<00:01:26.009> 10<00:01:26.310> 12<00:01:26.640> rallies<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.170> I<00:01:28.170> don't

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
that I'm like 10 12 rallies and I don't

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.530 
that I'm like 10 12 rallies and I don't
think<00:01:28.710> somehow<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.790> know<00:01:29.939> we<00:01:30.180> all<00:01:30.299> know<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.509> a

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
think somehow you know we all know is a

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.880 
think somehow you know we all know is a
great<00:01:30.780> driver<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.170> don't<00:01:31.380> think<00:01:31.590> he<00:01:31.680> can<00:01:31.860> win

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
great driver I don't think he can win

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.890 
great driver I don't think he can win
the<00:01:32.159> championship<00:01:32.759> by<00:01:33.180> only<00:01:33.360> doing<00:01:33.570> for

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
the championship by only doing for

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.410 
the championship by only doing for
rallies<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.009> does<00:01:35.159> look<00:01:35.369> like<00:01:35.400> oj<00:01:35.970> has<00:01:36.210> got

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
rallies so it does look like oj has got

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.510 
rallies so it does look like oj has got
a<00:01:36.450> massive<00:01:36.900> lead<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.680> championship<00:01:37.710> here

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
a massive lead in the championship here

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.700 
a massive lead in the championship here
as<00:01:38.700> he'll<00:01:39.119> probably<00:01:39.390> more<00:01:39.689> like<00:01:39.900> extend<00:01:40.500> this

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
as he'll probably more like extend this

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.670 
as he'll probably more like extend this
into<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.549> next<00:01:41.790> couple<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.150> rallies<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.680> yeah

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
into the next couple of rallies and yeah

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.980 
into the next couple of rallies and yeah
it's<00:01:43.860> looking<00:01:44.009> pretty<00:01:44.460> good<00:01:44.640> for<00:01:44.700> him<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.119> no

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
championship but still the Volkswagen is

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.040 
championship but still the Volkswagen is
looking<00:03:00.310> fast<00:03:00.610> it<00:03:01.180> does<00:03:01.450> look<00:03:01.690> like<00:03:01.720> they

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
looking fast it does look like they

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.170 
looking fast it does look like they
might<00:03:02.230> be<00:03:02.410> pretty<00:03:02.590> competitive<00:03:03.220> in<00:03:03.340> Mexico<00:03:03.880> so

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
might be pretty competitive in Mexico so

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.550 
might be pretty competitive in Mexico so
yeah<00:03:04.360> it's<00:03:04.870> looking<00:03:05.140> pretty<00:03:05.319> good<00:03:05.500> for

yeah it's looking pretty good for
Volkswagen<00:03:06.430> and<00:03:06.550> I<00:03:07.000> think<00:03:07.239> they're<00:03:07.360> going<00:03:07.510> to

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
Volkswagen and I think they're going to

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.479 
Volkswagen and I think they're going to
do<00:03:07.690> a<00:03:07.720> pretty<00:03:07.959> good<00:03:08.080> job<00:03:08.260> in<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.160> coming
