00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900 
okay so let's go to it what do you do

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.300 
okay so let's go to it what do you do
first<00:00:41.110> well<00:00:41.350> the<00:00:41.410> first<00:00:41.590> place<00:00:41.710> to<00:00:41.920> start<00:00:41.950> is

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.310 
first well the first place to start is

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.520 
first well the first place to start is
to<00:00:42.580> just<00:00:42.790> get<00:00:43.360> drape<00:00:43.780> the<00:00:43.930> tie<00:00:44.110> around<00:00:44.290> your

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
to just get drape the tie around your

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.900 
to just get drape the tie around your
neck<00:00:44.650> and<00:00:44.980> then<00:00:45.160> you<00:00:45.310> want<00:00:45.490> to<00:00:45.580> get<00:00:45.670> the<00:00:45.760> right

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
neck and then you want to get the right

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.510 
neck and then you want to get the right
size<00:00:46.630> so<00:00:47.350> that<00:00:47.500> the<00:00:47.560> wider<00:00:47.800> end<00:00:48.040> is<00:00:48.250> about

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
size so that the wider end is about

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.570 
size so that the wider end is about
halfway<00:00:49.230> further<00:00:50.230> past<00:00:50.740> the<00:00:50.920> narrowing<00:00:51.310> okay

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
halfway further past the narrowing okay

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.920 
halfway further past the narrowing okay
okay<00:00:51.850> so<00:00:51.910> that's<00:00:52.120> the<00:00:52.210> place<00:00:52.360> to<00:00:52.570> start<00:00:52.660> gonna

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
okay so that's the place to start gonna

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.030 
okay so that's the place to start gonna
have<00:00:53.020> like<00:00:53.110> a<00:00:53.140> minute<00:00:53.470> I<00:00:53.590> want<00:00:53.860> to<00:00:53.890> have<00:00:54.010> a

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
have like a minute I want to have a

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.400 
have like a minute I want to have a
little<00:00:54.220> mini<00:00:54.340> tie<00:00:54.610> exactly<00:00:55.270> and<00:00:55.480> you<00:00:56.290> might

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
little mini tie exactly and you might

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.540 
little mini tie exactly and you might
have<00:00:56.590> to<00:00:56.710> try<00:00:56.860> it<00:00:56.920> a<00:00:56.980> few<00:00:57.010> different<00:00:57.400> times

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
have to try it a few different times

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.160 
have to try it a few different times
because<00:00:57.820> different<00:00:58.210> ties<00:00:58.540> have<00:00:58.840> different

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
because different ties have different

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.420 
because different ties have different
lengths<00:00:59.440> okay<00:00:59.740> so<00:00:59.950> you're<00:01:00.070> never<00:01:00.220> going<00:01:00.400> to

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
lengths okay so you're never going to

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.950 
lengths okay so you're never going to
get<00:01:00.550> it<00:01:00.640> on<00:01:00.730> the<00:01:00.790> first<00:01:00.940> try<00:01:01.150> normally<00:01:01.600> the

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
get it on the first try normally the

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.450 
get it on the first try normally the
first<00:01:02.110> step<00:01:02.380> in<00:01:02.500> tying<00:01:02.710> a<00:01:02.830> foreign<00:01:03.100> hand<00:01:03.280> knot

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
first step in tying a foreign hand knot

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.770 
first step in tying a foreign hand knot
is<00:01:03.610> simply<00:01:03.910> to<00:01:04.000> put<00:01:04.150> the<00:01:04.269> tie<00:01:04.420> around<00:01:04.570> your

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
is simply to put the tie around your

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.539 
is simply to put the tie around your
neck<00:01:04.900> and<00:01:05.229> to<00:01:05.619> figure<00:01:05.770> out<00:01:06.010> the<00:01:06.130> right<00:01:06.280> length

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
neck and to figure out the right length

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:09.029 
neck and to figure out the right length
about<00:01:07.270> halfway<00:01:07.600> or<00:01:08.109> possibly<00:01:08.530> a<00:01:08.619> little<00:01:08.740> less

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:09.039 
about halfway or possibly a little less

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:10.800 
about halfway or possibly a little less
for<00:01:09.549> the<00:01:09.640> narrow<00:01:09.850> end<00:01:10.090> compared<00:01:10.630> to<00:01:10.750> the

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
for the narrow end compared to the

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.319 
for the narrow end compared to the
longer<00:01:11.109> end<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:12.520> take<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:12.820> wide<00:01:12.969> end<00:01:13.210> of<00:01:13.299> the

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:13.329 
longer end you take the wide end of the

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:15.840 
longer end you take the wide end of the
tie<00:01:13.420> and<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:13.869> first<00:01:14.200> step<00:01:14.429> is<00:01:15.429> to<00:01:15.579> bring<00:01:15.729> it

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
tie and the first step is to bring it

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.080 
tie and the first step is to bring it
around<00:01:15.909> like<00:01:16.539> that<00:01:17.399> then<00:01:18.399> you<00:01:18.579> simply<00:01:18.909> bring

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
around like that then you simply bring

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.870 
around like that then you simply bring
it<00:01:19.240> towards<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.259> front<00:01:20.380> you<00:01:21.340> wrap<00:01:21.640> it<00:01:21.670> around

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
it towards the front you wrap it around

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.899 
it towards the front you wrap it around
and<00:01:22.890> now<00:01:23.890> you<00:01:23.950> can<00:01:24.159> see<00:01:24.399> that<00:01:24.759> the

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
and now you can see that the

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.160 
and now you can see that the
four-in-hand<00:01:25.240> knot<00:01:25.299> is<00:01:25.630> starting<00:01:25.929> to<00:01:26.020> take

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
four-in-hand knot is starting to take

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.219 
four-in-hand knot is starting to take
shape<00:01:26.229> the<00:01:27.159> final<00:01:27.490> step<00:01:27.700> is<00:01:27.939> to<00:01:28.450> bring<00:01:28.840> the

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
shape the final step is to bring the

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.469 
shape the final step is to bring the
wide<00:01:29.439> end<00:01:29.469> up<00:01:29.890> through<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.460> loop<00:01:30.549> created<00:01:31.149> in

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
wide end up through the loop created in

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.309 
wide end up through the loop created in
