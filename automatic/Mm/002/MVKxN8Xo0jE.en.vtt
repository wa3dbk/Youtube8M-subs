00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
their cocoa beans making sure that the

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.689 
their cocoa beans making sure that the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
farmers are getting paid a fair amount

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.400 
farmers are getting paid a fair amount
for<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.480> amount<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.899> work<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.140> they're

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
for the amount of work that they're

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.020 
for the amount of work that they're
doing<00:00:55.440> but<00:00:56.039> unfortunately<00:00:56.100> it's<00:00:56.760> hard<00:00:56.940> to

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
doing but unfortunately it's hard to

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.459 
doing but unfortunately it's hard to
find<00:00:57.239> there<00:00:57.690> have<00:00:57.780> been<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> couple<00:00:58.020> times<00:00:58.320> that
