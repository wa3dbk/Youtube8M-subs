00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.960
 if we build such an amplifier 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.240
 So want to use a stronger order 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.130
 to control a mixer where you can 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.109
 interconnect different inputs and 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.900
 can add with equal weight 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.160
 still there you can look at these eight with the 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.490
 Operational amplifier as follows 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.070
 will do next to the turn 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:30.750
 invert the mode so have it here 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:32.250
 just input to 0 volt and the - one 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.770
 We want to put it together 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.340
 maybe with two as an example with 2 1 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.430
 went 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:46.820
 once we have a tension here 1 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:48.899
 which then has a resistance 1 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.750
 is turned on and maybe have 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.850
 a second such source 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.520
 is like saying you that music can 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.460
 the microphone will be winner of the song and 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:04.260
 this can be the microphone signal from 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:07.680
 guitar or two gives the resistance 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.270
 the 2 and that is how we too 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.299
 have already seen back coupled 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.299
 Be on the exit over the 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.390
 coupling resistance by output 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:27.799
 So resisted two cops resistance like that 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:29.700
 and because it is at the output voltage two 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.790
 Input voltages should be at one 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.670
 output voltage can be returned 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.200
 for the calculation with so in turn say 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:42.090
 we must know that there was the current 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.479
 This time also the tension is at the 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.460
 The pacifier needs it 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.360
 thing back leads to a bizarre of 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.380
 stromer that he is here then 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.509
 together 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.850
 on the stream in the part so the stream 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.619
 this stretch here's after 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.610
 uri law to use that again 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:10.640
 udo scheer so it comes to the stream 1 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:10.640
 which flows here is through e 10 1 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.319
 in addition comes the best stream like two of 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:23.370
 This voltage source of'll be there 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:29.459
 merged into this knot and that 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:31.319
 means we have +2 through r2 that should 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.459
 no stream on fries the same size 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.900
 be like the voltage divided by 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.659
 the feedback resistor from the 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.310
 current flows then this still save 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:50.010
 not very negative we know that is 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:53.989
 the same as - through rk and with it 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.989
 theme so the output voltage is here 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.280
 is made up of these 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.040
 weighted with these resistances 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.810
 weighted input voltages what he 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:10.109
 this dissolves me to cuba stands here 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:16.409
 output voltage is the same - rk to 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:19.980
 share 11 as I said it can be the microphone 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:23.010
 his signal will be from singing and then 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:31.049
 The negative sign can continue here before 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:32.819
 the staple 10er card cher 2 x 2 im 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.049
 principle among others with one further 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.019
 have such connections 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.370
 so you can weight the input voltage 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.260
 add weighted 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.169
 you can, for example , all 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.819
 choose resistors of the same size 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:50.430
 One of the two years maybe one 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:53.790
 gate or something then it 's just the same - 1 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.900
 + 2 plus to the normal sum without 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.900
 additional weighting 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.890
 So this one has to reinforce more 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:16.440
 a completely different story then comes 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.989
 in when we have a signal 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.690
 want to differentiate or integrate 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:26.020
 first grass for explanation when i enter 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:29.800
 signal the meat looks like this then 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:32.350
 is the integral still gives the signal 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.430
 the area from a certain point 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:41.830
 Appropriately the area under curve that 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:45.940
 the integral that one on summation 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.440
 the signal will go on board over time 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.360
 if I am more in favor of it now 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.760
 interested in how the signal changes 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.680
 so where is the change positive is that 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.590
 Change negative as it goes up there 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.710
 the zero is negative then he can 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.120
 say that here we are 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.330
 have positive signal 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.570
 there it is short 0 so far negative 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:10.270
 the change of signal said that 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:13.720
 slope and the derivative we see 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:17.170
 once topscorer goes under this 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.940
 is that this deep the 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.420
 derivative and the differential of the 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.420
 signal 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:30.190
 So go and these two things you can 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.030
 also to strengthen with operation 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.919
 realization 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.430
 So you can get a signal like that 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:38.169
 You can either use this red area 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.449
 enough for the time always 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.850
 gets bigger or you can get this 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:46.560
 green curve differential of the signal 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:48.550
 So that derive the signals it 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.199
 have output of the 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.840
 operational amplifier that and the money 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:55.080
 about a very simple trick if you 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:06:00.610
 namely a commissioner takes tor 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:02.470
 capacity c then yes goes in the electro 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.520
 I froze that law that 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:09.070
 capacity is equal to the charge 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:12.639
 by the tension over this consentor 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:15.850
 the charge accumulated charge through the 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:19.330
 tension if we have this this 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:22.840
 Derive the equation of what the eschatological 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:28.990
 look at change then it says that he 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:34.150
 here to write about kohlers 4q is 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:35.830
 equal to ten times that now derive on 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.190
 both be standing here on the left 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.000
 page the temporal change of the charge 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:43.560
 that is nothing else like that 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.700
 amperage amperage isiah charge 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.280
 percent on the right side we see 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:50.800
 the capacity thus a property of the 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.919
 Capacitor was the temporal change 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.810
 the tension 

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:57.910
 that is, you have something where we have her 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.620
 a temporal change tension 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:02.770
 and the tension we get 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.240
 here at the entrance have the deduce 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:08.460
 might want to be over 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.460
 But there it comes to the goal
