00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
levin first up we have northwest and it

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.720 
levin first up we have northwest and it
hasn't<00:00:08.970> seen<00:00:09.269> that<00:00:09.599> much<00:00:09.960> change<00:00:10.700> except<00:00:11.700> for

hasn't seen that much change except for
this<00:00:12.120> part<00:00:12.480> of<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.719> map<00:00:12.960> which<00:00:13.410> was

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
this part of the map which was

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.920 
this part of the map which was
previously<00:00:14.580> like<00:00:15.570> locked<00:00:16.020> off<00:00:16.320> from<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.930> from

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
previously like locked off from the from

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.750 
previously like locked off from the from
the<00:00:18.960> map<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:19.500> was<00:00:19.619> unavailable<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:20.430> couldn't

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
the map it was unavailable you couldn't

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.029 
the map it was unavailable you couldn't
really<00:00:20.970> drive<00:00:21.359> there<00:00:21.689> we're<00:00:22.439> gonna<00:00:22.529> take<00:00:22.800> a

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
really drive there we're gonna take a

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.820 
really drive there we're gonna take a
trip<00:00:23.519> down<00:00:23.789> there<00:00:24.570> because<00:00:24.990> most<00:00:25.529> people

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
trip down there because most people

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.250 
trip down there because most people
haven't<00:00:26.189> even<00:00:26.279> been<00:00:26.550> down<00:00:26.760> there<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.260> don't

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
haven't even been down there and don't

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.419 
haven't even been down there and don't
really<00:00:28.529> know<00:00:28.650> how<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.859> get<00:00:29.039> down<00:00:29.220> there

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
really know how to get down there

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.720 
really know how to get down there
because<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.689> just<00:00:30.900> wasn't<00:00:31.230> open<00:00:31.470> before<00:00:31.730> this

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
because it just wasn't open before this

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.250 
because it just wasn't open before this
route<00:00:33.540> was<00:00:34.200> just<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:35.090> dead<00:00:36.090> end<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.840> couldn't

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
route was just a dead end you couldn't

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.479 
route was just a dead end you couldn't
go<00:00:37.410> anywhere<00:00:37.800> down<00:00:38.010> here<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:40.190> you<00:00:41.190> didn't<00:00:41.370> go

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
go anywhere down here so you didn't go

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.430 
go anywhere down here so you didn't go
down<00:00:41.640> there<00:00:41.820> but<00:00:42.300> now<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.510> can<00:00:42.809> get<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.230> this

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
down there but now you can get to this

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.040 
down there but now you can get to this
flanking<00:00:44.160> position<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:45.270> can<00:00:45.360> either<00:00:45.450> skip

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
flanking position you can either skip

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.440 
flanking position you can either skip
going<00:00:46.680> all<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.070> way<00:00:47.160> around<00:00:47.250> or<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:48.180> can<00:00:48.329> go

going up on the on the upper floor up

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.939 
going up on the on the upper floor up
there<00:00:54.360> or<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:55.320> can<00:00:55.440> go<00:00:55.559> all<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.680> way<00:00:55.770> around

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
are a couple of houses there but they

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.349 
are a couple of houses there but they
are<00:01:00.449> destructible<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:01.500> watch<00:01:01.739> out<00:01:02.210> and<00:01:03.210> now

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
are destructible so watch out and now

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.830 
are destructible so watch out and now
for<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.780> most<00:01:04.100> imbalanced<00:01:05.100> map<00:01:05.540> highway<00:01:06.540> it

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
for the most imbalanced map highway it

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.010 
for the most imbalanced map highway it
has<00:01:07.290> finally<00:01:07.979> seen<00:01:08.250> some<00:01:08.520> changes<00:01:08.840> and<00:01:09.840> it's

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
has finally seen some changes and it's

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.550 
has finally seen some changes and it's
about<00:01:10.170> time<00:01:10.860> going<00:01:11.610> north<00:01:11.840> previously<00:01:12.840> or<00:01:13.080> now

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
about time going north previously or now

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.100 
about time going north previously or now
on<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.100> live<00:01:14.250> server<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.850> have<00:01:15.060> no<00:01:15.390> chance<00:01:15.840> of

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
on the live server you have no chance of

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.530 
on the live server you have no chance of
getting<00:01:16.200> anywhere<00:01:17.070> near<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.790> enemy<00:01:18.119> base<00:01:18.299> if

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
getting anywhere near the enemy base if

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.870 
getting anywhere near the enemy base if
they<00:01:19.200> just<00:01:19.439> have<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.830> couple<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.460> changes

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
they just have a couple of changes

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.850 
they just have a couple of changes
drawers<00:01:21.150> or<00:01:21.360> heavy<00:01:21.960> tanks<00:01:22.320> sitting<00:01:22.680> and

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
drawers or heavy tanks sitting and

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.120 
drawers or heavy tanks sitting and
camping<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.360> see<00:01:24.540> here<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:25.290> road<00:01:25.770> is

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
camping so you can see here this road is

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.630 
camping so you can see here this road is
very<00:01:27.000> flat<00:01:27.479> all<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.930> way<00:01:28.619> over<00:01:29.100> there<00:01:29.130> you

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
very flat all the way over there you

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.170 
very flat all the way over there you
have<00:01:29.820> no<00:01:30.259> chance<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.619> getting<00:01:31.710> any<00:01:32.340> cover<00:01:32.790> here

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
have no chance of getting any cover here

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.740 
have no chance of getting any cover here
but<00:01:33.990> now<00:01:34.200> there<00:01:34.770> are<00:01:34.799> both<00:01:35.460> houses<00:01:35.820> up<00:01:36.180> here<00:01:36.210> so

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
but now there are both houses up here so

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.260 
but now there are both houses up here so
you<00:01:36.840> can<00:01:37.170> get<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.680> strategic<00:01:38.250> position<00:01:38.970> up<00:01:39.060> here

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
you can get a strategic position up here

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.630 
you can get a strategic position up here
if<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:40.079> enemy<00:01:40.439> decides<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.159> push<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.579> little

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
if the enemy decides to push a little

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.300 
if the enemy decides to push a little
bit<00:01:42.000> northwest<00:01:42.689> from<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.500> North<00:01:43.740> base<00:01:44.009> and

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
bit northwest from the North base and

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.149 
bit northwest from the North base and
the<00:01:45.060> road<00:01:45.240> we<00:01:45.509> just<00:01:45.750> had<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.960> look<00:01:46.170> at<00:01:46.350> has

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
the road we just had a look at has

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.550 
the road we just had a look at has
actually<00:01:47.640> been<00:01:47.790> raised<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.630> if<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.110> manage<00:01:49.530> to

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
actually been raised so if you manage to

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.560 
actually been raised so if you manage to
push<00:01:49.920> all<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.340> way<00:01:50.369> down<00:01:50.670> here<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.270> house

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570
