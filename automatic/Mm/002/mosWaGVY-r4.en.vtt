00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
difference between a leg press machine

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.300

and<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.480> hack<00:00:24.720> hack<00:00:25.019> squat<00:00:25.350> machine<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:25.980> terms

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
and a hack hack squat machine in terms

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.349 
and a hack hack squat machine in terms
of<00:00:26.490> which<00:00:26.730> muscles<00:00:27.210> are<00:00:27.359> being<00:00:27.599> utilized<00:00:29.359> okay

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
of which muscles are being utilized okay

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.350

a<00:00:30.660> hex<00:00:31.380> squat<00:00:31.590> machine<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:32.219> where<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.969> have

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
a hex squat machine is where you have

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.660 
a hex squat machine is where you have
the<00:00:33.660> pads<00:00:34.110> on<00:00:34.469> your<00:00:34.680> shoulders<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.460> you're

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
the pads on your shoulders and you're

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.520 
the pads on your shoulders and you're
leaning<00:00:36.000> back<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.480> your<00:00:36.960> feet<00:00:37.200> are<00:00:37.230> on<00:00:37.500> a

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
leaning back and your feet are on a

leaning back and your feet are on a
platform<00:00:37.829> below<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:39.510> believe<00:00:39.960> that

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
platform below you and I believe that

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.500 
platform below you and I believe that
the<00:00:40.350> hack<00:00:40.559> squat<00:00:40.890> works<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.640> little<00:00:42.120> bit<00:00:42.300> more

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
the hack squat works a little bit more

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.900 
the hack squat works a little bit more
of<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.930> front<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.710> leg<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.399> quadricep

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
of the front of the leg so the quadricep

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.810 
of the front of the leg so the quadricep
muscles<00:00:45.270> versus<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.530> back<00:00:46.739> however<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.730> know

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
muscles versus the back however you know

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.430 
muscles versus the back however you know
if<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.000> go<00:00:48.120> really<00:00:48.360> deep<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.960> incorporate

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
if you go really deep you incorporate

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.860 
if you go really deep you incorporate
more<00:00:49.620> glutes<00:00:50.059> make<00:00:51.059> sure<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.390> your<00:00:51.510> heels

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
more glutes make sure that your heels

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.319 
more glutes make sure that your heels
stay<00:00:52.079> flat<00:00:52.320> on<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.530> platform<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.850> leg<00:00:54.090> press

stay flat on the platform the leg press

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.900 
stay flat on the platform the leg press
works<00:00:54.989> similar<00:00:55.469> muscles<00:00:55.890> but<00:00:56.190> depending<00:00:56.820> on

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
works similar muscles but depending on

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.459 
works similar muscles but depending on
where<00:00:57.059> your<00:00:57.149> feet<00:00:57.390> are<00:00:57.420> on<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.629> platform<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
where your feet are on the platform the

higher up they are the more you can
emphasize<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:01.350> know<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.559> glutes<00:01:01.800> and

bit of the hamstring and glute so do

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.560 
bit of the hamstring and glute so do
them<00:01:16.229> both<00:01:16.909> is<00:01:18.290> it<00:01:19.290> safe<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.799> use<00:01:20.090> bcaa's<00:01:21.090> on<00:01:21.509> a

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
them both is it safe to use bcaa's on a

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.780 
them both is it safe to use bcaa's on a
regular<00:01:22.080> basis<00:01:22.650> or<00:01:22.860> just<00:01:22.920> been<00:01:23.310> doing<00:01:23.580> heavy

regular basis or just been doing heavy

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.289 
regular basis or just been doing heavy
more<00:01:24.119> focused<00:01:24.479> training<00:01:25.909> bcaas<00:01:26.909> are<00:01:27.150> also

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
more focused training bcaas are also

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.179 
more focused training bcaas are also
known<00:01:27.600> as<00:01:27.750> branch<00:01:28.020> chain<00:01:28.320> amino<00:01:28.350> acids<00:01:28.979> and

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
known as branch chain amino acids and

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.340 
known as branch chain amino acids and
you<00:01:29.970> can<00:01:30.150> take<00:01:30.360> them<00:01:30.479> on<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.630> regular<00:01:30.780> basis

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
you can take them on a regular basis

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.350 
you can take them on a regular basis
there's<00:01:32.280> nothing<00:01:32.400> wrong<00:01:32.729> with<00:01:33.090> taking

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
there's nothing wrong with taking

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.859 
there's nothing wrong with taking
branched<00:01:34.049> chain<00:01:34.170> amino<00:01:34.200> acids<00:01:35.030> so<00:01:36.030> from<00:01:36.630> Team

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
branched chain amino acids so from Team

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.039 
branched chain amino acids so from Team
so<00:01:37.259> you're<00:01:37.799> getting<00:01:37.979> bcaa's<00:01:38.850> through<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.509> lot

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
so you're getting bcaa's through a lot

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.700 
so you're getting bcaa's through a lot
of<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.200> proteins<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.770> already<00:01:41.100> eat<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.960> I<00:01:42.960> do

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
of the proteins you already eat I I do

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.280 
of the proteins you already eat I I do
think<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.250> helps<00:01:44.520> with<00:01:44.810> increased<00:01:45.810> immunity

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
think it helps with increased immunity

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.609 
think it helps with increased immunity
so<00:01:46.880> yeah<00:01:47.880> there's<00:01:48.060> nothing<00:01:48.149> wrong<00:01:48.420> with<00:01:48.479> that

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.200

straps whenever you're training back or
any<00:02:52.890> exercise<00:02:53.459> that<00:02:54.330> will<00:02:54.510> also<00:02:54.690> help<00:02:54.870> with

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
any exercise that will also help with

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.720 
any exercise that will also help with
your<00:02:55.650> grip<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:57.350> forearm<00:02:58.350> strength<00:02:58.800> so<00:02:59.459> those

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
your grip and forearm strength so those

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.970 
your grip and forearm strength so those
are<00:02:59.760> just<00:02:59.910> a<00:03:00.090> few<00:03:00.120> things<00:03:00.360> but<00:03:01.080> when<00:03:01.860> you're

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
are just a few things but when you're

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.370 
are just a few things but when you're
doing<00:03:02.250> plank<00:03:02.880> holds<00:03:04.940> and<00:03:05.940> yoga<00:03:06.870> poses<00:03:07.110> you're

doing plank holds and yoga poses you're

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.770 
doing plank holds and yoga poses you're
not<00:03:07.530> really<00:03:07.740> gripping<00:03:08.160> anything<00:03:08.700> so<00:03:09.330> it<00:03:09.600> might

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
not really gripping anything so it might

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.710 
not really gripping anything so it might
just<00:03:09.959> be<00:03:10.290> weak<00:03:11.070> wrists<00:03:11.490> and<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.820> exercises

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
just be weak wrists and the exercises

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.300 
just be weak wrists and the exercises
that<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:12.870> showed<00:03:13.170> you<00:03:13.230> there<00:03:13.560> will<00:03:13.830> also<00:03:14.130> help

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
that I showed you there will also help

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:22.720 
that I showed you there will also help
with<00:03:14.400> strengthening<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.300> wrist<00:03:15.510> as<00:03:15.780> well<00:03:16.700> and

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.570 

the<00:03:23.730> last<00:03:23.940> question<00:03:24.120> I<00:03:24.360> have<00:03:24.570> is<00:03:25.519> how<00:03:26.519> many

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
the last question I have is how many

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.400 
the last question I have is how many
times<00:03:27.120> a<00:03:27.269> week<00:03:27.300> would<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:27.720> recommend<00:03:28.200> weight

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
times a week would you recommend weight

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.100 
times a week would you recommend weight
training<00:03:28.830> on<00:03:28.980> legs<00:03:29.310> I'm<00:03:29.640> more<00:03:30.390> tone<00:03:30.690> on<00:03:30.840> top

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
training on legs I'm more tone on top

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.470 
training on legs I'm more tone on top
half<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:31.739> was<00:03:31.920> wondering<00:03:32.250> if<00:03:32.400> I<00:03:32.489> should<00:03:32.670> do

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
half and was wondering if I should do

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.040 
half and was wondering if I should do
legs<00:03:33.810> two<00:03:34.140> times<00:03:34.350> a<00:03:34.500> week's<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.920> catch<00:03:35.100> up

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
legs two times a week's to catch up

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.120 
legs two times a week's to catch up
there's<00:03:37.050> nothing<00:03:37.230> wrong<00:03:37.500> with<00:03:37.709> doing<00:03:37.800> legs

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
there's nothing wrong with doing legs

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.560 
there's nothing wrong with doing legs
two<00:03:38.310> times<00:03:38.519> a<00:03:38.640> week<00:03:38.820> if<00:03:39.090> your<00:03:39.239> legs<00:03:39.450> are

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
two times a week if your legs are

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.150 
two times a week if your legs are
lagging<00:03:39.810> or<00:03:40.290> you're<00:03:40.560> trying<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:40.860> build<00:03:41.040> a

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
lagging or you're trying to build a

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.390 
lagging or you're trying to build a
little<00:03:41.340> bit<00:03:41.459> more<00:03:41.580> muscle<00:03:42.030> I<00:03:42.739> you<00:03:43.739> can<00:03:43.920> totally

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
little bit more muscle I you can totally

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.009 
little bit more muscle I you can totally
do<00:03:44.550> it<00:03:44.580> twice<00:03:44.940> i<00:03:45.239> don't<00:03:45.570> think<00:03:45.660> i<00:03:45.930> would

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
do it twice i don't think i would

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.630 
do it twice i don't think i would
recommend<00:03:46.560> doing<00:03:46.680> any<00:03:46.950> more<00:03:47.190> than<00:03:47.430> two<00:03:47.459> times

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
recommend doing any more than two times

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.900 
recommend doing any more than two times
because<00:03:48.330> your<00:03:48.510> legs<00:03:48.690> are<00:03:48.840> such<00:03:49.019> a<00:03:49.050> big<00:03:49.320> muscle

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
because your legs are such a big muscle

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.940 
because your legs are such a big muscle
group<00:03:50.910> that<00:03:51.269> you<00:03:51.959> want<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.320> allow<00:03:52.620> enough<00:03:52.920> time

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
group that you want to allow enough time

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.820 
group that you want to allow enough time
to<00:03:53.430> recover<00:03:53.730> and<00:03:54.180> if<00:03:54.600> you're<00:03:55.410> hitting<00:03:55.650> them

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
to recover and if you're hitting them

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.640 
to recover and if you're hitting them
hard<00:03:56.070> enough<00:03:56.130> to<00:03:57.060> three<00:03:57.390> days<00:03:57.540> minimum<00:03:58.230> is

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
hard enough to three days minimum is

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.830 
hard enough to three days minimum is
what<00:03:58.890> you<00:03:59.310> will<00:03:59.519> need<00:03:59.760> to<00:04:00.150> recover<00:04:00.600> them

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
what you will need to recover them

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.240 
what you will need to recover them
efficiently<00:04:01.200> before<00:04:01.680> hitting<00:04:01.860> them<00:04:02.010> again

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
efficiently before hitting them again

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.600 
efficiently before hitting them again
what<00:04:03.060> you<00:04:03.180> could<00:04:03.450> do<00:04:03.660> is<00:04:03.930> do<00:04:04.200> quads<00:04:04.769> one<00:04:05.430> day

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
what you could do is do quads one day

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.910 
what you could do is do quads one day
and<00:04:05.910> then<00:04:06.209> work<00:04:06.989> on<00:04:07.140> your<00:04:07.290> hamstrings<00:04:07.769> and

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
and then work on your hamstrings and

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.600 
and then work on your hamstrings and
