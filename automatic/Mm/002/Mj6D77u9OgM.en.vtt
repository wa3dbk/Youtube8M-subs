alizarin<00:01:33.299> crimson<00:01:33.750> cadmium<00:01:34.650> red<00:01:34.829> yellow

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
alizarin crimson cadmium red yellow

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.510 
alizarin crimson cadmium red yellow
ochre<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.579> white<00:01:36.020> so<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.470> would<00:01:38.159> gray<00:01:38.369> my

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
ochre and white so I would gray my

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.190 
ochre and white so I would gray my
colors<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.119> instead<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.420> using<00:01:39.630> blue<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:39.930> used

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
colors and instead of using blue I used

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.340 
colors and instead of using blue I used
grey<00:01:41.119> and<00:01:42.119> yeah<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.540> old<00:01:42.659> masters<00:01:42.990> did<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.320> a

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
grey and yeah the old masters did that a

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.810 
grey and yeah the old masters did that a
lot<00:01:43.560> because<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.890> blue<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.159> expensive<00:01:44.670> so

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
lot because the blue is expensive so

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.990 
lot because the blue is expensive so
they<00:01:45.060> would<00:01:45.210> use<00:01:45.240> grey<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.750> indicate<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.409> blue

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
they would use grey to indicate a blue

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.230 
they would use grey to indicate a blue
so<00:01:48.320> this<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.530> yellow<00:01:49.890> ochre<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.939> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
so this is yellow ochre this is the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.170 
so this is yellow ochre this is the
others<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.200> crimson<00:01:52.500> white<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.340> black<00:01:53.610> which

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
others in crimson white and black which

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
makes a pink and this is gray which is

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.340 
makes a pink and this is gray which is
blue<00:01:56.759> black<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.000> white<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.509> those<00:01:58.049> three

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350

juxtapose yellow red and blue and you

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.260 
juxtapose yellow red and blue and you
put<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.190> in<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.399> light<00:02:08.520> that's<00:02:08.729> where<00:02:08.970> in<00:02:09.119> your

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
years before the Impressionists so I

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.050 
years before the Impressionists so I
always<00:02:20.290> say<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.830> Masters<00:02:21.310> new<00:02:21.550> amount<00:02:22.000> of

Impressionists<00:02:24.820> but<00:02:25.750> they<00:02:26.020> just<00:02:26.260> didn't<00:02:26.560> use

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
Impressionists but they just didn't use

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.920 
Impressionists but they just didn't use
it<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.160> the<00:02:27.280> extent<00:02:27.700> that<00:02:27.790> that<00:02:28.330> the

it to the extent that that the
impression<00:02:29.350> is<00:02:29.440> used<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:30.520> Impressionists

impression is used the Impressionists

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.240 
impression is used the Impressionists
took<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.990> old<00:02:32.140> master<00:02:32.590> theories<00:02:33.040> and

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
took the old master theories and

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.950 
took the old master theories and
actually<00:02:33.550> implemented<00:02:34.150> them<00:02:34.300> in<00:02:34.420> a<00:02:34.480> new<00:02:34.630> form

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
actually implemented them in a new form

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.840 
actually implemented them in a new form
but<00:02:35.740> the<00:02:35.860> old<00:02:35.980> masters<00:02:36.430> were<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.640> ones<00:02:36.790> that

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
but the old masters were the ones that

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:43.080 
but the old masters were the ones that
came<00:02:37.030> up<00:02:37.090> with<00:02:37.240> it<00:02:37.390> like<00:02:38.140> da<00:02:38.290> Vinci<00:02:39.900> so<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:43.030> I

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
came up with it like da Vinci so so I

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.520 
came up with it like da Vinci so so I
did<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:43.450> head<00:02:43.630> with<00:02:43.840> brush<00:02:44.080> strokes<00:02:44.380> and

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
did the head with brush strokes and

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.520 
did the head with brush strokes and
knifed<00:02:44.770> in<00:02:44.980> this<00:02:45.250> area<00:02:45.750> left<00:02:46.750> in<00:02:46.960> this<00:02:47.110> area

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
knifed in this area left in this area

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.810 
knifed in this area left in this area
nice<00:02:48.070> and<00:02:48.100> most<00:02:48.490> of<00:02:48.670> it<00:02:48.790> then<00:02:49.450> I<00:02:50.430> drew<00:02:51.430> in<00:02:51.610> with

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
nice and most of it then I drew in with

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.670 
nice and most of it then I drew in with
the<00:02:51.910> liner<00:02:52.150> brush<00:02:52.450> all<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.780> details<00:02:53.380> of<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.650> I

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
the liner brush all the details of the I

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.110 
the liner brush all the details of the I
had<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.070> turn<00:02:54.250> it<00:02:54.340> upside<00:02:54.610> down<00:02:54.640> and<00:02:54.790> make<00:02:55.000> them

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
had to turn it upside down and make them

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.720 
had to turn it upside down and make them
even<00:02:55.290> but<00:02:56.290> this<00:02:56.530> has<00:02:56.680> to<00:02:56.710> be<00:02:56.860> very<00:02:57.040> even

you<00:03:06.940> have<00:03:07.150> to<00:03:07.300> do<00:03:07.420> this<00:03:07.660> you<00:03:07.990> have<00:03:08.170> to<00:03:08.290> do<00:03:08.500> the

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
you have to do this you have to do the

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.820 
you have to do this you have to do the
first<00:03:10.510> you<00:03:10.720> do<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:10.960> head<00:03:11.170> that<00:03:11.320> you<00:03:11.380> know<00:03:11.470> of

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
first you do the head that you know of

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.010 
first you do the head that you know of
degree<00:03:12.220> then<00:03:12.520> you<00:03:12.640> fit<00:03:12.940> in<00:03:13.120> your<00:03:13.390> model<00:03:13.810> into

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
degree then you fit in your model into

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.860 
degree then you fit in your model into
those<00:03:14.520> features<00:03:15.520> but<00:03:15.880> first<00:03:16.120> you<00:03:16.240> sculpt<00:03:16.690> a

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
those features but first you sculpt a

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.560 
those features but first you sculpt a
generic<00:03:17.320> head<00:03:17.500> as<00:03:17.710> if<00:03:18.220> you're<00:03:18.370> sculpting<00:03:18.730> then

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
generic head as if you're sculpting then

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.990 
generic head as if you're sculpting then
you<00:03:19.750> fit<00:03:20.620> in<00:03:20.740> the<00:03:20.860> individual<00:03:21.460> features<00:03:21.850> of

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
you fit in the individual features of

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.340 
you fit in the individual features of
the<00:03:22.060> model<00:03:22.270> which<00:03:22.480> is<00:03:22.630> my<00:03:22.780> eyes<00:03:22.930> nose<00:03:23.320> and

underneath<00:03:29.290> but<00:03:29.680> when<00:03:29.770> I<00:03:29.800> sanded<00:03:30.310> it<00:03:30.430> I<00:03:30.520> send

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
underneath but when I sanded it I send

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.490 
underneath but when I sanded it I send
it<00:03:30.940> down<00:03:31.120> to<00:03:31.270> this<00:03:31.390> glowing<00:03:31.690> when<00:03:31.900> Venetian

here I had a lot of brush texture with a

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.949 
here I had a lot of brush texture with a
fan<00:03:45.250> brush<00:03:45.550> and<00:03:45.580> then<00:03:45.940> I<00:03:46.030> finger<00:03:46.420> painted<00:03:46.840> in

serpentine<00:06:33.660> in<00:06:33.840> my<00:06:33.960> mediums<00:06:34.320> or<00:06:34.440> anything

serpentine in my mediums or anything

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.490 
serpentine in my mediums or anything
because<00:06:35.070> it's<00:06:35.400> poisonous<00:06:36.120> and<00:06:36.449> I<00:06:36.780> think<00:06:37.410> it

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 
because it's poisonous and I think it

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.749 
because it's poisonous and I think it
ruins<00:06:37.770> the<00:06:37.889> paint<00:06:38.070> thing<00:06:38.250> because<00:06:38.490> it<00:06:38.610> just

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:38.759 
ruins the paint thing because it just

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:40.370 
ruins the paint thing because it just
eats<00:06:38.970> away<00:06:39.150> at<00:06:39.300> I<00:06:39.509> need<00:06:39.630> layers<00:06:39.930> that<00:06:40.110> are<00:06:40.229> not
