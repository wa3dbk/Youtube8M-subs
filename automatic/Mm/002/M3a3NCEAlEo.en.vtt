00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.450
 meatballs 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.500
 for this we need for broth 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.530
 chicken skeletons 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.170
 2 chickens will be enough so bone 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.580
 chicken broth 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.900
 so like soup with meatballs us 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:27.449

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:30.119
 pork and 2 3 beef egg black 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:34.260
 pepper salt, respectively, 2 onions 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.989
 and for broth we need celery 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.469
 and for zazharki 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.480
 Bulgarian carrot pepper half 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:47.059
 red and green, respectively 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:50.489
 potato and here and here we have macaroni 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.110
 colored stars and so I put to cook 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.710
 broth broth is boiled from the frame 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.930
 fast enough from 40 minutes to an hour and 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.090
 broth and put 1 to such celery 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:13.170
 to cook fragrant broth 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:16.220
 a few grams of black pepper for 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:22.409
 broth flavor 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:26.130
 bay leaf things such bay 4 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.229
 leaf and so leave to stew broth 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.840
 only need to be removed when 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.900
 broth boils remove foam useful 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.000
 if we do as follows 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.299
 very, really need to chop the onion but 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.030
 it can already now in principle it 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:46.470
 kill to chop onion finely 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.780
 need to have a very sharp knife will not 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.320
 put onions quite a lot because 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.280
 that the meatballs will then be juicy 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:58.710
 I'm going to pepper now 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:01.850
 black pepper also need to add 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.850
 necessarily salt 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.790
 I also add because the stuffing is fresh but 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:17.160
 it seems to me anyway 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.160
 you need to add a little half cup water and 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:25.450
 tolkushkoy need to mix with us 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.000
 one testicle 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:33.190
 for stickiness to make meatballs not 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.290
 broke up stuffing I became boards for up 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.020
 homogeneous mass and cooked tea 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.050
 a spoon in order to cook 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.520
 meatballs but it's a bit bigger now 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:47.140
 I will need to cut 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:49.810
 all for the soup now I'm cutting thin 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.910
 the straw will then just be very small 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.180
 chopped bell pepper for that 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.770
 so that large pieces of the step float 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:03.270
 some like it big when cut 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:03.270
 but in our family that was not noticeable 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.610
 also finely chop straw first you 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.989
 then across 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.989
 paint red bell pepper 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:41.830
 olive oil preferably even adidas i 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.110
 I will not fry and very much 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:47.770
 literally put out the oil 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:51.010
 still took the color on coffee 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:53.560
 turned yellow well usually potato sock I 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.960
 I see it this way so small 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.010
 dice that is, it turns out somewhere here 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.010
 here is such a cube 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.500

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.650

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.140

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.940
 Potato Smeared To Make It 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.330
 time for him to fail 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.950
 painting than a little secret for that 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.280
 that only the girls turned out beautiful and 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.810
 fragrant you can put dried 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.570
 parsley or dill 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:44.340
 i will put the parsley mix thoroughly and 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:48.390
 then the critical holes will be very beautiful 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.880

 specially typed in order to 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.790
 wet your hands is not what is needed in order 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:05.900
 so that when approaching you get round and 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.900
 stuffing did not stick to hands 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.960
 such a meatball is obtained and hands 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.960
