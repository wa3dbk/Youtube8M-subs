property

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.270 

well<00:02:20.380> we're<00:02:20.530> going<00:02:20.650> to<00:02:20.710> be<00:02:20.830> very<00:02:21.040> aggressive

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
well we're going to be very aggressive

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.150

we're<00:02:21.670> going<00:02:21.820> to<00:02:21.880> be<00:02:21.970> drilling<00:02:22.620> an<00:02:23.620> initial

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
we're going to be drilling an initial

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.250 
we're going to be drilling an initial
three<00:02:24.490> drill<00:02:24.730> holes<00:02:24.970> at<00:02:25.510> a<00:02:25.630> cost<00:02:25.840> us<00:02:26.050> probably

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
three drill holes at a cost us probably

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.360 
three drill holes at a cost us probably
about<00:02:26.710> three<00:02:27.010> million<00:02:27.190> dollars<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:29.370> we're

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
about three million dollars and we're

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.010 
about three million dollars and we're
basically<00:02:30.820> going<00:02:31.060> to<00:02:31.150> continue<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.750> drill

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
basically going to continue to drill

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.280 
basically going to continue to drill
hopefully<00:02:32.560> throughout<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.520> year<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:34.230> try<00:02:35.230> to

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
hopefully throughout the year and try to

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.760 
hopefully throughout the year and try to
fast-track<00:02:35.800> into<00:02:36.340> a<00:02:36.370> resource<00:02:37.770> situation

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
fast-track into a resource situation

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.790 
fast-track into a resource situation
where<00:02:39.010> we<00:02:39.100> can<00:02:39.280> calculate<00:02:39.520> a<00:02:39.820> resource<00:02:40.210> so<00:02:41.110> I

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
where we can calculate a resource so I

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.250 
where we can calculate a resource so I
would<00:02:42.460> say<00:02:42.700> that<00:02:43.060> with<00:02:43.300> any<00:02:43.660> luck<00:02:43.960> we'll<00:02:44.230> be

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
would say that with any luck we'll be

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.660 
would say that with any luck we'll be
drilling<00:02:44.590> at<00:02:44.950> least<00:02:45.850> 15<00:02:46.390> holes<00:02:46.810> this<00:02:47.050> year

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.530 

well<00:02:51.450> we're<00:02:51.630> very<00:02:51.660> for

as<00:03:44.080> we<00:03:44.470> commence<00:03:44.830> drilling<00:03:45.100> our<00:03:45.550> goal<00:03:45.880> is<00:03:46.090> to

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
as we commence drilling our goal is to

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.960 
as we commence drilling our goal is to
basically<00:03:47.020> continue<00:03:47.920> drilling<00:03:48.220> throughout

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
basically continue drilling throughout

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.870 
basically continue drilling throughout
the<00:03:49.150> year<00:03:49.390> and<00:03:49.600> we<00:03:50.350> will<00:03:50.590> be<00:03:50.830> putting<00:03:51.130> out<00:03:51.370> news

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
the year and we will be putting out news

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.260 
the year and we will be putting out news
as<00:03:52.780> frequently<00:03:53.410> as<00:03:53.500> we<00:03:53.680> can<00:03:53.860> to<00:03:54.040> update<00:03:54.370> the

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
as frequently as we can to update the

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.260 
as frequently as we can to update the
investors<00:03:55.750> on<00:03:55.930> what<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.860> drill<00:03:57.070> results<00:03:57.220> are

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.460 

diamonds<00:04:01.270> are<00:04:01.420> very<00:04:01.660> difficult<00:04:02.110> as<00:04:02.230> you<00:04:02.349> know

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
diamonds are very difficult as you know

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.150 
diamonds are very difficult as you know
very<00:04:03.060> but<00:04:04.060> with<00:04:04.209> punishes<00:04:04.810> is<00:04:05.110> very<00:04:05.920> different

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
very but with punishes is very different

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.640 
very but with punishes is very different
because<00:04:06.340> these<00:04:06.879> these<00:04:07.269> are<00:04:07.510> salt<00:04:08.440> beds

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
because these these are salt beds

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.309 
because these these are salt beds
they're<00:04:08.980> basically<00:04:09.580> an<00:04:09.910> old<00:04:10.110> lake<00:04:11.110> that<00:04:11.260> has

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
they're basically an old lake that has

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.440 
they're basically an old lake that has
evaporated<00:04:11.680> and<00:04:12.310> these<00:04:13.090> things<00:04:13.269> are

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
evaporated and these things are

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.449 
evaporated and these things are
remarkably<00:04:14.050> continues<00:04:14.620> they<00:04:14.769> go<00:04:14.890> tens<00:04:15.220> and

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
remarkably continues they go tens and

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.159 
remarkably continues they go tens and
hundreds<00:04:15.849> of<00:04:15.940> kilometers<00:04:16.510> so<00:04:18.690> we<00:04:19.690> know<00:04:19.900> in

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
hundreds of kilometers so we know in

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.050 
hundreds of kilometers so we know in
fact<00:04:20.470> that<00:04:20.739> our<00:04:20.769> property<00:04:21.250> has<00:04:21.400> punished<00:04:21.700> from

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
fact that our property has punished from

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.770 
fact that our property has punished from
historic<00:04:22.570> oil<00:04:23.320> wells<00:04:23.650> so<00:04:24.550> we<00:04:24.970> know<00:04:25.330> that<00:04:25.360> for

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
historic oil wells so we know that for

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.629 
historic oil wells so we know that for
example<00:04:25.840> two<00:04:26.440> of<00:04:26.530> our<00:04:26.650> drill<00:04:26.889> holes<00:04:27.070> 15<00:04:27.430> miles

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
example two of our drill holes 15 miles

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.540 
example two of our drill holes 15 miles
apart<00:04:27.940> have<00:04:28.540> the<00:04:28.780> same<00:04:28.990> bed<00:04:29.260> the<00:04:29.770> same<00:04:29.979> geology

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
apart have the same bed the same geology

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.360 
apart have the same bed the same geology
and<00:04:30.840> similar<00:04:31.840> grades<00:04:32.139> so<00:04:33.070> we<00:04:33.220> are<00:04:33.340> very

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
and similar grades so we are very

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.180 
and similar grades so we are very
confident<00:04:34.000> that<00:04:34.120> that<00:04:34.960> the<00:04:35.440> potash<00:04:35.680> will<00:04:36.010> be

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
confident that that the potash will be

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.440 
confident that that the potash will be
there<00:04:36.430> so<00:04:37.120> what<00:04:37.600> we<00:04:37.720> need<00:04:37.870> to<00:04:38.020> do<00:04:38.260> is<00:04:38.500> basically

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
there so what we need to do is basically

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.969 
there so what we need to do is basically
really<00:04:40.450> is<00:04:40.540> define<00:04:41.020> the<00:04:41.200> exploration<00:04:41.680> here<00:04:41.860> is

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
really is define the exploration here is

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:43.860 
really is define the exploration here is
really<00:04:42.190> defined<00:04:43.060> the<00:04:43.270> extent<00:04:43.660> of<00:04:43.810> that

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
really defined the extent of that

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.170 
really defined the extent of that
deposit<00:04:44.560> come<00:04:45.190> up<00:04:45.340> with<00:04:45.520> the<00:04:45.610> tonnage<00:04:45.940> as

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
deposit come up with the tonnage as

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.300 
deposit come up with the tonnage as
quickly<00:04:46.630> as<00:04:46.780> we<00:04:46.900> can<00:04:47.050> and<00:04:47.290> then<00:04:47.919> get<00:04:48.160> into

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
quickly as we can and then get into

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.370 
quickly as we can and then get into
production<00:04:48.669> as<00:04:48.880> fast<00:04:49.090> as<00:04:49.360> possible<00:04:49.389> that's

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
production as fast as possible that's

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.080 
production as fast as possible that's
correct<00:04:50.680> that's<00:04:50.979> correct<00:04:51.490> because<00:04:51.880> the

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
correct that's correct because the

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.409 
correct that's correct because the
demand<00:04:52.330> is<00:04:52.510> so<00:04:52.570> it's<00:04:52.960> so<00:04:53.080> high<00:04:53.260> and<00:04:53.530> of<00:04:53.680> course

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
demand is so it's so high and of course

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.000 
demand is so it's so high and of course
that's<00:04:55.419> what<00:04:55.570> you<00:04:55.660> want<00:04:55.810> to<00:04:55.930> do<00:04:56.470> right<00:04:56.620> now<00:04:56.680> is

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
that's what you want to do right now is

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.969 
that's what you want to do right now is
bring<00:04:57.760> a<00:04:58.120> resource<00:04:59.110> to<00:04:59.169> that<00:04:59.470> point<00:04:59.770> where

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
bring a resource to that point where

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:01.740 
bring a resource to that point where
were<00:05:00.340> your<00:05:00.520> fast<00:05:00.760> tracking<00:05:01.120> it<00:05:01.389> to<00:05:01.479> pretend

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
were your fast tracking it to pretend
