00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.079 
unfortunately patience is the only thing
that's<00:00:13.230> gonna<00:00:13.349> work<00:00:13.590> however<00:00:14.250> if<00:00:14.700> you've<00:00:14.880> got

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
that's gonna work however if you've got

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.939 
that's gonna work however if you've got
something<00:00:15.420> going<00:00:15.540> on<00:00:15.750> like<00:00:15.960> this<00:00:16.260> where

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
something going on like this where

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.849 
something going on like this where
you've<00:00:17.070> got<00:00:17.250> like<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.430> step<00:00:17.880> that's<00:00:18.660> easy<00:00:19.020> go<00:00:19.830> to

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
you've got like a step that's easy go to

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.509 
you've got like a step that's easy go to
someone<00:00:20.220> you<00:00:20.310> trust<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:21.890> have<00:00:22.890> them<00:00:23.100> go<00:00:23.310> in

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
someone you trust and have them go in

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.009 
someone you trust and have them go in
and<00:00:23.730> just<00:00:23.850> sort<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.119> blend<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.600> little<00:00:24.900> bit

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
and just sort of blend that a little bit

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.650 
and just sort of blend that a little bit
more<00:00:25.199> so<00:00:25.710> once<00:00:25.890> they<00:00:26.070> blend<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:27.359> line

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
more so once they blend that that line

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.480 
more so once they blend that that line
will<00:00:27.869> go<00:00:27.990> away<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.529> that'll<00:00:28.830> be<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.949> lot<00:00:29.130> softer

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
will go away and that'll be a lot softer

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.260 
will go away and that'll be a lot softer
if<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.630> sides<00:00:30.869> are<00:00:31.019> too<00:00:31.230> short<00:00:31.500> like<00:00:32.009> here<00:00:32.399> you

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
if the sides are too short like here you

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.870 
if the sides are too short like here you
see<00:00:33.510> she's<00:00:33.899> got<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.200> step<00:00:34.530> here<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:35.010> can<00:00:35.730> go

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
see she's got the step here you can go

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.370 
see she's got the step here you can go
in<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.510> can<00:00:36.660> have<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:37.050> sort<00:00:37.320> of

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
in and you can have this sort of

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.410 
in and you can have this sort of
texturized<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.129> little<00:00:38.340> bit<00:00:38.460> more<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.030> looks

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
texturized a little bit more so it looks

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.440 
texturized a little bit more so it looks
like<00:00:40.340> it's<00:00:41.340> supposed<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.760> be<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:42.059> way<00:00:42.210> and

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
like it's supposed to be that way and

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.030 
like it's supposed to be that way and
that's<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.840> thing<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.500> want<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.860> make<00:00:44.010> a

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
that's the thing is you want to make a

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.490 
that's the thing is you want to make a
cut<00:00:44.340> look<00:00:44.670> like<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.000> meant<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.239> do<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.570> if<00:00:45.750> it's

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
cut look like you meant to do it if it's

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.319 
cut look like you meant to do it if it's
you<00:00:46.890> know<00:00:46.920> if<00:00:47.129> it's<00:00:47.250> bad<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.940> don't<00:00:48.059> want<00:00:48.270> to

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
you know if it's bad you don't want to

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.000 
you know if it's bad you don't want to
just<00:00:48.510> wear<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.750> like<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.469> all<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.770> time<00:00:49.980> just

you know do different things and
eventually<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:57.960> know<00:00:58.079> it'll<00:00:58.379> get<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.770> where

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
eventually you know it'll get to where

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.090 
eventually you know it'll get to where
you<00:00:59.129> can<00:00:59.309> do<00:00:59.460> more<00:00:59.489> with<00:00:59.670> it<00:01:00.710> but<00:01:01.710> just<00:01:01.920> go<00:01:02.039> to

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
with ideas where you can fix it and you

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.490 
with ideas where you can fix it and you
can<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.479> know<00:01:09.600> do<00:01:09.869> some<00:01:10.049> different<00:01:10.350> things

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
can you know do some different things

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.969 
can you know do some different things
with<00:01:10.770> it

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
with it

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.940 
with it
now<00:01:11.760> Lauren<00:01:12.479> here<00:01:12.750> she<00:01:13.409> doesn't<00:01:13.680> like<00:01:13.830> the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
now Lauren here she doesn't like the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.399 
now Lauren here she doesn't like the
layer<00:01:14.130> she<00:01:14.460> has<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.790> her<00:01:14.850> hair<00:01:15.090> she<00:01:15.299> feels<00:01:16.229> like

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
layer she has in her hair she feels like

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.980 
layer she has in her hair she feels like
it's<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.680> little<00:01:16.890> bit<00:01:17.040> too<00:01:17.420> bi-level<00:01:18.420> turn<00:01:18.810> your

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
it's a little bit too bi-level turn your

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.670 
it's a little bit too bi-level turn your
head<00:01:19.140> for<00:01:19.350> me<00:01:20.060> so<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.840> way<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.170> we<00:01:22.259> would<00:01:22.380> fix

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
head for me so the way that we would fix

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.460 
head for me so the way that we would fix
that<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.610> might<00:01:24.270> be<00:01:24.509> unfortunate<00:01:24.869> for<00:01:25.170> her

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
that and it might be unfortunate for her

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.870 
that and it might be unfortunate for her
but<00:01:25.710> we<00:01:25.860> could<00:01:26.040> take<00:01:26.220> some<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.640> length

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
but we could take some of this length

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.960 
but we could take some of this length
off<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.860> that<00:01:28.860> would<00:01:29.009> bring<00:01:29.220> everything<00:01:29.610> up

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
off and that would bring everything up

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.580 
off and that would bring everything up
and<00:01:30.180> make<00:01:30.479> these<00:01:30.689> layers<00:01:30.960> appear<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.409> lot

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
and make these layers appear a lot

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.330 
and make these layers appear a lot
longer<00:01:32.270> and<00:01:33.270> that's<00:01:33.479> an<00:01:33.689> easy<00:01:33.840> fix<00:01:34.100> now<00:01:35.100> let's

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
longer and that's an easy fix now let's

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.690 
longer and that's an easy fix now let's
say<00:01:35.549> her<00:01:35.729> bangs<00:01:36.030> were<00:01:36.240> cut<00:01:36.420> too<00:01:36.659> short<00:01:37.700> or

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
say her bangs were cut too short or
