Megatron as you might know the last
video<00:00:07.830> was<00:00:08.070> g2<00:00:08.430> Optimus<00:00:08.760> Prime<00:00:09.030> so<00:00:09.360> I<00:00:09.390> had<00:00:09.750> to

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
video was g2 Optimus Prime so I had to

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.770 
video was g2 Optimus Prime so I had to
make<00:00:10.050> his<00:00:10.170> nemesis<00:00:10.680> which<00:00:10.950> is<00:00:11.100> g2<00:00:11.880> Megatron<00:00:12.450> I

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
make his nemesis which is g2 Megatron I

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.810 
make his nemesis which is g2 Megatron I
didn't<00:00:13.470> try<00:00:13.680> this<00:00:13.740> before<00:00:14.340> but<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.550> didn't<00:00:14.730> do

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
didn't try this before but I didn't do

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.460 
didn't try this before but I didn't do
it<00:00:14.910> in<00:00:15.000> g1<00:00:15.150> colors<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:15.810> was<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.930> lot<00:00:16.049> skinnier

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
it in g1 colors and was a lot skinnier

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.560 
it in g1 colors and was a lot skinnier
this<00:00:16.589> guy<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:16.859> more<00:00:17.039> true<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.339> the<00:00:17.460> toy<00:00:17.640> but<00:00:18.330> is

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
this guy is more true to the toy but is

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.029 
this guy is more true to the toy but is
more<00:00:18.720> poseable<00:00:19.289> because<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.589> original<00:00:19.890> toy

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
more poseable because the original toy

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.189 
more poseable because the original toy
was<00:00:20.189> pretty<00:00:20.429> much<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.640> brick<00:00:20.880> this<00:00:21.660> guy<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:21.960> the

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
was pretty much a brick this guy is the

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.200 
was pretty much a brick this guy is the
largest<00:00:22.470> Megatron<00:00:22.919> figure<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.400> did<00:00:23.730> he's

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
largest Megatron figure that I did he's

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.329 
largest Megatron figure that I did he's
about<00:00:24.539> almost<00:00:24.749> 30<00:00:25.109> inches<00:00:25.349> taller<00:00:25.710> together

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:26.339 
about almost 30 inches taller together

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:28.189 
about almost 30 inches taller together
ones<00:00:26.490> were<00:00:26.579> 11<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.029> half<00:00:27.089> almost<00:00:27.509> 12

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
ones were 11 and a half almost 12

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.229 
ones were 11 and a half almost 12
so<00:00:28.859> another<00:00:29.039> inch<00:00:29.310> taller<00:00:29.640> than<00:00:29.909> but<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.060> head

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:30.239 
so another inch taller than but a head

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:31.759 
so another inch taller than but a head
taller<00:00:30.509> this<00:00:30.810> guy<00:00:30.989> is<00:00:31.050> than<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.470> other<00:00:31.619> guys

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
taller this guy is than the other guys

g1<00:00:59.910> g2<00:01:00.450> toy<00:01:00.750> because<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.650> thought<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.920> was<00:01:02.010> a

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
g1 g2 toy because I thought it was a

g1 g2 toy because I thought it was a
little<00:01:02.280> ridiculous<00:01:02.640> then<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.660> think<00:01:03.870> it's

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:03.990 
little ridiculous then and I think it's

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.340 
little ridiculous then and I think it's
a<00:01:04.049> little<00:01:04.229> ridiculous<00:01:04.499> now<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:06.140> as<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.259> can

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
a little ridiculous now so as you can

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.179 
a little ridiculous now so as you can
see<00:01:07.409> more<00:01:08.280> or<00:01:08.399> less<00:01:08.429> it's<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.509> big<00:01:10.439> tank<00:01:10.710> with

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
see more or less it's a big tank with

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.090 
see more or less it's a big tank with
the<00:01:11.340> big<00:01:11.579> cannon<00:01:12.329> on<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.859> because<00:01:13.859> he's<00:01:13.979> gonna

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
the big cannon on it because he's gonna

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.130 
the big cannon on it because he's gonna
transform<00:01:14.520> into<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:15.090> big<00:01:15.509> evil

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
transform into a big evil

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.899 
transform into a big evil
Megatron<00:01:16.829> with<00:01:17.039> the<00:01:17.130> big<00:01:17.280> cannon<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:17.759> his

Megatron with the big cannon on his

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.130 
Megatron with the big cannon on his
shoulder<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.569> one<00:01:18.719> thing<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.899> did<00:01:19.049> differently

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
shoulder the one thing I did differently

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.800 
shoulder the one thing I did differently
from<00:01:19.679> the<00:01:19.770> toy<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.939> was<00:01:21.090> influenced<00:01:21.749> from

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
from the toy and I was influenced from

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.630 
from the toy and I was influenced from
the<00:01:21.960> original<00:01:22.229> g1<00:01:22.380> toy<00:01:22.799> obviously<00:01:23.249> and<00:01:23.460> then

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
the original g1 toy obviously and then

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.959 
the original g1 toy obviously and then
from<00:01:24.179> blasters<00:01:24.929> studios<00:01:25.289> as<00:01:25.469> well<00:01:25.499> he<00:01:26.399> let<00:01:26.729> the

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:26.969 
from blasters studios as well he let the

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:28.879 
from blasters studios as well he let the
cannon<00:01:27.659> go<00:01:27.689> on<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.170> arm<00:01:28.350> instead<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.799> the

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:28.889 
cannon go on the arm instead of the

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:30.260 
cannon go on the arm instead of the
shoulder<00:01:29.249> which<00:01:29.639> I<00:01:29.729> actually<00:01:29.789> did<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.179> my

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
shoulder which I actually did on my

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.789 
shoulder which I actually did on my
other<00:01:30.420> model<00:01:30.749> as<00:01:30.869> well<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.259> it's<00:01:31.380> not<00:01:31.590> really<00:01:31.770> a

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
other model as well so it's not really a

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.800 
other model as well so it's not really a
new<00:01:31.889> surprise<00:01:32.399> or<00:01:32.579> anything<00:01:32.759> just<00:01:33.329> looks<00:01:33.569> kind

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
new surprise or anything just looks kind

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.230 
new surprise or anything just looks kind
of<00:01:33.840> better<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.170> more<00:01:34.920> poseable<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:35.639> let's<00:01:36.090> not

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
of better and more poseable so let's not

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.169 
of better and more poseable so let's not
let's<00:01:36.509> stop<00:01:36.630> yapping<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:38.460> turret<00:01:38.759> can<00:01:38.939> go<00:01:39.030> up

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
let's stop yapping the turret can go up

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:41.599 
let's stop yapping the turret can go up
and<00:01:39.329> down<00:01:39.920> you<00:01:40.920> can<00:01:40.950> deal<00:01:41.189> with<00:01:41.219> that<00:01:41.369> really

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:41.609 
and down you can deal with that really

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:44.359 
and down you can deal with that really
want<00:01:41.759> with<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.999> turret<00:01:42.380> that's<00:01:43.380> about<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.799> you

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
want with the turret that's about it you

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.859 
want with the turret that's about it you
can't<00:01:44.810> move<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.990> turret<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.859> way<00:01:47.869> because

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
can't move the turret this way because

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.929 
can't move the turret this way because
like<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.469> original<00:01:49.709> toy<00:01:49.829> it's<00:01:50.009> it's<00:01:50.249> the<00:01:50.609> arms

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
like the original toy it's it's the arms

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.429 
like the original toy it's it's the arms
or<00:01:51.270> part<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.719> turret<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.049> they<00:01:52.200> cannot

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
or part of the turret and they cannot

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.940 
or part of the turret and they cannot
transform<00:01:53.039> and<00:01:53.189> rotate<00:01:53.369> at<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.639> same<00:01:53.700> time<00:01:54.090> so

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
transform and rotate at the same time so

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.199 
transform and rotate at the same time so
transformation<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.069> this<00:01:56.189> guy<00:01:56.429> pretty<00:01:57.060> much

00:01:57.199 --> 00:01:57.209 
transformation of this guy pretty much

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:59.480 
transformation of this guy pretty much
like<00:01:57.539> the<00:01:57.659> g1<00:01:58.020> toy<00:01:58.350> we're<00:01:58.979> going<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.159> lift<00:01:59.310> him

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
like the g1 toy we're going to lift him

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
later they can be pegged or they can

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.900 
later they can be pegged or they can
hang<00:03:18.900> down<00:03:19.110> but<00:03:19.290> I<00:03:19.380> wanted<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.710> true<00:03:19.890> tread<00:03:20.220> so

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
hang down but I wanted a true tread so

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.790 
hang down but I wanted a true tread so
we<00:03:21.300> need<00:03:21.420> to<00:03:21.540> get<00:03:21.690> out<00:03:21.870> of<00:03:21.960> the<00:03:22.110> way<00:03:22.260> so<00:03:22.770> let's

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
we need to get out of the way so let's

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.090 
we need to get out of the way so let's
just<00:03:23.370> flip<00:03:23.760> it<00:03:23.820> back<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.720> out<00:03:25.110> of<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.380> way<00:03:25.530> you

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
just flip it back and out of the way you

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.710 
just flip it back and out of the way you
can<00:03:26.250> peg<00:03:26.550> them<00:03:26.760> you<00:03:26.850> can<00:03:27.030> see<00:03:27.180> these<00:03:27.270> pegs<00:03:27.540> on

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
can peg them you can see these pegs on

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.870

up but I did take the treads into two

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.890 
up but I did take the treads into two
sections<00:06:35.530> and<00:06:36.530> use<00:06:36.740> real<00:06:36.980> treads<00:06:37.780> instead<00:06:38.780> of

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 
sections and use real treads instead of

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:44.100 
sections and use real treads instead of
my<00:06:39.080> previous<00:06:39.530> version<00:06:39.980> so<00:06:41.140> that<00:06:42.140> is<00:06:42.410> that<00:06:42.830> so

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.110 
my previous version so that is that so

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:48.070 
my previous version so that is that so
again<00:06:45.610> the<00:06:46.610> original<00:06:46.700> was<00:06:47.030> a<00:06:47.060> brick<00:06:47.360> this<00:06:47.780> guy
