00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.480
 hello to all this video I make you 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.330
 see a very tasty recipe I would like 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.360
 This year milk is never a cousin 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.300
 of rice milk you know the one you blame with 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.400
 milk and rice for us of course 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.060
 instead of using we reuse the 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.160
 spelled and using it broken to do it 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.560
 we take that of promises that to 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.810
 who can no longer small because the beans 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.390
 to do have account been chopped 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.989
 so one can faster remains one 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.969
 a little more delicate we like the most is one 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.300
 perfect breakfast because nutritious 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.840
 light and also a very good dessert 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.289
 to eat and to present and it is 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.199
 very easy to do and will be respected 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.170
 to do it we will go to the end and milk us 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.270
 we are the one at home soy goes wrong in 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.030
 powder a bit of starch some 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.350
 we also put a dark chocolate 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.750
 little bit of vanilla and sweetener 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.810
 activity but maple syrup in the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.520
 spectator we have already ceased 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:14.090
 here we add other things on average 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:16.799
 milk we take the family name because I laugh 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.500
 every time I do it I'm wrong 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.600
 in theory I should dissolve the video 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.759
 with milk, however, I am punctually 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.759
 I forget then we all put in 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.070
 call right then take them right 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.439
 in short, a beautiful reborn you choose 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.210
 first no I am published that makes you 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.939
 some roms 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.490
 add the vanilla if you don't have it 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.670
 natural liquid aroma 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.700
 put a vanilla bean on it 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.090
 similar cadets we put ourselves in pieces of 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.490
 dark chocolate and we put it there 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.430
 maple syrup all the things 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.549
 find both some other notes 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.110
 name in the information hub 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.700
 now we can put on fire when 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.700
 will start to boil will be ready 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.950
 obviously like the 33 me to cook it 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:09.239
 mix them otherwise they might 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.850
 burning on the bottom 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:15.989
 surely more will burn on the bottom 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:20.310
 keep fire high enough and how much 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:23.640
 bubbles for good we can support the 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.519
