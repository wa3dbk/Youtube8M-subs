of<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:51.100> lightning<00:02:51.430> gun<00:02:51.580> most<00:02:52.150> of<00:02:52.300> the<00:02:52.390> weapons

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
of the lightning gun most of the weapons

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.880 
of the lightning gun most of the weapons
I<00:02:52.750> find<00:02:52.990> in<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.230> game<00:02:53.380> are<00:02:53.500> actually<00:02:53.770> pretty

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
I find in the game are actually pretty

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.800 
I find in the game are actually pretty
powerful<00:02:54.280> like<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.730> enforcers<00:02:55.270> you<00:02:55.690> can

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
powerful like the enforcers you can

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.030 
powerful like the enforcers you can
actually<00:02:56.110> like<00:02:56.230> take<00:02:56.380> someone<00:02:56.650> down<00:02:56.680> like

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
actually like take someone down like

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.410 
actually like take someone down like
it's<00:02:57.220> hard<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:57.490> you<00:02:57.640> know<00:02:57.670> his<00:02:57.940> aiming<00:02:58.300> is

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
it's hard to you know his aiming is

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.210 
it's hard to you know his aiming is
important<00:02:58.870> yeah<00:02:59.080> the<00:02:59.260> orc<00:02:59.470> enforces<00:02:59.890> a<00:02:59.920> fine

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
important yeah the orc enforces a fine

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.430 
important yeah the orc enforces a fine
weapon<00:03:00.430> and<00:03:00.820> I<00:03:00.970> think<00:03:01.209> that<00:03:01.390> you<00:03:02.110> know<00:03:02.230> like

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
was and I understand why this is but

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.830 
was and I understand why this is but
