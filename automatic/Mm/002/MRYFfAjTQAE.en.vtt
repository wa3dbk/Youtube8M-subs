will be your starting line it will
obviously<00:00:42.950> be<00:00:43.219> starting<00:00:43.730> line<00:00:43.820> but<00:00:43.940> it's

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
obviously be starting line but it's

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.060 
obviously be starting line but it's
gonna<00:00:44.120> be<00:00:44.210> in<00:00:44.300> the<00:00:44.390> pits<00:00:44.660> and<00:00:44.990> as<00:00:45.560> you<00:00:45.710> see<00:00:45.920> it

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
gonna be in the pits and as you see it

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.590 
gonna be in the pits and as you see it
says<00:00:46.310> a<00:00:46.480> your<00:00:47.480> it<00:00:47.810> you<00:00:48.410> have<00:00:48.530> to<00:00:48.650> put<00:00:48.800> on<00:00:48.980> tag<00:00:49.220> on

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
says a your it you have to put on tag on

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.319 
says a your it you have to put on tag on
line<00:00:50.600> two<00:00:50.900> practices<00:00:51.829> first<00:00:52.220> off<00:00:52.490> but<00:00:52.910> that's

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
line two practices first off but that's

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.880 
line two practices first off but that's
why<00:00:53.540> we'll<00:00:53.870> be<00:00:54.079> doing<00:00:54.410> it<00:00:54.590> for<00:00:55.340> the<00:00:55.550> event<00:00:56.890> so

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
why we'll be doing it for the event so

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.250 
why we'll be doing it for the event so
you'll<00:00:58.040> roll<00:00:58.250> off<00:00:58.430> here<00:01:01.810> so<00:01:02.810> you'll<00:01:02.930> be<00:01:03.050> doing

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
you'll roll off here so you'll be doing

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.720 
you'll roll off here so you'll be doing
about<00:01:03.380> 50<00:01:03.590> miles<00:01:03.920> an<00:01:04.100> hour

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:05.730 
about 50 miles an hour

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.040 
about 50 miles an hour
then<00:01:06.300> right<00:01:07.170> here<00:01:07.200> at<00:01:07.620> this<00:01:07.800> I<00:01:09.050> guess

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
then right here at this I guess

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.500 
then right here at this I guess
scoreboard<00:01:10.740> you'd<00:01:10.980> call<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.370> that's<00:01:12.150> where

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
scoreboard you'd call it that's where

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.280 
scoreboard you'd call it that's where
you<00:01:12.750> will<00:01:13.080> end<00:01:13.410> your<00:01:13.650> 50<00:01:14.190> right<00:01:14.970> here<00:01:18.290> so

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
you will end your 50 right here so

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.570 
you will end your 50 right here so
you'll<00:01:19.440> come<00:01:19.470> in

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.320 

and<00:01:23.060> you'll<00:01:23.510> be<00:01:23.660> home<00:01:24.350> but<00:01:25.120> swinging<00:01:26.120> out

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
and you'll be home but swinging out

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.860 
and you'll be home but swinging out
water<00:01:26.660> here

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
this inside this way your first clipping

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.480 
this inside this way your first clipping
point<00:01:48.979> it'd<00:01:49.979> be<00:01:50.340> on<00:01:50.550> the<00:01:50.640> inside<00:01:50.820> right<00:01:51.270> there

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
point it'd be on the inside right there

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.560 
point it'd be on the inside right there
then<00:01:53.490> you'll<00:01:53.640> hit<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.790> touch<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.270> go<00:01:54.360> right

go

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:26.500 

I've<00:02:15.840> been<00:02:15.990> able<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.460> so<00:02:17.460> much<00:02:17.670> right

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.429 

there<00:02:27.049> are<00:02:27.230> two<00:02:28.129> speed<00:02:28.489> zones<00:02:28.989> one<00:02:29.989> is<00:02:30.170> on<00:02:30.319> the

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:30.439 
there are two speed zones one is on the

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:32.710 
there are two speed zones one is on the
outside<00:02:30.769> clip<00:02:31.189> like<00:02:31.790> entering<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.390> outside

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
outside clip like entering the outside

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.360 
outside clip like entering the outside
calypso<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:33.200> get<00:02:33.379> your<00:02:33.500> entry<00:02:33.769> speed<00:02:34.129> and

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
calypso you get your entry speed and

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.660 
calypso you get your entry speed and
then<00:02:35.329> the<00:02:35.450> other<00:02:35.480> one<00:02:35.840> is<00:02:36.310> right<00:02:37.310> ere<00:02:37.489> you

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
then the other one is right ere you

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:51.170 
then the other one is right ere you
touch<00:02:38.209> and<00:02:38.420> go

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.479 

so<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:51.900> definitely<00:02:52.230> did<00:02:52.709> not<00:02:52.739> get<00:02:53.099> after<00:02:53.340> that

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
so it definitely did not get after that

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.330 
so it definitely did not get after that
so<00:02:54.390> like<00:02:54.719> I<00:02:54.810> should<00:02:55.049> have<00:02:55.140> needed

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
so like I should have needed

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.300 
so like I should have needed
I<00:02:57.430> also<00:02:57.879> didn't<00:02:58.269> get<00:02:58.360> out

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.510
