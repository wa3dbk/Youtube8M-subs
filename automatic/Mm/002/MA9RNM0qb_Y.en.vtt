00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.020 

yeah<00:01:07.390> that's<00:01:07.660> much<00:01:07.840> nicer

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.350 

and<00:01:12.659> then<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.080> simple<00:01:13.500> will<00:01:14.340> start<00:01:14.729> mod

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:27.090 

it's<00:01:17.540> off<00:01:17.780> now<00:01:17.810> it's<00:01:18.380> on

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.340 

boost<00:01:28.100> it<00:01:28.340> up<00:01:28.430> quite<00:01:28.760> nicely<00:01:31.120> then<00:01:32.120> I'm<00:01:32.350> cue

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
boost it up quite nicely then I'm cue

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:49.780 
boost it up quite nicely then I'm cue
screamer

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.200 

and<00:01:50.510> chip<00:01:50.810> screaming<00:01:51.230> would<00:01:51.380> they<00:01:51.530> eat<00:01:52.210> punch

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210

see<00:02:01.679> I'd<00:02:01.920> worse<00:02:07.369> it<00:02:08.369> really<00:02:08.610> gives<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.209> punch

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:22.130

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:53.770 

I<00:02:34.250> said<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.030> punch<00:02:35.270> mod<00:02:35.510> really<00:02:35.930> is<00:02:36.170> worth

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.180 

you

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.240 

see<00:03:10.060> how<00:03:10.180> they<00:03:10.330> those<00:03:11.170> that<00:03:11.470> are<00:03:11.560> both<00:03:12.070> the

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
see how they those that are both the

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.250 
see how they those that are both the
switch<00:03:12.490> works

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.319 

uh
