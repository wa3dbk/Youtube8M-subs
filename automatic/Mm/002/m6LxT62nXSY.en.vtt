once<00:00:30.539> windows<00:00:30.900> 8<00:00:31.349> hits<00:00:31.769> then<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.610> might<00:00:33.180> be<00:00:33.329> able

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
once windows 8 hits then I might be able

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.030 
once windows 8 hits then I might be able
to<00:00:33.510> give<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.690> more<00:00:33.870> rounded<00:00:34.290> answer<00:00:34.710> but<00:00:34.860> for

store<00:01:01.440> for<00:01:01.770> desktop<00:01:02.399> apps<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:03.180> course<00:01:03.480> we<00:01:03.660> can

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
store for desktop apps of course we can

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.299

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
machines as well so it really does work

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.920

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
I really do actually like rather than

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.760 
I really do actually like rather than
using<00:01:13.950> software<00:01:14.700> update<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:16.110> when<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.590> comes

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
using software update so when it comes

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.710 
using software update so when it comes
to<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.070> Apple<00:01:17.610> sort<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:17.970> ecosystem

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
everything seems to work great when it

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.060 
everything seems to work great when it
comes<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.810> Microsoft<00:01:22.439> things<00:01:22.799> are<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> little

big success on their hands but we really

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.490 
big success on their hands but we really
have<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.090> wait<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.540> see<00:01:57.570> till<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.140> full

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.660 
smoothly things work I certainly think
when<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:03.960> comes<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.350> cloud-based<00:02:04.770> services

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
when it comes to cloud-based services

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.850 
when it comes to cloud-based services
both<00:02:06.360> are<00:02:06.600> going<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.780> be<00:02:06.899> very<00:02:06.930> equal<00:02:07.680> in<00:02:07.829> terms

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
both are going to be very equal in terms

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.839 
both are going to be very equal in terms
of<00:02:08.399> features<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.470> functionality<00:02:10.670> it's<00:02:11.670> just

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
of features and functionality it's just

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.940 
of features and functionality it's just
when<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.090> comes<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.629> outside<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.410> things

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
when it comes to the outside of things

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.190 
when it comes to the outside of things
I<00:02:14.040> do<00:02:14.340> sort<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:14.760> worried<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.540> Microsoft

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
I do sort of worried that Microsoft

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.650 
I do sort of worried that Microsoft
might<00:02:16.650> not<00:02:16.890> get<00:02:17.069> it<00:02:17.160> right<00:02:17.430> first<00:02:17.459> time<00:02:18.120> round

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
might not get it right first time round

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.630 
might not get it right first time round
but<00:02:19.349> I<00:02:19.379> do<00:02:19.470> hope<00:02:19.800> they<00:02:20.010> do<00:02:20.069> because

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
but I do hope they do because

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.570 
but I do hope they do because
competition<00:02:21.300> means<00:02:22.080> we<00:02:22.349> get<00:02:22.530> better<00:02:22.860> things

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
competition means we get better things

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.309 
competition means we get better things
out<00:02:23.819> of<00:02:23.910> both<00:02:24.120> camps<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:24.840> it'd<00:02:24.959> be<00:02:24.989> really

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
out of both camps so it'd be really

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.869 
out of both camps so it'd be really
interesting<00:02:26.069> to<00:02:26.099> watch<00:02:26.340> this<00:02:26.640> space

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
interesting to watch this space

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.000 
interesting to watch this space
certainly<00:02:27.390> over<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.690> next<00:02:27.959> sort<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.680> six<00:02:28.860> to

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
certainly over the next sort of six to

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.130 
certainly over the next sort of six to
nine<00:02:29.160> months<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.670> see<00:02:29.849> how<00:02:30.090> Microsoft<00:02:30.720> shape

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
nine months to see how Microsoft shape

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.770 
nine months to see how Microsoft shape
