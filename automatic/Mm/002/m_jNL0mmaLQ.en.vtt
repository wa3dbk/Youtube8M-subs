on menu and search here gparted this is
the<00:01:00.079> this<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.409> tool<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.680> we<00:01:02.070> just

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
the this is the tool that we just

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.230 
the this is the tool that we just
installed<00:01:02.960> so<00:01:03.960> let's<00:01:04.470> launch<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:06.000> is

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
installed so let's launch this it is

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.260 
installed so let's launch this it is
asking<00:01:06.659> for<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.770> root<00:01:07.950> possible<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:09.240> just

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
asking for the root possible so just

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.520 
asking for the root possible so just
enter<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.369> authenticate<00:01:11.990> so<00:01:12.990> for<00:01:13.380> the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
enter this and authenticate so for the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.289 
enter this and authenticate so for the
first<00:01:13.710> time<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.190> searching<00:01:14.520> for<00:01:14.549> all<00:01:15.060> of

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
first time it is searching for all of

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:23.210 
first time it is searching for all of
the<00:01:15.509> partitions<00:01:21.500> this<00:01:22.500> would<00:01:22.740> take<00:01:22.950> few

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
the partitions this would take few

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:32.070 
the partitions this would take few
seconds

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.160

is for the disk used space and this
white<00:01:51.110> is<00:01:51.290> for<00:01:51.560> unused<00:01:52.100> space<00:01:52.550> and<00:01:53.150> here<00:01:53.990> I<00:01:54.170> am

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
white is for unused space and here I am

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.420 
white is for unused space and here I am
going<00:01:54.620> to<00:01:54.830> show<00:01:55.040> you<00:01:55.100> how<00:01:55.610> you<00:01:55.670> can<00:01:56.150> just

going to show you how you can just

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.490 
going to show you how you can just
modify<00:01:58.430> the<00:01:58.730> partition<00:01:59.570> or<00:01:59.840> you<00:01:59.960> can<00:02:00.110> edit<00:02:00.230> the

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
modify the partition or you can edit the

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.950 
modify the partition or you can edit the
partition<00:02:01.280> so<00:02:02.260> this<00:02:03.260> is<00:02:03.440> the<00:02:03.680> hard<00:02:04.340> disk<00:02:04.960> with

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
partition so this is the hard disk with

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.080 
partition so this is the hard disk with
label<00:02:06.380> name<00:02:06.590> collection<00:02:07.220> and<00:02:07.430> other<00:02:07.820> is

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
label name collection and other is

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.840 
label name collection and other is
personal<00:02:08.780> level<00:02:09.470> so<00:02:09.679> let's<00:02:10.280> select<00:02:10.429> any<00:02:10.760> one

we can do here I am NOT going to delete

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.710 
we can do here I am NOT going to delete
this<00:03:33.920> because<00:03:34.310> I<00:03:34.430> don't<00:03:34.640> have<00:03:34.879> the<00:03:35.060> backup<00:03:35.269> so

this because I don't have the backup so

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.720 
this because I don't have the backup so
it<00:03:35.870> is<00:03:35.989> always<00:03:36.909> preferred<00:03:37.909> to<00:03:38.209> have<00:03:38.780> backup

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
it is always preferred to have backup

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.390 
it is always preferred to have backup
while<00:03:40.730> you<00:03:40.940> are<00:03:41.060> doing<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.750> partition<00:03:42.440> so<00:03:43.160> I'm

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
while you are doing the partition so I'm

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.160 
while you are doing the partition so I'm
not<00:03:43.549> going<00:03:43.760> to<00:03:43.849> delete<00:03:44.150> this<00:03:44.360> another<00:03:44.900> thing

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
not going to delete this another thing

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.750 
not going to delete this another thing
is<00:03:45.379> I<00:03:45.670> am<00:03:46.670> going<00:03:46.879> to<00:03:46.970> resize<00:03:47.450> this<00:03:47.780> or<00:03:48.760> just

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
is I am going to resize this or just

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.670 
is I am going to resize this or just
click<00:03:50.540> here<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:52.629> minimum<00:03:53.629> size<00:03:53.870> is<00:03:53.900> here<00:03:54.440> you

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
click here and minimum size is here you

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.759 
click here and minimum size is here you
can<00:03:54.890> see<00:03:54.920> 64<00:03:55.879> MB<00:03:56.239> 72<00:03:57.140> and<00:03:57.349> be<00:03:57.530> for<00:03:57.950> maximum<00:03:58.340> size

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
can see 64 MB 72 and be for maximum size

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:09.990 
can see 64 MB 72 and be for maximum size
so<00:04:00.769> here's<00:04:01.579> the<00:04:01.819> free<00:04:02.090> space<00:04:03.970> let<00:04:04.970> it<00:04:05.120> be

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.060 

just<00:04:10.750> I'm<00:04:10.960> giving<00:04:11.290> it<00:04:11.410> a<00:04:11.440> random<00:04:11.920> number

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:19.240 

something<00:04:15.070> like

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.870 

a<00:04:19.720> thousand<00:04:20.720> MIB

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:35.070 

so<00:04:26.880> free<00:04:27.840> space<00:04:28.229> proceeding

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.800 

so<00:04:35.919> here's<00:04:36.430> the

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.960 

7,000<00:04:40.810> align<00:04:41.560> to<00:04:41.979> might<00:04:42.520> be<00:04:43.830> okay<00:04:44.830> so<00:04:45.580> I'm

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
7,000 align to might be okay so I'm

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:56.210 
7,000 align to might be okay so I'm
leaving<00:04:46.240> this<00:04:47.009> click<00:04:48.009> here<00:04:48.039> resize<00:04:48.759> your<00:04:49.000> move

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.320 

so<00:04:56.880> this<00:04:57.860> partition<00:04:58.860> moving<00:04:59.550> will<00:04:59.790> take<00:05:00.060> long

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
so this partition moving will take long

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.450 
so this partition moving will take long
time<00:05:00.360> to<00:05:00.660> apply<00:05:01.190> so<00:05:02.190> click<00:05:02.490> here<00:05:02.520> ok<00:05:03.000> now<00:05:04.460> you

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
time to apply so click here ok now you

time to apply so click here ok now you
can<00:05:05.760> see<00:05:05.970> there<00:05:06.240> is<00:05:06.390> a<00:05:08.570> unallocated<00:05:09.570> space<00:05:10.020> of

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
can see there is a unallocated space of

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.890 
can see there is a unallocated space of
this<00:05:11.360> 6.8<00:05:12.360> GP<00:05:12.870> is<00:05:13.080> created<00:05:13.650> to<00:05:13.740> be<00:05:13.860> just<00:05:14.900> string

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
this 6.8 GP is created to be just string

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.710 
this 6.8 GP is created to be just string
