right<00:05:01.800> I'm<00:05:02.009> an<00:05:02.219> advocate<00:05:02.400> of<00:05:02.940> playing<00:05:03.479> the

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:03.659 
right I'm an advocate of playing the

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:06.020 
right I'm an advocate of playing the
game<00:05:03.840> on<00:05:04.259> the<00:05:04.710> hardest<00:05:05.310> difficulty<00:05:05.639> setting

game on the hardest difficulty setting

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.209 
game on the hardest difficulty setting
I'm<00:05:06.330> one<00:05:06.539> of<00:05:06.629> those<00:05:06.690> guys<00:05:06.780> I<00:05:06.900> think<00:05:07.319> that<00:05:08.069> the

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:08.219 
I'm one of those guys I think that the

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:12.430 
I'm one of those guys I think that the
game<00:05:08.430> is<00:05:08.639> meant<00:05:08.969> to<00:05:09.150> be<00:05:09.180> played<00:05:09.800> on<00:05:10.800> hard

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
game is meant to be played on hard

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.839 
game is meant to be played on hard
mainly<00:05:13.440> because<00:05:13.469> it<00:05:13.889> gives<00:05:14.009> you<00:05:14.219> different

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849 
mainly because it gives you different

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:19.879 
mainly because it gives you different
things<00:05:15.319> Ranger<00:05:16.319> hardcore<00:05:17.039> mode<00:05:17.250> is<00:05:18.710> stupid<00:05:19.710> I

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
things Ranger hardcore mode is stupid I

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:23.089 
things Ranger hardcore mode is stupid I
must<00:05:20.759> say<00:05:20.909> it's<00:05:21.449> stupid<00:05:21.930> I<00:05:22.139> was<00:05:22.590> gonna<00:05:22.860> do<00:05:23.009> it

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:23.099 
must say it's stupid I was gonna do it

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:27.449 
debating not doing it now just because

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:29.540 
debating not doing it now just because
of<00:05:27.659> how<00:05:27.840> frustrating<00:05:28.680> range<00:05:28.949> or<00:05:29.099> hardcore

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
of how frustrating range or hardcore

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.879 
of how frustrating range or hardcore
mode<00:05:29.729> is<00:05:29.940> hope<00:05:30.120> is<00:05:30.539> and<00:05:30.930> it's<00:05:31.409> not<00:05:31.560> because

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:31.889 
mode is hope is and it's not because

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:35.480 
mode is hope is and it's not because
it's<00:05:32.279> a<00:05:32.370> hard<00:05:32.759> game<00:05:33.240> mode<00:05:33.569> the<00:05:34.229> game<00:05:34.560> is<00:05:34.860> really

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
it's a hard game mode the game is really

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.830

really<00:05:56.879> a<00:05:56.909> concern<00:05:57.150> I<00:05:57.360> think<00:05:57.750> there<00:05:57.840> was<00:05:57.960> like

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
really a concern I think there was like

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.640 
really a concern I think there was like
two<00:05:58.289> times<00:05:58.590> I<00:05:58.860> ever<00:05:58.889> had<00:05:59.159> a<00:05:59.340> mo<00:05:59.719> problems<00:06:00.719> and<00:06:01.020> a

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
two times I ever had a mo problems and a

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:02.930 
two times I ever had a mo problems and a
lot<00:06:01.979> of<00:06:02.219> that<00:06:02.400> could<00:06:02.520> have<00:06:02.610> been<00:06:02.699> alleviated

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
lot of that could have been alleviated

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.670 
lot of that could have been alleviated
might<00:06:03.330> be<00:06:03.449> just<00:06:03.659> switching<00:06:03.990> to<00:06:04.169> my

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
might be just switching to my

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.490 
might be just switching to my
overabundant<00:06:05.580> cost<00:06:06.360> of<00:06:06.569> a<00:06:06.599> military<00:06:07.080> military

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500

kind of bothered me is that they the
military-grade<00:06:20.159> ammunition<00:06:20.789> is<00:06:20.909> worthless
