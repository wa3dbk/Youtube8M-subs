00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.250 
had originally intended but I think it I
think<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:21.870> ended<00:02:22.470> up<00:02:22.560> being<00:02:22.740> a<00:02:22.860> good<00:02:23.820> balance

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
think it ended up being a good balance

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.850 
think it ended up being a good balance
between<00:02:26.270> between<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.800> number<00:02:28.800> of

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
between between the number of

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.260 
between between the number of
instrumental<00:02:29.310> tracks<00:02:29.550> on<00:02:29.700> there<00:02:29.850> too<00:02:30.000> so<00:02:30.180> the

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
instrumental tracks on there too so the

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.550 
instrumental tracks on there too so the
good<00:02:30.450> balance<00:02:30.750> between<00:02:30.780> instrumentals

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
good balance between instrumentals

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.150 
good balance between instrumentals
vehicles<00:02:32.780> different<00:02:33.780> styles<00:02:34.560> of<00:02:34.620> singing<00:02:34.980> on

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
vehicles different styles of singing on

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.940 
vehicles different styles of singing on
writing<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.850> yeah<00:02:36.060> I<00:02:36.300> really<00:02:36.840> tried<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:37.500> make

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
writing and yeah I really tried to make

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.920 
writing and yeah I really tried to make
an<00:02:38.730> album<00:02:38.910> that<00:02:39.090> flowed<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:41.610> from<00:02:42.540> beginning

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
an album that flowed and from beginning

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.990 
an album that flowed and from beginning
to<00:02:43.020> end<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.470> could<00:02:43.800> be<00:02:43.920> listened<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.310> as<00:02:44.580> you

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
to end and could be listened to as you

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.260 
to end and could be listened to as you
know<00:02:45.150> you're<00:02:46.020> looking<00:02:46.080> at<00:02:46.320> camera<00:02:46.709> display

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
know you're looking at camera display

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.990 
know you're looking at camera display
from<00:02:48.270> beginning<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.750> end<00:02:48.780> us<00:02:49.050> as<00:02:49.350> a<00:02:49.790> as<00:02:50.790> an

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
from beginning to end us as a as an

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.560 
from beginning to end us as a as an
album<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.540> I<00:02:52.140> think<00:02:52.440> that<00:02:53.010> become<00:02:53.400> whom<00:02:54.240> I

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
album and I think that become whom I

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.810 
album and I think that become whom I
felt<00:02:54.959> that<00:02:55.020> it<00:02:55.200> was<00:02:55.650> becoming<00:02:55.980> a<00:02:56.100> lost<00:02:56.280> art<00:02:56.490> the

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
felt that it was becoming a lost art the

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.820 
felt that it was becoming a lost art the
songs<00:02:57.060> came<00:02:57.450> further<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:58.080> was<00:02:58.200> very<00:02:58.440> important

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
songs came further it was very important

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.170 
songs came further it was very important
to<00:02:58.860> me<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:59.160> put<00:02:59.430> them<00:02:59.520> together<00:02:59.700> into<00:03:00.030> a

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
to me to put them together into a

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.640 
to me to put them together into a
cohesive<00:03:01.250> unit<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:02.430> therefore<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.810> song

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
cohesive unit and therefore the song

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.620 
cohesive unit and therefore the song
sequencing<00:03:05.310> was<00:03:05.430> done<00:03:05.670> a<00:03:05.700> very<00:03:06.090> early<00:03:06.450> stage

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
sequencing was done a very early stage

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.830 
sequencing was done a very early stage
in<00:03:07.020> the<00:03:07.140> game<00:03:07.170> very<00:03:07.769> often<00:03:08.180> 1<00:03:09.180> records<00:03:09.750> an

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
in the game very often 1 records an

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.900 
in the game very often 1 records an
album<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:10.620> it's<00:03:10.800> that<00:03:11.010> this<00:03:11.130> whole<00:03:11.370> game<00:03:11.640> of

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
album and it's that this whole game of

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.670 
album and it's that this whole game of
like<00:03:12.090> moving<00:03:12.540> titles<00:03:12.959> around<00:03:13.230> what's<00:03:13.560> the

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
like moving titles around what's the

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.440 
like moving titles around what's the
sequence<00:03:13.890> going<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.310> be<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:14.610> you<00:03:15.180> know<00:03:15.300> it's

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
sequence going to be and you know it's

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.820 
sequence going to be and you know it's
done<00:03:15.600> right<00:03:15.780> at<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:15.989> last<00:03:16.110> minute<00:03:16.350> but<00:03:16.500> I<00:03:16.560> knew

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
done right at the last minute but I knew

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.120 
done right at the last minute but I knew
that<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.310> song<00:03:17.519> sequence<00:03:17.940> way<00:03:18.480> back<00:03:19.440> in<00:03:19.650> the

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
that the song sequence way back in the

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.860 
that the song sequence way back in the
process<00:03:20.670> and<00:03:20.820> so<00:03:21.540> that<00:03:21.870> that<00:03:22.350> sort<00:03:23.100> of<00:03:23.570> ties<00:03:24.570> in

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
process and so that that sort of ties in

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.930 
process and so that that sort of ties in
with<00:03:25.110> what<00:03:25.170> I<00:03:25.320> was<00:03:25.470> saying<00:03:25.709> about<00:03:25.890> you<00:03:26.820> know

with what I was saying about you know

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.270 
with what I was saying about you know
recording<00:03:27.600> an<00:03:27.660> album<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:28.140> I<00:03:28.170> knew<00:03:28.860> what<00:03:29.160> the

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
recording an album I I knew what the

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.740 
recording an album I I knew what the
order<00:03:29.580> was<00:03:29.700> going<00:03:29.880> to<00:03:29.940> be<00:03:30.060> in<00:03:30.120> which<00:03:30.300> started

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
order was going to be in which started

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.550 
order was going to be in which started
you<00:03:30.870> know<00:03:30.989> and<00:03:31.230> how<00:03:31.560> it<00:03:31.709> was<00:03:31.800> going<00:03:31.980> to<00:03:32.070> flow

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
you know and how it was going to flow

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.000 
you know and how it was going to flow
with<00:03:34.560> an<00:03:35.550> idea<00:03:35.940> because<00:03:36.300> tempos<00:03:37.080> and<00:03:37.380> keys<00:03:37.620> and

with an idea because tempos and keys and
everything<00:03:38.100> juxtaposition<00:03:39.090> tempers<00:03:39.450> keys

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
everything juxtaposition tempers keys

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.380 
everything juxtaposition tempers keys
instrumental<00:03:40.800> vocals<00:03:41.310> all<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.120> sort<00:03:42.330> of

instrumental vocals all the sort of
things<00:03:42.540> very<00:03:42.720> important<00:03:43.080> to<00:03:43.140> do<00:03:43.260> this<00:03:43.410> early

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
things very important to do this early

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.380 
things very important to do this early
on<00:03:43.739> early<00:03:44.190> on<00:03:44.220> because<00:03:44.580> it<00:03:44.820> can<00:03:45.239> actually

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
on early on because it can actually

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.520 
on early on because it can actually
interest<00:03:45.870> how<00:03:46.739> you<00:03:46.799> arranged<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.580> song<00:03:47.820> and

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
interest how you arranged the song and

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.039 
interest how you arranged the song and
how<00:03:49.700> long<00:03:50.700> song<00:03:51.120> is<00:03:51.239> going<00:03:51.420> to<00:03:51.480> be<00:03:51.600> in<00:03:51.750> whether

how long song is going to be in whether

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.509 
how long song is going to be in whether
you<00:03:52.170> need<00:03:52.350> to<00:03:52.560> edit<00:03:52.709> it<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.070> all<00:03:53.190> the<00:03:53.280> sort<00:03:53.489> of

you need to edit it and all the sort of

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.360 
you need to edit it and all the sort of
thing<00:03:53.700> but<00:03:53.850> I<00:03:54.060> knew<00:03:54.709> quite<00:03:55.709> I<00:03:56.510> knew<00:03:57.510> what<00:03:57.660> I<00:03:57.690> was

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
thing but I knew quite I knew what I was

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.160 
thing but I knew quite I knew what I was
making<00:03:59.370> quite<00:03:59.730> quite<00:04:00.180> early<00:04:00.360> on<00:04:00.540> is<00:04:00.870> very

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
making quite quite early on is very

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.699 
making quite quite early on is very
little<00:04:01.519> experimentation<00:04:02.519> as<00:04:02.880> such<00:04:03.150> I<00:04:03.709> knew

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
little experimentation as such I knew

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.229 
little experimentation as such I knew
what<00:04:04.920> overdubs<00:04:05.370> needed<00:04:05.700> to<00:04:05.790> be<00:04:05.910> done<00:04:06.060> of

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
what overdubs needed to be done of

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.120 
what overdubs needed to be done of
course<00:04:06.420> as<00:04:06.540> always<00:04:06.630> room<00:04:07.019> for<00:04:07.380> spontaneous

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
course as always room for spontaneous

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.670 
course as always room for spontaneous
continuity<00:04:09.030> and<00:04:09.269> certain<00:04:10.260> things<00:04:10.290> may<00:04:10.650> not

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
continuity and certain things may not

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.000 
continuity and certain things may not
quite<00:04:11.190> work<00:04:11.430> the<00:04:11.579> way<00:04:11.700> you<00:04:11.730> had<00:04:12.120> planned<00:04:12.150> that

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
quite work the way you had planned that

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.770 
quite work the way you had planned that
so<00:04:14.010> I<00:04:14.070> would<00:04:14.190> leave<00:04:14.430> you<00:04:15.000> know<00:04:15.120> fifteen

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
so I would leave you know fifteen

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.490 
so I would leave you know fifteen
percent<00:04:16.049> or<00:04:16.230> so

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
percent or so

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.280 
percent or so
a room<00:04:17.220> for<00:04:17.760> for<00:04:18.239> change<00:04:18.540> and<00:04:19.850> and<00:04:21.019> but<00:04:22.019> I

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
a room for for change and and but I

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.190
