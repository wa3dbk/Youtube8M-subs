00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:09.179
 moin together I'll show you now 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.250
 the distribution to the 2 then I have me 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.780
 times written 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.389
 The found under tips can currently nine 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.529
 above works fully automatic 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.189
 content whose afk go 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:24.529
 Do whatever you want to get the inventory 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.079
 clean in the rother ports energy 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.630
 splitter remains the key to 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.519
 Bodensee left and the whole garbage 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.149
 Thoroughly most of that could be done at will 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.149
 to adjust 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.930
 that the pott view went I have 1 3 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.110
 graphic version set because everyone 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.250
 other graphics settings was preferred 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.340
 can only adjust 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.040
 there you can locate pandora under config 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.840
 I now look after all 35 females 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.260
 relatively large pictures painted in the 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:01:01.420
 good graphics driver I'll show you 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:01.420
 now with the 1024 x 768 32 pp 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.700
 You have to start by the board 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.100
 You have to stop all this here 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.940
 that he is always started seven and 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.280
 As an administrator, the rental car offered 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.150
 kottke written that is like in the 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.680
 programs like avg anti-virus kaspersky 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.299
 must be turned off or one 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.920
 Special admissions added 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.750
 otherwise there is nothing to say 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.930
 let's just start a little one 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.590
 You can load a same account 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:42.430
 use or registered by all 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:44.229
 exactly what you are correct why so now that 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.070
 the pott bad kept it all 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.500
 function 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.479
 Here you can choose if you want to 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.720
 has or has not been 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:56.520
 click that uses a gaul if in 3 c 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.520
 uses first comment below left 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.710
 he would automatically turn it on too 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.160
 not implemented yet 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.800
 that would have to let that here 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:11.070
 Fine tuning is the intervals 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.070
 I'm expecting vivendi crafts 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.890
 would just leave the 80 seconds 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:19.280
 he exactly 80 seconds are 1000 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.880
 milliseconds one second 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.350
 80,000 180 seconds 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.690
 I would just leave and test 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.150
 if he has the skills too soon 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.770
 Does that mean that they are not yet on 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.380
 learned and would have to increase in the interval 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.450
 if he makes her too late that she's up 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.490
 arrives but rather simply break 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.860
 then you have to hang your neck 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:44.100
 normally it would have to fit like that 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.420
 agree with it just drop settings 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.830
 here as already said you can 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.900
 Adjust water drop but 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.360
 standard silver blue-silver 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.550
 key blue-red to the largest 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.140
 crÃªpes and to wish you can the stuff 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.530
 also adjust 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.819
 Now I'm going to prove it 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.040
 I do not think I need that right now 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.680
 I do not click 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.380
 lied is not built in here 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:12.430
 I write one more instruction 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:16.690
 but you have the video exactly 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:20.920
 start doing the thing about f1 campos 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:23.080
 has four Euro 4 far below 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.270
 left first day as empty as possible 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.660
 that's what the drobs are all about 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.150
 to have 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.820
 if it comes with the sound in again 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.590
 we have an update here in the second 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.780
 inventory the first three rows for it 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.989
 The power then creates every ten 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.989
 minutes 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.810
 otherwise 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.519
 There is nothing to say you can 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.030
 to do the whole with a basel 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:53.790
 just make it sound 4 and f4 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:57.040
 you let it out then it works the same way 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.890
 drive well instead of then you have on the 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:04.000
 gold make it important and then start 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:06.730
 now live once he goes off power 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.910
 a bit of power struggle is rising rapidly 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.430
 exit on the guards contest managers 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.810
 down directly floated back to the 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.539
 his name always gets it his 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:20.590
 then girl throws on the second moment 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:22.229
 he equal the crap what we do 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.960
 of course, of course 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:28.150
 immediately played down underneath 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.570
 now wait that long down 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.940
 disappeared and now he lifts 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:37.420
 looks up again directly 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.900
 We can now with mannes on all 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.140
 throttling he does not lose 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.630
 escape 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:47.530
 Now we are just waiting for the special 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:50.790
 Doing crafts then do two 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.790
 room the crafts 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:55.529
 Schweisstec puts the energy splitter under 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.300
 that means he does it all the time 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:05:00.809
 through these days , their magic remains 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:03.749
 Click and the right drops of the ten 

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:06.689
 Cars charged so soon can be fresh 

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:10.129
 charged, he would have to dismount both 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:10.129
 turn on crafts again 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:20.750
 the bot itself is programmed 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.750
 as I said it can be 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:25.050
 that I download in the 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:27.509
 description will make that the bot 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:31.830
 so do not click on it the first time 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:34.430
 but then it works when 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:37.640
 second time no longer open 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:40.790
 that can pay that something with windows 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:43.540
 7 because I have a laptop with xp 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:46.040
 but no problems windows 7 already 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:49.910
 she just writes to me 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.500
 write my skype money to then 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:57.100
 just sign up for the war without 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:57.100
 version so again the same version 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:02.640
 which will hopefully work now 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:05.900
 have seen that descended or hardly 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.900
 spilled strikes on 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.570
 if I do it here again 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.390
 Troops would be down again 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:15.330
 throw it when I'm down everything 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:18.300
 that works on everything unterberg and 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:22.970
 to start tasks so boot 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:27.200
 press we remove one stops him 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:28.970
 and that's it for now as far 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.680
 as I said that we have a program 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:34.490
 unfortunately fail because it as us that 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:36.790
 recognizes as powerless otherwise and 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.790
 sharpness
