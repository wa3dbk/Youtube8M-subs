 interrupt more 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.450
 and that now will explain what 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.860
 happened to his channel because he has three thousand 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.710
 subscribers and has so many posts 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.400
 so many inactive subscribers in a 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.400
 gameplay channel 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.070

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.560
