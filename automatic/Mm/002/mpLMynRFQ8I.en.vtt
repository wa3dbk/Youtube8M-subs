I wasn't able to Wolverine was because I

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.580 
I wasn't able to Wolverine was because I

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.840 
that's a big thing about all the tanks
it's<00:02:51.600> about<00:02:51.890> tapping<00:02:52.890> your<00:02:53.069> shots<00:02:53.340> correctly

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850

especially with takes that take a long
time<00:02:56.069> to<00:02:56.130> reload<00:02:56.579> your<00:02:56.880> shells<00:02:57.569> like<00:02:58.230> the

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
time to reload your shells like the

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.890 
time to reload your shells like the
Wolverine<00:02:58.880> just<00:02:59.880> take<00:03:00.060> like<00:03:00.209> a<00:03:00.299> few<00:03:00.510> seconds

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
Wolverine just take like a few seconds

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.110 
Wolverine just take like a few seconds
kind<00:03:01.230> of<00:03:01.290> sucks<00:03:01.500> but<00:03:01.739> they're<00:03:02.549> hard<00:03:02.790> hitting

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
kind of sucks but they're hard hitting

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.030 
kind of sucks but they're hard hitting
shelter<00:03:03.450> that's<00:03:03.540> for<00:03:03.780> sure<00:03:03.900> also<00:03:04.889> I<00:03:04.920> think

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
shelter that's for sure also I think

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.789

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
they added a new shell I don't know it's

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.440 
they added a new shell I don't know it's
like<00:03:07.889> the<00:03:08.010> armor-piercing<00:03:08.489> one<00:03:08.940> I<00:03:09.150> don't<00:03:09.389> know

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450

like the armor-piercing one I don't know
I<00:03:09.569> might<00:03:09.780> have<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:09.930> check<00:03:10.230> after<00:03:10.380> this<00:03:10.560> game

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
I might have to check after this game

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.460 
I might have to check after this game
and<00:03:11.010> add<00:03:11.459> that<00:03:11.730> cuz<00:03:12.060> asset<00:03:12.870> you're<00:03:13.049> working<00:03:13.380> up
