00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:10.030
 Hello everyone for the product test of 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:13.209
 today a sauce ready and precisely sauce 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.469
 fresh from john rana is a novelty that 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:15.730
 that's what i got it 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.860
 they have n't even made one yet 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.830
 advertising but I found it in the pews 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.900
 fridge will be advertising or not 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.599
 actually I'm not crazy about sauces 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.519
 ready however this here how well you don't 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.080
 fresh juice 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.320
 so I thought I'd try it for you 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.640
 because anyway it intrigued me how 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.260
 I always go and read a little 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.899
 ingredients let's see a little bit inside 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.809
 what i got the one with mushrooms 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:45.100
 porcini which contains cream mushrooms 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:48.430
 champignon porcini mushrooms onion water 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.070
 sunflower oil butter wine 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.670
 white grated cheese starch of 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.039
 corn natural flavorings parsley salt 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.910
 skimmed milk oil yeast extract 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.320
 in powder 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.390
 these are all of them here 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.059
 ingredients that seem to me sincerely 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.060
 I can't find any good ingredients 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.100
 especially let's say reason always 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.570
 please report me below if found 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.030
 something wrong you know I don't 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.759
 these things are prepared together 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.830
 interesting thing is that inside 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.380
 of writing we also find some 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.900
 allergens because there is written product 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.780
 in the establishment that also uses 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.060
 nuts celery gluten eggs 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.360
 then shellfish and shellfish 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.240
 however let's face the truth they protect themselves 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.939
 a little weight written apart from that 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.540
 I also find the fact that very nice 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:43.000
 have put recipes to power 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.150
 with these dreams that you can find on 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.160
 site that is shown above and 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.590
 I recommend to use this 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.870
 sauce also for hasty risotto e 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.180
 scaloppine I will use it for pasta 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.300
 in it was such that it could taste well 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.090
 the taste and I just have to go to 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.740
 prepare here says to use it so you can 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.240
 heat the sauce directly in the pan 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.470
 or microwave for about a minute 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.000
 removing the aluminum cover 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.670
 obviously if we put it in the microwave 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.430
 but I heat it in the pan is 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:24.640
 I'm just going to open it to show you 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:26.620
 first of all then it has a smell 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.350
 quite intense of porcini mushrooms 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:33.520
 which I would not have sincerely believed 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.410
 and I don't know if so you take a teaspoon 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.520
 to make you see a little bit better 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.209
 certainly the cutting of the mushrooms is not 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.130
 great 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.769
 look, there are little pieces 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.170
 quite small we certainly don't find the 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.090
 pezzoni di funghi here is this 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.280
 size of the biggest mushroom I have 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.709
 found inside mostly are 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.750
 but for the moment it smashed the smell 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.390
 it looks like we just have to go to 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.120
 try it after taking the pasta there 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.709
 I put only and I go to give a birth 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.670
 Latin that in such a way as to do 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:09.400
 mix the sauce well with the pasta 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.730
 I find it a bit liquid so I will try 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.410
 to let it dry a little before 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.540
 speak to serve it within the 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.370
 flat however the whole is an operation 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.690
 very fast and just the time of 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.670
 cooking pasta 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.519
 after stir for 20 his 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.299
 pasta ready to taste we give 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.299
 a little 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.989
 It tastes good mushroom flavor 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:40.970
 enough where freed is not heard 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:46.069
 excessively in garlic onion 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:48.860
 in short, I like the only fact that 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:52.129
 I find that the amount of sauce is 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.200
 enough for 2 3 servings of pasta not 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:57.860
 it's a lot so if you are lovers like 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.290
 me of a well seasoned dish if you are 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.510
 four for example you will have to buy two 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.069
 packs we are going to give a little bit of 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.750
 votes now 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.069
 first of all for what concerns the 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.160
 quality price 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:13.459
 I paid for a container of course 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:16.039
 as i told you it's good for me 2 3 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.829
 portions of pasta 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:21.799
 I paid two euros and 49 that sincerely 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.860
 being a porcini mushroom sauce 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.210
 I find it a price more than 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.300
 acceptable and honest so for the 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.060
 quality price I would give an 8 for what 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.320
 concerns the preparation time 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.330
 fast to prepare his would 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.099
 required cooking the mushrooms 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.669
 sauce preparation and all the rest 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:42.830
 so for that a 10 really 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.530
 excellent vote for what concerns 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.979
 the appearance I'm not very happy with 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.150
 fact that mushrooms are alas very much 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.710
 I would have wanted some chopped up 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.550
 mushroom a little bigger 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:57.620
 inside then for that from one 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:01.780
 enough then my general vote 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.650
 for this frog product is a 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.349
 half past seven 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.849
 I'm especially happy considering the 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:10.729
 fact that I am not 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:12.949
 notes of ready sauces is a product that 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:14.599
 I think you could try it also in 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:15.830
 other tastes if you try others 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:18.199
 tastes let me know 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.240
 a kiss to all and see you on Saturday 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:21.800
 next with the new media review 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.669
 or Tuesday with the recipe 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.669
 bye Bye
