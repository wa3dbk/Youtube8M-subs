once<00:01:52.580> you<00:01:52.759> get<00:01:52.910> it<00:01:53.000> broken<00:01:53.179> loose<00:01:53.800> you<00:01:54.800> can

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
once you get it broken loose you can

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.980 
once you get it broken loose you can
spin<00:01:55.190> it<00:01:55.220> the<00:01:55.369> rest<00:01:55.550> of<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:55.759> way<00:01:55.910> off<00:01:56.090> by<00:01:56.660> hand

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
spin it the rest of the way off by hand

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.990 
spin it the rest of the way off by hand
but<00:01:57.500> before<00:01:57.860> you<00:01:57.979> do<00:01:58.100> that<00:01:58.280> make<00:01:58.610> sure<00:01:58.640> that

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
but before you do that make sure that

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.180 
but before you do that make sure that
your<00:01:59.149> oil<00:01:59.179> catch<00:01:59.720> pan<00:02:00.080> is<00:02:00.500> underneath<00:02:01.009> because

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
your oil catch pan is underneath because

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.279 
your oil catch pan is underneath because
otherwise<00:02:01.580> you'll<00:02:02.270> have<00:02:02.330> a<00:02:02.479> mess<00:02:02.750> some<00:02:03.050> oil

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
otherwise you'll have a mess some oil

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.380 
otherwise you'll have a mess some oil
will<00:02:03.560> come<00:02:03.740> out<00:02:03.920> of<00:02:04.039> that<00:02:04.100> oil<00:02:04.250> filter<00:02:04.789> alright

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
will come out of that oil filter alright

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.300 
will come out of that oil filter alright
now<00:02:05.509> that<00:02:05.570> we've<00:02:05.780> got<00:02:05.929> the<00:02:06.050> old<00:02:06.170> filter<00:02:06.649> out<00:02:06.890> we

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
now that we've got the old filter out we

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.980 
now that we've got the old filter out we
need<00:02:07.460> to<00:02:07.550> check<00:02:07.759> the<00:02:07.940> area<00:02:08.119> where<00:02:08.600> the<00:02:08.750> new

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
need to check the area where the new

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.540 
need to check the area where the new
filter<00:02:09.410> will<00:02:09.590> seal<00:02:09.800> up<00:02:09.830> against<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.369> block

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
filter will seal up against the block

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.070 
filter will seal up against the block
and<00:02:10.820> make<00:02:11.090> sure<00:02:11.270> that<00:02:11.420> there<00:02:11.600> aren't<00:02:11.720> any<00:02:11.810> bits

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
and make sure that there aren't any bits

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.630 
and make sure that there aren't any bits
of<00:02:12.230> old<00:02:12.320> gasket<00:02:12.890> or<00:02:13.010> any<00:02:13.100> other<00:02:13.310> kind<00:02:13.550> of

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
of old gasket or any other kind of

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.580 
of old gasket or any other kind of
debris<00:02:13.910> that<00:02:13.940> would<00:02:14.180> cause<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:14.450> leak<00:02:14.840> so<00:02:15.530> I'm

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
debris that would cause a leak so I'm

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.140 
debris that would cause a leak so I'm
just<00:02:15.710> gonna<00:02:15.860> reach<00:02:16.069> down<00:02:16.340> with<00:02:16.520> the<00:02:16.640> rag<00:02:16.850> and

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
just gonna reach down with the rag and

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.440 
just gonna reach down with the rag and
wipe<00:02:17.410> it<00:02:18.410> off<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:18.800> then<00:02:19.340> visually<00:02:19.819> inspect<00:02:20.270> it

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
wipe it off and then visually inspect it

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.210 
wipe it off and then visually inspect it
to<00:02:20.750> make<00:02:20.870> sure<00:02:20.900> it's<00:02:21.170> clean<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:21.950> we're<00:02:22.100> all

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
to make sure it's clean and we're all

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.830 
to make sure it's clean and we're all
set<00:02:22.460> down<00:02:22.640> there<00:02:22.850> now

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
set down there now

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.090 
set down there now
I'll<00:02:24.080> go<00:02:24.290> ahead<00:02:24.380> and<00:02:24.590> I'll<00:02:24.680> get<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:24.950> new

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
I'll go ahead and I'll get the new

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.160 
I'll go ahead and I'll get the new
filter

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.710 

this<00:02:29.890> is<00:02:29.950> a<00:02:29.980> high-performance<00:02:30.730> K&amp;N<00:02:31.240> filter

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
this is a high-performance K&amp;N filter

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.830 
this is a high-performance K&amp;N filter
works<00:02:32.260> great<00:02:32.709> with<00:02:33.160> these<00:02:33.370> big<00:02:34.030> v8<00:02:34.390> engines

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
works great with these big v8 engines

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.900 
works great with these big v8 engines
this<00:02:35.620> filter<00:02:35.950> has<00:02:36.099> a<00:02:36.130> neat<00:02:36.370> feature<00:02:36.610> that<00:02:36.760> I

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
this filter has a neat feature that I

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.790 
this filter has a neat feature that I
really<00:02:37.270> like<00:02:37.450> it's<00:02:37.870> an<00:02:38.020> attachment<00:02:38.319> that<00:02:38.680> you

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
really like it's an attachment that you

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.040 
really like it's an attachment that you
can<00:02:38.950> fit<00:02:39.160> a<00:02:39.190> socket<00:02:39.640> onto<00:02:39.910> or<00:02:40.270> a<00:02:40.300> wrench<00:02:40.750> and

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
can fit a socket onto or a wrench and

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.900 
can fit a socket onto or a wrench and
when<00:02:41.530> you're<00:02:41.680> in<00:02:41.770> tight<00:02:41.980> spaces<00:02:42.250> it<00:02:42.580> makes<00:02:42.760> it

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
when you're in tight spaces it makes it

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.360 
when you're in tight spaces it makes it
a<00:02:43.000> lot<00:02:43.180> easier<00:02:43.239> to<00:02:43.810> get<00:02:43.959> on<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.470> spin<00:02:44.950> back<00:02:45.130> off

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
a lot easier to get on and spin back off

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.640 
a lot easier to get on and spin back off
now<00:02:45.700> what<00:02:45.819> you<00:02:46.000> have<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.209> do<00:02:46.480> so<00:02:46.720> this<00:02:46.989> seals<00:02:47.380> up

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
now what you have to do so this seals up

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.470 
now what you have to do so this seals up
against<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.160> block<00:02:48.400> as<00:02:48.700> you<00:02:48.819> put<00:02:49.120> just<00:02:49.239> a<00:02:49.450> dab

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
against the block as you put just a dab

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.900 
against the block as you put just a dab
of<00:02:49.750> fresh<00:02:50.290> oil<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:50.920> then<00:02:51.100> you<00:02:51.220> spin<00:02:51.550> it<00:02:51.580> around

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
of fresh oil and then you spin it around

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.710 
of fresh oil and then you spin it around
like<00:02:52.209> that<00:02:52.270> and<00:02:52.780> that<00:02:53.260> lubricates<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:53.980> seal

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
like that and that lubricates the seal

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.479 
like that and that lubricates the seal
so<00:02:55.720> that<00:02:55.750> it<00:02:55.959> locks<00:02:56.140> tightly<00:02:56.739> up<00:02:56.980> against<00:02:57.430> the

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
so that it locks tightly up against the

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.449 
so that it locks tightly up against the
block<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:58.360> then<00:02:58.480> we'll<00:02:58.660> just<00:02:59.250> drop<00:03:00.250> the

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
block and then we'll just drop the

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.290 
block and then we'll just drop the
filter<00:03:00.880> down<00:03:01.030> you<00:03:02.130> spin<00:03:03.130> it<00:03:03.280> on<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:04.120> I'm<00:03:04.180> going

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
filter down you spin it on and I'm going

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.150 
filter down you spin it on and I'm going
to<00:03:04.390> reach<00:03:04.510> back<00:03:04.750> down<00:03:05.019> there<00:03:05.260> with<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.980> oil

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
to reach back down there with the oil

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.259 
to reach back down there with the oil
filter<00:03:06.489> wrench<00:03:06.519> and<00:03:06.910> give<00:03:07.120> it<00:03:07.209> another

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
filter wrench and give it another

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.000 
filter wrench and give it another
quarter<00:03:07.870> turn<00:03:07.900> to<00:03:08.230> make<00:03:08.350> sure<00:03:08.530> we<00:03:08.709> don't<00:03:08.799> have

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
quarter turn to make sure we don't have

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.640 
quarter turn to make sure we don't have
any<00:03:09.069> leaks<00:03:09.459> once<00:03:10.120> I<00:03:10.269> do<00:03:10.330> that<00:03:10.420> we<00:03:11.230> can<00:03:11.350> fill<00:03:11.560> up

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
any leaks once I do that we can fill up

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.550 
any leaks once I do that we can fill up
the<00:03:11.769> crankcase<00:03:12.069> with<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:12.610> oil

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
the crankcase with the oil

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.860 
the crankcase with the oil
now<00:03:14.560> while<00:03:15.040> this<00:03:15.190> clean<00:03:15.549> oil<00:03:15.730> is<00:03:16.030> going<00:03:16.209> in<00:03:16.450> one

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
now while this clean oil is going in one

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.090 
now while this clean oil is going in one
of<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.049> things<00:03:17.260> you've<00:03:17.410> got<00:03:17.530> to<00:03:17.590> think<00:03:17.860> about

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
of the things you've got to think about

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.039 
of the things you've got to think about
is<00:03:18.400> what<00:03:18.670> to<00:03:18.790> do<00:03:18.910> with<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.150> old<00:03:19.299> dirty<00:03:19.780> oil

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
is what to do with the old dirty oil

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.860 
is what to do with the old dirty oil
that<00:03:20.290> we<00:03:20.440> took<00:03:20.650> out<00:03:20.890> most<00:03:21.340> areas<00:03:21.790> have

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
that we took out most areas have

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.820 
that we took out most areas have
recycling<00:03:22.870> centers<00:03:23.230> where<00:03:23.440> you<00:03:23.500> can<00:03:23.650> take

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
recycling centers where you can take

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.320 
recycling centers where you can take
your<00:03:23.860> old<00:03:24.160> oil<00:03:24.370> look<00:03:24.790> for<00:03:25.000> them<00:03:25.120> on<00:03:25.209> the

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
your old oil look for them on the

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.360 
your old oil look for them on the
Internet<00:03:25.660> then<00:03:25.989> you're<00:03:26.140> good<00:03:26.290> to<00:03:26.410> go<00:03:26.440> now<00:03:27.069> put

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370
