00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.920
 Euphorbia family that is malachite 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.440

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.329
 somewhere out there in east africa in 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.579
 In principle, we don’t care where it is. 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.350
 grows the main thing to help on his 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.260
 the structure of the oil is represented as 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.309
 yellowish liquid 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.920
 characterized by increased viscosity 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.020
 a plane as well as a strange smell 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.129
 interesting properties for cosmetology 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.309
 castor oil 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.930
 due to the highest content 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.750
 rational and you and acid with 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.060

 turn affects hair strengthening 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.670

 make cities manageable and more direct 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.369
 high concentration of acids 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.170
 causes the nutritional properties and 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.600
 regular application gives hair 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.610
 silkiness mask of castor oil 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.630
 is one of the most effective for 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.759
 hair treatments 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.500
 and to accelerate their growth as well 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.360
 apply it before the course starts 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.789
 please check if you have any 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.979
 castor oil allergies like 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.799
 check if you are allergic to it 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.720
 you can smear a little skin if you start 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.240
 there to blush then maybe you have 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.280
 allergies can also just a little 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.229
 fall on the skin and put oil there if 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.750
 will begin to blush then maybe you have 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.940
 allergy so be careful 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.159
 in addition, attention should be paid 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.319
 the smell of this oil is not for me personally 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.330
 I really like the way she smells 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.640
 maybe some will be right here 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.530
 gag reflex then cause us too 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.780
 You should not even smear in principle 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.970
 just smear like castor oil but 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.630
 better to make a mask for masks I will tell 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.430
 a little bit later 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.510
 Now let's assume that we are 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.370
 have already prepared a castor mask and 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.650
 we want to apply it to start we need 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.600
 slightly heat our brew on the steam 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.660
 a bath to make it a little warmer 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.430
 then put this mask on the city as 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.489
 apply a mask on the beard at all for 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.760
 any oil is here in this video 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:39.850
 click all see see her face 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.680
 need about 40 to 60 minutes to flush 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.780
 this mask is needed by hot water 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.000
 because oil does not dissolve cope 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.799
 and after you water see or stand 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.720
 wait a little bit for us to dig 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.209
 then rinse several times 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.650
 beard with shampoo or soap as often as possible 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.350
 use this oil 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.209
 It must be used once a week this 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.850
 maximum why because my hair 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.739
 may simply be sorry they will 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.109
 soloists are not pleasant to the touch 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.989
 And now for the sand mass recipes. 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:09.489
 On the right, I personally know some oil 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.460
 I know that there are many more 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.200
 if you are interested, look on the Internet 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.180
 but now I will tell you such more or 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.030
 less common first and most 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.310
 simple recipe need to mix the castor 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.880
 oil with other less fatty oil 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.850
 for example with burdock oil how to mix 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.210
 need to mix in a ratio of two to one 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.610
 i.e. two spoons of castor oil and 1 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.940
 spoon of burdock oil mix 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.740
 we stir on we finish a little 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.830
 Lubricate the following recipe small 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.150
 analogue and peyna oil with red pepper 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.430
 castor oil is recommended to mix 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.360
 tincture of red pepper in proportions 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.880
 one to one 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.280
 Ie one spoon tincture one spoon 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.020
 oil well or with vodka with the addition of 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.300
 red pepper mixture 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.420
 should be rubbed a little into the skin and 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.960
 leave under a towel or food 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.240
 film 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.400
 about 2-3 hours well, but the procedure 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.650
 this should be done twice in 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.120
 week also like from now on the bridge miha 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.160
 you say what you need mass 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.530
 castor oil 1 time per week 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.750
 but here we mix oil with vodka by 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.840
 Essentially the whole tincture as it becomes 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.880
 less wife means beard less fat 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.000
 if suddenly your hair started to fall out 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.130
 beard or head recommended 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.470
 make tincture of castor oil with 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.060
 adding onion juice 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.520
 to enhance the effect you can add 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.620
 gruel from pounded well and keep 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.750
 Such a mask is necessary for about an hour 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.240
 You need to use this mask once 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.780
 week as well as with the usual you for 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.370
 stimulation of blood circulation on the skin of the beard 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:45.030
 it is recommended to massage and apply 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.950
 castor oil with lavender well 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.020
 in principle, the castor will also 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.430
 it’s enough to mix it up 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.710
 eg 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:55.220
 she is dressed in the proportions of 30 to one 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:58.610
 have 30 milliliters of castor oil 1 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.840
 milliliter conventional essential oil 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.490
 for example lavender 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.080
 but now a couple of answers to often 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.120
 asked questions 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.210
 is it possible to mix burdock oil with 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.850
 red pepper castor there is not worth it 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.610
 why well because it seems to me 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.950
 generally straight just nonsense because here 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.050
 This is one mask and this is another bridge and 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.120
 more mask with the addition of red pepper 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.070
 and steve castor oil is it possible 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.500
 apply burdock mask with 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.200
 red pepper mask from castor 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.600
 oils can be but not to overdo the maximum 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.910
 twice a week then there is one mask out 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.490
 castor other of burdock 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:37.220
 well that's all with you was bearded x
