00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:25.039
 what does working cutting edge mean 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.920
 him commensurate with a match when I 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.330
 recently in the future of the company 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.360
 got this knife to cut 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:37.890
 smoked chicken almost laughed at me 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:43.610
 but then everyone saw what he was capable of 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:49.350
 just and I myself was never surprised before 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:55.289

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.900
 pocket in communication burden 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:21.210
 just put your pocket and forget about it 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.850
 the others are on knives and they have 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.720
 constantly remember shifting with 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:31.100
 pocket in your pocket and this one just put and 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.079
 forgot well then let's see what 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.740
 capable of this 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.740
 knife 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:18.660

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:30.709

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:29.630
 in half but honestly speaking, here you are 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.970
 ferich 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:05:01.680
 that is, all the actual work I 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:05:01.680
 made one knife without changing would say 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:22.180

 but the authorities and the like 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.350
 so wipe the blade dry 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:32.040
