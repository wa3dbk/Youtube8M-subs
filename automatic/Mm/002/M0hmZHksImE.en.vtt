00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.660
 what about kids or the jack of the already 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.730
 that we are in the next video the 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.680
 sky link that as you see in the end I have 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.139
 could finish all the missions that 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.390
 they were a real pain in the ass and I could 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.460
 upload the video of the last mask that 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.869
 we call against that in a way that I 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.429
 I say that this mission is not suitable for 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.380
 people without patience or that is 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.579
 mission is truly managed I say 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.499
 the truth no longer looks like shit the 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:31.560
 get done because they force you to do 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:33.989
 all all all the missions of 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.079
 Winterfell and I tell you that they are 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.510
 how many and all the long 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.499
 all all of them so you have to 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.690
 give patience if you truly 

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:46.199
 you want to get masks good 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.760
 we are here in laberint it can already be the 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.920
 Easiest place to find the economic 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.359
 have to go to laberint already and when 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.519
 you are the mission because the only thing 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:56.909
 you have to do already you know is to catch and 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.260
 looking is the signal set and you know 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:59.519
 that here you can not enter if you have not 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.320
 you get from all the missions because 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.329
 gives you the object that you will see that I am 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.750
 placing the same here on the door that 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.980
 it's kind of like 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:12.100
 so good now we go there to what 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:16.570
 would be 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.120
 the love fight ok to see how we 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.420
 comes out 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.340
 and well, here we are already as you see 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.130
 behind me and like a kind of dome 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.110
 of power or something like that and you will see that there is 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.750
 some fucking magicians who are there 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.810
 throwing a field of 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.900
 a force field then we take 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.140
 we load the first one and that's where the 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.240
 second also as you can see now 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.630
 our friend mor ok I'm going to can 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.670
 move freely and good I wanted to try 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.220
 suspect you have a lot of damage you loose 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.650
 the first and the truth is that it takes away 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.700
 nothing so youtube because you play 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:59.050
 melee and if I'm a magician go to 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.550
 mess with God we can give it 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.920
 the only one that has thanks to the cable 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.350
 much blow that I do not know if I can appreciate 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.120
 the lightning that to me it releases to me in a moment 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.240
 I think they attack me that once but 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.940
 what is clear 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:16.300
 the magic not only much contrary so 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.880
 Do not attempt to remove it if I remove as 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.460
 I do not know a little less than a quarter of 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.960
 life with a lightning situation or an idea 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:28.450
 well here we had entered because 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:30.460
 we must choose the donkey barca and then 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.650
 already we take our mask and already 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.200
 we have completed all the masters that 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.020
 this was the last one of moru that 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.180
 explained in the bonus thing is that 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.720
 regenerates the machine is down 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.600
 regenerates a hundred percent faster 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.790
 you will tell me or afterwards pretty good if I 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.520
 you accompany with a robe as I go 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.670
 to put that recovers 125 percent 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.050
 faster it could have 225 percent 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.700
 what is a fist 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.850
 I'm going to throw some magic so that 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.520
 see how it recovers and as you can see 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:07.820
 recover in two seconds a good piece 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:11.069
 for the magicians because together with that of the 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:14.849
 maned may be the best choice as 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.769
 good for magicians is pretty good and 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.569
 typical uninhabited and to find a 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.790
 cofrecito and I think that here there is no 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.799
 I shouted at least I could not find it 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.499
 if there is any kind soul that 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.569
 you will find one of this and no and no 

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:31.469
 you can say for in the comments I 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:34.280
 I would appreciate it, well, here it comes out 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:38.300
 the ghost and scene 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.850
 and he tells us 4 trias that he gives us 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.640
 a little like 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.660
 and such 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:48.230
 and we take now we open the doors and 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.230
 we went out there 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:58.850
 and if we take it open the door and we 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.410
 an elf comes out who wants to get us 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.300

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.360
