00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
say a graph or something you don't call

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.270 
say a graph or something you don't call
them<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.600> then<00:00:40.050> they<00:00:40.260> just<00:00:40.500> end<00:00:40.710> up<00:00:41.010> not

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
them and then they just end up not

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.250 
them and then they just end up not
really<00:00:41.730> going<00:00:41.910> minus<00:00:42.390> at<00:00:42.540> all<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:43.050> actually

really going minus at all you actually

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.340 
really going minus at all you actually
minus<00:00:43.710> because<00:00:44.190> you've<00:00:44.370> activated<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.969> card

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
minus because you've activated the card

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.630 
minus because you've activated the card
obviously<00:00:46.350> with<00:00:46.590> playing<00:00:46.860> certain<00:00:47.219> cards

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640

like<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.690> certain<00:00:48.870> way<00:00:49.110> against

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
like that in a certain way against

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.049 
like that in a certain way against
asserts<00:00:49.829> matchup<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.760> will<00:00:50.910> become

asserts matchup you will become

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.819 
asserts matchup you will become
accustomed<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.750> how<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.930> play<00:00:52.230> around<00:00:52.379> it

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
accustomed to how to play around it

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.619 
accustomed to how to play around it
maybe<00:00:53.039> depending<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:53.760> how<00:00:54.059> many<00:00:54.120> effects

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
maybe depending on how many effects

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:55.970 
maybe depending on how many effects
they've<00:00:54.809> activated<00:00:55.110> then<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.649> can<00:00:55.770> activate

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
they've activated then you can activate

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.290 
they've activated then you can activate
a<00:00:56.129> chance<00:00:56.340> attribute<00:00:56.760> because<00:00:56.969> they<00:00:57.090> don't

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
a chance attribute because they don't

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.209 
a chance attribute because they don't
use<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:57.899> forth<00:00:58.109> but<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.829> one<00:00:59.010> thing

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
use it so and so forth but the one thing

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.459 
use it so and so forth but the one thing
that<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.430> think<00:00:59.609> is<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.180> jeopardy<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.930> really

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
that I think is in jeopardy of really

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.219 
that I think is in jeopardy of really
hurting<00:01:01.920> those<00:01:02.129> cards<00:01:02.609> are<00:01:02.820> pendulums<00:01:03.660> now

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
hurting those cards are pendulums now

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.539 
hurting those cards are pendulums now
pendulums<00:01:04.769> we<00:01:04.920> all<00:01:05.040> know<00:01:05.220> when<00:01:05.400> they

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
pendulums we all know when they

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.250

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
destroyed they go straight to the top of

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
pendulums if the future is going to be

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.520 
pendulums if the future is going to be
so<00:01:36.420> kind<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.549> pendulum<00:01:38.549> based<00:01:38.960> with<00:01:39.960> all<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
so kind of pendulum based with all the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.649 
so kind of pendulum based with all the
main<00:01:40.740> decks<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.369> meta<00:01:41.549> decks<00:01:41.850> being<00:01:42.240> just

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
main decks and the meta decks being just

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.340 
main decks and the meta decks being just
pendulum<00:01:43.380> based<00:01:43.590> then<00:01:44.810> maybe<00:01:45.810> it's<00:01:46.079> something

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
pendulum based then maybe it's something

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.710 
pendulum based then maybe it's something
that<00:01:46.740> might<00:01:46.890> actually<00:01:47.100> end<00:01:47.490> up<00:01:47.759> happening<00:01:48.149> dog

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
that might actually end up happening dog

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.539 
that might actually end up happening dog
Cole<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.200> Ray<00:01:49.229> gehrke<00:01:49.649> might<00:01:49.829> actually<00:01:50.070> be

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
Cole and Ray gehrke might actually be

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.760 
Cole and Ray gehrke might actually be
relegated<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.540> side<00:01:51.840> deck<00:01:52.079> cards<00:01:52.350> depending

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
relegated to side deck cards depending

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.990 
relegated to side deck cards depending
on<00:01:53.070> what<00:01:53.220> deck<00:01:53.399> you're<00:01:53.579> gonna<00:01:53.700> be<00:01:53.850> going

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
on what deck you're gonna be going

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.850 
on what deck you're gonna be going
against<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.899> that's<00:01:55.079> such<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.290> really<00:01:55.619> weird

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
against and that's such a really weird

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.950 
against and that's such a really weird
thought<00:01:56.250> for<00:01:56.460> me<00:01:56.579> because<00:01:56.939> they're<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.479> good

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
thought for me because they're so good

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.620 
thought for me because they're so good
and<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.860> know<00:01:58.979> even<00:01:59.189> if<00:01:59.759> you<00:02:00.270> are<00:02:00.420> going

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
and you know even if you are going

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.310 
and you know even if you are going
against<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.020> pen

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
against the pen

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.740 
against the pen
on<00:02:01.409> deck<00:02:01.680> dark<00:02:02.370> hauling<00:02:02.760> a<00:02:02.880> field<00:02:03.120> is<00:02:03.479> still

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
on deck dark hauling a field is still

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.450 
on deck dark hauling a field is still
all<00:02:03.870> right<00:02:04.050> getting<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.590> feel<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:05.100> still<00:02:05.310> pretty

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
all right getting a feel is still pretty

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.330 
all right getting a feel is still pretty
good<00:02:05.790> but<00:02:06.600> it's<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.170> fact<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.620> they<00:02:08.070> don't

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
good but it's the fact that they don't

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.070 
good but it's the fact that they don't
really<00:02:08.429> lose<00:02:08.820> out<00:02:09.090> on<00:02:09.149> anything<00:02:09.660> unless<00:02:10.020> you

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
really lose out on anything unless you

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.320 
really lose out on anything unless you
kill<00:02:10.530> them<00:02:10.709> in<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:11.009> turn<00:02:11.280> but<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.270> still

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
kill them in that turn but you still

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.660 
kill them in that turn but you still
have<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:12.900> combat<00:02:13.380> possible<00:02:13.920> back<00:02:14.130> row<00:02:14.430> and

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
have to combat possible back row and

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.240 
have to combat possible back row and
then<00:02:15.660> they<00:02:16.050> just<00:02:16.350> end<00:02:16.620> up<00:02:16.800> getting<00:02:17.040> everything

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
then they just end up getting everything

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.680 
then they just end up getting everything
back<00:02:17.370> if<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:17.790> don't<00:02:17.820> end<00:02:18.150> up<00:02:18.209> killing<00:02:18.540> them

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
back if you don't end up killing them

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.510 
back if you don't end up killing them
and<00:02:18.870> it's<00:02:19.020> like<00:02:19.140> nothing<00:02:19.470> ever<00:02:19.800> happened<00:02:19.890> I

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
and it's like nothing ever happened I

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.340 
and it's like nothing ever happened I
believe<00:02:20.910> that's<00:02:21.090> why<00:02:21.360> right<00:02:21.630> yeah<00:02:21.810> he<00:02:21.990> went<00:02:22.200> to

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
believe that's why right yeah he went to

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.190 
believe that's why right yeah he went to
one<00:02:22.560> dark<00:02:23.280> i<00:02:23.430> went<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.940> riga<00:02:24.360> key<00:02:24.510> was<00:02:25.020> one

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
one dark i went to to riga key was one

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.080 
one dark i went to to riga key was one
of<00:02:25.290> those<00:02:25.410> concert<00:02:25.860> but<00:02:26.040> I'm<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.220> ban<00:02:26.430> list<00:02:26.459> so

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
of those concert but I'm the ban list so

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.260 
of those concert but I'm the ban list so
long<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.600> never<00:02:27.660> expected<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.709> come<00:02:28.770> back

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
long I never expected it to come back

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.030 
long I never expected it to come back
simply<00:02:30.270> because<00:02:30.630> I<00:02:30.810> was<00:02:31.050> used<00:02:31.320> to<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.650> being<00:02:31.860> on

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
simply because I was used to it being on

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.620 
simply because I was used to it being on
the<00:02:32.130> ban<00:02:32.340> list<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.790> didn't<00:02:33.030> actually<00:02:33.120> look<00:02:33.480> at

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
the ban list I didn't actually look at

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.180 
the ban list I didn't actually look at
the<00:02:33.750> matter<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:34.170> think<00:02:34.410> hey<00:02:34.590> Brian<00:02:34.950> deck<00:02:35.070> he

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
the matter and think hey Brian deck he

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.590 
the matter and think hey Brian deck he
might<00:02:35.340> be<00:02:35.459> actually<00:02:35.580> quite<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:35.940> nice<00:02:36.120> card<00:02:36.450> to

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
might be actually quite a nice card to

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.300 
might be actually quite a nice card to
come<00:02:36.750> back<00:02:36.959> I<00:02:37.140> just<00:02:37.350> didn't<00:02:37.560> even<00:02:37.590> consider<00:02:38.070> it

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
come back I just didn't even consider it

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.710 
come back I just didn't even consider it
because<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.640> was<00:02:38.670> one<00:02:38.880> of<00:02:38.910> those<00:02:39.120> that<00:02:39.480> was

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
because it was one of those that was

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.210 
because it was one of those that was
just<00:02:40.470> so<00:02:40.910> brutal<00:02:41.910> back<00:02:42.270> in<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.570> day<00:02:43.190> they<00:02:44.190> just

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
just so brutal back in the day they just

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.949 
just so brutal back in the day they just
should<00:02:44.880> have<00:02:44.910> been<00:02:45.090> balanced<00:02:45.510> but<00:02:45.630> now<00:02:45.750> where

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
should have been balanced but now where

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.990 
should have been balanced but now where
I<00:02:46.020> geeky<00:02:46.350> still<00:02:46.650> an<00:02:46.739> incredible<00:02:46.890> cards<00:02:47.670> but

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
I geeky still an incredible cards but

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.540 
I geeky still an incredible cards but
depending<00:02:48.959> on<00:02:49.050> what<00:02:49.200> dekhi<00:02:49.440> play<00:02:49.890> against<00:02:50.400> and

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
depending on what dekhi play against and

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.280 
depending on what dekhi play against and
depending<00:02:50.940> on<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.150> situation<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.930> time<00:02:52.140> you

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
depending on the situation and time you

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.890 
depending on the situation and time you
draw<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:52.650> in<00:02:52.850> it<00:02:53.850> might<00:02:54.060> not<00:02:54.209> actually<00:02:54.390> be<00:02:54.630> that

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
draw it in it might not actually be that

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.780 
draw it in it might not actually be that
great<00:02:55.050> anymore<00:02:55.440> so<00:02:55.950> one<00:02:56.160> other<00:02:56.250> way<00:02:56.459> you<00:02:56.519> guys

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
great anymore so one other way you guys

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.600 
great anymore so one other way you guys
think<00:02:57.180> of<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.630> possibility<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:58.610> multiple

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
think of the possibility that multiple

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.729 
think of the possibility that multiple
destruction<00:03:00.239> cards<00:03:00.690> are<00:03:00.870> actually<00:03:01.560> going<00:03:01.650> to

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
destruction cards are actually going to

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.380 
destruction cards are actually going to
be<00:03:01.769> phased<00:03:02.070> out<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.610> think<00:03:02.820> I'm<00:03:02.970> just<00:03:03.239> maybe

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
be phased out you think I'm just maybe

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.940 
be phased out you think I'm just maybe
being<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.690> little<00:03:03.720> bit<00:03:04.050> paranoid<00:03:04.320> in<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.709> fact

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
being a little bit paranoid in the fact

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.070 
being a little bit paranoid in the fact
that<00:03:05.040> Konami<00:03:05.850> won't<00:03:06.060> make<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:06.510> future<00:03:06.959> just

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
that Konami won't make the future just

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.080 
that Konami won't make the future just
pendulum<00:03:07.650> based<00:03:07.860> archetypes<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.610> that<00:03:08.790> is<00:03:08.910> it

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
pendulum based archetypes and that is it

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.630 
pendulum based archetypes and that is it
