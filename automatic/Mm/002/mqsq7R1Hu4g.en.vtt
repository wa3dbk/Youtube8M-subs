primarily Huntington's disease our

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.919 
primarily Huntington's disease our
approach<00:00:10.650> is<00:00:10.980> using<00:00:11.790> simple<00:00:12.300> model<00:00:12.570> systems

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
approach is using simple model systems

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.169 
approach is using simple model systems
like<00:00:13.110> baker's<00:00:13.710> yeast<00:00:13.740> which<00:00:14.309> you<00:00:14.460> use<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.700> bake

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
like baker's yeast which you use to bake

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.330 
like baker's yeast which you use to bake
bread<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.509> brew<00:00:16.020> beer<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.470> fruit<00:00:17.100> flies

the conserved basic mechanisms involved
in<00:00:22.619> neurodegenerative<00:00:23.189> disease<00:00:23.580> so<00:00:24.539> one<00:00:24.689> of

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
in neurodegenerative disease so one of

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.839 
in neurodegenerative disease so one of
the<00:00:24.840> hallmarks<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.529> disease<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:26.039> cell

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
the hallmarks of the disease is cell

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.849 
the hallmarks of the disease is cell
death<00:00:27.119> in<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.390> case<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.859> Huntington's

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
death in the case of Huntington's

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.500 
death in the case of Huntington's
disease<00:00:28.949> since<00:00:29.849> it's<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.060> neurodegenerative

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
disease since it's a neurodegenerative

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.440 
disease since it's a neurodegenerative
disease<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.410> see<00:00:31.619> loss<00:00:31.980> or<00:00:32.369> death<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:33.000> neurons

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
disease you see loss or death of neurons

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.270 
disease you see loss or death of neurons
and<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:34.260> what<00:00:34.559> we<00:00:34.680> can<00:00:34.800> do<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.040> we<00:00:35.130> can<00:00:35.160> actually

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
and so what we can do is we can actually

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.639 
and so what we can do is we can actually
express<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.329> portion<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.410> mutant

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
express a portion of the mutant

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.619 
express a portion of the mutant
huntingtin<00:00:37.829> protein<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:38.610> baker's<00:00:39.149> yeast<00:00:39.180> and

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
huntingtin protein in baker's yeast and

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.350 
huntingtin protein in baker's yeast and
what<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.469> see<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.710> cell<00:00:41.040> death<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.969> mimics

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
what you see is cell death so it mimics

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.020 
what you see is cell death so it mimics
what's<00:00:42.540> going<00:00:42.809> on<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.140> neurons<00:00:44.030> the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
what's going on in the neurons the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.970 
what's going on in the neurons the
benefit<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.539> using<00:00:45.750> yeast<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.590> fact<00:00:46.829> that

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
benefit of using yeast is the fact that

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.940 
benefit of using yeast is the fact that
it's<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.460> very<00:00:48.090> simple<00:00:48.690> organism<00:00:49.260> has<00:00:49.590> very

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
it's a very simple organism has very

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.010 
it's a very simple organism has very
powerful<00:00:50.430> genetics<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.090> we<00:00:51.690> can<00:00:51.870> do

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
powerful genetics and we can do

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.990 
powerful genetics and we can do
experiments<00:00:52.559> very<00:00:52.739> very<00:00:52.949> rapidly<00:00:53.370> we<00:00:53.850> can

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
experiments very very rapidly we can

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.939 
experiments very very rapidly we can
basically<00:00:54.300> interrogate<00:00:55.020> every<00:00:55.379> single<00:00:55.680> yeast

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
basically interrogate every single yeast

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.979 
basically interrogate every single yeast
gene<00:00:56.280> by<00:00:56.610> either<00:00:56.789> deleting<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.570> or<00:00:57.780> over

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
gene by either deleting it or over

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.319 
gene by either deleting it or over
expressing<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.649> now<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.550> course<00:00:59.730> one<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
expressing it now of course one of the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.880 
expressing it now of course one of the
limitations<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.050> yeast<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.500> fact

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
limitations of the yeast is the fact

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.290 
limitations of the yeast is the fact
that<00:01:01.980> doesn't<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.399> nervous<00:01:02.640> system<00:01:03.090> and

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
that doesn't have a nervous system and

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.539 
that doesn't have a nervous system and
obviously<00:01:04.229> there<00:01:04.500> are<00:01:04.530> certain<00:01:04.979> symptoms<00:01:05.309> of

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
obviously there are certain symptoms of

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.130 
obviously there are certain symptoms of
the<00:01:05.610> disease<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.970> we<00:01:06.090> can't<00:01:06.330> mimic<00:01:06.540> for

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
the disease that we can't mimic for

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.440 
the disease that we can't mimic for
example<00:01:07.610> behavior<00:01:08.610> locomotor<00:01:09.360> activity

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
example behavior locomotor activity

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.300 
example behavior locomotor activity
these<00:01:09.990> sorts<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.320> things<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.979> can't<00:01:11.189> really

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
these sorts of things you can't really

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.670 
these sorts of things you can't really
look<00:01:11.490> at<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:11.850> East<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.750> that's<00:01:13.200> where<00:01:13.409> we<00:01:13.530> move

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
look at in East so that's where we move

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.380 
look at in East so that's where we move
into<00:01:13.860> Drosophila<00:01:14.549> which<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.760> also<00:01:15.119> very<00:01:15.270> very

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
into Drosophila which is also very very

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.870 
into Drosophila which is also very very
powerful<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.200> well<00:01:16.530> defined<00:01:16.740> genetic<00:01:17.549> tool

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
powerful and well defined genetic tool

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.359 
powerful and well defined genetic tool
but<00:01:18.450> obviously<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.840> big<00:01:19.140> benefit<00:01:19.619> for<00:01:19.770> us<00:01:20.100> is

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
but obviously the big benefit for us is

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.370 
but obviously the big benefit for us is
that<00:01:20.729> flies<00:01:21.060> have<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> nervous<00:01:21.509> system<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.259> we

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
that flies have a nervous system so we

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.499 
that flies have a nervous system so we
can<00:01:22.470> now<00:01:22.530> start<00:01:22.950> looking<00:01:23.310> at<00:01:23.460> phenotypes<00:01:24.210> or

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
can now start looking at phenotypes or

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.840 
can now start looking at phenotypes or
symptoms<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.680> drosophila<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.490> more

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
symptoms in the drosophila that more

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.450 
symptoms in the drosophila that more
closely<00:01:27.180> mimic<00:01:28.140> what's<00:01:28.590> going<00:01:28.950> on<00:01:29.100> in

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
closely mimic what's going on in

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.929 
closely mimic what's going on in
patients<00:01:30.799> the<00:01:31.799> combination<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.490> doing<00:01:32.759> work

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
patients the combination of doing work

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.870 
patients the combination of doing work
in<00:01:33.119> yeast<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.659> ursula<00:01:34.259> allows<00:01:34.829> us<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.220> quickly

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
in yeast and ursula allows us to quickly

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.450 
in yeast and ursula allows us to quickly
look<00:01:36.270> at<00:01:36.479> many<00:01:37.049> many<00:01:37.170> candidates<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:38.220> then

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
look at many many candidates but then

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.230 
look at many many candidates but then
actually<00:01:39.329> validate<00:01:39.960> them<00:01:40.140> very<00:01:40.320> robustly<00:01:41.240> in

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
actually validate them very robustly in

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.960 
actually validate them very robustly in
terms<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.810> our<00:01:43.110> work<00:01:43.409> we'd<00:01:43.799> like<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.159> see<00:01:44.340> some

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970

recently<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.840> appeared<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.290> be<00:01:49.320> protective

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
recently that appeared to be protective

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.560 
recently that appeared to be protective
in<00:01:50.040> our<00:01:50.159> models<00:01:50.490> we'd<00:01:50.759> like<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:50.939> actually<00:01:51.210> see

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
in our models we'd like to actually see

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.929 
in our models we'd like to actually see
these<00:01:51.720> tested<00:01:52.290> in<00:01:52.409> higher<00:01:52.710> systems<00:01:53.220> with<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
these tested in higher systems with the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.730 
these tested in higher systems with the
hope<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.390> then<00:01:54.810> these<00:01:54.990> could<00:01:55.229> be<00:01:55.350> moved<00:01:55.560> on

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
hope that then these could be moved on

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.459 
hope that then these could be moved on
ultimately<00:01:56.250> into<00:01:56.490> clinical<00:01:56.820> trials<00:01:57.270> and

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
ultimately into clinical trials and

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:59.539 
ultimately into clinical trials and
basically<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.680> our<00:01:58.770> work<00:01:59.009> now<00:01:59.280> has

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
basically that our work now has

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.850 
basically that our work now has
hopefully<00:02:00.210> served<00:02:00.659> as<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.899> filter<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.680> we've

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
hopefully served as a filter that we've

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.100 
hopefully served as a filter that we've
been<00:02:01.920> able<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.189> reduce<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.850> lot<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.390> red

able to identify some really strong

able to identify some really strong
candidates<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.920> are<00:02:07.950> worthy<00:02:08.340> of

candidates that are worthy of

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.790 
candidates that are worthy of
exploration<00:02:08.789> in<00:02:09.539> higher<00:02:09.780> systems<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.530> to

exploration in higher systems and to

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
really reduce hopefully in the future

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.490 
really reduce hopefully in the future
the<00:02:12.629> number<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:12.959> animals

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500

onset<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:16.920> Huntington's<00:02:17.370> disease<00:02:17.490> maybe<00:02:18.060> 45

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
onset of Huntington's disease maybe 45

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.600 
onset of Huntington's disease maybe 45
years<00:02:18.840> of<00:02:18.990> age<00:02:19.170> but<00:02:19.500> there<00:02:20.220> are<00:02:20.280> subtle

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
years of age but there are subtle

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.760 
years of age but there are subtle
changes<00:02:21.030> occurring<00:02:21.480> before<00:02:21.630> that<00:02:22.110> that<00:02:22.590> we're

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
changes occurring before that that we're

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.230 
changes occurring before that that we're
now<00:02:22.890> starting<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.340> look<00:02:23.490> at<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:24.000> think<00:02:24.180> it

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
now starting to look at and I think it

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.670 
now starting to look at and I think it
would<00:02:24.330> be<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.420> big<00:02:24.600> breakthrough<00:02:24.900> if<00:02:25.320> people

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
would be a big breakthrough if people

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.740 
would be a big breakthrough if people
could<00:02:25.830> identify<00:02:26.040> protective<00:02:27.000> compounds<00:02:27.180> such

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
could identify protective compounds such

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.210 
could identify protective compounds such
as<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.990> ones<00:02:28.140> that<00:02:28.230> we've<00:02:28.350> identified<00:02:28.560> and

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
as the ones that we've identified and

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.830 
as the ones that we've identified and
see<00:02:29.460> whether<00:02:29.610> or<00:02:29.700> not<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:29.940> can<00:02:30.090> modulate<00:02:30.330> some

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
see whether or not you can modulate some

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.260 
see whether or not you can modulate some
of<00:02:30.930> these<00:02:30.990> biomarkers<00:02:31.500> in<00:02:31.890> advance<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:32.940> actual

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
of these biomarkers in advance of actual

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.510 
of these biomarkers in advance of actual
disease<00:02:33.600> onset<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:34.350> think<00:02:34.830> that's<00:02:35.010> really<00:02:35.400> what

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
disease onset I think that's really what

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.100 
disease onset I think that's really what
we're<00:02:35.640> talking<00:02:35.790> about<00:02:36.060> here<00:02:36.209> maybe<00:02:36.750> not<00:02:36.959> so

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
we're talking about here maybe not so

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.930 
we're talking about here maybe not so
much<00:02:37.170> curing<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.040> is<00:02:38.220> in<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.520> classical

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
much curing and is in the classical

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.280 
much curing and is in the classical
sense<00:02:38.970> of<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.270> word<00:02:39.450> curing<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.840> disease<00:02:40.110> but

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
sense of the word curing a disease but

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.080 
sense of the word curing a disease but
really<00:02:40.590> trying<00:02:41.070> to<00:02:41.130> delayed<00:02:41.520> onset<00:02:41.850> of

really trying to delayed onset of
symptoms<00:02:42.390> because<00:02:42.780> if<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:43.020> can<00:02:43.140> push<00:02:43.350> back

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
symptoms because if you can push back

the<00:02:43.620> average<00:02:44.010> age<00:02:44.220> of<00:02:44.310> onset<00:02:44.490> from<00:02:44.820> 45<00:02:45.209> years

it'll<00:02:50.459> be<00:02:50.550> perfect<00:02:50.910> we'll<00:02:51.000> probably<00:02:51.180> have<00:02:51.360> to
