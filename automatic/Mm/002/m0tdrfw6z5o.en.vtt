something<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.399> was<00:00:41.790> really<00:00:41.910> good<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.270> cover

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
something that was really good to cover

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.130 
something that was really good to cover
on<00:00:42.719> like<00:00:43.680> cover<00:00:43.920> him<00:00:44.070> up<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.430> was<00:00:44.910> used<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.329> NYC<00:00:46.110> i

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
on like cover him up I was used in NYC i

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.400 
on like cover him up I was used in NYC i
think<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.890> green<00:00:47.280> color<00:00:47.579> stick<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:49.110> mean

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
think the green color stick and I mean

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.049 
think the green color stick and I mean
it<00:00:49.620> didn't<00:00:49.860> work<00:00:50.010> relate<00:00:50.399> as<00:00:50.610> well<00:00:50.789> as<00:00:50.910> I

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
it didn't work relate as well as I

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.180 
it didn't work relate as well as I
wanted<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.840> noticed<00:00:52.260> throughout<00:00:53.039> the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
wanted it to I noticed throughout the

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.920 
wanted it to I noticed throughout the
day<00:00:53.340> like<00:00:53.610> my<00:00:53.879> cheeks<00:00:54.090> would<00:00:54.329> end<00:00:54.539> up<00:00:54.660> getting

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
day like my cheeks would end up getting

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.410 
day like my cheeks would end up getting
read<00:00:55.110> anyway<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.640> cheaper<00:00:57.000> brand<00:00:57.239> I

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
read anyway and it is a cheaper brand I

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.580 
read anyway and it is a cheaper brand I
know<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.780> I've<00:00:57.870> tried<00:00:58.020> several<00:00:58.440> different
