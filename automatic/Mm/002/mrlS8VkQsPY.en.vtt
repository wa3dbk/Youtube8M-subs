can get so I had 15 minutes to find out

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.499 
can get so I had 15 minutes to find out
a<00:01:46.380> way<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.680> log<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.250> get<00:01:47.430> my<00:01:47.460> stuff<00:01:47.880> so

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
a way to log in and get my stuff so

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.240 
a way to log in and get my stuff so
basically<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.079> just<00:01:49.380> immediately<00:01:49.649> started

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
basically I just immediately started

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.190 
basically I just immediately started
quick<00:01:50.460> thinking<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.479> realized<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.110> I

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
quick thinking and I realized that I

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.530 
quick thinking and I realized that I
have<00:01:52.380> my<00:01:52.500> jagex<00:01:52.950> laptop<00:01:53.280> open<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.880> actually<00:01:54.119> did

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
have my jagex laptop open I actually did

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.999 
have my jagex laptop open I actually did
have<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.810> restart<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.350> because<00:01:55.619> if<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.829> leave

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
have to restart it because if you leave

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.920 
have to restart it because if you leave
it<00:01:56.040> on<00:01:56.189> for<00:01:56.250> too<00:01:56.549> long<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.820> have<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.180> retype<00:01:57.719> in

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
it on for too long you have to retype in

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.410 
it on for too long you have to retype in
through<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.409> VPN<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.340> had<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.610> do<00:01:59.820> that<00:01:59.969> but

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420
