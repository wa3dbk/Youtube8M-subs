00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
hitting that way I know which areas to

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:17.270 
hitting that way I know which areas to
focus<00:04:10.900> on<00:04:11.380> for<00:04:12.010> the<00:04:12.070> org<00:04:12.430> are<00:04:12.700> more<00:04:13.030> cold<00:04:13.360> I

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.210 

then<00:04:18.280> painted<00:04:18.670> his<00:04:18.910> seat<00:04:19.600> and<00:04:20.440> Minister<00:04:20.950> Adam

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.060 
gray to write a little bit more depth of
color<00:04:26.350> for<00:04:27.070> the<00:04:27.160> seat<00:04:27.340> I<00:04:27.550> then<00:04:27.880> gave<00:04:28.180> the<00:04:29.070> seat

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
color for the seat I then gave the seat

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.060

consecutive shadings row being non oil

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.010 
consecutive shadings row being non oil
and<00:04:35.490> then<00:04:36.490> I<00:04:36.760> just<00:04:36.910> highlighted<00:04:37.450> once<00:04:37.750> again

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
and then I just highlighted once again

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.780 
and then I just highlighted once again
very<00:04:38.260> quickly<00:04:38.470> with<00:04:38.950> a<00:04:38.980> minister<00:04:39.400> Adam<00:04:39.610> grey

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
again this is a very quick way of

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.320 
again this is a very quick way of
producing<00:04:41.800> a<00:04:42.130> slight<00:04:42.520> gradient<00:04:42.970> in<00:04:43.120> color

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
producing a slight gradient in color

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.150 
producing a slight gradient in color
just<00:04:43.780> going<00:04:44.020> back<00:04:44.140> to<00:04:44.200> the<00:04:44.350> base<00:04:44.500> color<00:04:44.710> after

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
just going back to the base color after

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.380 
just going back to the base color after
a<00:04:45.190> single<00:04:45.430> shading

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.360 

I<00:04:49.460> then<00:04:50.460> base<00:04:50.760> coated<00:04:51.180> all<00:04:51.390> of<00:04:51.930> the<00:04:52.230> skulls<00:04:52.980> on

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
I then base coated all of the skulls on

00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:01.220 
I then base coated all of the skulls on
the<00:04:54.090> model<00:04:54.390> with<00:04:54.660> rushabh<00:04:54.990> t-bone<00:05:00.230> chef
