00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:13.699
 the resistance

 and the resistance 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.039
 from my point of view and taking synthesis from mendez authors 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:21.699
 in psychophysical capacity 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.890
 that allows the athlete to maintain the quality quantity of efforts that 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.220

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.300
 at speed 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.560
 Strength resistance we can define 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.380
 as the capacity that will support the maintenance of the different 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.980
 force demands are the attic explosive

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.750
 at speed 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.860
 is the capacity that will sustain the intensity in the movements a maximum 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.690
 and maximum translation 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.980
 and it is based on the capacity of synthesis

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.160
 football 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.160
 it's a sport nekane intermittent entity 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.730
 where the players 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.770
 they have to sustain a high level of stress that ariaga arrives 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.890
 maximum approximately around 75 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.930
 80% uploaded maximum throughout the 90 minutes that lasts 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.880
 at the same time 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.880
 they have to maintain a quality of muscular contraction 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.020
 very high 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.740
 during in a car 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.869
 that's why resistance in football is not just a problem of 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.889
 Metabolic characteristics if not also a linked problem 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:10.539
