00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
so each of them are like doing it you

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.889 
so each of them are like doing it you
know<00:00:31.279> you<00:00:32.279> know<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:33.000> distinctive<00:00:33.750> way

tour is kind of like fatalistic I would

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.779 
tour is kind of like fatalistic I would
say<00:00:45.000> talking<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.629> this<00:00:45.750> camera<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.440> decided<00:00:47.309> to

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
say talking to this camera I decided to

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.049 
say talking to this camera I decided to
put<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.600> camera<00:00:49.020> in<00:00:49.920> such<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> way<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.610> it's

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
put the camera in such a way that it's

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.380 
put the camera in such a way that it's
basically<00:00:52.129> on<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.399> first<00:00:53.670> panel

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
basically on the first panel

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.160 
basically on the first panel
the<00:00:55.050> camera<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:56.120> underneath<00:00:57.120> them<00:00:57.420> second

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
the camera is underneath them second

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.100 
the camera is underneath them second
panel<00:00:58.469> it's<00:00:58.770> roughly<00:00:59.840> I<00:01:01.370> I<00:01:02.370> hate<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
panel it's roughly I I hate and the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.640 
panel it's roughly I I hate and the
first<00:01:04.350> panel<00:01:04.710> its<00:01:05.060> tanning<00:01:06.060> about<00:01:06.390> them<00:01:06.659> so

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
first panel its tanning about them so

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.890 
first panel its tanning about them so
basically<00:01:08.189> when<00:01:08.729> we<00:01:08.880> get<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.270> our<00:01:09.299> next<00:01:09.540> page

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
basically when we get to our next page

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.070 
basically when we get to our next page
double<00:01:10.380> splash<00:01:10.680> it's<00:01:11.400> kind<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.840> same

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
double splash it's kind of on the same

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.649 
double splash it's kind of on the same
position<00:01:13.650> just<00:01:13.920> following<00:01:14.430> down<00:01:14.640> towards<00:01:15.299> the

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
position just following down towards the

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.060 
position just following down towards the
main<00:01:16.350> villain<00:01:17.210> obviously<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:19.070> phase

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
main villain obviously this is phase

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.570

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
it's candidate and processed in

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.230 
it's candidate and processed in
Photoshop<00:01:47.899> then<00:01:48.899> we<00:01:49.110> go<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:50.000> black<00:01:51.000> and

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
Photoshop then we go to the black and

all the details are fleshed out there

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.870 
all the details are fleshed out there
and<00:01:56.700> it's<00:01:57.420> over<00:01:57.689> whether<00:01:57.960> it's

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
and it's over whether it's

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.390 
and it's over whether it's
mostly<00:01:59.840> the<00:02:00.230> way<00:02:00.350> it's<00:02:00.530> gonna<00:02:00.710> be<00:02:00.830> in<00:02:01.040> the<00:02:01.220> end

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
mostly the way it's gonna be in the end

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.590 
mostly the way it's gonna be in the end
based<00:02:02.390> 4<00:02:02.810> which<00:02:03.380> is<00:02:03.580> grayscale<00:02:04.580> I<00:02:05.000> would<00:02:05.479> say

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
based 4 which is grayscale I would say

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.150 
based 4 which is grayscale I would say
more<00:02:05.810> interesting<00:02:06.290> this<00:02:06.409> is<00:02:06.470> basically<00:02:06.920> what

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
more interesting this is basically what

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.380 
more interesting this is basically what
I'm<00:02:07.250> doing<00:02:07.310> on<00:02:07.670> each<00:02:07.790> page<00:02:08.830> since<00:02:09.830> I<00:02:10.340> want<00:02:11.000> to

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
I'm doing on each page since I want to

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.140 
I'm doing on each page since I want to
control<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.980> lighting<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:15.670> highlights<00:02:16.670> you

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
control the lighting and highlights you

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.440 
control the lighting and highlights you
know<00:02:17.300> in<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:17.930> rendering<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:19.240> basically<00:02:20.240> this

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
know in a rendering and basically this

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.180 
know in a rendering and basically this
is<00:02:20.510> kinda<00:02:21.260> rough<00:02:21.320> guide<00:02:21.709> for<00:02:22.780> forest<00:02:23.780> where

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
is kinda rough guide for forest where

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.920 
is kinda rough guide for forest where
you<00:02:25.190> know<00:02:26.320> white<00:02:27.320> and<00:02:27.620> shadows<00:02:28.010> are<00:02:28.900> he<00:02:29.900> can

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
you know white and shadows are he can

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.560 
you know white and shadows are he can
actually<00:02:30.260> use<00:02:30.800> the<00:02:31.400> renderings<00:02:31.880> you<00:02:32.209> know<00:02:32.360> the

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
actually use the renderings you know the

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.479 
actually use the renderings you know the
faces<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.470> stuff<00:02:33.830> like<00:02:34.040> that<00:02:34.630> she<00:02:35.630> just<00:02:35.840> turns

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
faces and stuff like that she just turns

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.570 
faces and stuff like that she just turns
those<00:02:37.489> things<00:02:37.910> in<00:02:38.300> color<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:39.260> maybe<00:02:39.890> has<00:02:40.250> a

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
those things in color and maybe has a

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.920 
those things in color and maybe has a
little<00:02:40.880> bit<00:02:40.970> of<00:02:41.120> highlights<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:41.780> that's

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
little bit of highlights and that's

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.830 
little bit of highlights and that's
about<00:02:42.080> it<00:02:42.230> so<00:02:42.620> it<00:02:42.950> kinda<00:02:43.400> makes<00:02:43.580> it<00:02:43.840> much

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
about it so it kinda makes it much

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:55.710
