 yesterday at night from the list it is occupied by an attitude 

00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:19.839
 Since we sincerely 50 to 60% of our fleet are phenomena and how

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.450
 that is the test 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.200
 As you can see, it is a performance that will break it, but the calibrators 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.360
 Cuba by means of the heras 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.520
 lilita that as you can see they have a table where you can measure this 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.380
 speed of the game being thrown the stone then right now let's start 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.900

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.530

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.530
 91 miles per hour 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.400
 3 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.710
 we must see 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.710
 the impact that left 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.820
 5 as you can see a booty to look for a more than half no no 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.430
 damage in a thousand libraries can be visibly present the year nothing more 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.170
 this purpose the mica within a cost of internal consumption we will try it to the 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.390
 maximum the maximum are one hundred 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.390
 start in miles per hour 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:56.940
 reporter 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:07.130
 on the other hand prat regarding the report return to register the d mark of the 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.130
 second part where he delivered vii 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:15.790
 the damage is nothing more in the mica there is no damage to the windshield here with takeoff 

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:17.199
 the first time 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:19.919
 I want to score goals but the second time 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:23.459
 you can appreciate there is not our corrido 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.189
 the glass is not broken 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:27.629
 here neither 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.399
 or what the only thing I wanted to show you here 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:33.369
 this inside the windshield 

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:36.089
 I'm not touching and it's not 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:39.009
 starred not there 

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:43.229
 do not feel that the windshield is damaged this is because 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:46.229
 inside the pao 

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:55.979
 let's do the test now with the vehicle that does not have the judge 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.530
 and we are waiting for up to 120 mills 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:03.139
 per hour 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.019
 as you can see peta 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:12.169
 the video that 

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:17.369
 crashed in two places at the same veloing veloing the product 

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:19.979
 did not break the fifth 

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:21.909
 then it broke 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:23.729
 here the windshield 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:25.269
 can not be observed 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.339
 they chose this spider legs 

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:29.969
 sta k 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:32.469
 so obviously this windshield 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:37.010
 6 you have to change it because you can not take it one step further 

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:39.769
 places with the same stone 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:40.810
 for the first time
