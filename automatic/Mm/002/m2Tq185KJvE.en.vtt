00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 and good kids here we are in a 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.290
 new video before anything you always have 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.819
 in the description a page of coins 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.620
 very cheap to buy coins with the 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.660
 code seen you have a 5% discount 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.059
 that's good, it makes it cheaper 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.590
 still and well here you see the title 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.450
 of the video five players five 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.650
 predictions of players for fifa 16 and 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.990
 well let's go to the point we have the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.510
 first player we have here they cover a 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.760
 player this year I think not me 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.779
 has disappointed or blunted by 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.890
 how well he has done it or how badly 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.050
 who has done it will simply be 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.000
 substitute of bouquets and pepe and like that 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.140
 has served as a substitute so 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.640
 for next year I do not think that in 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.739
 as to average they raise nothing and neither 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.960
 to get it down leaves an average of 81 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.000
 but one thing that is almost confirmed 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.520
 I do not know where I've seen that that's almost 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.899
 most likely you have 80 rhythm and 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.370
 well you see that it drops a little bit 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.950
 defense to physics to be the uploaded but 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.870
 good as if we download it also yes 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.550
 yes it is true that it has 80's pace going to 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.649
 to be a player who is going to have is going to give 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.149
 a lot to talk about in fifa 16 especially 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.670
 well that's because in the bv there has never been 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.829
 of defenses in rapid plan with 80 and 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.300
 so many of rhythm and we hope that they go what 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.520
 either because that has some statistics 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.500
 that if you add 80 rhythm then it would be 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.909
 pretty good in addition with bouquets like 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.300
 central couple if it is not going to the 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.640
 Manchester 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.260
 Well it would come quite well and good what 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.340
 said here we have a defense that goes to 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.750
 give a lot to talk about next year and 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.630
 let's move on to the next player 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.850
 we have here lionel messi a player 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.680
 that surely after so long 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.630
 I think that they will be fully charged 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.580
 in fifa and well you know that is 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.170
 Christian everybody says good everything 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.330
 world says Christian in the cifa is 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.160
 Undoubtedly, it is better than messi because 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.780
 next safest year is that 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.000
 right put and end to messi 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.850
 83th place equal equal 83 equal 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.740
 they are 84 going down they are going to lower 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.960
 it keeps you from getting it or you upload it from 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.750
 mean and you see that the statistics then 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.060
 I have kept them even raised 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.460
 physical and defense the rhythm it 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.830
 it goes down a little bit because good drops a 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.210
 rhythm point I think 83 is the same 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.820
 even too much for messi but good 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.990
 although they are 80 although they are 93 I have said 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.520
 82 92 and even if they are 93 it does not matter I think 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.920
 that is a player messi is a player 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.690
 obviously to see what they give to messi in 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.600
 hand and he takes it safe but I think 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.820
 I if next year 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.030
 how are you playing this year will you come out of 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.280
 far right and if so, it's going to be more 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.690
 difficult to take advantage of I do not say that it is 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.090
 worst player is more the player will be 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.040
 just like this year or better even but 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.319
 right end because it will not be what 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.670
 same apart from being left-handed and for 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.239
 get inside and kick is going to be 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.950
 Well, it's a delight, but well, I think 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.150
 that is not the same to have a 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.400
 center forward player that 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.160
 extreme right and messi we're going to 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.270
 I can take less, I think that 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.819
 is the word that can be said and 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.260
 well let's move on to the next player 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.120
 we have the nolito a good player this 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.550
 it's not a real prediction this is a 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.440
 prediction what I would like and is 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.880
 How nice I honestly nolito with the 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.200
 good season the season 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.239
 temporadÃ³n that has done this year of 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.769
 Celtic 'I think the most logical thing is that 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.530
 for next year we have a nolito 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.930
 in sestao but good you know that the 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.630
 of fifa I do not know what's wrong with those of 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.760
 the bbva league that always returns to 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.290
 Spanish more still good is that I what 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.080
 I think and say if it is bad iniesta is 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.660
 bad xavi is bad 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.590
 I wanted cesc fabregas because nolito goes to 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.020
 be worse yet 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.670
 and is that you see it here on the left 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.130
 you have this year's letter a shit 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.440
 a complete shit and to the right is what 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.940
 that I would like me to be 16 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.680
 things that are not going to be simply 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.990
 you see that really 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.630
 neither is it a super super che 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.210
 is at 84 the pace of the almost 80 debate 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.220
 shot is a good card to be a good 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.960
 player so I know 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.790
 that you want me to say without without exaggerating 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.340
 right now I think he's not ready is 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.710
 much better than is aragua and such 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.330
 even that giovinco and giovinco and sara 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.490
 guayin statistics you hit that thousand 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.110
 turns to nolito because I think that to me 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.910
 I would like to go to me I would like to 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.440
 I think it would be fair that we have nolito 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.630
 as well as view to the right the year that 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.240
 it comes but we'll leave it like 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.100
 like an illusion of mine and leave it there 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.570
 because we go I would like very much but 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.090
 you know how they are from there I do not think that 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.770
 carry with us like for good is going to 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.910
 behave with nolito as to put them and 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.610
 well we move on to the next player 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.130
 We have a forward here 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.020
 that this year has been the top scorer the lic 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.280
 one of the French league and that for the 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.990
 next year 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.030
 but they will rise above all on average from 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:16.639
 uploaded monet has an area 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.260
 and I think they will raise it to 83 average 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.700
 and it's not a little bit less a bit 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.900
 more but good in terms of 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.060
 statistics I think they will still be there 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.419
 similar shots will be uploaded to you 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.620
 because rhythm and dribbling and such that though 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.389
 you rise in most not only usually 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.770
 Look me up and good because in toni 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.330
 kroos to one of these players who from 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.070
 last year they have gone up a lot 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.110
 mean and what is the rhythm have left 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.280
 intact even be they have lowered the 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.630
 going up something else and they lower the pace 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.639
 they are not things that do not understand good 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.250
 we passed already the last player we have 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:45.230
 here to danilo a player who also goes 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.320
 to be quite important if it is 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.970
 as I like him I do the prediction and 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.320
 well I uploaded four points of rhythm 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.940
 and it has gone up a lot of physical defense 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.010
 I think this has been the year let's say 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.470
 revelation of danilo's age for something 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.150
 is right now in Madrid and dani 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.890
 alves we will see how is the letter of dani 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.330
 next year as he has done 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.190
 this year but good if dani alves is still 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.350
 in its line of lowering what comes to be 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.060
 the last store letter is the worst and 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.410
 they take away more rhythm yet thing that I 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.510
 I would miss but good in case 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.700
 happen surely danilo be the only 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.740
 substitute that we have of dani alves in 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.330
 the right band I say of lateral is 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.410
 better than carvajal and such is also a 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.430
 very complete player as you can 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.960
 check the letter 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.970
 to the right of uploaded a little bit more 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.800
 in what comes to be total dribble almost 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.210
 not uploaded but good would be a player 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.800
 we could use quite good enough 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.480
 well and good now yes yes kids already 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.650
 everything is commented all the players 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.050
 I hope you liked the video 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.370
 Commenting already know what I said you have 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.540
 in the section the page of coins and 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.540
 until the next kids
