and<00:03:13.860> I<00:03:14.010> think<00:03:14.310> I<00:03:14.580> speak<00:03:14.640> on<00:03:15.030> behalf<00:03:15.210> of<00:03:15.480> our

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
and I think I speak on behalf of our

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.560 
and I think I speak on behalf of our
shelves<00:03:15.930> so<00:03:16.230> for<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.500> same<00:03:16.680> thing<00:03:17.090> he's<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.120> son

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
shelves so for the same thing he's a son

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.840 
shelves so for the same thing he's a son
of<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.780> soil<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.230> I<00:03:19.380> think<00:03:19.590> we<00:03:19.680> both<00:03:19.860> believe

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
of the soil and I think we both believe

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.960 
of the soil and I think we both believe
that<00:03:21.050> where<00:03:22.050> we<00:03:22.140> come<00:03:22.320> from<00:03:22.350> is<00:03:22.970> more

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
that where we come from is more

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.090 
that where we come from is more
important<00:03:24.570> than<00:03:25.170> where<00:03:25.380> we<00:03:25.500> are<00:03:25.680> because<00:03:25.830> it's

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
important than where we are because it's

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.180 
important than where we are because it's
important<00:03:26.580> to<00:03:26.930> remember<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.590> people<00:03:28.770> who<00:03:28.950> got
