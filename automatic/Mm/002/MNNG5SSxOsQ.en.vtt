down<00:00:47.340> for<00:00:47.579> about<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.789> month<00:00:48.030> I've<00:00:48.809> driven<00:00:49.110> over

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
down for about a month I've driven over

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.020 
down for about a month I've driven over
it<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.680> packed<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.039> down<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.579> can<00:00:50.760> see<00:00:50.910> up

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
it and packed it down you can see up

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.490 
it and packed it down you can see up
over<00:00:51.270> here<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.480> packed<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.930> down<00:00:52.050> pretty<00:00:52.230> good

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
over here I packed it down pretty good

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.470 
over here I packed it down pretty good
up<00:00:52.739> here<00:00:53.100> I've<00:00:53.640> just<00:00:53.879> brought<00:00:54.090> some<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
up here I've just brought some of the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.410 
up here I've just brought some of the
material<00:00:54.960> back<00:00:55.170> down<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:56.070> way<00:00:56.270> because<00:00:57.270> I

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
material back down this way because I

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.760 
material back down this way because I
think<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.719> had<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.109> little<00:00:58.140> bit<00:00:58.379> too<00:00:58.590> much

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
think I had just a little bit too much

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.709 
think I had just a little bit too much
angle<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.870> but<00:01:01.850> we'll<00:01:02.850> see<00:01:03.000> what<00:01:03.120> happens

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
angle on it but we'll see what happens

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.990 
angle on it but we'll see what happens
the<00:01:04.220> probably<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.280> hardest<00:01:05.700> part<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
the probably the hardest part of the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000 
the probably the hardest part of the
whole<00:01:06.119> deal<00:01:06.330> was<00:01:06.600> seven<00:01:07.470> tons<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.799> gravel

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
whole deal was seven tons of gravel

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.190 
whole deal was seven tons of gravel
shoveled<00:01:08.790> by<00:01:08.970> hand<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:11.420> anywho<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.020> it

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
shoveled by hand so anywho this is it

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.830 
shoveled by hand so anywho this is it
there's<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.860> slight<00:01:14.189> rise<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.390> brickwork

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
there's a slight rise in the brickwork

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.429 
there's a slight rise in the brickwork
you<00:01:16.080> can<00:01:16.229> see<00:01:16.409> right<00:01:17.400> up<00:01:17.520> over<00:01:17.670> here<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.659> was

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
you can see right up over here I was

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.830 
you can see right up over here I was
this<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.009> all<00:01:20.310> perfectly<00:01:20.759> graded<00:01:21.299> with<00:01:21.689> the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
this is all perfectly graded with the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.530 
this is all perfectly graded with the
ground<00:01:22.110> all<00:01:22.350> down<00:01:22.560> here<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.240> there's<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.299> rise

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
ground all down here and there's a rise

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.300 
ground all down here and there's a rise
up<00:01:24.840> here<00:01:25.140> because<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.560> wanted<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.860> eventually

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
up here because I wanted to eventually

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.890 
up here because I wanted to eventually
catch<00:01:26.490> up<00:01:26.520> with<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.939> grade<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.630> doesn't

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
catch up with the grade so it doesn't

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.630 
catch up with the grade so it doesn't
look<00:01:28.020> like<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.409> now<00:01:28.560> but<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.100> perfectly

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
look like it now but this is perfectly

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.179 
look like it now but this is perfectly
level<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.270> here<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.229> kind<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.829> wish<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.159> just

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
level in here so I kind of wish I just

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.359 
level in here so I kind of wish I just
stayed<00:01:32.700> with<00:01:33.030> what<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.600> was<00:01:33.840> doing<00:01:34.130> just<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.250> it

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
stayed with what I was doing just so it

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.480
