00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.959 
of countries now I did choose the Nikon
because<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.379> went<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> couple<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.399> stores<00:00:44.640> and

like<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.520> nicest<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:47.940> my<00:00:48.090> hand<00:00:48.300> which<00:00:48.840> I

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
like the nicest in my hand which I

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.090

thought<00:00:49.110> was<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.260> very<00:00:49.469> very<00:00:49.680> important

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
thought was a very very important

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.520 
thought was a very very important
quality<00:00:50.460> now<00:00:51.360> looking<00:00:52.020> at<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.199> physical

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.550 
back we do have our 3 inch screen now
this<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.240> one<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.570> places<00:01:18.750> where<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.350> low

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
this is one of the places where the low

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.880 
this is one of the places where the low
price<00:01:19.799> sticks<00:01:20.130> out<00:01:20.310> because<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:21.030> only<00:01:21.240> a

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
price sticks out because this is only a

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.740 
price sticks out because this is only a
230,000<00:01:22.890> dot<00:01:23.070> our<00:01:23.430> resolution<00:01:24.330> screen<00:01:24.600> it's

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
230,000 dot our resolution screen it's

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.780 
230,000 dot our resolution screen it's
not<00:01:24.900> very<00:01:25.140> higher<00:01:25.320> as<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.770> does<00:01:26.310> get<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.549> job

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
not very higher as it does get the job

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.940 
not very higher as it does get the job
done<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.150> does<00:01:27.360> look<00:01:27.570> quite<00:01:27.810> nice<00:01:28.049> but<00:01:28.860> I'm

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
done and does look quite nice but I'm

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.620 
done and does look quite nice but I'm
sure<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.250> Nikon<00:01:29.610> could<00:01:29.850> do<00:01:29.970> better<00:01:30.180> as<00:01:30.450> they

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
sure that Nikon could do better as they

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.590 
sure that Nikon could do better as they
did<00:01:30.780> show<00:01:30.930> us<00:01:31.079> in<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.290> new<00:01:31.409> Nikon<00:01:31.740> d3200<00:01:32.600> now

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
did show us in the new Nikon d3200 now

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.510 
did show us in the new Nikon d3200 now
on<00:01:33.750> top<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.110> we<00:01:34.320> do<00:01:34.470> have<00:01:34.740> our<00:01:34.770> optical

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
on top of that we do have our optical

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.600 
on top of that we do have our optical
viewfinder<00:01:36.030> now<00:01:36.299> like<00:01:36.600> most<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:37.079> provides<00:01:37.710> 95%

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
viewfinder now like most I provides 95%

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.940 
viewfinder now like most I provides 95%
of<00:01:38.700> view<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.689> does<00:01:39.810> work<00:01:39.960> pretty<00:01:39.990> well<00:01:40.200> now

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
of view and it does work pretty well now

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.020 
of view and it does work pretty well now

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
is that it has this nice little switch

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.590 
is that it has this nice little switch
here<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.860> switch<00:01:44.070> between<00:01:44.390> the<00:01:45.390> viewfinder

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600
