00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.510
 of this month 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.939
 everyone who received the copy of the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.460

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.580
 upgrade your windows to this new 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.219

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.809
 amount of users receive 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.730
 then you see that it's all right the 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.370
 windows 10 did not give many banks in these 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.530
 Users on these pcs 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.719
 hence it catches and releases a further quantity 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.510
 or better free windows 10 for more 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.210
 an amount of pcs and so it goes up 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.280
 release to everyone as she is 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.159

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.710
 windows 10 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.600
