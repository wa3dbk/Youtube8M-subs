00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.910
 another good question again from 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.590
 man under the nickname 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:14.059
 from view about articular gymnastics 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.230
 such questions are often asked 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:22.109
 I will try to answer 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:23.490
 to be simple and understandable if interference 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.320
 besides strength exercises go 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:31.380
 any exercises on joints rather 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.640
 just and the person under the nickname of view 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.590
 experience is not a small occupation go if 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.079
 asks such a question the bottom line is that 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.030
 go except weight training 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.140
 there is a unique go feature this is still 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.320
 and stretching stretching from the so-called 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.260
 active type when I am a muscle 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.570
 stretching another muscle and at the same time 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.170
 I develop the joint because everything 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.449
 movement we have an amplitude maximum 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.329
 amplitude which can only be done 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.700
 we don't have short courses of movements all 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.470
 wide all wide if shoulders that 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.990
 shoulders open if the spine then 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.909
 spine in all directions and bends out 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.220
 hip joint here tucked in rows 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.979
 the joint also opens on the neck 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:22.170
 concerns 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:24.360
 the whole body brushes are just awesome 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.640
 the difference between the move and other world types 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.710
 stretch marks than we stretch the body not 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.090
 under your own not under the action of your own 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.250
 weight with opposing muscles 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.119
 there is a go initially present 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.400
 articular gymnastics which except 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.040
 joint development makes it even more 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.159
 elastic this is the default you can 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.869
 I canâ€™t believe but after a month you work 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.960
 you yourself say that you are increasing 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.079
 mobility in all joints is another matter 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.790
 what do we have some physiological 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:59.189
 norms 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.960
 so in the course you get close to these 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.729
 physiological nights for example this 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.320
 just this angle is 90 degrees 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.179
 combined physiological norm and down 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.500
 also 90 degrees it too 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.600
 physiological norm 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.260
 some may have a little more 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.600
 less is our individual 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.260
 features if you want something beyond 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.600
 your his 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.960
 optimum so this is already focused 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.090
 special training maybe she with 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.740
 the roads will have nothing to do 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.060
 because work on the result 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.530
 but the course will lead you to this optimum 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.680
 again one of the indicator in general 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.530
 for example, his legs are standing next to bend 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.560
 to the floor so what would the palms put on 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.640
 the floor is also a physiological norm Thu 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.220
 should be able to do it 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:51.060
 the input is also get if you 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.410
 engage regularly so talk 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.989
 that go it is purely strength training 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.640
 without the development of joints it is very 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:02.250
 incorrectly just try you will 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:05.130
 yourself surprised if you if you 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.360
 need something for joint development but not 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.360
 power view so firstly 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.950
 any motor options 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.660
 activity are close to you I have already 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.010
 this many times many talk go 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.140
 two or three times a week 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.140
 muscle developmental strength training 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.100
 and ligaments of the joints of the bones for exchange look for 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.019
 and for the nervous system 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.510
 the rest of the time, all you need is 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.100
 please want stretched 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.590
 please stretch your yoga 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.690
 Please yoga if you also have to 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:39.000
 this is how ready for it and it is only 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:40.739
 welcome if you are interested in me 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.790
 I can offer in this regard 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:47.220
 please can as a coach 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:51.440
 morning charge perform 18-minute 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.700
 go blitz in the morning but without 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.739
 shock voltage as its usual 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.200
 I advise then it will just warm up 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:02.190
 let's say at 50 percent powerful stress 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.440
 not at 80 90 as I say let's get to 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.299
 it was strength training she had with such 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.709
 weak tension very well 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.959
 acts and people quite often 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:14.600
 used precisely as an internal 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:17.600
 18 minutes charge on the main 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.600
 zones
