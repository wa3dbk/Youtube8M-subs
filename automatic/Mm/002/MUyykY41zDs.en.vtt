more efficient loads so we can do it for

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.640 
more efficient loads so we can do it for
more<00:02:43.030> cycles<00:02:43.510> so<00:02:43.630> we<00:02:43.720> can<00:02:43.840> do<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:43.959> for<00:02:44.140> more<00:02:44.290> ski

all that sets my pelvis in the position
and<00:03:50.049> allows<00:03:50.530> me<00:03:50.769> to<00:03:50.980> isolate<00:03:51.549> what<00:03:51.820> I<00:03:51.850> really

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
keeping keeping the glutes tight I start

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.090 
keeping keeping the glutes tight I start
moving<00:03:59.590> around

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
moving around

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.430

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
hips a lot of this band tension to pull

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.060 
hips a lot of this band tension to pull
me<00:04:05.380> forward<00:04:05.950> and<00:04:06.220> help<00:04:06.459> me<00:04:06.579> open<00:04:06.820> up<00:04:07.090> this

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
sometimes I take the band put this foam

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.720 
sometimes I take the band put this foam
roller<00:04:13.420> on<00:04:13.570> top<00:04:13.780> of<00:04:13.930> it<00:04:14.049> push<00:04:14.799> down<00:04:14.829> that

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
really gets even more attention in that

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.980 
really gets even more attention in that
band<00:04:20.979> the<00:04:21.760> last<00:04:22.000> thing<00:04:22.180> you<00:04:22.300> do

my<00:05:20.020> pelvis<00:05:20.410> all<00:05:20.979> the<00:05:21.220> way<00:05:21.310> through<00:05:21.580> my<00:05:21.850> legs

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
my pelvis all the way through my legs

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.990 
my pelvis all the way through my legs
okay<00:05:22.570> so<00:05:23.470> what<00:05:23.590> happens<00:05:24.040> is<00:05:24.250> if<00:05:24.790> you're

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
okay so what happens is if you're

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.730 
okay so what happens is if you're
already<00:05:25.240> your<00:05:25.660> spines<00:05:25.990> already<00:05:26.320> bent<00:05:26.560> like

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
already your spines already bent like

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.360 
already your spines already bent like
this<00:05:26.970> okay<00:05:28.410> your<00:05:29.410> spine<00:05:29.590> is<00:05:29.740> already<00:05:29.979> slightly

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
this okay your spine is already slightly

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.460 
this okay your spine is already slightly
bent<00:05:30.610> like<00:05:30.760> this<00:05:30.789> and<00:05:31.240> then<00:05:31.810> you<00:05:31.900> take<00:05:32.140> a<00:05:32.169> load

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
bent like this and then you take a load

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.580 
bent like this and then you take a load
the<00:05:33.400> spine<00:05:33.700> bends<00:05:33.970> even<00:05:34.240> more<00:05:34.450> and<00:05:34.660> squirts

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
the spine bends even more and squirts

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.500 
the spine bends even more and squirts
out<00:05:35.680> the<00:05:35.860> front<00:05:36.100> basically<00:05:36.550> you<00:05:36.669> over<00:05:37.120> extend

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
out the front basically you over extend

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.870 
out the front basically you over extend
over<00:05:37.780> arch<00:05:37.990> and<00:05:38.289> your<00:05:38.919> body<00:05:39.100> shuts<00:05:39.460> down<00:05:39.550> right

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
over arch and your body shuts down right

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.150 
over arch and your body shuts down right
away<00:05:40.000> your<00:05:40.539> back<00:05:40.750> stiffens<00:05:41.200> up<00:05:41.320> can't<00:05:41.950> get<00:05:42.070> out

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 
away your back stiffens up can't get out

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.770 
away your back stiffens up can't get out
of<00:05:42.250> bed<00:05:42.280> the<00:05:42.520> next<00:05:42.640> morning<00:05:42.760> that's<00:05:43.539> the

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
of bed the next morning that's the

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:44.219 
of bed the next morning that's the
problem

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:44.229 
problem

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:46.140 
problem
not<00:05:44.800> from<00:05:45.070> this<00:05:45.250> stuff<00:05:45.490> necessarily<00:05:46.000> being

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
not from this stuff necessarily being

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.150 
not from this stuff necessarily being
too<00:05:46.330> tight<00:05:46.600> it<00:05:47.169> all<00:05:47.289> plays<00:05:47.500> together<00:05:47.680> but<00:05:48.070> this

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
too tight it all plays together but this

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.520 
too tight it all plays together but this
is<00:05:48.220> a<00:05:48.310> very<00:05:48.789> very<00:05:49.060> overlooked<00:05:49.570> problem<00:05:49.960> so

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
is a very very overlooked problem so

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.469 
is a very very overlooked problem so
what<00:05:50.710> happens<00:05:51.070> is<00:05:51.250> you<00:05:52.060> don't<00:05:52.240> want<00:05:52.360> your

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
what happens is you don't want your

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:55.230 
what happens is you don't want your
spine<00:05:52.860> to<00:05:53.860> be<00:05:54.010> bent<00:05:54.340> when<00:05:54.639> you<00:05:54.729> take<00:05:54.940> a<00:05:54.970> load

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
spine to be bent when you take a load

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.000 
spine to be bent when you take a load
yeah<00:05:55.750> it's<00:05:55.960> got<00:05:56.110> a<00:05:56.139> certain<00:05:56.320> amount<00:05:56.530> of<00:05:56.650> sway

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
yeah it's got a certain amount of sway

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.210 
yeah it's got a certain amount of sway
and<00:05:57.190> a<00:05:57.250> certain<00:05:57.520> about<00:05:57.669> a<00:05:57.729> flat<00:05:58.479> bend<00:05:59.080> but<00:05:59.710> you

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.969 
and a certain about a flat bend but you
want<00:06:00.460> it<00:06:00.490> to<00:06:00.610> be<00:06:00.729> neutral<00:06:01.450> okay<00:06:02.080> so<00:06:02.650> when<00:06:02.919> you

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:02.979

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.350 
take a load through this spine it

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:06.659 
take a load through this spine it
doesn't<00:06:05.710> want<00:06:05.800> to<00:06:05.889> budge<00:06:06.070> it<00:06:06.280> doesn't<00:06:06.490> want<00:06:06.610> to
