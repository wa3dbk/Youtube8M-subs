00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.860 
go you know yeah but yeah I think I'm
getting<00:04:11.040> bigger<00:04:11.310> and<00:04:11.459> I<00:04:11.550> think<00:04:11.730> my<00:04:11.850> my<00:04:12.180> top<00:04:12.570> lip

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
if this works then it will be worth it

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.180
