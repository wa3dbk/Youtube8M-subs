last<00:00:00.719> week<00:00:00.960> I<00:00:01.140> both<00:00:01.410> box<00:00:01.709> amad<00:00:01.860> 84<00:00:02.460> is<00:00:02.580> su-37

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
last week I both box amad 84 is su-37

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.869 
last week I both box amad 84 is su-37
with<00:00:03.810> the<00:00:03.929> twin<00:00:04.170> props<00:00:04.500> those<00:00:05.220> are<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.460> twin

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
with the twin props those are the twin

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.730 
with the twin props those are the twin
microjet<00:00:06.240> version<00:00:06.720> freeze<00:00:07.020> on<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.379> back<00:00:07.560> on

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
microjet version freeze on the back on

microjet version freeze on the back on
the<00:00:07.859> elevon<00:00:08.250> and<00:00:08.580> I<00:00:09.150> think<00:00:09.389> through<00:00:09.570> great

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
the elevon and I think through great

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.560 
the elevon and I think through great
it's<00:00:10.230> about<00:00:10.500> 40<00:00:10.920> ounces<00:00:11.309> now<00:00:11.639> thought<00:00:12.360> it<00:00:12.480> was

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
it's about 40 ounces now thought it was

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.620 
it's about 40 ounces now thought it was
37<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.259> close<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.679> 14<00:00:14.040> applies

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
37 is close to the 14 applies

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.300 
37 is close to the 14 applies
spectacular<00:00:15.630> very<00:00:15.900> nice<00:00:16.199> scale<00:00:16.619> performance

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
spectacular very nice scale performance

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.120 
spectacular very nice scale performance
and<00:00:17.490> then<00:00:18.359> Jay<00:00:18.660> went<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.109> made<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.619> mid

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
and then Jay went and made a mid

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.670 
and then Jay went and made a mid
mountain<00:00:20.310> also<00:00:21.029> this<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.199> same<00:00:22.410> size

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680

KF<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.170> like<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.440> set<00:00:49.890> up<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.190> really<00:00:50.340> gives

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
KF I like that set up it really gives

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.220 
KF I like that set up it really gives
you<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.969> good<00:00:51.149> combination<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.989> wind

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
you a good combination of wind

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.220 
you a good combination of wind
resistance<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.070> high<00:00:53.969> alpha<00:00:54.230> capabilities

resistance and high alpha capabilities
i'm<00:00:56.449> still<00:00:57.449> experimenting<00:00:57.719> with<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.230> center

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
i'm still experimenting with the center

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.889 
i'm still experimenting with the center
of<00:00:58.530> gravity<00:00:58.649> on<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.760> twin<00:01:00.030> prop<00:01:00.359> plane<00:01:00.690> i've

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
of gravity on the twin prop plane i've

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.560 
of gravity on the twin prop plane i've
got<00:01:01.109> at<00:01:01.260> six<00:01:01.500> inches<00:01:01.770> behind<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.370> canopy<00:01:03.359> and

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
got at six inches behind the canopy and

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.990 
got at six inches behind the canopy and
i<00:01:04.470> wanted<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.830> try<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.129> push<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.790> little

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
i wanted to try to push that a little

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.080 
i wanted to try to push that a little
bit<00:01:06.450> further<00:01:07.200> back<00:01:07.590> for<00:01:08.310> better<00:01:08.490> aerobatics

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
bit further back for better aerobatics

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.469 
bit further back for better aerobatics
oh<00:01:10.040> I've<00:01:11.040> got<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> battery<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.119> center

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
oh I've got the battery in the center

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.480 
oh I've got the battery in the center
section<00:01:12.659> here<00:01:13.170> instead<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.830> nose<00:01:14.040> instead

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
section here instead of the nose instead

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.910 
section here instead of the nose instead
of<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.790> can<00:01:15.060> under<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.540> canopy<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.170> I'm

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
of the can under the canopy and I'm

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.800 
of the can under the canopy and I'm
using<00:01:17.189> weights<00:01:17.640> taped<00:01:18.420> on<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:19.159> order<00:01:20.159> to

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
using weights taped on in order to

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.060 
using weights taped on in order to
fine-tune<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.049> center<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.380> gravity<00:01:22.470> once<00:01:22.920> I

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
fine-tune the center of gravity once I

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.130 
fine-tune the center of gravity once I
get<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.460> then<00:01:24.119> I'll<00:01:24.299> be<00:01:24.479> able<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.750> shift<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
get it then I'll be able to shift the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.200 
get it then I'll be able to shift the
battery<00:01:25.500> into<00:01:25.650> position<00:01:25.770> better<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:27.030> let's

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
battery into position better so let's

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:44.500 
battery into position better so let's
see<00:01:27.299> how<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.450> does

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.910 

this<00:01:45.510> plane<00:01:45.810> has<00:01:45.840> such<00:01:46.260> low<00:01:46.650> wing<00:01:46.920> loading<00:01:46.950> a

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
this plane has such low wing loading a

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.760 
this plane has such low wing loading a
lot<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.010> the<00:01:50.130> canard<00:01:50.490> planes<00:01:50.820> do<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.420> they

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
lot of the canard planes do that they

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.380 
lot of the canard planes do that they
can<00:01:52.770> go<00:01:52.979> way<00:01:53.310> forward<00:01:53.790> with<00:01:53.940> the<00:01:54.060> center<00:01:54.360> of

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
can go way forward with the center of

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.530 
can go way forward with the center of
gravity<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:55.550> I<00:01:56.550> think<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:57.030> adds<00:01:57.240> stability

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
gravity and I think that adds stability

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.749 
gravity and I think that adds stability
to<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.290> plane<00:01:59.810> but<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:00.930> feels<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.320> light<00:02:01.759> this

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
to the plane but it feels so light this

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.760 
to the plane but it feels so light this
thing<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:04.910> 34<00:02:05.910> 35<00:02:06.450> ounces<00:02:06.690> and<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.560> thing

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
thing is 34 35 ounces and the thing

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:15.949 
thing is 34 35 ounces and the thing
flies<00:02:08.009> like<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.810> v1<00:02:09.810> plane<00:02:10.080> at<00:02:10.289> 22<00:02:10.770> ounces<00:02:14.959> all

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
flies like a v1 plane at 22 ounces all

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.750 
flies like a v1 plane at 22 ounces all
right<00:02:16.110> let's<00:02:16.709> see<00:02:16.890> what<00:02:16.920> it<00:02:17.100> will<00:02:17.190> do<00:02:17.370> speed

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
right let's see what it will do speed

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.809 
right let's see what it will do speed
wise

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:34.470 

love<00:02:23.480> pretty<00:02:24.469> good<00:02:24.739> for<00:02:25.040> such<00:02:25.219> a<00:02:25.249> big<00:02:25.519> play

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.440 

so<00:02:35.480> smooth<00:02:35.840> look<00:02:36.050> at<00:02:36.170> this<00:02:36.290> how<00:02:36.620> smoothies

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
so smooth look at this how smoothies

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:49.320 
so smooth look at this how smoothies
su-37<00:02:38.450> czar

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.030 

yeah<00:02:49.960> I<00:02:50.230> can't<00:02:50.590> fly<00:02:50.800> inverted<00:02:51.400> on<00:02:51.550> a<00:02:51.580> kf2<00:02:52.090> but

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
yeah I can't fly inverted on a kf2 but
