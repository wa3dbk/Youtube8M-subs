00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:14.379
 at the moment only one two three steps 

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:16.860
 comes to the front and the tension is 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:16.860
 huge 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.830
 a player one has seen the 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.020
 the public gallery here is the factor 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.210
 is of course gigantic and they have one 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.760
 especially for hofer here for the first time 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.940
 built this lie around there too 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:47.379
 school classes and his first 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:49.900
 sports teacher a country of course here too 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.600
 with appropriate tempo do everything 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.220
 is styled everything is planned that 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.110
 weather is okay too 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.900
 Temperatures rise only very completely 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.170
 slowly on the thames what is important 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:05.140
 and gips and what do they have of it 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:08.350
 Spoken how are you going to run 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.500
 he speaks of his tactics in 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.520
 behave in the run and he will 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.750
 not expressed 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.460
 Let's see this is the man in Boston 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.229
 it did not go too fast 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.890
 be recognized and that is the 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:27.870
 previous year winner formed 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:31.380
 How to get his name, maybe 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:34.520
 as outsiders they are all still 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.520
 in a good mood 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.970
 He finally wants a quick time 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:47.390
 or nothing 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:52.630
 and then the other one comes up 203 5 2 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.630
 already experienced in london and then 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:02.850
 here pays paid 500,000 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.100
 entrance fee best mood 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.399
 that's what we keep in mind 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.470
 I'm a little bit promised 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.709
 I'm a bit skeptical 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.709
 Honestly 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:29.840
 on a stop did not give 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:33.840
 Glinker in language as good as know 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:39.270
 we will be that and then the big one 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.260
 number of Brazilians also in the years 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.270
 come 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.940
 ten certainly not to the 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.030
 Favorites have been presented this and 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.390
 everyone else is tried in the train of this 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.209
 Men a reasonably reasonable time too 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:03:00.709
 Run the runway was always huge 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.709
 but set as in this year 2014 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.640
 and the best riders did days 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.050
 city ​​hall 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.050
 some time measurement 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:29.310
 Men consists of 23 runners and space 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:39.959
 complain and a case mate of course completely 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:41.069
 especially out 40 years old and no 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:46.260
 a little tired 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:48.569
 and please do not even then here 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.810
 they can be very, very safe and 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.840
 will drive the chance he will use 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:04:00.299
 accordingly, putting yourself in the scene and 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:02.840
 will try his mate now 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.840
 right 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:18.610
 importance of the task as a pillar 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:20.650
 falls through on 61 45 home and he 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.440
 would like to go up to miles if it goes 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:29.800
 30 run and there are the runners 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:33.850
 then at 1 27 40 2002 comes through here 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:37.660
 London is also here with more 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:41.410
 considered as it is today and that is not so 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.910
 properly at times was paving the 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:47.370
 to take on opposite 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.370
 Since he has run two world records 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.220
 so again 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:03.980
 I am already at the press 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.060
 launched together for it's every 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:12.160
 London now the fourth participation 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:15.770
 now explains in a new role and 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.720
 as he imagined the whole thing 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.650
 of course has the really big one 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.650
 experience 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.910
 have to attack the world record 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.870
 you halve your time 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:41.690
 at every kilometer 35 kilometers 10 km 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.910
 then you have to start counting 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.400
 the calculation is not about it 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.860
 fast or slow to run but 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:52.020
 to keep your pace constant 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.879
 that is entirely my responsibility 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.949
 Of course it is very important 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:57.629
 first five kilometers you have to in 14 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:06:02.849
 30 minutes 

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:06.750
 at 10 km you have at 29 15 km 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:08.430
 that would be 43 30 so you count 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.340
 every five kilometers 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:14.250
 each should be 14 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.730
 then were his good time, it is 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.740
 insane 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:19.350
 this year is going faster and faster 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:24.500
 faster i want that even new one 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:24.500
 ships as a pacemaker on the way
