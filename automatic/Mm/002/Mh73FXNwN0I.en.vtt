00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.670
 have breakfast like a king have lunch like a 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.410
 prince and dinner as a beggar always 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.720
 we have heard that breakfast is the 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.420
 most important meal of the day and that 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.980
 no reason we should omit it too 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.170
 we have seen that most of 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.839
 diet programs and numerous dietitians 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.539
 advise to eat between 5 and 8 meals 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:26.699
 small a day to lose weight without 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.890
 no doubt these claims have their 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.630
 foundation but as the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.940
 years discover new ways of 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.220
 carry out a diet and lose fat 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.840
 in this case we are going to talk about fasting 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.059
 intermittent from the point of view 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.980
 fitness before we start we must 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.219
 understand that the intermittent is not a 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.390
 but diet is a way of eating 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.489
 basically it's a way to program 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.219
 your meals to get the most 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.050
 advantage of them in other words not 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.839
 it's about changing what you eat but 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.309
 rather when you eat it generally the 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.949
 intermittent alien is based on avoiding 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.179
 eat for 16 to 32 hours with the 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.460
 intention to teach the body to 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:04.320
 use stored fat as a source 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.240
 of energy there are several reasons why 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.130
 which is thought that intermittent fasting 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.810
 works when the fat loss 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.460
 first is because the long 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.590
 of fasting will help you maintain a 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.720
 caloric deficit as we all know 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.520
 we need to consume fewer calories from 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.530
 what we need to be able to lose 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.149
 fat also because when our 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.009
 body is without eating for a long 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.229
 time period sugar levels 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.789
 in blood they remain low as 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.590
 we know sugar is the source of 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:30.990
 Preferred energy of our organism 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.030
 when your body detects that lack of 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.399
 energy will try to do everything possible 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.679
 to keep it and will not have another 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.450
 remedy that look for energy elsewhere 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.700
 to stay in good condition 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.259
 then what it does is use the 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.350
 stored fat as a source of energy 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.479
 but the question is we will lose muscle 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.310
 when doing an intermittent year 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.929
 we have all heard that we must 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.209
 eat every three hours to avoid losing 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.439
 muscle mass and for that reason fasting 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:57.270
 intermittent presses as if 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.789
 we were sacrificing our mass 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.649
 muscle to lose fat but nothing very 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.060
 far from reality, the truth is that the 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.520
 intermittent fasting will not make you lose 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.740
 muscle and can be very positive for the 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.660
 health if the 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.370
 reason for this is because as long as they exist 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.200
 free amino acids in your blood 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.750
 body will not worry about using the 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.920
 muscle tissue as a source of energy and 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.900
 the trick of all this 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.480
 is in consuming protein foods from 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.060
 slow absorption like meat casein 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.099
 chicken or eggs as these will keep 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.260
 a constant flow of amino acids in 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.060
 blood for several hours also what 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.500
 Ideal is combining proteins with others 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.590
 nutrients such as fibers and fats 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.569
 to slow down more the absorption of this 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.819
 way your body will calmly take 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.040
 for 16 to 24 hours to absorb everything 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.440
 to that we owe to add the glycogen 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.209
 liver which our body goes to 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.550
 before using muscle mass as 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.959
 source energy so in a few words 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.450
 fasting does not cause us losses 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.880
 muscle or at least not before 48 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.739
 hours another reason why not 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.330
 you will lose muscle mass is because you have 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.130
 demonstrated that intermittent fasting 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.260
 naturally increases the production of 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.700
 human growth hormones this 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.400
 hormone is not only effective for 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.410
 maintain muscle mass but it favors 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.450
 the burning of fat so we must see 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.580
 intermittent fasting as a way of 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.950
 maximize the results in a diet 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.569
 that's why it can be combined with others 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.239
 types of diet like the diet of 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.100
 definition diets ketogenic diets 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.740
 high in carbohydrates and the 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.660
 diet among many others if you ask 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.090
 when you will start to see results with 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.220
 This method is important for you to know that 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.110
 this will depend on each person due to 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.060
 different factors such as habits 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.310
 food resistance insulin 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.620
 body composition the style of 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.540
 daily life the type of program 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.520
 exercises and of course the protocol 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.990
 that you choose although the most important thing 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.790
 you have to keep in mind is that the 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.680
 intermittent fasting will not work for you 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.510
 lose fat if you're not in a deficit 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.250
 caloric when talking about fasting 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.130
 intermittent we are not talking about 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.720
 fast for 40 days and 40 nights 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.820
 it is simply a tool with the 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.990
 that we should not be obsessed because 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.660
 otherwise it could be 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.880
 counterproductive there are fasting protocols 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.460
 intermittent for all tastes by 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.560
 example there is one in which he suggests you 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:11.340
 eat for 8 hours and fast during 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.010
 16 others where 20 are fasted and eat 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.990
 for 4 and another combination in which 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.630
 they fast 24 hours and eat in the 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.400
 following 24 as a conclusion I do not know 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.560
 can deny that intermittent fasting 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.090
 it seems a promising solution for 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.190
 lose fat and even to avoid 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.820
 health problems although you have to 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.230
 remember 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.930
 each body is different and 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.400
 results vary in each person 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.800
 our advice is that you have nothing 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.110
 to lose that try a greeting very 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.620
 strong to everyone and as long as you follow 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.620
 The madness
