how to make driftwood how to actually
make<00:00:10.050> you<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.290> piece<00:00:10.620> of<00:00:10.800> driftwood<00:00:11.210> and<00:00:12.210> I

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
make you a piece of driftwood and I

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.029 
make you a piece of driftwood and I
couldn't<00:00:13.110> find<00:00:13.410> it<00:00:13.559> anywhere<00:00:14.509> so<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:16.039> decided

couldn't find it anywhere so I decided

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.390 
couldn't find it anywhere so I decided
to<00:00:17.220> take<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.820> initiative<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.570> make<00:00:19.369> me<00:00:20.369> a

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
to take the initiative and make me a

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.840 
to take the initiative and make me a
piece<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:21.029> driftwood<00:00:21.800> so<00:00:22.800> we'll<00:00:23.550> show<00:00:23.789> you

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
piece of driftwood so we'll show you

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.170 
piece of driftwood so we'll show you
what<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.150> did<00:00:24.300> here<00:00:25.130> all<00:00:26.130> right<00:00:26.340> I'm<00:00:26.970> boiling

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
what it did here all right I'm boiling

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.269 
what it did here all right I'm boiling
it<00:00:27.510> right<00:00:27.689> now<00:00:28.340> big<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.640> big<00:00:30.420> pot<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.349> branch<00:00:32.040> is

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
it right now big a big pot the branch is

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.870 
it right now big a big pot the branch is
like<00:00:32.489> 15<00:00:33.090> inches<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:33.780> that's<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.380> big<00:00:34.559> part<00:00:34.880> so

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
like 15 inches so that's a big part so

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:44.569 
like 15 inches so that's a big part so
it<00:00:36.480> takes<00:00:36.719> them<00:00:43.160> traditional<00:00:44.160> piece<00:00:44.399> of

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
it takes them traditional piece of

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.440 
it takes them traditional piece of
driftwood<00:00:45.329> like<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.469> see<00:00:46.649> everywhere<00:00:47.070> else

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
driftwood like you see everywhere else

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.560 
driftwood like you see everywhere else
so<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.840> went<00:00:49.739> ahead<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.039> made<00:00:50.250> my<00:00:50.670> own<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:51.090> wanted

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
so I went ahead and made my own I wanted

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.910 
so I went ahead and made my own I wanted
it<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.809> be<00:00:51.960> like<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.379> tree

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
it to be like a tree

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.950 
it to be like a tree
there's<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.180> fishtank<00:00:54.930> 100-gallon<00:00:55.820> but

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
find you a piece of driftwood it's not

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.429 
find you a piece of driftwood it's not
really<00:01:04.739> drift<00:01:04.979> with<00:01:05.189> but<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:06.030> works<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:07.170> then

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
you find you a smaller piece of

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.050 
you find you a smaller piece of
driftwood<00:01:10.310> and<00:01:11.310> get<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> bunch<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.000> these

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
driftwood and get you a bunch of these

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.820 
driftwood and get you a bunch of these

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
let me turn some light on here so you

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.320 
let me turn some light on here so you
can<00:01:33.570> see<00:01:36.500> all<00:01:37.500> right

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330

took<00:01:39.330> a<00:01:39.360> wooden<00:01:39.720> bit<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.510> got<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.110> be<00:01:43.260> a

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
took a wooden bit and I got to be a

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.310 
took a wooden bit and I got to be a
would<00:01:43.860> fit<00:01:44.360> that<00:01:45.360> looked<00:01:45.570> like<00:01:45.690> it<00:01:45.810> was<00:01:46.020> almost

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
would fit that looked like it was almost

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.220 
would fit that looked like it was almost
fit<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:48.770> I<00:01:49.770> would<00:01:50.280> drill<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.670> hole<00:01:51.110> in<00:01:52.110> the

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
fit that and I would drill a hole in the

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.570 
fit that and I would drill a hole in the
sides<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.830> the<00:01:52.890> big<00:01:53.040> piece<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.340> wood<00:01:54.290> and<00:01:55.290> then

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
sides of the big piece of wood and then

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.280 
sides of the big piece of wood and then
I'll<00:01:56.580> take<00:01:56.880> my<00:01:56.910> knife<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.510> Whittle<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:57.960> in

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
I'll take my knife and Whittle that in

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.210 
I'll take my knife and Whittle that in
down<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:59.520> stick<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.540> in<00:02:00.660> the<00:02:00.720> hole<00:02:00.750> and

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
down and stick it in the hole and

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.290 
down and stick it in the hole and
there's<00:02:02.220> your<00:02:02.400> branch<00:02:02.900> and<00:02:03.900> I<00:02:04.860> plan<00:02:05.220> on

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
there's your branch and I plan on

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.670 
there's your branch and I plan on
attaching<00:02:06.300> Moss<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.840> my<00:02:06.990> branch<00:02:07.260> and<00:02:07.470> I<00:02:07.500> want

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
attaching Moss to my branch and I want

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.970 
attaching Moss to my branch and I want
it<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.860> look<00:02:08.040> sort<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.060> like<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.210> real<00:02:09.510> treat<00:02:09.980> so

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:10.980 
it to look sort of like a real treat so

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.650 
it to look sort of like a real treat so
I<00:02:11.250> took<00:02:11.370> this<00:02:11.820> a<00:02:12.240> very<00:02:13.080> very<00:02:13.410> small<00:02:13.770> drill<00:02:14.070> bit

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
I took this a very very small drill bit

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.000 
I took this a very very small drill bit
and<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:16.320> drill<00:02:17.280> holes<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.450> side<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:18.900> this<00:02:19.080> in

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
and I drill holes to the side of this in

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.870 
and I drill holes to the side of this in
the<00:02:20.160> natural<00:02:20.580> direction<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.600> branches<00:02:22.050> go

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
the natural direction that branches go

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.040 
the natural direction that branches go
so<00:02:24.560> what<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.590> did<00:02:25.830> after<00:02:26.160> that<00:02:26.190> I<00:02:27.050> took

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
so what I did after that I took

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.640 
so what I did after that I took
toothpicks<00:02:28.710> and<00:02:29.630> I<00:02:30.630> basically<00:02:31.080> broke<00:02:31.470> the

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
toothpicks and I basically broke the

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.320 
toothpicks and I basically broke the
toothpicks<00:02:32.130> in<00:02:32.310> half<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:32.820> shoved<00:02:33.060> them<00:02:33.209> in

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
toothpicks in half and shoved them in

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.090 
toothpicks in half and shoved them in
there<00:02:33.860> and<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:34.940> is<00:02:35.940> what<00:02:36.180> you<00:02:36.330> get<00:02:37.100> something

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
there and that is what you get something

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.650 
there and that is what you get something
with<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.340> lot<00:02:38.520> of<00:02:38.580> surface<00:02:38.970> area<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.330> hold<00:02:39.420> your
