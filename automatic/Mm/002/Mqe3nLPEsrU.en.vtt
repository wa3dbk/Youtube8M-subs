00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
done this right you hit kick it should

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.970

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
only show up in snare however I think

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.990 
only show up in snare however I think
bleed<00:03:07.440> is<00:03:07.650> on<00:03:07.830> that<00:03:08.070> might<00:03:08.220> be<00:03:08.370> why<00:03:08.520> this<00:03:08.580> is

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
bleed is on that might be why this is

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.800 
bleed is on that might be why this is
happening<00:03:11.450> know<00:03:12.450> what's<00:03:12.600> good<00:03:14.750> I'm<00:03:15.750> not

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
happening know what's good I'm not

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.170 
happening know what's good I'm not
really<00:03:16.110> sure<00:03:16.440> why<00:03:16.710> that<00:03:17.070> is<00:03:17.310> doing<00:03:17.700> oh<00:03:17.880> I<00:03:17.910> know

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
really sure why that is doing oh I know

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.930 
really sure why that is doing oh I know
why<00:03:18.450> because<00:03:18.990> everything<00:03:19.440> kick<00:03:20.430> is<00:03:20.580> actually

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
why because everything kick is actually

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.430 
why because everything kick is actually
track<00:03:21.209> 1<00:03:21.420> &amp;<00:03:21.570> 2<00:03:21.770> so<00:03:23.090> if<00:03:24.090> you<00:03:24.300> so<00:03:24.870> right<00:03:25.230> now<00:03:25.380> we

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
track 1 &amp; 2 so if you so right now we

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.180 
track 1 &amp; 2 so if you so right now we
have<00:03:25.740> everything<00:03:26.000> bleeding<00:03:27.000> into<00:03:27.180> 1<00:03:27.330> &amp;<00:03:27.480> 2<00:03:27.630> so

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
have everything bleeding into 1 &amp; 2 so

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.620 
have everything bleeding into 1 &amp; 2 so
