00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.280 
strong abv so that's why i'd probably
put<00:02:33.730> a<00:02:33.760> little<00:02:34.000> larger<00:02:34.390> head<00:02:34.570> if<00:02:34.960> it<00:02:35.140> had<00:02:35.260> been

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
put a little larger head if it had been

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.310 
put a little larger head if it had been
a<00:02:35.550> 67<00:02:36.550> maybe<00:02:36.850> even<00:02:36.940> eight<00:02:37.240> percent<00:02:37.660> you

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
a 67 maybe even eight percent you

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.750 
a 67 maybe even eight percent you
wouldn't<00:02:38.620> get<00:02:38.710> that<00:02:38.740> kind<00:02:39.040> of<00:02:39.130> head<00:02:39.310> out<00:02:39.490> of<00:02:39.520> it

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
wouldn't get that kind of head out of it

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.210 
wouldn't get that kind of head out of it
