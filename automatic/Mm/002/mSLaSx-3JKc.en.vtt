00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
taking a look at that episode so we're

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.380 
taking a look at that episode so we're
gonna<00:00:32.160> highlight<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.579> couple<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:32.940> cards<00:00:33.239> that

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
gonna highlight a couple of cards that

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.729 
gonna highlight a couple of cards that
we<00:00:33.480> think<00:00:33.660> are<00:00:33.750> confusing<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.320> newer<00:00:34.440> players

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
we think are confusing to newer players

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.319 
we think are confusing to newer players
and<00:00:34.920> all<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.070> players<00:00:35.280> alike<00:00:35.550> such<00:00:36.059> as<00:00:36.180> our

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
and all the players alike such as our

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.600 
and all the players alike such as our
first<00:00:36.450> example<00:00:36.690> blood<00:00:37.410> Scrivener<00:00:37.829> Blood

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
first example blood Scrivener Blood

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.090 
first example blood Scrivener Blood
Scrivener<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.210> tu-142<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.469> says<00:00:40.649> if<00:00:40.860> you

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
Scrivener is a tu-142 that says if you

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
Scrivener is a tu-142 that says if you
would<00:00:41.219> draw<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> card<00:00:41.700> while<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:41.940> have<00:00:42.030> no

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
would draw a card while you have no

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.030 
would draw a card while you have no
cards<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.450> hand<00:00:42.660> instead<00:00:43.260> twelve<00:00:43.620> two<00:00:43.739> cards

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
cards in hand instead twelve two cards

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.619 
cards in hand instead twelve two cards
and<00:00:44.100> lose<00:00:44.280> one<00:00:44.430> life<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.360> first<00:00:45.539> question

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
and lose one life so the first question

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.150 
and lose one life so the first question
that<00:00:45.840> comes<00:00:45.989> up<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.350> what<00:00:46.710> if<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.860> have<00:00:46.890> more

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
that comes up is what if I have more

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.770 
that comes up is what if I have more
than<00:00:47.219> one<00:00:47.340> play<00:00:47.579> say<00:00:47.969> two<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.390> them<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.629> play

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
than one play say two of them in play

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.619 
than one play say two of them in play
with<00:00:49.440> no<00:00:49.590> cards<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:49.920> hand<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:51.030> end<00:00:51.180> result<00:00:51.539> is

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
with no cards in hand the end result is

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.209 
with no cards in hand the end result is
going<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.840> be<00:00:51.899> you'll<00:00:52.260> draw<00:00:52.410> three<00:00:52.710> cards<00:00:52.739> and

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
going to be you'll draw three cards and

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.189 
going to be you'll draw three cards and
lose<00:00:53.399> two<00:00:53.550> life<00:00:53.730> if<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.420> have<00:00:54.570> three<00:00:54.870> employee

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
lose two life if you have three employee

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.540 
lose two life if you have three employee
you'll<00:00:55.410> draw<00:00:55.559> four<00:00:55.800> cards<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.250> lose<00:00:56.340> three

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
you'll draw four cards and lose three

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.369 
you'll draw four cards and lose three
life<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.449> reasoning<00:00:57.840> for<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.260> because

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
life the reasoning for this is because

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.170 
life the reasoning for this is because
we<00:00:58.649> have<00:00:58.800> replacement<00:00:59.309> effects<00:00:59.550> applying<00:00:59.969> to

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
we have replacement effects applying to

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.819 
we have replacement effects applying to
other<00:01:00.329> replacement<00:01:00.930> effects<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.590> can<00:01:01.739> go

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
other replacement effects and I can go

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.680 
other replacement effects and I can go
into<00:01:01.980> detail<00:01:02.370> about<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:02.730> but<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.570> would

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
into detail about this but that would

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.329 
into detail about this but that would
probably<00:01:03.870> take<00:01:04.260> an<00:01:04.409> entire<00:01:04.650> episode<00:01:04.830> all<00:01:05.189> on

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
probably take an entire episode all on

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.770 
probably take an entire episode all on
its<00:01:05.489> own<00:01:05.670> discussing<00:01:06.060> replacement<00:01:06.659> and

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
its own discussing replacement and

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.670 
its own discussing replacement and
prevention<00:01:07.140> effects<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.590> their

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
prevention effects and their

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.929 
prevention effects and their
interactions<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:08.490> we're<00:01:08.610> going<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.790> save<00:01:08.909> that

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
interactions so we're going to save that

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.179 
interactions so we're going to save that
for<00:01:09.090> another<00:01:09.210> episode<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:09.930> our<00:01:10.860> next<00:01:11.100> example

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
for another episode in our next example

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.550 
for another episode in our next example
we<00:01:11.820> have<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> Scrivener<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:12.810> play<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.260> we<00:01:13.409> play

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
we have a Scrivener in play and we play

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.109 
we have a Scrivener in play and we play
a<00:01:13.590> sign<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.920> blood<00:01:14.100> with<00:01:14.310> no<00:01:14.520> cards<00:01:14.760> at<00:01:14.939> hand

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
a sign of blood with no cards at hand

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.270 
a sign of blood with no cards at hand
when<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.229> Sun<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.530> blood<00:01:16.650> goes<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.950> resolve

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
when the Sun and blood goes to resolve

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.320 
when the Sun and blood goes to resolve
we're<00:01:17.490> going<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.670> end<00:01:17.790> up<00:01:17.820> drawing<00:01:18.030> three

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
we're going to end up drawing three

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.300 
we're going to end up drawing three
cards<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.750> losing<00:01:18.990> three<00:01:19.140> life<00:01:19.320> two<00:01:20.009> from<00:01:20.220> the

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
cards and losing three life two from the

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.090 
cards and losing three life two from the
sign<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.580> blood<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.970> one<00:01:21.210> from<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.479> Scrivener

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
sign of blood and one from the Scrivener

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.109

we<00:01:38.520> resolve<00:01:38.880> everything<00:01:39.180> on<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.450> Sphinx's

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
we resolve everything on the Sphinx's

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.060 
we resolve everything on the Sphinx's

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
written so we gain the life first

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.499 
written so we gain the life first
gaining<00:01:44.009> for<00:01:44.310> life<00:01:44.490> putting<00:01:44.850> us<00:01:44.939> at<00:01:45.060> five<00:01:45.270> and

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
gaining for life putting us at five and

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.240 
gaining for life putting us at five and
then<00:01:46.049> we<00:01:46.140> draw<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.320> cards<00:01:46.680> replacing<00:01:47.159> the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
then we draw the cards replacing the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.120 
then we draw the cards replacing the
first<00:01:47.490> draw<00:01:47.700> with<00:01:48.000> draw<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.840> lose<00:01:49.140> one<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
first draw with draw to lose one so the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.740 
first draw with draw to lose one so the
end<00:01:50.220> result<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.640> we<00:01:50.909> have<00:01:51.030> five<00:01:51.240> cards<00:01:51.479> in<00:01:51.600> hand

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
end result is we have five cards in hand

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.560 
end result is we have five cards in hand
and<00:01:51.960> we're<00:01:52.079> sitting<00:01:52.229> at<00:01:52.409> four<00:01:52.590> life<00:01:53.240> our<00:01:54.240> next

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
and we're sitting at four life our next

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.870 
and we're sitting at four life our next
card<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:54.930> feral<00:01:55.320> animist<00:01:55.649> which<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.280> 2-1<00:01:56.700> for

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
card is feral animist which is a 2-1 for

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.149 
card is feral animist which is a 2-1 for
three<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.509> reads<00:01:57.750> pay<00:01:58.380> three<00:01:58.649> generic<00:01:58.979> mana

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
three that reads pay three generic mana

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.069 
three that reads pay three generic mana
and<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.729> gets<00:01:59.939> plus<00:02:00.180> X<00:02:00.420> plus<00:02:00.570> O<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.899> tell<00:02:00.990> them

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
and it gets plus X plus O and tell them

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.499 
and it gets plus X plus O and tell them
to<00:02:01.200> turn<00:02:01.350> where<00:02:01.770> X<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.310> its<00:02:02.490> power<00:02:02.670> so

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
to turn where X is its power so

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.300 
to turn where X is its power so
basically<00:02:04.020> if<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.350> pay<00:02:04.500> three<00:02:04.770> men<00:02:04.920> into<00:02:05.219> it

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
basically if you pay three men into it

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.760 
basically if you pay three men into it
it<00:02:05.490> becomes<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.909> 4-1<00:02:06.240> if<00:02:06.689> instead<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.290> pay<00:02:07.409> six

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
it becomes a 4-1 if instead you pay six

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.919 
it becomes a 4-1 if instead you pay six
it<00:02:08.009> becomes<00:02:08.310> an<00:02:08.640> eight<00:02:08.759> one<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.539> on<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.840> so

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
it becomes an eight one and so on and so

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.380 
it becomes an eight one and so on and so
forth<00:02:10.170> but<00:02:10.319> what<00:02:11.160> happens<00:02:11.459> if<00:02:11.640> its<00:02:11.879> power<00:02:12.060> is

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
forth but what happens if its power is

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.860 
forth but what happens if its power is
negative<00:02:12.750> such<00:02:13.170> as<00:02:13.349> through

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
negative such as through

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.140 
negative such as through
or<00:02:13.930> phobia<00:02:14.319> and<00:02:14.470> what<00:02:15.190> if<00:02:15.280> it's<00:02:15.370> a<00:02:15.459> minus<00:02:15.730> 3/1

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
or phobia and what if it's a minus 3/1

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.240 
or phobia and what if it's a minus 3/1
well<00:02:17.019> if<00:02:17.230> you<00:02:17.319> activate<00:02:17.620> its<00:02:17.830> effect<00:02:17.890> it's

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
well if you activate its effect it's

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.890 
well if you activate its effect it's
actually<00:02:18.489> going<00:02:18.580> to<00:02:18.670> become<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:19.090> minus<00:02:19.330> six<00:02:19.690> one

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
actually going to become a minus six one

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.780 
actually going to become a minus six one
and<00:02:20.140> if<00:02:20.709> you<00:02:20.799> activate<00:02:21.069> it<00:02:21.220> again<00:02:21.340> it'll

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
and if you activate it again it'll

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.000 
and if you activate it again it'll
become<00:02:21.879> a<00:02:22.030> minus<00:02:22.299> 12<00:02:22.599> one<00:02:22.780> so<00:02:23.470> our<00:02:23.560> next<00:02:23.709> card

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
become a minus 12 one so our next card

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.619 
become a minus 12 one so our next card
is<00:02:24.129> Master<00:02:24.489> cruelties<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:25.150> man<00:02:25.360> has<00:02:25.510> this

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
is Master cruelties and man has this

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.630 
is Master cruelties and man has this

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.580 
the effect triggers when it isn't
blocked<00:02:57.280> not<00:02:57.700> when<00:02:57.970> it<00:02:58.090> attacks<00:02:58.390> so<00:02:59.290> a<00:02:59.349> really

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
blocked not when it attacks so a really

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.170 
blocked not when it attacks so a really
cool<00:02:59.739> example<00:03:00.129> with<00:03:00.549> this<00:03:00.730> card<00:03:01.000> would<00:03:01.120> be

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
cool example with this card would be

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.149 
cool example with this card would be
what<00:03:01.690> happens<00:03:01.959> if<00:03:02.049> I<00:03:02.109> attack<00:03:02.379> with<00:03:02.409> it<00:03:02.680> it

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 
what happens if I attack with it it

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:04.740 
what happens if I attack with it it
doesn't<00:03:03.370> get<00:03:03.549> blocked<00:03:03.790> its<00:03:04.120> effect<00:03:04.420> triggers

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
doesn't get blocked its effect triggers

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.449 
doesn't get blocked its effect triggers
and<00:03:05.049> puts<00:03:05.200> my<00:03:05.319> opponent<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:05.680> one<00:03:05.829> and<00:03:06.069> my

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
and puts my opponent to one and my

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:07.589 
and puts my opponent to one and my
opponent<00:03:06.819> thinks<00:03:06.879> it's<00:03:07.120> not<00:03:07.269> going<00:03:07.420> to<00:03:07.480> deal

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
opponent thinks it's not going to deal

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.990 
opponent thinks it's not going to deal
damage<00:03:07.780> to<00:03:08.079> it<00:03:08.170> but<00:03:08.680> then<00:03:08.829> I<00:03:08.859> ninjitsu<00:03:09.340> it<00:03:09.609> with

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
damage to it but then I ninjitsu it with

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.390 
damage to it but then I ninjitsu it with
an<00:03:10.150> ink<00:03:10.299> guys<00:03:10.420> when<00:03:11.409> this<00:03:11.530> happens<00:03:11.890> it<00:03:12.040> guys<00:03:12.250> is

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
an ink guys when this happens it guys is

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.880 
an ink guys when this happens it guys is
going<00:03:12.489> to<00:03:12.579> come<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:12.819> play<00:03:13.000> attacking<00:03:13.510> and<00:03:13.890> then

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
going to come to play attacking and then

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.500 
going to come to play attacking and then
deal<00:03:15.040> damage<00:03:15.220> to<00:03:15.370> my<00:03:15.609> opponent<00:03:16.000> killing<00:03:16.390> them

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
deal damage to my opponent killing them

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.270 
deal damage to my opponent killing them
within<00:03:16.659> guys<00:03:16.870> unless<00:03:17.680> of<00:03:17.919> course<00:03:17.950> they<00:03:18.190> have

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
within guys unless of course they have

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.240 
within guys unless of course they have
some<00:03:18.310> way<00:03:18.519> to<00:03:18.579> handle<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:19.030> guys<00:03:19.889> so<00:03:20.889> our<00:03:20.980> final

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
some way to handle the guys so our final

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.949 
some way to handle the guys so our final
example<00:03:21.489> is<00:03:21.730> progenitor<00:03:22.120> mimic<00:03:22.569> which<00:03:22.810> is

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
example is progenitor mimic which is

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.780 
example is progenitor mimic which is
basically<00:03:23.319> a<00:03:23.440> clone<00:03:23.769> that<00:03:24.099> lets<00:03:24.370> us<00:03:24.519> make

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
basically a clone that lets us make

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.789 
basically a clone that lets us make
copies<00:03:25.239> of<00:03:25.269> the<00:03:25.510> clone<00:03:25.750> at<00:03:26.019> the<00:03:26.470> beginning<00:03:26.680> of

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
copies of the clone at the beginning of

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:27.690 
copies of the clone at the beginning of
each<00:03:26.950> of<00:03:27.069> our<00:03:27.160> upkeep's

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
each of our upkeep's

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.330 
each of our upkeep's
so<00:03:28.329> progenitor<00:03:28.780> mimic<00:03:29.230> reads<00:03:29.470> you<00:03:29.919> may<00:03:30.099> have

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
so progenitor mimic reads you may have

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.949 
so progenitor mimic reads you may have
progenitor<00:03:30.700> mimic<00:03:31.180> enter<00:03:31.599> the<00:03:31.720> battlefield

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
progenitor mimic enter the battlefield

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.599 
progenitor mimic enter the battlefield
is<00:03:32.230> a<00:03:32.260> copy<00:03:32.560> of<00:03:32.680> any<00:03:32.889> creature<00:03:33.280> on<00:03:33.519> the

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
is a copy of any creature on the

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.580 
is a copy of any creature on the
battlefield<00:03:33.970> except<00:03:34.510> it<00:03:34.660> gains<00:03:34.900> at<00:03:35.470> the

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
battlefield except it gains at the

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.170 
battlefield except it gains at the
beginning<00:03:35.829> of<00:03:35.980> your<00:03:36.069> upkeep<00:03:36.129> if<00:03:36.669> this

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
beginning of your upkeep if this

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.940 
beginning of your upkeep if this
creature<00:03:37.389> isn't<00:03:37.930> a<00:03:37.959> token<00:03:38.349> but<00:03:38.739> it's<00:03:38.859> open

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
creature isn't a token but it's open

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.349 
creature isn't a token but it's open
onto<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.370> battlefield<00:03:39.700> that's<00:03:39.849> a<00:03:40.000> copy<00:03:40.180> of

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
onto the battlefield that's a copy of

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:41.940 
onto the battlefield that's a copy of
this<00:03:40.450> creature<00:03:40.720> that<00:03:40.959> become<00:03:41.739> a<00:03:41.769> little

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
this creature that become a little

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.890 
this creature that become a little
confusing<00:03:42.340> like<00:03:42.699> what<00:03:43.419> happens<00:03:43.660> about<00:03:43.810> the

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
confusing like what happens about the

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.930 
confusing like what happens about the
tokens<00:03:44.230> themselves<00:03:44.980> do<00:03:45.129> they<00:03:45.190> produce<00:03:45.459> tokens

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
tokens themselves do they produce tokens

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.000 
tokens themselves do they produce tokens
and<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.239> answer<00:03:46.480> of<00:03:46.510> course<00:03:46.569> is<00:03:46.750> no<00:03:46.900> or<00:03:47.230> what

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
and the answer of course is no or what

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.470 
and the answer of course is no or what
happens<00:03:48.220> if<00:03:48.280> we<00:03:48.400> copy<00:03:48.699> a<00:03:48.819> token<00:03:49.180> with<00:03:49.389> the

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
happens if we copy a token with the

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.020 
happens if we copy a token with the
original<00:03:49.870> mimic<00:03:50.169> well<00:03:50.859> let's<00:03:51.459> say<00:03:51.609> we<00:03:51.730> do<00:03:51.849> that

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
original mimic well let's say we do that

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.439 
original mimic well let's say we do that
and<00:03:52.209> we<00:03:52.269> copy<00:03:52.480> a<00:03:52.629> 3/3<00:03:53.169> centaur<00:03:53.530> token

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:54.449 
and we copy a 3/3 centaur token

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:57.390 
and we copy a 3/3 centaur token
fortunately<00:03:55.449> for<00:03:55.599> us<00:03:55.629> the<00:03:56.199> original<00:03:56.620> mimic

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
fortunately for us the original mimic

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.890 
fortunately for us the original mimic
that's<00:03:57.699> copying<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.209> Centaur<00:03:58.540> is<00:03:58.690> going<00:03:58.840> to

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
that's copying the Centaur is going to

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.689 
that's copying the Centaur is going to
be<00:03:58.989> able<00:03:59.079> to<00:03:59.230> produce<00:03:59.379> other<00:03:59.799> centaur<00:04:00.340> tokens

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:00.699 
be able to produce other centaur tokens

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:02.460 
be able to produce other centaur tokens
and<00:04:00.879> this<00:04:01.060> is<00:04:01.209> because<00:04:01.540> when<00:04:01.989> we<00:04:02.079> copy<00:04:02.290> the

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
and this is because when we copy the

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:03.839 
and this is because when we copy the
Centaur<00:04:02.799> it<00:04:02.980> doesn't<00:04:03.280> actually<00:04:03.400> become<00:04:03.819> a

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
Centaur it doesn't actually become a

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.150 
Centaur it doesn't actually become a
token<00:04:04.329> itself<00:04:04.690> it<00:04:05.260> just<00:04:05.319> copies<00:04:05.739> all<00:04:05.919> of<00:04:06.069> the

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
token itself it just copies all of the

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.580 
token itself it just copies all of the
characteristics<00:04:06.760> on<00:04:06.879> that<00:04:07.329> token<00:04:07.690> the<00:04:08.379> fact

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
characteristics on that token the fact

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.439 
characteristics on that token the fact
that<00:04:08.680> the<00:04:08.980> token<00:04:09.160> only<00:04:09.699> means<00:04:09.910> that<00:04:10.030> the<00:04:10.239> card

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:10.449 
that the token only means that the card

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:12.240 
that the token only means that the card
isn't<00:04:10.750> a<00:04:10.780> real<00:04:10.930> magic<00:04:11.319> card<00:04:11.500> while<00:04:12.040> if<00:04:12.160> the

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
isn't a real magic card while if the

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.800 
isn't a real magic card while if the
progenitor<00:04:12.489> mimic<00:04:12.940> that<00:04:13.090> originally<00:04:13.480> copied

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
progenitor mimic that originally copied

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.080 
progenitor mimic that originally copied
it<00:04:13.930> actually<00:04:14.319> is<00:04:14.470> a<00:04:14.500> real<00:04:14.799> magic<00:04:15.069> card<00:04:15.250> so<00:04:15.760> it

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
it actually is a real magic card so it

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.020 
it actually is a real magic card so it
can<00:04:16.239> continue<00:04:16.479> to<00:04:16.780> produce<00:04:16.930> smaller<00:04:17.410> centaurs

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
can continue to produce smaller centaurs

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.039 
can continue to produce smaller centaurs
another<00:04:19.030> question<00:04:19.359> that<00:04:19.479> might<00:04:19.630> come<00:04:19.660> up<00:04:19.900> is

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
another question that might come up is

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.050 
another question that might come up is
what<00:04:20.470> if<00:04:20.530> you<00:04:20.590> play<00:04:20.769> another<00:04:20.979> mimic<00:04:21.400> copying

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
what if you play another mimic copying

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.580 
what if you play another mimic copying
the<00:04:22.210> mimic<00:04:22.539> that's<00:04:22.810> copying<00:04:23.200> the<00:04:23.289> Centaur

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
the mimic that's copying the Centaur

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.399 
the mimic that's copying the Centaur
token<00:04:23.919> well<00:04:24.610> if<00:04:25.120> you<00:04:25.240> do<00:04:25.390> this<00:04:25.570> the<00:04:25.960> new<00:04:26.080> mimics

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:26.409 
token well if you do this the new mimics

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:27.730 
token well if you do this the new mimics
can<00:04:26.560> have<00:04:26.740> two<00:04:26.919> instances<00:04:27.310> of

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
can have two instances of

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.589 
can have two instances of
the<00:04:27.800> triggered<00:04:28.069> effect<00:04:28.340> this<00:04:29.090> is<00:04:29.240> because

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:29.599 
the triggered effect this is because

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:32.200 
the triggered effect this is because
when<00:04:30.440> you<00:04:30.530> copy<00:04:30.830> something<00:04:31.190> that<00:04:31.639> grants

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
when you copy something that grants

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.480 
when you copy something that grants
something<00:04:32.599> through<00:04:33.349> copying<00:04:33.860> it<00:04:34.039> becomes<00:04:34.400> a

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
something through copying it becomes a

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.400 
something through copying it becomes a
copia<00:04:34.789> Balearic<00:04:35.120> turistic<00:04:35.449> of<00:04:35.569> the<00:04:35.690> card<00:04:35.960> when

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
copia Balearic turistic of the card when

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.439 
copia Balearic turistic of the card when
you<00:04:36.530> go<00:04:36.650> to<00:04:36.710> copy<00:04:36.979> it<00:04:37.099> with<00:04:37.190> something<00:04:37.370> else<00:04:37.580> so

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 
you go to copy it with something else so

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:39.700 
you go to copy it with something else so
the<00:04:38.750> new<00:04:38.900> mimic<00:04:39.169> is<00:04:39.259> going<00:04:39.410> to<00:04:39.470> have<00:04:39.560> two

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
the new mimic is going to have two

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.290 
the new mimic is going to have two
instances<00:04:40.039> of<00:04:40.340> the<00:04:40.430> trick<00:04:40.580> effect<00:04:40.910> the<00:04:41.150> old

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
instances of the trick effect the old

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.120 
instances of the trick effect the old
one<00:04:41.479> has<00:04:41.630> one<00:04:41.840> instance<00:04:42.259> and<00:04:42.770> then<00:04:42.919> I<00:04:42.949> guess

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
one has one instance and then I guess

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.800 
one has one instance and then I guess
three<00:04:43.490> new<00:04:43.639> central<00:04:43.970> tokens<00:04:44.270> beginning<00:04:44.750> of

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
three new central tokens beginning of

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.350 
three new central tokens beginning of
each<00:04:44.930> of<00:04:45.080> our<00:04:45.139> upkeep's<00:04:46.000> so<00:04:47.000> this<00:04:47.180> concludes
