ok<00:00:03.600> let's<00:00:03.750> get<00:00:03.840> familiar<00:00:04.020> with<00:00:04.230> servo

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
ok let's get familiar with servo

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.769 
ok let's get familiar with servo
reversing<00:00:05.220> sir<00:00:05.430> reversing<00:00:05.910> is<00:00:05.970> critical<00:00:06.390> when

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
reversing sir reversing is critical when

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.390 
reversing sir reversing is critical when
you<00:00:06.899> go<00:00:06.990> through<00:00:07.170> and<00:00:07.319> do<00:00:07.410> your<00:00:07.620> control<00:00:08.010> your

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
you go through and do your control your

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.759 
you go through and do your control your
control<00:00:08.940> surface<00:00:09.240> setup<00:00:09.559> oftentimes<00:00:10.559> you'll

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
control surface setup oftentimes you'll

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:11.660 
control surface setup oftentimes you'll
put<00:00:10.950> him<00:00:11.040> in<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.280> depending<00:00:11.550> on<00:00:11.610> the

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
put him in and depending on the

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.640 
put him in and depending on the
orientation<00:00:11.820> of<00:00:12.420> your<00:00:12.480> elevator<00:00:13.049> your<00:00:13.410> rudder

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
orientation of your elevator your rudder

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.640 
orientation of your elevator your rudder
servo<00:00:13.950> or<00:00:14.580> your<00:00:15.000> out<00:00:15.389> around<00:00:15.660> servos<00:00:16.170> you<00:00:16.500> may

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
servo or your out around servos you may

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.950 
servo or your out around servos you may
need<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.890> reverse<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.490> based<00:00:17.880> on<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.240> throw

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
need to reverse that based on the throw

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.870 
need to reverse that based on the throw
direction<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:20.010> if<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.340> need<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.580> do<00:00:20.699> your

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
direction so if you need to do your

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.279 
direction so if you need to do your
server<00:00:21.119> reversing<00:00:21.539> let's<00:00:21.689> take<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.869> look<00:00:22.109> at

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
server reversing let's take a look at

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.349 
server reversing let's take a look at
this<00:00:22.619> this<00:00:22.740> builds<00:00:23.070> off<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.369> previous<00:00:23.550> short

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
this this builds off the previous short

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.870 
this this builds off the previous short
quick<00:00:24.570> clinic<00:00:24.840> we<00:00:24.960> did<00:00:25.109> on<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:26.070> trimming<00:00:26.789> and

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
quick clinic we did on the trimming and

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.939 
quick clinic we did on the trimming and
sub<00:00:27.029> trimming<00:00:27.330> so<00:00:27.539> let's<00:00:28.349> go<00:00:28.500> ahead<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.769> this

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
sub trimming so let's go ahead and this

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.800 
sub trimming so let's go ahead and this
is<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.070> great<00:00:29.310> way<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.460> show<00:00:29.730> serve<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.269> reversing

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
is a great way to show serve a reversing

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.450 
is a great way to show serve a reversing
a<00:00:30.900> lot<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.140> times<00:00:31.380> you'll<00:00:31.650> you'll<00:00:31.949> initialize

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
a lot of times you'll you'll initialize

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.940 
a lot of times you'll you'll initialize
a<00:00:32.489> servo<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.270> do<00:00:34.260> your<00:00:34.380> dead<00:00:34.559> point<00:00:34.800> your

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
a servo and do your dead point your

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.139 
a servo and do your dead point your
center<00:00:35.160> point<00:00:35.309> adjustments<00:00:35.880> through<00:00:36.030> your

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
center point adjustments through your

center point adjustments through your
sub<00:00:36.329> trim<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.840> then<00:00:37.079> when<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.290> go<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.440> hook<00:00:37.800> up

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
sub trim and then when you go to hook up

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.889 
sub trim and then when you go to hook up
your<00:00:38.070> linkage<00:00:38.399> you'll<00:00:39.059> realize<00:00:39.390> right<00:00:39.690> at<00:00:39.809> the

the servo reverse menu it displays all

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.389 
the servo reverse menu it displays all
of<00:00:59.940> our<00:01:00.180> channels<00:01:00.719> available<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:02.100> we're<00:01:02.250> on

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
of our channels available and we're on

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.439 
of our channels available and we're on
our<00:01:02.430> Ella<00:01:02.699> ROM<00:01:02.940> which<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.149> what<00:01:03.239> we're<00:01:03.329> going

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
our Ella ROM which is what we're going

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.630 
our Ella ROM which is what we're going
to<00:01:03.480> make<00:01:03.629> adjustments<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.890> it's<00:01:05.339> working

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
to make adjustments to so it's working

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.250 
to make adjustments to so it's working
the<00:01:05.729> right<00:01:05.880> way<00:01:06.060> for<00:01:06.299> our<00:01:06.420> example<00:01:07.020> but<00:01:07.170> we're

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
the right way for our example but we're

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.359 
the right way for our example but we're
going<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.439> say<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.220> actually

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
going to say that this is actually

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.039 
going to say that this is actually
opposite<00:01:08.939> based<00:01:09.150> on<00:01:09.330> how<00:01:09.450> its<00:01:09.600> installed<00:01:09.689> in

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
opposite based on how its installed in

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.200 
opposite based on how its installed in
the<00:01:10.170> model<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:10.890> we<00:01:11.010> need<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.189> reverse<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.729> all

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
the model so we need to reverse that all

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.550 
the model so we need to reverse that all
of<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.540> going<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.750> rail<00:01:12.960> around<00:01:13.260> we've<00:01:13.439> got

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
of you is going to rail around we've got

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.830 
of you is going to rail around we've got
it<00:01:13.650> selected<00:01:13.799> normal<00:01:14.369> we<00:01:14.460> choose<00:01:14.700> rivers<00:01:15.270> and

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
it selected normal we choose rivers and

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.719 
it selected normal we choose rivers and
confer<00:01:16.200> we<00:01:16.409> have<00:01:16.530> two<00:01:16.650> XS<00:01:17.009> if<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.250> took<00:01:17.460> if<00:01:17.640> you

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
confer we have two XS if it took if you

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.820 
confer we have two XS if it took if you
want<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.909> confirm<00:01:18.180> Lisa<00:01:18.540> hit<00:01:18.780> yes<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.290> now

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
want to confirm Lisa hit yes and now

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.530 
want to confirm Lisa hit yes and now
we've<00:01:20.009> got<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> reversed<00:01:20.640> aileron<00:01:21.119> Channel<00:01:21.450> we

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
we've got a reversed aileron Channel we

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.810 
we've got a reversed aileron Channel we
can<00:01:21.659> verify<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.049> by<00:01:22.409> moving<00:01:22.710> our<00:01:22.860> stick<00:01:23.100> lose

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
can verify that by moving our stick lose

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.850 
can verify that by moving our stick lose
in<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.060> opposite<00:01:24.420> direction<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.900> used<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.229> now

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
in the opposite direction it used to now

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.140 
in the opposite direction it used to now
the<00:01:25.920> interesting<00:01:26.130> thing<00:01:26.460> too<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.820> since<00:01:27.030> we

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
the interesting thing too is since we

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.350 
the interesting thing too is since we
already<00:01:27.390> put<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.570> sub<00:01:27.869> trim<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.320> most<00:01:28.829> radios

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
already put a sub trim in most radios

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.520 
already put a sub trim in most radios
will<00:01:30.360> hold<00:01:30.570> those<00:01:30.780> sub<00:01:31.049> trims<00:01:31.290> you've<00:01:31.439> already

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
will hold those sub trims you've already

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.469 
will hold those sub trims you've already
dialed<00:01:32.009> in<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.820> lot<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.000> times<00:01:33.240> you'll<00:01:33.390> go

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
dialed in so a lot of times you'll go

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.880 
dialed in so a lot of times you'll go
through<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.840> hook<00:01:33.990> up<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.110> servo<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.650> find

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
through you hook up the servo you find

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.870 
through you hook up the servo you find
your<00:01:35.040> center<00:01:35.280> point<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.610> hook<00:01:35.729> up<00:01:35.850> your

your center point you hook up your

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.280 
your center point you hook up your

on<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.180> bench<00:01:39.450> but<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.020> don't<00:01:40.200> realize<00:01:40.500> it

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
on the bench but you don't realize it

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.319 
on the bench but you don't realize it
till<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.829> flip<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.130> model<00:01:41.280> over<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:42.090> check

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
till you flip the model over you check

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.850 
till you flip the model over you check
in<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.509> check<00:01:42.750> out<00:01:42.899> or<00:01:43.140> verify<00:01:43.470> your<00:01:43.590> control

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.620 
in you check out or verify your control
services<00:01:44.280> now<00:01:44.460> all<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.670> sudden<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.420> went

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
services now all of a sudden you went

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.690 
services now all of a sudden you went
through<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.140> sub<00:01:46.409> trimmed<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.950> it

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
through and you sub trimmed and it

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.510 
through and you sub trimmed and it
dialed<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:49.380> sub<00:01:49.890> trim<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.220> opposite

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
dialed in the sub trim in the opposite

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.850 
dialed in the sub trim in the opposite
direction<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:51.420> now<00:01:51.570> we<00:01:51.659> sub<00:01:52.110> trim<00:01:52.380> in<00:01:52.470> our<00:01:52.590> case

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
direction so now we sub trim in our case

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.789 
direction so now we sub trim in our case
let's<00:01:53.250> go<00:01:53.399> back<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.790> sub<00:01:54.000> trim<00:01:54.240> menu<00:01:54.540> in

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
let's go back to the sub trim menu in

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.190 
let's go back to the sub trim menu in
model<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.009> in<00:01:56.700> sub<00:01:57.000> trim<00:01:57.270> we<00:01:57.750> see<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.079> on<00:01:58.170> our

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
model and in sub trim we see you on our

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.170 
model and in sub trim we see you on our
aileron<00:01:58.680> we<00:01:58.799> still<00:01:59.009> have<00:01:59.219> our<00:01:59.250> negative<00:01:59.640> six

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
aileron we still have our negative six

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.560 
aileron we still have our negative six
steps<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.229> sub<00:02:01.950> trim<00:02:02.189> which<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:02.969> now<00:02:03.149> setting

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
steps of sub trim which is now setting

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.330 
steps of sub trim which is now setting
us<00:02:03.689> off<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:04.020> zero<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:04.619> we<00:02:04.770> need<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.009> take<00:02:05.159> that

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
us off of zero so we need to take that

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.240 
us off of zero so we need to take that
back<00:02:05.399> out<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.750> nice<00:02:06.930> thing<00:02:06.960> now<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.530> when<00:02:08.129> we

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
back out the nice thing now is when we

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.970 
back out the nice thing now is when we
go<00:02:08.369> positive<00:02:11.330> we're<00:02:12.330> almost<00:02:12.660> dead<00:02:13.230> on

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
go positive we're almost dead on

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.530 
go positive we're almost dead on
and<00:02:14.099> actually<00:02:14.370> it's<00:02:14.520> only<00:02:14.610> within<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:15.120> couple

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
and actually it's only within a couple

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.259 
and actually it's only within a couple
steps<00:02:15.780> so<00:02:16.709> what<00:02:17.099> we've<00:02:17.250> done<00:02:17.430> is<00:02:17.489> even<00:02:18.120> though

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
steps so what we've done is even though

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.330 
steps so what we've done is even though
we<00:02:18.660> we've<00:02:19.019> flipped<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.590> reverse<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.890> servo

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
we we've flipped a reverse a servo

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.070 
we we've flipped a reverse a servo
around<00:02:20.640> we're<00:02:21.120> able<00:02:21.239> to<00:02:21.420> sub<00:02:21.629> trim<00:02:21.900> in<00:02:22.019> the

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
around we're able to sub trim in the

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.809 
around we're able to sub trim in the
opposite<00:02:22.470> direction<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:23.069> no<00:02:23.250> harm<00:02:23.459> no<00:02:23.489> foul

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
opposite direction and no harm no foul

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.220 
opposite direction and no harm no foul
we've<00:02:24.030> got<00:02:24.209> our<00:02:24.330> linkage<00:02:24.629> still<00:02:24.900> centered

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
we've got our linkage still centered

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.320 
we've got our linkage still centered

horns<00:02:29.580> were<00:02:29.700> parallel<00:02:30.180> when<00:02:30.420> we<00:02:30.480> actually<00:02:30.780> set

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
horns were parallel when we actually set

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.210 
horns were parallel when we actually set
up<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.110> linkage<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:31.980> didn't<00:02:32.190> change

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
field another thing to remember too is

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.750 
field another thing to remember too is
on<00:02:37.380> some<00:02:37.560> radio<00:02:37.709> systems<00:02:38.160> specifically

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
on some radio systems specifically

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.390 
on some radio systems specifically
Futaba<00:02:39.360> comes<00:02:39.569> to<00:02:39.690> mind<00:02:39.900> their<00:02:40.590> throttle

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400

channel<00:02:41.790> is<00:02:41.940> often<00:02:42.650> reverse<00:02:43.650> or<00:02:43.980> it's

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
channel is often reverse or it's

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.910 
channel is often reverse or it's
reversed<00:02:44.790> throw<00:02:45.090> for<00:02:45.450> ESC<00:02:46.080> so<00:02:46.380> if<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.799> use

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
reversed throw for ESC so if you use

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.080 
reversed throw for ESC so if you use
electric<00:02:47.280> aircraft<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:47.819> lose<00:02:47.970> the

electric aircraft you lose the
electronic<00:02:48.510> speed<00:02:48.720> control<00:02:49.049> and<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.680> hook

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
electronic speed control and you hook

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.009

that<00:02:49.950> up<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.730> throttle<00:02:51.060> channel<00:02:51.390> you'll

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
that up to the throttle channel you'll

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.050 
that up to the throttle channel you'll
find<00:02:52.079> that<00:02:52.410> your<00:02:52.560> ESC<00:02:52.980> is<00:02:53.010> not<00:02:53.340> arming<00:02:53.730> or<00:02:53.910> it's

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
find that your ESC is not arming or it's

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.550 
find that your ESC is not arming or it's

radio system it sees that throttle is

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.110 
radio system it sees that throttle is
actually<00:03:01.380> being<00:03:01.560> full<00:03:01.890> when<00:03:02.579> in<00:03:02.700> fact<00:03:02.880> you

on Futaba radio systems make sure that
throttle<00:03:46.350> is<00:03:46.560> set<00:03:46.739> is<00:03:46.829> reversed<00:03:47.250> or<00:03:48.000> you'll

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
throttle is set is reversed or you'll

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.420 
throttle is set is reversed or you'll
have<00:03:48.329> a<00:03:48.359> lot<00:03:48.540> of<00:03:48.630> difficulties<00:03:49.049> Aurora<00:03:49.769> 9<00:03:49.980> the

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
have a lot of difficulties Aurora 9 the

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.640 
have a lot of difficulties Aurora 9 the
throttle<00:03:51.269> orientation<00:03:51.840> from<00:03:52.350> zero<00:03:52.560> to<00:03:52.620> a

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
throttle orientation from zero to a

throttle orientation from zero to a
hundred<00:03:52.680> percent<00:03:53.130> is<00:03:53.280> normal<00:03:53.730> out<00:03:53.819> of<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:53.970> box

hundred percent is normal out of the box

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.849 
hundred percent is normal out of the box
so<00:03:54.510> I've<00:03:54.660> never<00:03:54.840> had<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:55.139> reverse<00:03:55.380> anything<00:03:55.769> in

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
so I've never had to reverse anything in

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.729 
so I've never had to reverse anything in
Aurora<00:03:56.250> or<00:03:57.239> in<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:57.989> same<00:03:58.170> can<00:03:58.410> be<00:03:58.530> said<00:03:58.709> with

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
changes on the throttle channel so

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.110 
changes on the throttle channel so
always<00:04:04.920> be<00:04:05.010> mindful<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:05.609> pay<00:04:05.940> close

certain radio setups but that's
reversing<00:04:12.720> it's<00:04:12.840> simple<00:04:13.169> easy<00:04:13.380> and<00:04:13.680> something

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
reversing it's simple easy and something

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.039 
reversing it's simple easy and something
that<00:04:14.340> will<00:04:14.459> prove<00:04:14.639> highly<00:04:14.970> beneficial<00:04:15.359> when
