the<00:00:16.640> duality<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:17.670> know<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:18.000> was<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.840> believe

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
the duality I know it was I believe

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.470 
the duality I know it was I believe
carrier<00:00:20.420> stealth<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:22.039> monolith<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.310> he<00:00:24.300> took

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
carrier stealth and monolith and he took

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.009 
carrier stealth and monolith and he took
a<00:00:24.539> helix<00:00:25.050> from<00:00:25.350> scout<00:00:26.039> thus<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.910> 70<00:00:27.300> 200<00:00:27.510> Life

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
a helix from scout thus the 70 200 Life

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.700 
a helix from scout thus the 70 200 Life
Points<00:00:29.900> okay<00:00:30.900> so<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.170> looks<00:00:31.199> like<00:00:31.349> he's<00:00:31.529> going

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
Points okay so it looks like he's going

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.380 
Points okay so it looks like he's going
to<00:00:31.890> normal<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.489> helix<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.390> pass<00:00:33.660> turn

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
to normal the helix and pass turn

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.430 
to normal the helix and pass turn
actually<00:00:36.390> think<00:00:36.540> he<00:00:36.690> looks<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.020> starting<00:00:37.380> to

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
actually think he looks is starting to

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.440 
actually think he looks is starting to
become<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.950> better<00:00:38.280> turn<00:00:38.640> on<00:00:38.850> summoned<00:00:39.329> in<00:00:39.420> a

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
if I said I didn't use it in some of my

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.000 
if I said I didn't use it in some of my
regional<00:04:00.670> decks<00:04:00.940> but<00:04:01.210> I<00:04:01.420> hate<00:04:01.990> using<00:04:02.290> it<00:04:02.590> on<00:04:02.770> my

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
regional decks but I hate using it on my

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.230 
regional decks but I hate using it on my
opponents<00:04:03.520> turn<00:04:03.610> like<00:04:03.850> I<00:04:03.910> want<00:04:04.060> to<00:04:04.120> use<00:04:04.210> it

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
after my draw phase so that I can

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.460 
after my draw phase so that I can
maximize<00:04:06.880> its<00:04:07.090> potential<00:04:07.450> because<00:04:07.750> he<00:04:08.350> only

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
maximize its potential because he only

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.350 
maximize its potential because he only
has<00:04:08.620> three<00:04:08.830> cards<00:04:09.160> right<00:04:09.310> now<00:04:09.490> and<00:04:09.790> if<00:04:10.270> he

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
has three cards right now and if he

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.730 
has three cards right now and if he
doesn't<00:04:10.540> have<00:04:10.690> a<00:04:10.780> scout<00:04:11.050> he's<00:04:11.350> really<00:04:11.530> not
