00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.550
 the video I want to mention that the 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.340
 channel has already reached the thousand 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.830
 subscribers the channel is really 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.600
 growing at a very very fast level I 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.130
 had very good expectations without 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.320
 But you are breaking them 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.910

 thank you really I think there are no other 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.120
 words I would like to give you a div away 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.770
 or things like that but without 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.960
 However, the entire budget does not reach 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.390
 but without a doubt as soon as we have 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.520
 the opportunity thanks to you your 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.320

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.270
 I think since then to throw more 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.940
 you win this motivates me and we will continue 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.640
 forward so now we're going to 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.840
 move to the video part today 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.640
 I bring you one of the best 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.920
 applications that I have found in the 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.570
 windows store not only with respect to 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.850
 context of the camera that is what 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.740
 this application is about, but one of 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.290
 the best alternatives to the nokia 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.960
 camera as it will allow us to give so much 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.900
 edit how to take photos inside the 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.670
 same application as well as inclusive 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.409
 share them within this application 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.509
 without having to leave 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.770
 in three of the most social networks 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.219
 important as it has been 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.780
 facebook twitter and flickr so let's go 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:28.759
 to start by downloading this application 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.740
 we will go to our windows 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.829
 store and on the search key 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.630
 we will write camera 360 you try written 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.609
 this suggestion will appear to us 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.069
 give me touch on it and it will not be the 

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:43.159
 first application that you suggest 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:45.590
 it really is a is a pretty logo 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.599
 striking on my part I really do not know 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.729
 who is the editor since he is 

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:51.349
 written I think in Japanese language or 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.259
 china the next thing we're going to do is 

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:55.310
 tap where it says install 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.569
 let's change the dynamics a little bit 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.310
 of the video so that it can be appreciated 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:00.530
 better both the application and the 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.200
 pictures I repeat this app we 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.759
 allows both edit take and share 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.099
 the photographs within it 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:10.069
 application without having to leave us good 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:12.799
 here we are going to take a picture to giving a 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.930
 touch on the camera will not take a 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:17.989
 photo and here at the bottom 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.879
 left we appear as some 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.950
 slides let's give a tap on 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:24.210
 she and this is one of the best 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.850
 functions that I think this one has 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.520
 and we are very fond of the 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.890
 photography we can ride that puts us 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.320
 a photography diary how are we going 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.760
 taking the photos chronologically in the 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.550
 left part come the days of the 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.530
 week to leave or move a little 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.330
 faster for example these future 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.010
 I took previously and good here the part 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.080
 Little girl comes to us like a plane 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.670
 paper if we touch on the one of what 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.820
 that I told you that allows us 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.410
 share the photograph in the 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.150
 following three social networks like what 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.700
 it's being facebook twitter and flickr 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.080
 so that they take it into account in case 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.760
 this was not too much one of the 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.670
 functions that this application has is 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.140
 that we can adjust it according to a 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.460
 scale that we like for 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.370
 example this one to one that comes 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.100
 being for instagram they also come 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.780
 Well, as shading effects 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.670
 around the polarized world or 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.200
 including film comes as the 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.000
 part of the right will come this 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.460
 M-shaped circuit if we give 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.440
 a touch is heard this sound quite 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.960
 good that if we give in the first touch 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.700
 has been what is the balance of 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.510
 whites if we give 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.069
 here in the bar we see that there is a 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.560
 puntito if we give a touch on 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.660
 we scroll down well you lower the 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.790
 tonality or it goes up according to the 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.160
 clarity of light if we go 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.230
 to tap on that same icon 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.739
 Well now it's been generally 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:53.310
 for the type for the approach either mode 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:55.019
 macro like this simple if we 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.760
 come on now a touch closes in the 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.760
 part of the grandfather right are being 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.560
 the main settings this touch 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.959
 I recommend that you put it in the background 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.540
 so that you focus on different parts not 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.579
 only in the center the sound good 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.500
 they seem quite striking to me 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.209
 that I'll leave it on also gives us the 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.910
 Timer option effects 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.919
 instantaneous and other adjustments if 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.780
 Here we look around 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.000
 the camera have like a roller like 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.850
 a roulette if we give the 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.130
 right will put us to different effects 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.320
 predetermined and depending on taste 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.169
 of each one so to take different 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.380
 photo styles comes as well as 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.540
 on exposed a little fuzzy 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.640
 well we also come different 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.560
 types of effects to be able to edit the 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.560
 picture we are going to enter our journal of 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.420
 photograph will open and you will 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.250

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.300
 lower will sell us or good we 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.160
 they will come forgiveness 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.930
 these four options and we give a touch 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.670
 in the three little dots we can 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.950
 we have three options as it comes 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.530
 being returned to the camera edit 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.060
 delete or share 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.520

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.570
 application and pull the picture sorry 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.610

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.140
 we give a touch here they will show us 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.090
 different scales for example this is 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.040
 one to one usually for instagram 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.890

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.920
