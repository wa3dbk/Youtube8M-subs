00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 Ever thought about drinking beer in the cafe? 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.000
 beer or a beer. 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.250
 dessert 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.480
 then you think that this idea does not 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.309
 less sense 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.910
 So be prepared, we 'll talk about the 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.910
 States 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.279
 la breweries of the 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.050
 Brazil I'm in charge of this, but I can 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.420
 call Maria saved that you are 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.760
 watching the third episode of the cd 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.769
 since a web series is the one who is starting 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.140
 to enjoy the first beer labels 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.270
 really well today we will look for 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.399
 a crazy idea 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.309
 Have you ever thought about combining beer with 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.840
 your dessert or have beer in the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.360
 menu breakfast 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.100
 well it seems less 15 jobs will do 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.120
 feel but you will understand that 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.160
 I'm talking 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.379
 stays are known by color 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.090
 dark and by the body the Pope 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.370
 because they are made with malt 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.530
 roast that does not deliver its color 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.000
 different for beers but does with 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.090
 that it has aromas and flavors 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.210
 incredible you will be able to perceive 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.990
 aroma and taste of chocolate cocoa coffee 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.760
 They are taking breakfast in the morning so I think 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.130
 I just gave an excuse to 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.210
 start well before noon this is not 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.159
 cool, not very cool 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.710
 and these characteristics make 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.540
 desserts like chocolate brownie I 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.450
 I'm sure if you try 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.880
 golden week is a difficult field to talk about 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.890
 of stout because within that style we 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.560
 let's find beers completely 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.619
 different from a stout grid that is 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.560
 drier than that is what guiness is until 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.810
 the most sweet sasso stops that can 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.939
 taste like chocolate 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.790
 bitter and it's not just the malt that shines 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.380
 not many stout are very popular or 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.390
 are are most loved 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.299
 is the case of American history and 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.310
 gaucho stout well and speaking about 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.649
 a projectile today we will go 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.540
 talk about a great example is a box 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.750
 Petroleum 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.750
 O 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.500
 This beer, that's who I said. 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.330
 only good imported beer then you can 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.980
 bite the tongue because she's Brazilian 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.020
 and he is a miner 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.300
 OGX oil is produced by 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.430
 brewery walls that brought two 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.400
 it is important that people there in the 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.260
 spicy eye then a voice of the bell that 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.140
 one of the labels dantas and gold medal 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.940
 in Brazil and the paper board brought the silver 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.160
 then to show how much the market 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.660
 Brazilian brewer is being 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.870
 recognized outside 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.970
 to audi oil she has 12% alcohol and 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.510
 on the beer bittern range that goes 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.600
 from zero to 120 it has 70 points of 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.480
 bitterness then it's a strong beer, right? 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.959
 bitter a good bench as one of them 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.810
 the restaurant operates and beyond 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.970
 Sensational sheet I'm going to try not 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.709
 cause an accident for me person 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.709
 try and we'll go 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.140
 one of the things that draw attention 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.120
 when we serve walls this foam 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.120
 consistent brown 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.130
 and there was not one was what I said ah 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.120
 has this chocolate coffee stick that 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.220
 it is very good 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.220
 nice lets me prove that I'm singing more 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:54.130
 is this is quite alcoholic and beloved 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:58.450
 but then in the end you feel 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:04.349
 quite a bit of chocolate that 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:04.349
 goes beyond bitter until it stands out 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.580

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.200
