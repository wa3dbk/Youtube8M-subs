00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
new to this that hose that you see

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.029 
new to this that hose that you see
running<00:00:45.660> across<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.350> not<00:00:46.379> there<00:00:46.739> for<00:00:46.920> any

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
running across is not there for any

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.319 
running across is not there for any
reason<00:00:47.100> just<00:00:47.579> happened<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.879> be<00:00:48.000> there<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.239> the

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
reason just happened to be there in the

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.540 
reason just happened to be there in the
video<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:49.230> when<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.890> put<00:00:50.100> something<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.489> his

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
video so when I put something in his

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.090 
video so when I put something in his
mouth<00:00:50.610> like<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.329> he's<00:00:51.570> very<00:00:52.230> driven<00:00:52.680> for<00:00:53.039> a

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
mouth like this he's very driven for a

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.549 
mouth like this he's very driven for a
toy<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:53.850> it's<00:00:54.300> very<00:00:54.570> difficult<00:00:54.899> for<00:00:55.260> him<00:00:55.440> to

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
toy so it's very difficult for him to

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.000 
toy so it's very difficult for him to
hold<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.340> toy<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.530> still<00:00:58.530> be<00:00:58.710> aware

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
hold on to that toy and still be aware

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.619 
hold on to that toy and still be aware
of<00:00:59.129> his<00:00:59.219> feet<00:00:59.489> at<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.820> early<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.510> game

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
of his feet at this early in the game

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.410 
of his feet at this early in the game
but<00:01:01.140> we'll<00:01:01.710> progress<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.280> later<00:01:02.579> into<00:01:02.879> bite

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
but we'll progress this later into bite

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.960 
but we'll progress this later into bite
work<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.989> into<00:01:04.320> just<00:01:05.040> being<00:01:05.250> steady<00:01:05.700> no

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
work and into just being steady no

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.130 
work and into just being steady no

him pick it up here as well and that

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.520 
him pick it up here as well and that
will<00:01:17.759> create<00:01:18.000> movement<00:01:18.570> ideally<00:01:19.080> we<00:01:19.229> wanted

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
will create movement ideally we wanted

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.010 
will create movement ideally we wanted
to<00:01:19.619> just<00:01:19.830> pick<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.340> up<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.700> boom<00:01:21.150> right<00:01:21.420> into<00:01:21.990> a

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
to just pick it up and boom right into a

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.460 
to just pick it up and boom right into a
into<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.860> stand<00:01:23.159> but<00:01:23.310> he<00:01:23.909> still<00:01:24.270> digs<00:01:25.049> for<00:01:25.229> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
into a stand but he still digs for the
