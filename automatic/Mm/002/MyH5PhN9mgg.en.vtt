that's move the little knock out that's
sufficient<00:02:34.470> right<00:02:34.590> there<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.220> then<00:02:35.730> use<00:02:35.970> the

my job I'm a lieutenant the FDNY today
we're<00:05:17.110> gonna<00:05:17.200> talk<00:05:17.380> about<00:05:17.440> the<00:05:17.740> New<00:05:17.860> York<00:05:18.070> roof

we're gonna talk about the New York roof
hook<00:05:18.610> and<00:05:18.850> its<00:05:19.419> value<00:05:19.810> to<00:05:19.990> the<00:05:20.080> fire<00:05:20.260> service

hook and its value to the fire service

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.920 
hook and its value to the fire service
first<00:05:21.940> thing<00:05:22.150> is<00:05:22.300> a<00:05:22.330> lot<00:05:22.540> of<00:05:22.660> people<00:05:22.840> don't

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
first thing is a lot of people don't

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.890 
first thing is a lot of people don't
realize<00:05:23.200> one<00:05:24.040> side<00:05:24.310> has<00:05:24.550> a<00:05:24.580> tapered<00:05:25.150> head<00:05:25.300> one

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
realize one side has a tapered head one

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:26.970 
realize one side has a tapered head one
side<00:05:26.200> is<00:05:26.410> flat

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980 
side is flat

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.190 
side is flat
the<00:05:27.280> reason<00:05:27.580> it's<00:05:27.700> flat<00:05:27.940> on<00:05:27.970> one<00:05:28.270> side<00:05:28.540> is<00:05:28.780> when

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
the reason it's flat on one side is when

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.560 
the reason it's flat on one side is when
you<00:05:29.290> put<00:05:29.590> it<00:05:29.680> up<00:05:29.770> against<00:05:30.160> a<00:05:30.250> wall<00:05:30.490> it<00:05:30.820> rides

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
you put it up against a wall it rides

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.900 
you put it up against a wall it rides
flat<00:05:32.050> so<00:05:32.470> that<00:05:32.650> the<00:05:32.770> point<00:05:33.160> can<00:05:33.520> get<00:05:33.669> under

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
flat so that the point can get under

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.490 
flat so that the point can get under
some<00:05:34.090> flashing<00:05:34.660> maybe<00:05:35.110> on<00:05:35.260> the<00:05:35.350> old

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
some flashing maybe on the old

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.620 
some flashing maybe on the old
dumbwaiter<00:05:35.770> shaft<00:05:36.070> or<00:05:36.820> maybe<00:05:37.000> sometimes<00:05:37.479> when

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
dumbwaiter shaft or maybe sometimes when

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.330 
dumbwaiter shaft or maybe sometimes when
we're<00:05:37.750> taking<00:05:37.870> crown<00:05:38.229> molding<00:05:38.710> go<00:05:39.070> flat

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
we're taking crown molding go flat

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.850 
we're taking crown molding go flat
against<00:05:39.639> the<00:05:39.729> wall<00:05:39.850> as<00:05:40.360> you<00:05:41.020> can<00:05:41.229> see<00:05:41.440> it<00:05:41.620> stays

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
against the wall as you can see it stays

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.280 
against the wall as you can see it stays
flush<00:05:42.340> when<00:05:43.150> you<00:05:43.240> put<00:05:43.450> it<00:05:43.540> this<00:05:43.720> way<00:05:43.960> you<00:05:44.139> can

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.290 
flush when you put it this way you can

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.960 
flush when you put it this way you can
see<00:05:44.440> the<00:05:44.620> gap<00:05:44.860> with<00:05:45.190> the<00:05:45.220> point<00:05:45.580> won't<00:05:45.820> get

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
see the gap with the point won't get

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.850 
see the gap with the point won't get
behind<00:05:46.120> the<00:05:46.450> product<00:05:47.290> that<00:05:47.410> you're<00:05:47.530> forcing

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
behind the product that you're forcing

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.400 
behind the product that you're forcing
one<00:05:48.669> of<00:05:48.820> the<00:05:48.940> nice<00:05:49.120> value<00:05:49.479> of<00:05:49.600> this<00:05:49.750> tool<00:05:50.020> and

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
one of the nice value of this tool and

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.680 
one of the nice value of this tool and
that's<00:05:50.560> two<00:05:50.770> workable<00:05:51.250> ends<00:05:51.460> if<00:05:52.090> you<00:05:52.330> notice

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
that's two workable ends if you notice

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.690 
that's two workable ends if you notice
on<00:05:52.840> this<00:05:52.990> side<00:05:53.260> of<00:05:53.290> the<00:05:53.440> hook<00:05:53.650> we<00:05:54.190> have<00:05:54.310> a

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
on this side of the hook we have a

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.000 
on this side of the hook we have a
chisel<00:05:55.360> and<00:05:55.540> somewhere<00:05:55.990> else<00:05:56.110> well<00:05:56.320> duckbill

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
chisel and somewhere else well duckbill

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.950 
chisel and somewhere else well duckbill
and<00:05:57.280> the<00:05:57.669> value<00:05:58.000> of<00:05:58.120> this<00:05:58.210> is<00:05:58.450> against<00:05:58.780> its

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
and the value of this is against its

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.560 
and the value of this is against its
purchase<00:05:59.380> points<00:05:59.800> it's<00:06:00.190> also<00:06:00.430> very<00:06:00.790> good<00:06:01.060> to

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
purchase points it's also very good to

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.540 
purchase points it's also very good to
get<00:06:01.720> under<00:06:01.960> crown<00:06:02.229> molding<00:06:02.800> or<00:06:03.220> when<00:06:03.400> we're

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
get under crown molding or when we're

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.640 
get under crown molding or when we're
pulling<00:06:03.790> the<00:06:03.970> baseboard<00:06:04.570> instead<00:06:05.229> of<00:06:05.350> bending

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
pulling the baseboard instead of bending

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.620 
pulling the baseboard instead of bending
