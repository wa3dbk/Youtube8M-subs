this particular point that's kind of

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.290 
this particular point that's kind of
unclear<00:00:32.070> because<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.610> what<00:00:32.730> we<00:00:32.850> found<00:00:32.969> out<00:00:33.149> in

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
unclear because of what we found out in

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.840 
unclear because of what we found out in
this<00:00:33.420> chapter<00:00:33.690> but<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.309> really<00:00:35.460> helping

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
this chapter but this is really helping

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.450 
this chapter but this is really helping
to<00:00:35.969> showcase<00:00:36.390> more<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.690> your<00:00:37.649> watch<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.190> where

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
to showcase more of your watch and where

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.490 
to showcase more of your watch and where
he<00:00:38.670> went<00:00:38.850> with<00:00:39.000> everything<00:00:39.149> like<00:00:39.600> why<00:00:40.140> he

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
he went with everything like why he

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.440

started<00:00:41.040> stuff<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.489> whatnot<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:42.180> think

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
started stuff and whatnot so I think

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.000 
started stuff and whatnot so I think
this<00:00:42.510> flashback<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:43.079> going<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.290> help<00:00:43.440> for<00:00:43.710> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
skeptical but at the same time I'm kind

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.160 
skeptical but at the same time I'm kind
of<00:00:56.550> like<00:00:56.699> wondering<00:00:57.090> because<00:00:57.210> when<00:00:57.840> they<00:00:57.960> both

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
of like wondering because when they both

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.410 
of like wondering because when they both
met<00:00:58.440> bass<00:00:58.649> being<00:00:59.010> hostile<00:00:59.460> it<00:01:00.000> seems<00:01:00.329> as

met bass being hostile it seems as

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.779 
met bass being hostile it seems as
though<00:01:00.510> ha<00:01:00.780> strolled<00:01:01.160> wasn't<00:01:02.160> really<00:01:02.609> like

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
though ha strolled wasn't really like

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.280 
though ha strolled wasn't really like
they<00:01:03.059> were<00:01:03.120> related<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.780> sense<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.140> being

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
they were related in a sense of being

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.899 
they were related in a sense of being
Quincy<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.890> whatnot<00:01:05.159> because<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.790> know<00:01:05.880> all

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
Quincy and whatnot because you know all

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.730 
Quincy and whatnot because you know all
of<00:01:06.119> them<00:01:06.299> were<00:01:06.390> Quincy<00:01:06.780> or<00:01:06.840> whatever<00:01:07.080> but<00:01:07.530> I

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
of them were Quincy or whatever but I

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.469 
of them were Quincy or whatever but I
thought<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.490> was<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.640> possibility<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.270> he<00:01:09.360> was

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
thought it was a possibility that he was

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.060 
thought it was a possibility that he was
like<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.750> watch<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.110> Sun<00:01:10.380> or<00:01:10.560> whatever<00:01:10.830> and

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
like you watch the Sun or whatever and

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.700 
like you watch the Sun or whatever and
there's<00:01:11.640> still<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> possibility<00:01:12.290> but<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.590> way

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
there's still a possibility but the way

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.100 
there's still a possibility but the way
it<00:01:13.890> was<00:01:14.010> presented<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.610> whatnot<00:01:14.939> was<00:01:15.210> okay<00:01:15.900> my

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
it was presented and whatnot was okay my

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.899 
it was presented and whatnot was okay my
parents<00:01:16.530> are<00:01:16.619> dead<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.130> lived<00:01:17.369> my<00:01:17.430> uncle

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
parents are dead and I lived my uncle

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.880 
parents are dead and I lived my uncle
and<00:01:18.150> then<00:01:18.390> his<00:01:18.540> uncle<00:01:18.810> got<00:01:19.140> burned<00:01:19.350> alive<00:01:19.619> when

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
and then his uncle got burned alive when

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.130 
and then his uncle got burned alive when
the<00:01:19.979> forest<00:01:20.220> burnt<00:01:20.490> down<00:01:20.670> or<00:01:20.850> whatever<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.450> it

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
the forest burnt down or whatever so it

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.560 
the forest burnt down or whatever so it
kind<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.590> made<00:01:22.770> me<00:01:22.799> wonder<00:01:23.130> like<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.580> Bach<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
kind of made me wonder like is Bach the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.840 
kind of made me wonder like is Bach the
parent<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.140> supposedly<00:01:25.740> died<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.549> then

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
parent that supposedly died and then

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.670 
parent that supposedly died and then
