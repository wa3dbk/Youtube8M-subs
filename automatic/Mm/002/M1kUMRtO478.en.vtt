00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
just gave me a tutorial to pull over and

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.509 
just gave me a tutorial to pull over and
yes<00:02:49.349> I<00:02:49.560> don't<00:02:49.620> know<00:02:49.769> that<00:02:49.920> works<00:02:50.190> for<00:02:50.280> everyone

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
yes I don't know that works for everyone

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.009 
yes I don't know that works for everyone
else<00:02:50.640> but<00:02:50.880> yeah<00:02:51.120> so<00:02:51.329> that's<00:02:51.450> pretty<00:02:51.690> messed<00:02:51.840> up

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
else but yeah so that's pretty messed up

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.780 
else but yeah so that's pretty messed up
but<00:02:52.470> yeah<00:02:52.650> apparently<00:02:52.829> they<00:02:53.190> updated<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.640> toy

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
but yeah apparently they updated the toy

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.400 
but yeah apparently they updated the toy
tutorial<00:02:54.299> I<00:02:54.390> believe<00:02:54.660> it<00:02:54.780> might<00:02:55.079> be<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.290> first

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
tutorial I believe it might be the first

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.080 
tutorial I believe it might be the first
one<00:02:55.650> because<00:02:55.799> it<00:02:56.040> does<00:02:56.220> seem<00:02:56.579> a<00:02:56.610> little<00:02:56.819> bit

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
one because it does seem a little bit

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.990 
one because it does seem a little bit
more<00:02:57.599> or<00:02:58.230> in-depth<00:02:59.160> towards<00:02:59.760> what's

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
more or in-depth towards what's

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.280 
more or in-depth towards what's
happening<00:03:00.359> in<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.510> game<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:00.870> stuff<00:03:00.989> so<00:03:01.170> yeah

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
happening in the game and stuff so yeah

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.229 
happening in the game and stuff so yeah
that<00:03:01.470> that<00:03:01.769> seems<00:03:02.250> like<00:03:02.489> it<00:03:02.609> would<00:03:02.760> be<00:03:02.910> pretty

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
that that seems like it would be pretty

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.680 
that that seems like it would be pretty
