that you'll fall up till now we know

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.529 
that you'll fall up till now we know
that<00:00:22.040> she's<00:00:22.189> hopeful<00:00:22.520> broken<00:00:22.939> that<00:00:23.150> is<00:00:23.300> she

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
that she's hopeful broken that is she

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:25.929 
that she's hopeful broken that is she
will<00:00:23.750> allow<00:00:24.169> you<00:00:24.230> to<00:00:24.439> put<00:00:25.220> the<00:00:25.310> halter<00:00:25.460> on<00:00:25.640> and

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
will allow you to put the halter on and

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.220 
will allow you to put the halter on and
off<00:00:26.060> and<00:00:26.390> she<00:00:27.020> carries<00:00:27.380> it<00:00:27.529> quite<00:00:27.770> happily

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
off and she carries it quite happily

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.630 
off and she carries it quite happily
you've<00:00:30.230> gentled<00:00:30.710> her<00:00:30.800> face<00:00:31.070> in<00:00:31.250> the<00:00:31.369> early

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
you've gentled her face in the early

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.490 
you've gentled her face in the early
stages<00:00:31.970> so<00:00:32.390> that<00:00:32.540> she's<00:00:32.750> not<00:00:32.780> objecting<00:00:33.470> to

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
stages so that she's not objecting to

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.200 
stages so that she's not objecting to
having<00:00:33.830> a<00:00:33.920> face<00:00:34.129> handle<00:00:34.489> to<00:00:34.670> the<00:00:34.760> extent<00:00:35.090> where

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
having a face handle to the extent where

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.549 
having a face handle to the extent where
you<00:00:35.300> can<00:00:35.449> now<00:00:35.600> put<00:00:35.809> the<00:00:35.840> halter<00:00:36.050> on<00:00:36.199> and<00:00:36.470> off

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
you can now put the halter on and off

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.920 
you can now put the halter on and off
really<00:00:37.040> easily<00:00:37.250> she<00:00:38.150> doesn't<00:00:38.449> mind<00:00:38.629> it<00:00:38.780> being

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
really easily she doesn't mind it being

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:39.820 
really easily she doesn't mind it being
moved<00:00:39.110> around

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:39.830 
moved around

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.180 
moved around
I<00:00:39.860> haven't<00:00:40.519> up<00:00:40.699> till<00:00:40.940> now<00:00:41.150> and<00:00:41.949> used<00:00:42.949> the

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
I haven't up till now and used the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.670 
I haven't up till now and used the
halter<00:00:43.580> than<00:00:44.030> any<00:00:44.239> of<00:00:44.449> our<00:00:44.600> training<00:00:45.110> because

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
halter than any of our training because

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.410 
halter than any of our training because
I<00:00:45.829> didn't<00:00:46.129> want<00:00:46.280> to<00:00:46.399> put<00:00:46.579> any<00:00:46.730> undue<00:00:46.969> pressure

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
I didn't want to put any undue pressure

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.299 
I didn't want to put any undue pressure
on<00:00:47.629> her<00:00:48.020> face<00:00:48.289> which<00:00:48.590> there's<00:00:48.890> there's<00:00:49.160> no

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
on her face which there's there's no

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.330 
on her face which there's there's no
flesh<00:00:49.610> there<00:00:49.850> it's<00:00:49.969> quite<00:00:50.090> bony<00:00:50.450> a<00:00:51.320> bit<00:00:52.250> of

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
flesh there it's quite bony a bit of

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.760 
flesh there it's quite bony a bit of
force<00:00:52.550> on<00:00:52.730> her<00:00:52.879> face<00:00:53.149> might<00:00:53.420> actually<00:00:54.110> hurt<00:00:54.559> it

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
force on her face might actually hurt it

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.889 
force on her face might actually hurt it
and<00:00:55.160> I<00:00:55.219> don't<00:00:55.280> want<00:00:55.670> the<00:00:55.850> holder<00:00:56.570> to<00:00:56.600> pull

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
and I don't want the holder to pull

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.599 
and I don't want the holder to pull
across<00:00:57.170> her<00:00:57.320> eye<00:00:57.500> when<00:00:57.829> I<00:00:57.860> was<00:00:58.100> doing<00:00:58.250> some<00:00:58.370> of

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
across her eye when I was doing some of

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.580 
across her eye when I was doing some of
the<00:00:58.699> lateral<00:00:59.000> movements<00:00:59.510> but<00:00:59.930> now<00:01:00.109> it's<00:01:00.320> time

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
the lateral movements but now it's time

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.290 
the lateral movements but now it's time
that<00:01:00.920> she's<00:01:01.309> quite<00:01:01.460> established<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:02.210> her

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
that she's quite established and her

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.079 
that she's quite established and her
other<00:01:02.480> work<00:01:02.719> to<00:01:03.230> start<00:01:04.220> using<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:04.699> halter<00:01:05.059> and

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
other work to start using the halter and

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:06.520 
other work to start using the halter and
that's<00:01:05.420> when<00:01:05.600> I<00:01:05.630> start<00:01:05.990> calling<00:01:06.200> at<00:01:06.440> the

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
that's when I start calling at the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.450 
that's when I start calling at the
halter<00:01:06.860> training<00:01:08.080> by<00:01:09.080> doing<00:01:09.440> that<00:01:09.619> we<00:01:10.130> need<00:01:10.310> to

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
halter training by doing that we need to

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.450 
halter training by doing that we need to
actually<00:01:11.050> teach<00:01:12.050> her<00:01:12.259> to<00:01:12.530> take<00:01:12.979> a<00:01:13.009> little<00:01:13.280> bit

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
actually teach her to take a little bit

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.279 
actually teach her to take a little bit
of<00:01:13.550> pressure<00:01:13.729> off<00:01:14.000> on<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:14.330> halter<00:01:14.539> building

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289 
of pressure off on the halter building

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:17.469 
of pressure off on the halter building
up<00:01:15.440> towards<00:01:15.649> being<00:01:16.280> tied<00:01:16.550> up<00:01:16.580> where<00:01:17.330> the

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
up towards being tied up where the

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.780 
up towards being tied up where the
pressure<00:01:17.690> may<00:01:17.900> come<00:01:18.170> on<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:18.680> if<00:01:19.369> she<00:01:19.580> does

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
pressure may come on and if she does

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.149 
pressure may come on and if she does
argue<00:01:20.330> a<00:01:20.360> little<00:01:20.479> but<00:01:20.630> about<00:01:20.930> the<00:01:21.740> tying<00:01:21.979> up

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
argue a little but about the tying up

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.160 
argue a little but about the tying up
process<00:01:22.640> so<00:01:23.210> we<00:01:23.450> want<00:01:24.110> to<00:01:25.000> teach<00:01:26.000> her<00:01:26.240> to<00:01:26.270> yield

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
process so we want to teach her to yield

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.410 
process so we want to teach her to yield
to<00:01:27.409> them<00:01:27.830> sideways<00:01:28.130> pressure<00:01:28.670> on<00:01:28.939> the<00:01:29.090> halter

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
to them sideways pressure on the halter

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.710 
to them sideways pressure on the halter
and<00:01:29.540> you<00:01:30.079> do<00:01:30.229> that<00:01:30.409> by<00:01:30.619> just<00:01:31.299> pressing<00:01:32.299> on<00:01:32.600> her

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
and you do that by just pressing on her

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.469 
and you do that by just pressing on her
nose<00:01:32.930> on<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.350> side<00:01:33.560> of<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.799> face<00:01:34.150> away<00:01:35.150> from

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
nose on the side of the face away from

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.859 
nose on the side of the face away from
you<00:01:35.720> and<00:01:35.990> she's<00:01:36.920> quite<00:01:37.240> so<00:01:38.240> that<00:01:38.390> she'll<00:01:38.540> yield

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
you and she's quite so that she'll yield

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.260 
you and she's quite so that she'll yield
to<00:01:39.140> that<00:01:39.170> feel<00:01:39.590> so<00:01:40.250> if<00:01:40.369> she<00:01:40.549> starts<00:01:40.880> to<00:01:41.060> move

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
to that feel so if she starts to move

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.120 
to that feel so if she starts to move
away<00:01:41.420> and<00:01:41.810> she<00:01:41.990> softens<00:01:42.409> her<00:01:42.500> head<00:01:42.710> as<00:01:42.950> you're

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
away and she softens her head as you're

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.020 
away and she softens her head as you're
pushing<00:01:43.570> on<00:01:44.570> there<00:01:44.899> she<00:01:45.560> will<00:01:46.030> understand

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
pushing on there she will understand

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.389 
pushing on there she will understand
that<00:01:47.439> she<00:01:48.439> needs<00:01:48.470> to<00:01:48.770> yield<00:01:49.009> with<00:01:49.280> his

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
that she needs to yield with his

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.310 
that she needs to yield with his
pressure<00:01:49.640> on<00:01:49.820> her<00:01:49.909> head<00:01:50.149> just<00:01:50.840> like<00:01:50.990> she<00:01:51.170> had

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
pressure on her head just like she had

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.969 
pressure on her head just like she had
to<00:01:51.439> yield<00:01:51.649> for<00:01:51.950> her<00:01:52.130> and<00:01:52.490> all<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:53.540> other

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
to yield for her and all the other

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.440 
to yield for her and all the other
maneuvers<00:01:54.979> we've<00:01:55.310> been<00:01:55.490> doing<00:01:55.729> all<00:01:55.820> that<00:01:55.970> so<00:01:56.420> I

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
maneuvers we've been doing all that so I

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.120 
maneuvers we've been doing all that so I
just<00:01:56.659> press<00:01:57.079> on<00:01:57.259> the<00:01:57.350> side<00:01:57.530> of<00:01:57.680> her<00:01:57.740> head<00:01:57.920> she's

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
just press on the side of her head she's

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.789 
just press on the side of her head she's
yielded<00:01:58.520> I'll<00:01:58.640> take<00:01:58.850> my<00:01:59.060> hand<00:01:59.270> away<00:01:59.740> if<00:02:00.740> she

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
yielded I'll take my hand away if she

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.440 
yielded I'll take my hand away if she
does<00:02:01.130> yield<00:02:01.430> it<00:02:01.670> so<00:02:01.820> that<00:02:01.939> I<00:02:02.000> can<00:02:02.060> show<00:02:02.360> her

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
does yield it so that I can show her

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.030 
does yield it so that I can show her
that<00:02:02.570> that's<00:02:02.689> what<00:02:02.930> I<00:02:02.960> want<00:02:03.259> by<00:02:03.469> rewarding<00:02:03.920> her

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
that that's what I want by rewarding her

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.510 
that that's what I want by rewarding her
too

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
too

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.359 
too
release<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:04.970> pressure<00:02:05.210> but<00:02:05.840> upward<00:02:06.140> pressure

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
release the pressure but upward pressure

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:07.780 
release the pressure but upward pressure
take<00:02:07.369> it<00:02:07.520> away

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
take it away

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.020 
take it away
a<00:02:08.560> few<00:02:09.560> more<00:02:09.679> times<00:02:09.920> with<00:02:10.160> that<00:02:10.369> put<00:02:10.789> a<00:02:10.819> bit<00:02:11.000> of

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
a few more times with that put a bit of

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.940 
a few more times with that put a bit of
pressure<00:02:11.120> on<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.569> side<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:12.349> knots<00:02:12.560> on<00:02:12.739> these

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
pressure on the side the knots on these

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.410 
pressure on the side the knots on these
rope<00:02:13.190> holders<00:02:13.550> are<00:02:13.640> quite<00:02:13.849> handy<00:02:14.239> and

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
rope holders are quite handy and

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.949 
rope holders are quite handy and
strategically<00:02:15.319> placed<00:02:15.709> to<00:02:16.540> allow<00:02:17.540> for<00:02:17.840> that

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
strategically placed to allow for that

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.600 
strategically placed to allow for that
pressure<00:02:18.260> to<00:02:18.410> come<00:02:18.590> on<00:02:18.770> when<00:02:18.980> it's<00:02:19.130> needed<00:02:19.310> but

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
pressure to come on when it's needed but

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.850 
pressure to come on when it's needed but
not<00:02:19.760> too<00:02:20.090> harsh<00:02:20.390> if<00:02:20.750> she's<00:02:21.260> willing<00:02:21.440> to<00:02:21.650> yield

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
not too harsh if she's willing to yield

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.100 
not too harsh if she's willing to yield
so<00:02:22.459> just<00:02:22.730> push<00:02:22.910> away<00:02:23.060> with<00:02:23.390> that<00:02:23.630> side<00:02:23.930> of<00:02:23.959> the

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
so just push away with that side of the

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.940 
so just push away with that side of the
whole<00:02:24.290> trip<00:02:26.050> try<00:02:27.050> not<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.349> take<00:02:27.470> your<00:02:27.620> hand<00:02:27.800> off

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
whole trip try not to take your hand off

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.970 
whole trip try not to take your hand off
so<00:02:28.250> she<00:02:28.849> doesn't<00:02:29.150> learn<00:02:29.239> to<00:02:29.480> just<00:02:29.690> escape<00:02:30.650> the

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
so she doesn't learn to just escape the

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.949 
so she doesn't learn to just escape the
pressure<00:02:31.220> so<00:02:31.819> I'm<00:02:31.880> just<00:02:32.090> pushing<00:02:32.269> she<00:02:32.750> sealed

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
pressure so I'm just pushing she sealed

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.840 
pressure so I'm just pushing she sealed
it<00:02:33.200> a<00:02:33.290> little<00:02:33.440> bit<00:02:33.680> I'll<00:02:33.800> take<00:02:34.010> my<00:02:34.130> hand<00:02:34.340> away<00:02:34.430> a

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
it a little bit I'll take my hand away a

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.090 

few<00:02:37.850> more<00:02:38.120> of<00:02:38.209> those<00:02:38.360> you<00:02:39.319> just<00:02:39.470> keep<00:02:39.890> it<00:02:40.010> all

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
few more of those you just keep it all

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.180 
few more of those you just keep it all
on<00:02:40.160> this<00:02:41.140> method<00:02:42.140> just<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.769> give<00:02:42.920> you<00:02:43.010> to

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
on this method just to give you to

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.940 
on this method just to give you to
soften<00:02:43.760> her<00:02:44.030> face<00:02:44.569> and<00:02:45.730> yield<00:02:46.730> a<00:02:47.769> little<00:02:48.769> bit

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
soften her face and yield a little bit

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.190 
soften her face and yield a little bit
she's<00:02:49.310> objecting<00:02:49.819> so<00:02:50.060> I'm<00:02:50.630> just<00:02:50.900> putting<00:02:51.170> a

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
she's objecting so I'm just putting a

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.360 
she's objecting so I'm just putting a
little<00:02:51.380> bit<00:02:51.500> of<00:02:51.620> pressure<00:02:51.769> there<00:02:51.920> she<00:02:52.280> is

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
little bit of pressure there she is

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.870 
little bit of pressure there she is
actually<00:02:52.880> leaning<00:02:53.480> on<00:02:53.600> it<00:02:53.780> I<00:02:54.530> just<00:02:55.370> want<00:02:55.700> her

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
actually leaning on it I just want her

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.979 
actually leaning on it I just want her
to<00:02:55.930> stop<00:02:56.930> from<00:02:57.080> her<00:02:57.200> face<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:58.660> yield<00:02:59.660> she's

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
to stop from her face and yield she's

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.280 
to stop from her face and yield she's
actually<00:03:00.319> holding<00:03:00.650> on<00:03:00.980> leaning<00:03:01.549> on<00:03:01.700> me<00:03:02.290> not

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
actually holding on leaning on me not

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.370 
actually holding on leaning on me not
not<00:03:03.650> sure<00:03:03.680> what<00:03:04.190> to<00:03:04.310> do<00:03:04.459> so<00:03:04.989> I'll<00:03:05.989> just<00:03:06.170> keep

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
not sure what to do so I'll just keep

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.660 
not sure what to do so I'll just keep
putting<00:03:06.739> that<00:03:06.950> little<00:03:07.190> bit<00:03:07.280> of<00:03:07.370> pressure<00:03:07.549> on

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
putting that little bit of pressure on

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.030 
putting that little bit of pressure on
the<00:03:07.970> air

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
the air

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.060 
the air
she<00:03:10.040> hasn't<00:03:10.250> understood<00:03:11.120> what<00:03:11.480> to<00:03:11.600> do<00:03:11.750> yet<00:03:12.019> so

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
she hasn't understood what to do yet so

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.500 
she hasn't understood what to do yet so
I'll<00:03:13.070> just<00:03:13.250> put<00:03:13.459> a<00:03:13.489> little<00:03:13.579> bit<00:03:13.730> more<00:03:13.790> on<00:03:14.150> not

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
I'll just put a little bit more on not

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.880 
I'll just put a little bit more on not
not<00:03:14.780> losing<00:03:14.989> her<00:03:15.230> but<00:03:15.380> just<00:03:15.560> a<00:03:15.620> little<00:03:15.739> bit

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
not losing her but just a little bit

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.840 
not losing her but just a little bit
more<00:03:17.650> yeah<00:03:18.650> she<00:03:19.010> just<00:03:19.190> softened<00:03:19.519> to<00:03:19.640> face<00:03:19.820> a

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
more yeah she just softened to face a

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.740 
more yeah she just softened to face a
little<00:03:20.120> bit<00:03:21.250> it's<00:03:22.250> not<00:03:22.370> a<00:03:22.489> lot<00:03:23.269> that<00:03:23.299> you<00:03:23.570> need

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
little bit it's not a lot that you need

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.620 
little bit it's not a lot that you need
to<00:03:23.840> do<00:03:23.989> with<00:03:24.170> this<00:03:24.320> but<00:03:24.950> just<00:03:25.190> just<00:03:25.940> to<00:03:26.120> show

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
to do with this but just just to show

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.300 
to do with this but just just to show
her<00:03:26.870> not<00:03:27.140> to<00:03:27.320> turn<00:03:27.500> her<00:03:27.590> body<00:03:27.769> just<00:03:27.859> to<00:03:28.130> turn

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
her not to turn her body just to turn

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.430 
her not to turn her body just to turn
her<00:03:28.430> face<00:03:28.609> to<00:03:28.880> yield<00:03:29.120> there<00:03:29.450> she<00:03:29.930> yielded<00:03:30.260> to<00:03:30.410> a

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
her face to yield there she yielded to a

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.509 
her face to yield there she yielded to a
little<00:03:30.680> bit<00:03:30.739> of<00:03:30.859> pressure<00:03:31.040> on<00:03:31.160> the<00:03:31.250> side<00:03:31.489> of

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
little bit of pressure on the side of

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.140 
little bit of pressure on the side of
her<00:03:31.700> face<00:03:31.810> I<00:03:32.810> want<00:03:33.230> to<00:03:33.290> prepare<00:03:33.590> her<00:03:33.890> for<00:03:34.150> being

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
her face I want to prepare her for being

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:42.699 
her face I want to prepare her for being
um<00:03:35.390> having<00:03:36.170> a<00:03:36.230> hold<00:03:36.410> a<00:03:36.500> bit<00:03:36.650> used<00:03:41.290> not<00:03:42.290> liking

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
um having a hold a bit used not liking

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.590 
um having a hold a bit used not liking
it<00:03:42.799> but<00:03:42.920> we'll<00:03:43.100> try<00:03:43.250> again<00:03:43.400> come<00:03:43.790> on<00:03:43.880> just

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
it but we'll try again come on just

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.479 
it but we'll try again come on just
there<00:03:45.260> she's<00:03:45.590> stopping<00:03:45.799> to<00:03:45.980> face<00:03:46.160> away<00:03:46.340> from

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
there she's stopping to face away from

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:47.920 
there she's stopping to face away from
that<00:03:46.850> pressure<00:03:47.090> I<00:03:47.209> was<00:03:47.269> putting<00:03:47.359> on<00:03:47.690> there

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
that pressure I was putting on there

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.229 
that pressure I was putting on there
just<00:03:48.709> one<00:03:48.889> more<00:03:49.100> just<00:03:49.489> to<00:03:49.639> show<00:03:49.670> you<00:03:52.060> this<00:03:53.060> on

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
just one more just to show you this on

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.940 
just one more just to show you this on
the<00:03:53.359> side<00:03:55.120> here<00:03:56.120> she's<00:03:56.389> given<00:03:56.690> I<00:03:57.350> can<00:03:57.560> start

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
the side here she's given I can start

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.479 
the side here she's given I can start
leading<00:03:58.190> her<00:03:58.489> more<00:03:58.850> from<00:03:59.389> the<00:03:59.510> halter<00:03:59.840> now

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
leading her more from the halter now
