00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello and welcome too 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.500
 back to the bay and this time on 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.000
 Nietzsche dot org 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.809
 and there are a few small ones 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.089
 changes to bay, that is 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.850
 I'm here now next to the ball something 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.580
 a little less, other chess occurs 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.820
 variants play so for example 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:29.519
 robber chess or there is also king 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:31.260
 of the hill horde is new on how 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.730
 test.org I will do that again 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.390
 I will start playing now though 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.590
 with 860 respectively chess960 and 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.770
 then I will be more through the 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.899
 work through variations 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.460
 First of all, I will be here a lot here too 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.050
 has not done this except that 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.180
 my team is now in the center and me 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:55.129
 I would like to prefer these farmers 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.129
 perform and possibly 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.059
 they could yes I think so 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.590
 it does not work 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.590
 I'll just take him out and as well 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.270
 then I try with four more 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.360
 I forgot something to work on 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.850
 mention 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.780
 something important I should have now 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.979
 not so as I said several variants 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:29.140
 different times and bullet 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.170
 Please be a little less concerned here 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:36.340
 made at bay and then i look 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.470
 how it works and as I said on song 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:43.030
 test.org because here we still came 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:45.880
 best play with the variants 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:51.179
 I have not seen capcom yet 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:58.060
 at 624 I do not believe so 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:02:00.280
 So you can rorschach and the game 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.409
 the sharia variants 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.409
 I am not registered and 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.129
 otherwise I will concentrate 

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:11.129
 now at stake 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:21.069
 i think i have some de i 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:23.379
 I want to give this tree and continue 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.560
 talk through and maybe yes in 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:28.000
 future with how much possible in 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.989
 connection with this runner here behind 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.400
 this is definitely a matron 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.030
 At the same time I would springer this 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.030
 attack 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.540
 and the only thing he could do 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.040
 Maybe take it out of here 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.780
 and he would be the springer with it 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.560
 covered that I have yet seen but 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.269
 this here 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.489
 this construction and so we really had in 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:59.049
 my hands are played and i think here 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:01.030
 I'll be the horde after a while 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.409
 try is already the dull 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.409
 unless I forgot something 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:08.590
 a bit like me change short 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:10.450
 checkerboard horde though on help 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.269
 chess variant I personally still 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:17.019
 did not know and a bit funny 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.819
 from so much before already s-Bahn and 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.120
 Welcome back this is the horde 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:25.629
 I will explain the rules for a moment 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:28.780
 black must be white matt and white 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:30.659
 must beat all farmers that is the 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.840
 great story behind this variant 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:36.459
 and now I'm trying it out 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.200
 to get my farmers moving 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.470
 I can do something else bad too 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:46.090
 Of course it is a sparvariant one 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:48.519
 I do not have a king but that's why 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.909
 it does not work it is I think for white 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:53.430
 a bigger challenge here 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:55.659
 get through 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.909
 you have to sacrifice in any case though 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:59.859
 sacrifice and possibly try with the 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:02.680
 lady on the ground to come if 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:04.959
 I have a gap somewhere 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.190
 even managed a few times but 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.379
 I am still a few times miserable 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.000
 failed 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:12.879
 good and of course I'm going to 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.579
 center in let that go a bit 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:17.019
 closed 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:19.019
 So my tactics as whiter than me 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.250
 which may ever betrayed is 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.860
 I open the door as soon as possible 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.870
 hair and the a line with it my towers 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.949
 ever have free lane and then 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.630
 I try with springer and runner 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:34.229
 somehow beat a path to 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.460
 then to bring the lady into play 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.610
 Of course that's easier said than 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.610
 done 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:50.270
 but however it works as I said I'm 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.270
 the opinion black should here 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.420
 hardly have problems or the larger ones 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:03.120
 Opportunities and I have them, however 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:05.410
 pretty good in a twig 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.940
 you can start here now 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.880
 open I think I would give them that 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:13.930
 also guess otherwise i play in g5 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:18.150
 and this farmer is covered she can 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.150
 I can hardly wait to move 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:27.820
 So runs beats springer then beats 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.860
 perhaps all right he even takes the 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.590
 Jump the hand that means I want to 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.910
 but here this construction cover even more 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:39.130
 otherwise he might sacrifice again here 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:41.370
 in and of course that's not mine 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.370
 aim 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.800
 Too fast to go on well last 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.900
 Winter the farmers but I still have 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.320
 enough on the field I have to stop that 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.130
 Keep sheep together 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:06:01.120
 time actually is good too 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:06:01.810
 From here I will go in this direction 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.790
 beat 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:09.660
 now he can open here on the 5 that 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:11.770
 I would recommend him to me 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:15.540
 he has to get through somehow 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.540
 lady ever active the tower too 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:24.850
 listen to that is interesting 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:29.660
 Well, well , I do not take it and me 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:33.410
 fork now now the hard 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:35.050
 Figures on the field I'll believe 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.190
 I do not take 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.750
 otherwise, the lady will come here 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.490
 the basic series then looks real 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.830
 problematic for that reason let me 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.990
 I that again it is from the 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.759
 is interesting because I do not think so 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.870
 because it was a good move and he 

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:51.530
 also has no time 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:55.009
 shell otherwise it will again 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:57.800
 it can be really exciting 

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:59.060
 estimate for offenders too rarely 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.960
 we played one more here 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.960
 offer revanche 

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:06.169
 now I would have made a mistake 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.610
 now would have taken out with the lady here 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:10.780
 can 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:16.419
 So it's really hard 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:16.419
 to have an eye on every farmer 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.530
 well maybe try it yourself 

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:24.590
 is actually quite a fun variation 

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:27.110
 and why not you can do something 

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:30.680
 Try something different than just the normal one 

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:32.150
 chess ok and then i would say if 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:37.330
 I see the video here, we'll see you 

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:37.330
 next time at the new bay 3
