of the yarn this part is the bottom

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.680 
of the yarn this part is the bottom
there's<00:00:38.250> no<00:00:38.399> real<00:00:38.610> way<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.760> crochet<00:00:39.210> into<00:00:39.540> this

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
there's no real way to crochet into this

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.650 
there's no real way to crochet into this
you<00:00:40.140> can<00:00:40.320> only<00:00:40.440> crochet<00:00:40.950> into<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.190> top<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.730> to

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
you can only crochet into the top and to

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.180 
you can only crochet into the top and to
make<00:00:42.809> your<00:00:42.960> necklace<00:00:43.290> more<00:00:43.469> secure<00:00:43.890> we<00:00:44.010> want

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
make your necklace more secure we want

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.459 
make your necklace more secure we want
to<00:00:44.280> skip<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:44.700> first<00:00:44.969> space<00:00:45.390> we're<00:00:46.289> going<00:00:46.410> to

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
to skip this first space we're going to

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.709 
to skip this first space we're going to
insert<00:00:46.800> our<00:00:46.950> hook<00:00:46.980> right<00:00:47.340> here<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.090> we're

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
insert our hook right here and we're

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:49.729 
insert our hook right here and we're
basically<00:00:48.989> what<00:00:49.230> we're<00:00:49.320> going<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.500> do<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.710> a

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
basically what we're going to do is a

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.299 
basically what we're going to do is a
chain<00:00:50.070> but<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.399> skip<00:00:50.879> one<00:00:51.180> in<00:00:51.360> between<00:00:51.660> each<00:00:51.690> one

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
chain but I skip one in between each one

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.850 
chain but I skip one in between each one
so<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.399> stick<00:00:53.640> your<00:00:53.730> hook<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:54.090> there<00:00:54.710> pull<00:00:55.710> it

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
so you stick your hook in there pull it

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.360 
so you stick your hook in there pull it
pull<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.460> through<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:57.030> counts<00:00:57.329> as<00:00:57.390> one<00:00:57.690> chain

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
pull it through that counts as one chain

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.970 
pull it through that counts as one chain
and<00:00:59.690> every<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:00.840> often<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.170> don't<00:01:01.500> skip<00:01:01.770> one

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
and every so often you don't skip one

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.740 
and every so often you don't skip one
and<00:01:02.309> sometimes<00:01:02.489> maybe<00:01:02.850> skip<00:01:03.149> two<00:01:03.329> or<00:01:03.449> three

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
and sometimes maybe skip two or three

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.899 
and sometimes maybe skip two or three
every<00:01:04.710> time<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.010> change<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.400> way<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.580> skips

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
every time you change the way it skips

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.609 
every time you change the way it skips
it<00:01:06.150> affects<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.810> way<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.290> ruffles<00:01:09.590> so<00:01:10.590> I

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
it affects the way that it ruffles so I

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.380 
it affects the way that it ruffles so I
didn't<00:01:11.130> do<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> slips<00:01:11.580> not<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.939> start<00:01:12.180> as<00:01:12.299> you

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
didn't do a slips not to start as you

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.800 
didn't do a slips not to start as you
saw<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.600> just<00:01:12.900> kind<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.110> inserted<00:01:13.590> my<00:01:13.710> hook<00:01:13.890> and

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
saw I just kind of inserted my hook and

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.480 
saw I just kind of inserted my hook and
I'm<00:01:15.810> going<00:01:16.200> through<00:01:16.409> let<00:01:16.710> me<00:01:16.799> spread<00:01:17.220> out<00:01:17.369> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
I'm going through let me spread out the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.730 
I'm going through let me spread out the
yarn<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.909> will<00:01:18.180> try<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.450> twirl<00:01:18.840> on<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.560> that

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
yarn it will try to twirl on you so that

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:30.890 
yarn it will try to twirl on you so that
can<00:01:19.890> be<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.009> little<00:01:20.220> hard<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.610> deal<00:01:20.729> with

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.870 

so<00:01:31.530> now<00:01:31.650> I'm<00:01:31.710> going<00:01:31.800> to<00:01:31.950> skip<00:01:32.100> two<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.640> this

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
so now I'm going to skip two so this

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.100 
so now I'm going to skip two so this
would<00:01:33.090> be<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.300> one<00:01:33.420> if<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.630> wasn't<00:01:33.810> skipping

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
would be the one if I wasn't skipping

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.320 
would be the one if I wasn't skipping
skipping<00:01:35.040> one<00:01:35.310> I'd<00:01:35.460> go<00:01:35.610> here<00:01:35.880> but<00:01:36.060> since<00:01:36.210> I

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
skipping one I'd go here but since I

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.700 
skipping one I'd go here but since I
want<00:01:36.510> to<00:01:36.570> skip<00:01:36.750> 2<00:01:36.930> i'm<00:01:37.080> going<00:01:37.230> to<00:01:37.320> go<00:01:37.380> into<00:01:37.530> this

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
want to skip 2 i'm going to go into this

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.570 
want to skip 2 i'm going to go into this
third<00:01:38.070> hole<00:01:38.310> as<00:01:39.800> you<00:01:40.800> can<00:01:40.950> see<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.280> makes<00:01:41.430> a

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
third hole as you can see that makes a

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.030 
third hole as you can see that makes a
really<00:01:41.820> rough<00:01:42.150> Lee<00:01:42.360> spot<00:01:42.630> right<00:01:42.900> there<00:01:43.040> versus

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
really rough Lee spot right there versus

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.350 
really rough Lee spot right there versus
right<00:01:44.190> here<00:01:44.430> it's<00:01:44.550> not<00:01:44.670> quite<00:01:44.880> as<00:01:45.060> roughly

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
right here it's not quite as roughly

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.940 
right here it's not quite as roughly
this<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:45.900> kind<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.170> what<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.410> looks<00:01:46.590> like<00:01:46.740> it

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
this is kind of what it looks like it

00:01:46.950 --> 00:02:04.570 
this is kind of what it looks like it
will<00:01:47.070> start<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.340> twist<00:01:47.640> like<00:01:47.820> this

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580
