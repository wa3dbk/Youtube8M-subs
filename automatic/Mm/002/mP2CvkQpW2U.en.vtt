00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.500
 I'm Oliver. 

00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:08.500
 I Emily. 

00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:10.500
 RELATIONSHIPS ARE COMPLIED 

00:00:10.501 --> 00:00:12.500
 So this would never come to my mind. 

00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:15.500
 Would you like to sit next to your girlfriend? 

00:00:17.501 --> 00:00:20.500
 Because even though the two fit together, ... 

00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:24.000
 Boy like me, with work, house, car, 

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:27.000
 do you think I have a problem finding someone who falls in love with me? 

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:28.500
 You'll have a big problem. 

00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:31.000
 ... even if ... 

00:00:33.501 --> 00:00:34.500
 ... that is a good mood ... 

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:36.500
 Everything will be fine, 

00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:39.000
 if you're not wearing that orange sweatshirt. 

00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:40.500
 Do not call me again. 

00:00:40.501 --> 00:00:42.000
 ... and the environment ... 

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:43.000
 Don't move, okay? 

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.000
 You're kidding me now. 

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:46.500
 ... is magical. 

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:50.500
 Could I talk to you for a moment? 

00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:52.500
 This is a national park. 

00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:56.500
 But the timing ... 

00:00:56.501 --> 00:00:58.500
 I'm moving, I got a job in San Francisco. 

00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:01.000
 I just barely like you and you go away. 

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:03.000
 ... means everything. 

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:06.500
 How could I be here for her when I haven't decided yet. 

00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:10.000
 You'll be much better off without him. It's over. 

00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:12.000
 I have to ask you something. 

00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:14.000
 What was my first loss? In New York. 

00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:17.000
 Second loss, I didn't learn to play guitar. 

00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:19.500
 And third, I was born in a bad sign. 

00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:20.500
 So what was my first loss? 

00:01:20.501 --> 00:01:21.500
 I took the first step. 

00:01:21.501 --> 00:01:24.000
 Remember? 

00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:31.200
 I may have been 6 years late, I want to correct my first loss. 

00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:33.000
 I'm engaged. 

00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:38.000

 AMANDA PEET 

00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:46.500
 TOUCHSTONE PICTURES AND BEACON PICTURES states 

00:01:46.501 --> 00:01:50.000
 If you're not willing to do something stupid, you don't deserve to be in love. 

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:52.200
 "I really need you, 

00:01:52.201 --> 00:01:55.000
 these are my words, I promise you 

00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:58.700
 when you breathe, I want to be your air 

00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:02.000
 still together, I'll be " 

00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:06.500
 You're on nothing! 

00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:07.500
 SOMETHING LIKE LOVE 

00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:09.500
 The story of two people ... 

00:02:09.501 --> 00:02:10.800
 I have to call Oliver. 

00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:11.800
 He is getting married. 

00:02:11.801 --> 00:02:15.000
 ... who do not know what they are facing. ------------------------------ 3fa63e8a44e4--
