wanted to give you guys some tips on how

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.490 
wanted to give you guys some tips on how
to<00:00:13.100> get<00:00:13.430> the<00:00:13.670> first<00:00:13.910> power<00:00:14.269> source<00:00:14.630> after<00:00:14.960> you

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
to get the first power source after you

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.159 
to get the first power source after you
exit<00:00:15.980> the<00:00:16.070> animus<00:00:16.550> towards<00:00:17.480> the<00:00:17.630> end<00:00:17.839> of

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:18.169 
exit the animus towards the end of

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:20.950 
exit the animus towards the end of
sequence<00:00:18.650> 5<00:00:18.980> and<00:00:19.339> right<00:00:19.490> before<00:00:19.699> sequence<00:00:20.659> 6

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
sequence 5 and right before sequence 6

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.929 
sequence 5 and right before sequence 6
now<00:00:21.169> ain't<00:00:21.890> nothing<00:00:22.070> too<00:00:22.189> much<00:00:22.310> special<00:00:22.759> about

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
now ain't nothing too much special about

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:24.519 
now ain't nothing too much special about
this<00:00:23.179> but<00:00:23.419> the<00:00:23.509> reason<00:00:23.839> I<00:00:23.929> do<00:00:23.989> and<00:00:24.289> this<00:00:24.380> is

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
this but the reason I do and this is

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.710 
this but the reason I do and this is
because<00:00:24.859> I<00:00:25.099> had<00:00:25.609> a<00:00:25.640> little<00:00:25.849> difficulty<00:00:26.300> doing

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
because I had a little difficulty doing

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.839 
because I had a little difficulty doing
it<00:00:26.839> and<00:00:26.989> I<00:00:27.619> was<00:00:27.649> stuck<00:00:27.980> at<00:00:28.130> certain<00:00:28.399> points<00:00:28.730> so

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
it and I was stuck at certain points so

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:30.220 
it and I was stuck at certain points so
I<00:00:28.880> figured<00:00:29.239> let<00:00:29.359> me<00:00:29.449> do<00:00:29.539> a<00:00:29.569> video<00:00:29.839> in<00:00:30.079> case

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
I figured let me do a video in case

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.139 
I figured let me do a video in case
other<00:00:30.529> people<00:00:30.919> were<00:00:31.039> stucked<00:00:31.310> as<00:00:31.489> well<00:00:31.669> -<00:00:31.939> I

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
other people were stucked as well - I

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:33.970 
other people were stucked as well - I
won't<00:00:32.599> be<00:00:32.720> doing<00:00:32.930> any<00:00:33.140> commentary<00:00:33.800> throughout

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
won't be doing any commentary throughout

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.310 
won't be doing any commentary throughout
the<00:00:34.789> video<00:00:35.059> for<00:00:35.300> the<00:00:35.359> most<00:00:35.570> part<00:00:35.870> because<00:00:36.199> you

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
the video for the most part because you

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.529 
the video for the most part because you
just<00:00:36.530> follow<00:00:36.739> the<00:00:36.829> path<00:00:37.160> but<00:00:37.940> after<00:00:38.269> it's<00:00:38.390> over

00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:38.539 
just follow the path but after it's over

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:39.910 
just follow the path but after it's over
we're<00:00:38.930> gonna<00:00:39.050> talk<00:00:39.320> a<00:00:39.350> little<00:00:39.590> bit<00:00:39.800> about

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
we're gonna talk a little bit about

00:00:39.920 --> 00:01:47.639 
we're gonna talk a little bit about
using<00:00:40.489> the<00:00:40.640> power<00:00:40.820> source<00:00:41.239> so<00:00:42.050> here<00:00:42.710> it<00:00:42.800> is

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:02:55.530

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
Jesus forgot the bright side no security

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.680 
Jesus forgot the bright side no security
to<00:02:58.780> worry<00:02:59.019> about

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690

to<00:04:54.910> talk<00:04:55.120> through<00:04:55.360> that<00:04:55.449> video<00:04:55.600> because<00:04:56.110> it's

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
to talk through that video because it's

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.439

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
after you get the power cube once you do

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.260 
after you get the power cube once you do

here<00:05:11.110> you<00:05:11.320> could<00:05:11.590> actually<00:05:11.620> use<00:05:12.340> the<00:05:12.789> power

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
here you could actually use the power

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.170 
here you could actually use the power
source<00:05:13.930> on<00:05:14.289> one<00:05:14.949> of<00:05:14.979> these<00:05:15.130> terminals<00:05:15.460> and<00:05:15.880> you

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.120 
source on one of these terminals and you
will<00:05:16.300> get<00:05:16.509> a<00:05:16.539> little<00:05:16.690> cutscene<00:05:17.139> I<00:05:17.470> took<00:05:18.010> out

will get a little cutscene I took out

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.670 
will get a little cutscene I took out
the<00:05:18.280> cutscenes<00:05:18.699> because<00:05:19.389> um<00:05:19.570> you<00:05:20.560> know<00:05:20.650> I

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
the cutscenes because um you know I

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.170 
the cutscenes because um you know I
don't<00:05:20.860> really<00:05:21.010> like<00:05:21.280> to<00:05:21.400> show<00:05:21.550> cutscenes<00:05:22.030> for

somewhere<00:05:28.210> where<00:05:29.199> you<00:05:29.289> could<00:05:29.470> go<00:05:29.620> and<00:05:29.729> watch

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
somewhere where you could go and watch

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:33.090 
somewhere where you could go and watch
them<00:05:30.910> in<00:05:31.060> all<00:05:31.330> their<00:05:31.510> beautiful<00:05:32.020> glory<00:05:32.320> so

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
them in all their beautiful glory so

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.860 
them in all their beautiful glory so
just<00:05:33.520> head<00:05:33.699> along<00:05:34.030> this<00:05:34.240> path<00:05:34.510> nevertheless

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
just head along this path nevertheless

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.879 
just head along this path nevertheless
and<00:05:39.300> once<00:05:40.300> you<00:05:40.419> do<00:05:40.599> reach<00:05:40.870> the<00:05:41.110> top<00:05:41.380> part<00:05:41.650> here

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:41.889 
and once you do reach the top part here

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:43.170 
and once you do reach the top part here
I<00:05:41.919> didn't<00:05:42.220> even<00:05:42.250> know<00:05:42.490> initially<00:05:42.699> that<00:05:43.060> you

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
I didn't even know initially that you

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.080 
I didn't even know initially that you
could<00:05:43.360> do<00:05:43.479> this<00:05:43.630> and<00:05:44.580> if<00:05:45.580> you<00:05:45.669> hadn't<00:05:45.970> done

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
could do this and if you hadn't done

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.730 
could do this and if you hadn't done
this<00:05:46.180> before<00:05:46.389> you<00:05:46.690> could<00:05:46.840> exit<00:05:47.259> the<00:05:47.349> Animus

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
this before you could exit the Animus

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.140 
this before you could exit the Animus
and<00:05:47.949> I<00:05:48.190> think<00:05:48.460> you<00:05:48.580> should<00:05:48.729> be<00:05:48.820> able<00:05:48.910> to<00:05:49.030> do

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
and I think you should be able to do

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.159 
and I think you should be able to do
this<00:05:49.300> we<00:05:50.050> can<00:05:50.199> get<00:05:50.289> one<00:05:50.530> cutscene<00:05:50.949> right<00:05:51.190> there

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
this we can get one cutscene right there

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:57.120 
this we can get one cutscene right there
and<00:05:53.169> then<00:05:53.320> we<00:05:53.440> can<00:05:53.620> get<00:05:53.800> another<00:05:54.220> cutscene<00:05:56.130> and

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
and then we can get another cutscene and

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.339 
and then we can get another cutscene and
so<00:05:57.400> you<00:05:57.880> use<00:05:58.030> it<00:05:58.060> on<00:05:58.270> that<00:05:58.449> terminal<00:05:58.720> and<00:05:59.110> call

00:05:59.339 --> 00:05:59.349 
so you use it on that terminal and call

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:01.409 
so you use it on that terminal and call
it<00:05:59.500> a<00:05:59.560> day<00:05:59.639> so<00:06:00.639> folks<00:06:00.880> that's<00:06:01.090> pretty<00:06:01.270> much

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
it a day so folks that's pretty much

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:03.330
