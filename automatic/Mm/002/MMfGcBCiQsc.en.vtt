said if you're a newcomer to the devil
may<00:00:32.099> cry<00:00:32.310> series<00:00:32.340> Nero<00:00:33.030> just<00:00:33.360> might<00:00:33.570> be<00:00:33.840> the

may cry series Nero just might be the

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.290 
may cry series Nero just might be the
character<00:00:34.470> for<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.800> he's<00:00:35.730> designed<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.210> be

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
character for you he's designed to be

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.850 
character for you he's designed to be
kind<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.540> an<00:00:36.660> entry<00:00:36.900> point<00:00:36.930> character<00:00:37.590> as<00:00:37.740> you

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
kind of an entry point character as you

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.500 
kind of an entry point character as you
can<00:00:37.980> see<00:00:38.220> even<00:00:38.610> visually<00:00:39.030> he's<00:00:39.180> kind<00:00:39.420> of

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
can see even visually he's kind of

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.600 
can see even visually he's kind of
reminiscent<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.140> Dante<00:00:40.620> but<00:00:41.070> his<00:00:41.160> mechanics

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
reminiscent of Dante but his mechanics

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.160 
reminiscent of Dante but his mechanics
are<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> little<00:00:41.910> bit<00:00:42.090> less<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.450> swallow<00:00:42.780> all<00:00:43.020> at

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
are a little bit less to swallow all at

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.500 
are a little bit less to swallow all at
once<00:00:43.380> that<00:00:44.220> said<00:00:44.580> there's<00:00:44.850> plenty<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.150> depth

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
once that said there's plenty of depth

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.060 
once that said there's plenty of depth
to<00:00:45.630> be<00:00:45.810> uncovered<00:00:46.110> with<00:00:46.350> Nero<00:00:46.590> he's<00:00:46.860> got<00:00:47.040> a

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
to be uncovered with Nero he's got a

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.040 
to be uncovered with Nero he's got a
handful<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.520> very<00:00:47.760> interesting<00:00:48.330> combat

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
handful of very interesting combat

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.720 
handful of very interesting combat
mechanics<00:00:49.200> which<00:00:49.740> I'll<00:00:49.890> introduce<00:00:50.100> right<00:00:50.490> now

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
mechanics which I'll introduce right now

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.540 
mechanics which I'll introduce right now
so<00:00:51.660> first<00:00:51.900> off<00:00:52.080> euro<00:00:52.440> has<00:00:52.620> his<00:00:52.890> sword<00:00:53.220> which<00:00:53.430> is

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
so first off euro has his sword which is

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.700 
so first off euro has his sword which is
called<00:00:53.700> the<00:00:53.790> Red<00:00:54.090> Queen<00:00:54.480> now<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.380> is<00:00:55.530> not

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
called the Red Queen now this is not

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.380 
called the Red Queen now this is not
your<00:00:55.860> ordinary<00:00:55.920> sword<00:00:56.700> it<00:00:56.850> actually<00:00:57.210> has<00:00:57.360> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
your ordinary sword it actually has a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.890 
your ordinary sword it actually has a
special<00:00:58.290> ability<00:00:58.380> to<00:00:58.980> be<00:00:59.100> revved<00:00:59.550> if<00:01:00.450> you<00:01:00.690> hold

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
special ability to be revved if you hold

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.560 
special ability to be revved if you hold
l2<00:01:01.110> and<00:01:01.650> as<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.520> can<00:01:02.640> see<00:01:02.670> as<00:01:02.940> I'm<00:01:03.090> pressing<00:01:03.450> l2

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
l2 and as you can see as I'm pressing l2

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.170 
l2 and as you can see as I'm pressing l2
that<00:01:03.990> red<00:01:04.229> gauge<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.739> going<00:01:05.070> up<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:05.970> will

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
that red gauge is going up and this will

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.149 
that red gauge is going up and this will
power<00:01:06.390> up<00:01:06.509> the<00:01:06.780> next<00:01:07.110> attack<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.890> Nero

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
power up the next attack that Nero

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.840 
power up the next attack that Nero
unleashes<00:01:08.789> up<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.929> three<00:01:10.200> levels<00:01:10.590> but<00:01:11.579> as<00:01:11.700> you

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
unleashes up to three levels but as you

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.459 
unleashes up to three levels but as you
can<00:01:11.939> see<00:01:12.179> revving<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.780> sword<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.200> quite<00:01:13.439> a

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:13.469 
can see revving the sword is quite a

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:15.499 
can see revving the sword is quite a
slow<00:01:13.829> action<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.609> actually<00:01:14.759> slows<00:01:15.090> down

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
slow action and it actually slows down

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.719 
slow action and it actually slows down
his<00:01:15.810> walking<00:01:16.590> speed<00:01:16.859> as<00:01:17.009> well<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.490> it's<00:01:17.579> not

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
his walking speed as well so it's not

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.520 
his walking speed as well so it's not
particularly<00:01:18.149> practical<00:01:18.990> for<00:01:19.289> when<00:01:19.409> you're

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
particularly practical for when you're

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.859 
particularly practical for when you're
in<00:01:19.710> battle<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.700> instead<00:01:21.179> you<00:01:21.479> can<00:01:21.600> use<00:01:21.749> an

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
in battle so instead you can use an

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.289 
in battle so instead you can use an
ability<00:01:22.109> called<00:01:22.289> X<00:01:22.799> act<00:01:23.069> and<00:01:23.399> it's<00:01:24.119> upgraded

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
ability called X act and it's upgraded

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.899 
ability called X act and it's upgraded
version<00:01:24.899> max<00:01:25.170> act<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:26.280> reb<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.670> sword

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
version max act to reb the sword

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.120 
version max act to reb the sword
instantaneously<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.170> do<00:01:28.289> that<00:01:28.469> by<00:01:28.649> attacking

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
instantaneously you do that by attacking

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.849 
instantaneously you do that by attacking
and<00:01:29.490> then<00:01:29.609> pressing<00:01:30.119> l2<00:01:30.619> with<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.710> right

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:31.859 
and then pressing l2 with the right

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:33.770 
and then pressing l2 with the right
timing<00:01:32.189> during<00:01:32.609> the<00:01:32.729> attack<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.569> get<00:01:33.689> an

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
timing during the attack you get an

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.020 
timing during the attack you get an
instant<00:01:34.200> Rev<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.649> if<00:01:35.130> you're<00:01:35.280> good<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.999> can

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
instant Rev and if you're good you can

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.179 
instant Rev and if you're good you can
actually<00:01:36.329> Rev<00:01:37.109> all<00:01:37.229> three<00:01:37.530> levels<00:01:37.710> at<00:01:38.009> once

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
actually Rev all three levels at once

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.700 
actually Rev all three levels at once

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
have a charge blade that will power up

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.419 
have a charge blade that will power up

the next attack but if you keep revving
during<00:01:44.670> attacks<00:01:44.969> you<00:01:45.210> can<00:01:45.359> keep<00:01:45.509> your<00:01:45.630> blade

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869
