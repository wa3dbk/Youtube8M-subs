00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.490
 very good to all kids here wright 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.290
 today I bring you a mouse guide os 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.030
 I will comment on the objects that we have to 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.610
 put this champion his skills we 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.050
 we will explain we will also explain the 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.810
 wheels that you have to carry and your 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.970
 masters 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.949
 so let's go to it and let's start 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.720
 in the jungle looking at your skills 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.160
 well now I will explain the 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.860
 reggaeton skills and I'm going to 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.379
 explain to give it more priority in 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.649
 this case is to the w since this 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:42.710
 champion is a champion who defends himself 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.900
 with a basic attack and more than anything 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.420
 power for its for its ferocity or for 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.610
 his fury then let's see start at 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.980
 read the reggaeton passive that says that 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.870
 earn 5 fury points per attack when 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.460
 you have 50 of fury you can make an attack 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.309
 boosted but at the same time it is reduced and 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.379
 it remains in zero also say that if not 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.080
 you attack against nobody and the fury is lowered 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.390
 every two seconds he gets 5 of fury and 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.500
 when renga and when reggaeton has the 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:12.890
 50% less of your life will increase the 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.799
 rage by 50% better explain the 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.900
 the area cursen inflicts damage to 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.900
 allies that enemies that are 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.420
 close to him and earns an equivalent to 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.119
 51 percent of the year inflicted 20% yes 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.729
 it's about champions up to a maximum of 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.990
 50 and when he's in fury his 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:37.860
 damage and the percentage of healing too 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:41.100
 of 100 is 10% worth the w is checked 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:45.869
 a single objective hits twice and 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:48.450
 inflicts 243 damage at level 3 worth more 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.479
 of 50 more than 150 because of its damage 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.700
 attack and stuns the enemy for 0.75 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.789
 seconds 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:00.020
 and when he is in fury with three blows 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:02.090
 inflicts 365 and more attack sleep than 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.780
 it will be 225 percent damage and it stuns 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:09.009
 for a second and a half 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:12.450
 is worth the cut and chop w is a 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.459
 skill that is first only 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.400
 cut is pounced towards a goal 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.690
 inflicting physical damage if you hit 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.640
 gives the possibility to use again 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.830
 that skill called trocear is 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.290
 throws again removes same physical damage 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.720
 but it can be used twice or the 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.730
 first and the second chop and with 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.270
 Fury bonus as it removes more 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.870
 damage removes more damage and reduces the armor 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:40.900
 by 15% for four seconds worth 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.510
 the last of benetton 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.239
 it is surrounded like of energies during 15 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:50.439
 seconds it increases your life at level 1 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:54.670
 300 inflicts 40 in the magic year in area 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:57.340
 and earn 5 fury per second 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.860
 Ok now I will explain the attacks 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.030
 against against minions or clips we're going to 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.830
 start with w 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.250
 as you can see is inflicted only 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:09.670
 target and remove the damage that I told you 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.290
 before 243 at level 3 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.540
 as soon as you are seeing that you are 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.160
 generating 5 of fury for each blow that 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.830
 I have now has fury activated and 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.310
 use the w I would seek the both 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.350
 a hundred of life with the minions is worth 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.750
 if now the ghosts 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.680
 several hours I will teach you with the 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:33.980
 as you see if you reach a champion with 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.019
 with lae you can throw it back 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.989
 what I told you before you put on 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.800
 a bit of life kilo w 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.530
 this links to the objective 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.550
 for a short period of time it is worth 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.790
 I will explain to you in the phase of 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.580
 lines the powerful attack that has 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:53.330
 reelecto and let's see a tim fain 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.330
 against cali 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.040
 there 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.930
 and so with w we get to end it 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.950
 well I'm not going to show you the objects 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.050
 that we should buy with this 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.790
 champion vale let's see start 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.290
 here I recommend a spacer but 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.720
 good as always you already know three 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.090
 positions and the first boots after 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.960
 of the second object you should take a 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.190
 Two grammy sword for top stage 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.350
 we should buy the brutalizer 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.000
 since now they have improved it and it's going 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.740
 with the black clÃ­ver with the blade 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.350
 black is an object that has given very very 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.320
 well then of object first I would say 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.350
 the black blade of second object then 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:45.240
 nothing would be wrong 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:47.130
 bacteriophage and leave it aside 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.900
 very well to endure in the phase of 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.680
 line also and in last in faith for 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.690
 slow down next object's worth one 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.260
 bloodthirsty would be pretty good but 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:01.710
 if we see that there is a lot of our departure 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.570
 magic many many magical champions 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.910
 I would eat a maw of more dead 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.880
 about magnificent gives you very good shield 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:12.870
 against magic and it gives you a little bit 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:15.720
 of damage too so that would be fine 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.450
 blackley see with black blade the 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.290
 system of dead boots 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.410
 magic resistance 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.780
 obviously mercury questions would be 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.419
 objects mercury boots black blade 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:31.300
 fauces of badly dead 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:33.910
 bloody mallet ice cream and it could be 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.500
 Emperor of weapons or I recommend layer 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.290
 of solar fire since it gives you life 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.060
 the armor inflicts 40 points of the year 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.580
 magical also per second to enemies 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.770
 close soul preparer is very 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.390
 ok but if you're going to do a wil very 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.790
 offensive 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.260
 although it removes enough that 15 probable 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.010
 critical impact but would be a better 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:57.070
 if you wanted to make offensive attack as 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:58.780
 bloodthirsty black blade even one 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:01.620
 blue medium trinity but I 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:04.510
 I recommend more soldier and that would be the 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.130
 very basic of this champion now I'm going to 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.320
 explain the runes that we will have to 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.930
 put the blowout in fifth damage of 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.300
 attack on marks attack damage on 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.920
 seals armor and in glyphs resistance 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.570
 magical these would be some good runes 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.640
 to have good attack damage and a 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.170
 good endurance online good and for 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.060
 I'm going to leave you here the masters 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:24.760
 so you can see what I have 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.560
 I have 21 on offense and defense 9 in these 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.060
 are the various reggaeton strips I 'm going 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.440
 to leave time so you can see them 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.360
 I hope you liked the video 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.050
 subscribe and favorite see you in the 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.050
 next until later
