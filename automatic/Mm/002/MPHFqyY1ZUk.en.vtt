under the hood right now and here's the
the<00:00:51.550> top<00:00:51.820> of<00:00:52.090> the<00:00:52.300> like<00:00:53.079> the<00:00:53.350> shock<00:00:53.710> tower

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
the top of the like the shock tower

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.430 
the top of the like the shock tower
thingy<00:00:54.250> and<00:00:54.660> basically<00:00:55.660> we<00:00:55.899> just<00:00:55.930> have<00:00:56.140> this

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
thingy and basically we just have this

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.130 
thingy and basically we just have this
that<00:00:57.100> nut<00:00:57.340> right<00:00:57.579> there<00:00:57.820> that's<00:00:58.690> gonna<00:00:58.899> come

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
that nut right there that's gonna come

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.950 
that nut right there that's gonna come
off<00:00:59.170> and<00:00:59.620> this<00:01:00.520> whole<00:01:00.700> top<00:01:01.059> piece<00:01:01.329> should<00:01:01.719> come

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
off and this whole top piece should come

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.550 
off and this whole top piece should come
out<00:01:01.989> and<00:01:02.370> then<00:01:03.370> this<00:01:03.610> whole<00:01:04.229> crown<00:01:05.229> type

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
out and then this whole crown type

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.890 
out and then this whole crown type
assembly<00:01:06.070> there's<00:01:06.340> a<00:01:06.610> couple<00:01:07.270> bolts<00:01:07.420> looks

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
assembly there's a couple bolts looks

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.410 
assembly there's a couple bolts looks
like<00:01:08.020> we<00:01:08.170> can<00:01:08.290> get<00:01:08.409> at<00:01:08.560> one<00:01:08.710> there's<00:01:09.520> nuts<00:01:09.850> we

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
like we can get at one there's nuts we

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.700 
like we can get at one there's nuts we
can<00:01:10.540> get<00:01:10.630> at<00:01:10.720> one<00:01:10.870> of<00:01:10.960> them<00:01:11.080> right<00:01:11.200> here<00:01:11.260> the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
can get at one of them right here the

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.140 
can get at one of them right here the
other<00:01:11.830> two<00:01:12.040> will<00:01:12.220> probably<00:01:12.520> have<00:01:12.640> to<00:01:12.700> access

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
other two will probably have to access

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.080 
other two will probably have to access
through<00:01:13.360> the<00:01:13.479> wheel<00:01:13.659> well<00:01:13.920> but<00:01:15.060> that'll<00:01:16.060> come

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
through the wheel well but that'll come

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.140 
through the wheel well but that'll come
off<00:01:16.240> and<00:01:16.720> then<00:01:18.240> see<00:01:20.310> then<00:01:21.310> down<00:01:21.520> below<00:01:21.549> here

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
off and then see then down below here

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.800 
off and then see then down below here
down<00:01:22.690> below<00:01:22.930> here<00:01:23.170> we've<00:01:23.380> got<00:01:24.420> there's<00:01:25.420> just<00:01:25.659> a

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
down below here we've got there's just a

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.080 
down below here we've got there's just a
bolt<00:01:26.049> right<00:01:26.200> there<00:01:26.500> I<00:01:26.650> guess<00:01:27.159> the<00:01:27.400> that<00:01:27.790> not<00:01:27.940> on

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
bolt right there I guess the that not on

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.660 
bolt right there I guess the that not on
the<00:01:28.240> back<00:01:28.390> of<00:01:28.600> it<00:01:28.720> is<00:01:28.869> kind<00:01:29.140> of<00:01:29.320> I<00:01:29.560> don't<00:01:30.549> know

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
the back of it is kind of I don't know

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.660 
the back of it is kind of I don't know
it's<00:01:31.650> designed<00:01:32.650> in<00:01:32.799> such<00:01:33.010> a<00:01:33.070> way<00:01:33.310> that<00:01:33.340> you

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
it's designed in such a way that you

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.240 
it's designed in such a way that you
don't<00:01:33.760> have<00:01:33.970> to<00:01:34.090> put<00:01:34.240> a<00:01:34.270> wrench<00:01:34.450> on<00:01:34.659> it<00:01:34.689> it<00:01:34.930> it<00:01:35.590> I

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
don't have to put a wrench on it it it I

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.920 
don't have to put a wrench on it it it I
don't<00:01:36.820> know<00:01:36.880> if<00:01:37.000> it's<00:01:37.119> fixed<00:01:37.390> on<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.780> other

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
don't know if it's fixed on the other

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.840 
don't know if it's fixed on the other
side<00:01:38.200> or<00:01:38.320> something<00:01:38.530> but<00:01:38.860> you<00:01:39.520> don't<00:01:39.670> really

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
side or something but you don't really

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.109 
side or something but you don't really
have<00:01:40.030> to<00:01:40.180> worry<00:01:40.360> about<00:01:41.549> pulling<00:01:42.549> that<00:01:42.700> they're

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
have to worry about pulling that they're

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.940 
have to worry about pulling that they're
getting<00:01:43.450> a<00:01:43.510> wrench<00:01:43.659> on<00:01:43.810> the<00:01:43.960> other<00:01:44.080> side<00:01:44.350> so<00:01:44.650> I

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
getting a wrench on the other side so I

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.830 
getting a wrench on the other side so I
don't<00:01:45.520> know<00:01:45.610> what<00:01:45.970> side<00:01:46.150> socket<00:01:46.540> did<00:01:46.720> you

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
don't know what side socket did you

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:54.690 
don't know what side socket did you
figure<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:50.320> 21<00:01:50.979> millimeter<00:01:52.470> socket<00:01:53.549> should<00:01:54.549> do

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
figure so 21 millimeter socket should do

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.679 
figure so 21 millimeter socket should do
the<00:01:54.820> trick<00:01:55.000> it<00:01:55.210> looks<00:01:55.360> like<00:01:55.570> you<00:01:56.470> can<00:01:56.590> see<00:01:57.689> with

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
the trick it looks like you can see with

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.730 
the trick it looks like you can see with
probably<00:01:59.290> won't<00:01:59.470> have<00:01:59.590> room<00:01:59.799> to<00:02:00.009> get<00:02:00.189> a<00:02:01.740> socket

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
probably won't have room to get a socket

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.230 
probably won't have room to get a socket
wrench<00:02:02.920> right<00:02:03.310> on<00:02:03.460> it<00:02:03.610> so<00:02:03.850> we're<00:02:04.090> probably

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
wrench right on it so we're probably

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.639 
wrench right on it so we're probably
going<00:02:04.509> to<00:02:04.600> take<00:02:04.840> a<00:02:06.090> fairly<00:02:07.090> long<00:02:07.360> extension<00:02:08.319> so

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
going to take a fairly long extension so

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.589 
going to take a fairly long extension so
we<00:02:08.679> can<00:02:08.920> kind<00:02:09.129> of<00:02:09.220> work<00:02:09.849> on<00:02:10.090> it<00:02:10.209> out<00:02:10.360> here<00:02:10.569> a

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
we can kind of work on it out here a

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
with the shock tower still on it in math

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.390 
with the shock tower still on it in math
working<00:02:30.150> on<00:02:30.240> getting<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.600> off<00:02:30.810> now

had this bulb connecting so that's all

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.990 
had this bulb connecting so that's all
out<00:02:39.770> as<00:02:40.770> soon<00:02:40.920> as<00:02:41.010> we<00:02:41.100> get<00:02:41.220> this<00:02:41.400> up<00:02:41.610> anyone's

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000

out as soon as we get this up anyone's
going<00:02:42.240> in<00:02:44.330> sorry<00:02:45.330> okay<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:46.560> this<00:02:47.550> bolt<00:02:47.850> that

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
going in sorry okay so this bolt that

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.380 
going in sorry okay so this bolt that
goes<00:02:48.450> on<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:48.930> bottom<00:02:49.670> that<00:02:50.670> would<00:02:50.970> give<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:51.330> a

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
goes on the bottom that would give you a

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.650 
goes on the bottom that would give you a
good<00:02:51.720> look<00:02:52.110> at<00:02:52.320> this<00:02:52.640> this<00:02:53.640> this<00:02:54.180> nut<00:02:54.450> that

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
good look at this this this nut that

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.170 
good look at this this this nut that
goes<00:02:54.810> on<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.140> back<00:02:55.610> so<00:02:56.610> it's<00:02:56.760> got<00:02:56.910> this<00:02:57.030> little

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
goes on the back so it's got this little

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.550 
goes on the back so it's got this little
flange<00:02:57.600> on<00:02:57.720> here<00:02:57.960> that<00:02:58.170> keeps<00:02:58.380> it<00:02:58.530> from

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
flange on here that keeps it from

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.520 
flange on here that keeps it from
spinning<00:02:58.920> so<00:02:59.540> like<00:03:00.540> we<00:03:00.660> said<00:03:00.840> don't<00:03:01.320> have<00:03:01.440> to

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
spinning so like we said don't have to

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.430 
spinning so like we said don't have to
worry<00:03:01.680> about<00:03:01.830> throwing<00:03:02.520> a<00:03:02.640> wrench<00:03:02.730> on<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:03.090> but

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
worry about throwing a wrench on it but

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.160 
worry about throwing a wrench on it but
there<00:03:04.440> you<00:03:04.530> go<00:03:05.690> okay<00:03:06.720> well<00:03:06.960> that's<00:03:07.170> basically

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
there you go okay well that's basically

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.090 
there you go okay well that's basically
what<00:03:10.170> you<00:03:10.290> have<00:03:10.320> to<00:03:10.500> do<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.740> get<00:03:10.830> them<00:03:10.950> out

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
what you have to do to get them out

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.830 
what you have to do to get them out
there's<00:03:11.370> only<00:03:11.490> you<00:03:12.000> know<00:03:12.090> I<00:03:12.270> think<00:03:12.420> that<00:03:12.630> bolt

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
there's only you know I think that bolt

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.080 
there's only you know I think that bolt
on<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.170> bottom<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.770> three<00:03:14.730> on<00:03:14.820> the<00:03:14.940> top

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
on the bottom and the three on the top

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.740 
on the bottom and the three on the top
and<00:03:15.360> it<00:03:15.510> should<00:03:15.750> come<00:03:16.650> right<00:03:16.920> out<00:03:16.950> but<00:03:17.630> we<00:03:18.630> got

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
and it should come right out but we got

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.490 
and it should come right out but we got
one<00:03:18.960> of<00:03:19.080> them<00:03:19.170> replaced<00:03:19.560> but<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.010> other<00:03:20.160> that

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
one of them replaced but the other that

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.900 
one of them replaced but the other that
the<00:03:22.500> bottom<00:03:22.890> piece<00:03:23.100> where<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.490> bolt<00:03:23.700> goes

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
the bottom piece where the bolt goes

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.880 
the bottom piece where the bolt goes
through<00:03:25.040> like<00:03:26.040> say<00:03:26.310> for<00:03:26.550> instance<00:03:27.500> you<00:03:28.500> have<00:03:28.860> a

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
through like say for instance you have a

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
through like say for instance you have a
truck<00:03:29.220> that's<00:03:30.110> lived<00:03:31.110> through<00:03:31.500> 14<00:03:32.310> years<00:03:32.610> in

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
truck that's lived through 14 years in

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.120 
truck that's lived through 14 years in
Minnesota<00:03:33.420> winters<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:34.410> might<00:03:34.650> be<00:03:34.830> a<00:03:34.860> little

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
Minnesota winters it might be a little

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.490 
Minnesota winters it might be a little
rusty<00:03:35.510> we<00:03:36.510> kind<00:03:36.720> of<00:03:36.810> found<00:03:36.930> that<00:03:37.170> out<00:03:37.320> the<00:03:37.350> hard

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
rusty we kind of found that out the hard

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.380 
rusty we kind of found that out the hard
way<00:03:37.830> so<00:03:38.310> only<00:03:38.430> got<00:03:38.760> one<00:03:38.910> of<00:03:39.000> them<00:03:39.090> done<00:03:39.270> tonight

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
way so only got one of them done tonight

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.720 
way so only got one of them done tonight
but<00:03:41.780> under<00:03:42.780> ideal<00:03:43.110> conditions<00:03:44.010> it<00:03:44.190> might<00:03:44.340> be<00:03:44.700> a

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
but under ideal conditions it might be a

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.050 
but under ideal conditions it might be a
pretty<00:03:45.000> fast<00:03:45.750> job<00:03:46.050> but<00:03:46.680> not<00:03:47.610> this<00:03:47.760> time

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
pretty fast job but not this time

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.280 
pretty fast job but not this time
but<00:03:48.590> either<00:03:49.590> way<00:03:49.710> thanks<00:03:50.370> for<00:03:50.490> watching<00:03:51.290> shows
