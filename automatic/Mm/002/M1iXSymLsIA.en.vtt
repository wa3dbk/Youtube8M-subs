00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.970
 to put it simply is a person who 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.750
 Hooker pulls out eating but 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:10.140
 he simply can not gain weight because 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:15.050
 maybe many of you identify 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.340
 they have had everything they have trained times 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.250
 they take supplements 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.859
 eat 40 times a day he told them 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.399
 your coach but you just can not 

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:29.399

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:35.399
 amorphous I understand how difficult it is to win 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.770
 weight if then for today they 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.810
 I want to present a recipe that 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.880
 to be delicious 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.759
 is going to help you win those little books 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.000
 that counts so much because it's going to be a 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.259
 match with zero supplements are going to be 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.740
 with things you can find 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.479
 quietly in the supermarket ok 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.430
 these are going to be the ingredients for the 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:03.960
 today ok we are going to use a guineo 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.170
 has an avocado two tablespoons of 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.619
 peanut butter 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.900
 a glass of natural tony yogurt or yogurt 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.680
 that they come to win 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.150
 and a glass of flavored yogurt at the end 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.080
 let's mix with 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.690
 avn to taste 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.420
 and these are going to be the ingredients that 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.790
 let's use 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.880
 make 0 supplements if you use 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.510
 supplements please welcome it if 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.310
 is that they use mass winning protein 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.319
 but for people who do not use 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.730
 supplements this shake will serve you 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:44.439
 very much for you to take two options 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.170
 one that is the one that I recommend just 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:49.840
 for after training and the other at 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.510
 wake up in the manner of a first breakfast 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.430
 yes because if they are these you should know 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.690
 that at least they should be eating 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.690
 minimum breakfast 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.489
 those are the techniques that you gave for 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.970
 gain weight many of you have 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.610
 seen the pictures of my change 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.740
 I had a quite drastic change happens 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.570
 of being a 130 pound person 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.780
 but a person at this moment 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:20.620
 I find at 210 pounds 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.569
 it was hard it was hard but this shake 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.090
 that presents them with this increase was one of 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.440
 the secrets that helped me this and such 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.410
 time many of you will say but the 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.420
 peanut butter has fat 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:36.340
 but the avocado has fat 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.400
 but flavored yogurt has fats and 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.890
 It's good fat 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.040
 healthy and it's grace that your body 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.040
 needs to 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.560
 do not worry about that it's a smoothie 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.610
 of proteins discharged from coal 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.610
 It is ideal for 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.709
 then as I told you I am going to use a 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:56.709
 glass 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.840
 Hello 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.730
 more or less like that 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.060
 if you want, you can add more 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.470
 yogurt 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.470
 absolutely nothing 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.819
 an extra ingredient that can be 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.670
 add can be whole milk too 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:18.280
 It is also very protein loaded if 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.259
 is that you want me in this in this 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.470
 case I will not add it but if you 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:25.660
 they want milk well can it be that they do not 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.100
 like the very thick match can 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:32.870
 add as I say milk or if it does not go 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.870
 if they do not like it too thick 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.990
 i 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:52.119

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:54.789
