well<00:00:32.930> I<00:00:33.019> was<00:00:33.140> always<00:00:33.320> interested<00:00:33.440> in<00:00:34.100> space<00:00:34.489> so

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820

well I was always interested in space so
I<00:00:34.850> knew<00:00:35.030> I<00:00:35.059> wanted<00:00:35.360> to<00:00:35.420> do<00:00:35.570> something<00:00:35.900> that

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
I knew I wanted to do something that

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.649 
I knew I wanted to do something that
involves<00:00:36.260> propulsion<00:00:36.920> Oh<00:00:37.160> watching<00:00:38.059> TV<00:00:38.239> and

an engineer just like my daddy you know
I<00:01:37.459> was<00:01:37.640> always<00:01:37.789> interested<00:01:37.880> in<00:01:38.330> science<00:01:38.479> and

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.190 
well we're looking at burn rates for
solid<00:01:43.940> propellants<00:01:44.479> and<00:01:44.569> it's<00:01:44.750> helping<00:01:44.989> NASA

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
solid propellants and it's helping NASA

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.410 
solid propellants and it's helping NASA
because<00:01:45.709> they're<00:01:46.610> actually<00:01:46.910> looking<00:01:47.060> at

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
because they're actually looking at

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.180 
because they're actually looking at
using<00:01:48.140> cell<00:01:48.380> phones<00:01:48.619> and<00:01:48.920> some<00:01:49.009> of<00:01:49.099> their
