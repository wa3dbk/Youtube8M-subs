00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.640
 many producers do not believe in 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.770
 numbers presented by the farm with the 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.019
 eyes the cruise a municipality of 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.820
 Create alert 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.269
 could also be numbers that 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.490
 impress on productivity and 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.520
 conditions in which it presents itself 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.070
 here the average production is 600 liters 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.090
 of milk per day in an area of only 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:30.359
 two hectares just this just 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.120
 two hectares and 34 animals 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.989
 The secret to this is actually no 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.940
 secret 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.329
 the promoter bet on the information and 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.219
 knowledge for a jump in production and 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.010
 quality is I'm the producer's son 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.460
 was raised on the farm, my father 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.289
 50 years milk strip has always been the story 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.020
 on the other side of the milkmaid with great pride 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.340
 that we continue to follow in the 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.559
 second generation 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.140
 I also hope that the third 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.710
 Why are we proud to say that? 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.840
 that we continue in the activity with 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.240
 much insistence and persistence and 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.970
 believing in the activity that people 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.159
 brings a message to everyone who can 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.530
 believe in the full bucket project that 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.119
 above all, it is a project that has come to 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.640
 the small producer 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.890
 and more as the social end as was the 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.229
 start work here on the property 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.180
 the beginning in the bucket full project of 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.490
 difficulties at the time saw the 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.850
 dairy activity carried out in a 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:34.560
 quite amateur as it always was 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.640
 and without the information that is a secret of 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.040
 business 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.350
 the information stays with the technician until 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.340
 producer producer accepts these 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.890
 changes 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.350
 there is always that contrast to arrive new 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.970
 information new methods 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.729
 here was quite difficult at first 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.560
 due to cm the parent that touches that being 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.750
 also the question of the 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.219
 notes that in those cities the measure 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.350
 that the thing was walking was 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.430
 improving that we were seeing that the 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.320
 project is feasible 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.259
 the care of herds in the 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.460
 initials of growth is fundamental 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.420
 so the heifers stay in 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.610
 hutch housing type sombrite 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.250
 a simple installation with good 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.900
 good shade availability 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.060
 water and food 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.610
 besides the natural disinfection of the place 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.599
 by the sun and little probability of 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.550
 diseases 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.310
 the main structural changes 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.970
 were in relation to food 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.260
 grazing rotated the two hectares 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.910
 divided into titan pickets 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.770
 Brachiaria and giggs 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.550
 irrigation is key in the system 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.860
 in the cold months of the year. 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.930
 adds oats and ryegrass to the 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.959
 which makes it possible to maintain the 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.660
 in the pasture the whole year all the changes 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.760
 happened to the entry to the program 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.549
 More difficult was it to adapt notes 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.549
 of key areas for the project 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.870
 bucket was the beginning of activity 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.100
 in the right way 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.769
 before we did not have a control 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.380
 dairy farmer did not have the 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:05.019
 genetic quality of milk cow cows 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.940
 to pasture to crooked and right now to people 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.950
 has a process that the car is the default 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.739
 that we have today are seven spreadsheets 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.690
 that only have the obligation that is the 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.720
 part of minimum and maximum temperature 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.260
 part of the problem and would have to 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.560
 from revenue from expenditure is 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.600
 weight of the milk to the calving part and 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.489
 the blankets, that is the 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.650
 all this makes it easier to 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.540
 The measurement of results is a 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.359
 today my farm today is a company 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.160
 people today have accounting that has 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.079
 the financial part is from 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.000
 easy investment has money do not have 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.010
 money do not do then the farm turned 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.859
 a company today a company that gives 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.019
 profitability in milk prices are increasingly 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:49.120
 more conditioned the composition of the 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.519
 product in accordance with the 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.489
 legislation in force, the greasy 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.980
 receive up to 15 cents more for 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.959
 quality of milk and is sold to a 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.640
 cooperative here in the region 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.730
 the result not only of good 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.170
 but also improvement 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.340
 that the product developed in the 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.049
 property 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.410
 we started with what we had in the 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:13.299
 base was cattle 34 thousand blood 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.239
 We've been working on this part 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:17.590
 genetics you start caring for the grass 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.580
 very well and have to have a cattle 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.109
 compatible 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.539
 we are walking the seventh eighth 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.840
 right from here we'll work on that 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:29.090
 level 7 8th fifty wo there 34 no 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.370
 most of the improvements continue 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.530
 the producer planted seedlings and 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.199
 other trees for the cows to have 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.090
 more shade on your property 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:40.550
 the farm is one of the units 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.000
 of the project that has already received 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.610
 visit of producers from other states 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.949
 brazilian goiÃ¡s and tocantins 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.310
 is the biggest proof that with little space 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:54.409
 it is possible to produce much and make 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.240
 more profitable activity 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:05:00.020
 many doubt the situation of people 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.060
 works when you get here and see is 17 goes 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.779
 connect and 18 on other hectares not 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:08.150
 They believe that this is true but 

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:12.259
 activity is real for the thing I 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:15.289
 I always say the technical part combines 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:17.629
 very well with the part is bureaucratic 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.520
 So the technicians talk you do the 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:21.650
 thing happens in the sense that the 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.810
 project has credibility I believe 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.330
 who is going to have milk future who 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.490
 have a project at the goal level of 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.039
 full and with assistance it is no use 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.020
 I played it, it will not happen 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.729
 who does not have the research behind today 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.889
 the embrapa responsible for the full bucket 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:38.839
 that we have all this technology 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:40.819
 arriving at the producer 

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:43.400
 it's no use having the technology today 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:45.080
 stop in the room to reach a producer 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.089
 The woman I run will not go. 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.550
 nothing happens then I believe spin 

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:52.930
 so she leaves the room and arrives at the 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.930
 producer one thing happens
