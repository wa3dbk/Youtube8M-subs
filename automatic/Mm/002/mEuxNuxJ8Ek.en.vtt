00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 to us judges for you to do these 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.690
 it's not very easy to mine 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:13.530
 You are the white enamel growth 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:16.080
 black enamel or then fabric paint and 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.609
 end trait brush but if you 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.890
 They want to see how it's done 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.930
 I need to meet first, I did it myself 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.490
 was to paint zone and white 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:30.119
 now I'm going to the second part that goes 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:34.320
 If you speak, you make that line in the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.230
 horizontal with paint of chalk or 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.890
 then with pink enamel and dash brush 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.890
 bells 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.520
 I'll make this line in the middle of the nail 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:38.300
 the third classic girls will be 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:42.250
 to form the dominoes to make the 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:48.130
 your pieces I'm going to use the junior planet 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.130
 This is going to be the quayside here. 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.550
 this one but if the stone of duke 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.610
 this is going to be eternal forever 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.200
 now just pass an extra brightness through 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.800
 top 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.800
 the then bank 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:15.290
 the nails look like this but it's very beautiful 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:18.700
 It's a different fingernail, there you look. 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.700
 Wherever you go
