00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.300 

weight<00:01:46.930> distribution<00:01:47.290> and<00:01:47.860> when<00:01:48.159> you've<00:01:48.280> got

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.590 

that's<00:01:59.990> no<00:02:00.140> but<00:02:00.409> it's<00:02:01.000> three-quarters<00:02:02.000> full

I've seen cars where it's been down to

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.330 
I've seen cars where it's been down to
only<00:02:04.909> half<00:02:05.270> full<00:02:05.630> so<00:02:05.960> obviously<00:02:06.680> very<00:02:06.979> smooth
