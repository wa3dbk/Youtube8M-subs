00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
to be Chauncy

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.670 
to be Chauncy
to<00:01:45.530> become<00:01:45.710> see<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:46.430> two<00:01:47.360> beats<00:01:47.570> on<00:01:47.689> D<00:01:47.869> okay<00:01:48.619> so

to become see and two beats on D okay so
it's<00:01:48.950> a<00:01:49.009> bit<00:01:49.130> of<00:01:49.220> an<00:01:49.280> odd<00:01:49.460> split<00:01:49.869> because<00:01:50.869> we've

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
it's a bit of an odd split because we've

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.530 
it's a bit of an odd split because we've
got<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:51.200> C<00:01:51.409> going<00:01:52.250> across<00:01:52.399> two<00:01:52.670> bars<00:01:52.909> so<00:01:53.180> three

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
got the C going across two bars so three

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.120 
got the C going across two bars so three
and<00:01:53.570> four<00:01:53.840> on<00:01:54.110> the<00:01:54.140> first<00:01:54.380> bottom<00:01:54.710> one<00:01:54.890> and<00:01:55.009> two

four okay so once you've got the chords
the<00:02:08.720> movement<00:02:09.110> and<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.319> time<00:02:09.530> in<00:02:09.880> like<00:02:10.880> that

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
the movement and the time in like that

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.670 
the movement and the time in like that
what<00:02:11.269> you<00:02:11.360> want<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.569> do<00:02:11.660> is<00:02:11.750> now<00:02:11.930> add<00:02:12.170> a<00:02:12.319> push

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:19.960 
in half a be early so not on the free
but<00:02:18.890> on<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.069> end<00:02:19.220> of<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.370> two<00:02:19.519> so<00:02:19.760> we're<00:02:19.880> going

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
but on the end of the two so we're going

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.880 
but on the end of the two so we're going
to<00:02:20.030> go<00:02:20.150> one<00:02:20.480> two<00:02:21.350> and<00:02:21.530> three<00:02:22.280> four<00:02:23.030> one<00:02:23.360> two<00:02:24.230> and

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
to go one two and three four one two and

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.430 
to go one two and three four one two and
three<00:02:25.610> four<00:02:26.209> that's<00:02:26.330> pretty<00:02:26.540> crucial<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:27.319> get

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
three four that's pretty crucial to get

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.590 
three four that's pretty crucial to get
the<00:02:27.500> summit<00:02:27.830> in<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:27.950> recording<00:02:28.340> okay<00:02:28.549> the<00:02:29.420> end

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
the summit in the recording okay the end

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.640 
the summit in the recording okay the end
wouldn't<00:02:29.810> really<00:02:29.959> be<00:02:30.080> enough<00:02:30.260> stroke<00:02:30.470> so<00:02:30.560> you

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
wouldn't really be enough stroke so you

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.900 
wouldn't really be enough stroke so you
can<00:02:30.799> if<00:02:30.980> you're<00:02:31.040> strumming<00:02:31.250> it<00:02:31.489> you<00:02:31.610> could<00:02:31.760> do

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
can if you're strumming it you could do

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.229 
can if you're strumming it you could do
one<00:02:32.180> two<00:02:32.870> and<00:02:33.140> that<00:02:33.560> would<00:02:33.680> be<00:02:33.799> textbook<00:02:34.250> three

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
one two and that would be textbook three

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.650 
one two and that would be textbook three
four<00:02:35.959> and<00:02:36.489> okay<00:02:37.489> that<00:02:37.640> would<00:02:37.700> be<00:02:37.760> textbook<00:02:38.150> I'm

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
four and okay that would be textbook I'm

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.930 
four and okay that would be textbook I'm
going<00:02:38.900> to<00:02:38.959> be<00:02:39.049> plucking<00:02:39.920> picking

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
going to be plucking picking

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.600 
going to be plucking picking
okay<00:02:41.870> so<00:02:41.930> doesn't<00:02:42.650> kind<00:02:42.920> of<00:02:43.040> really<00:02:43.250> matter

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
okay so doesn't kind of really matter

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.280 
okay so doesn't kind of really matter

thumb or pluck it twice and then what is

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:19.360 
thumb or pluck it twice and then what is
been<00:03:15.670> open<00:03:16.670> E<00:03:16.790> so<00:03:17.390> we<00:03:17.420> can<00:03:17.660> play<00:03:17.780> C<00:03:17.959> chord<00:03:18.370> okay

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
been open E so we can play C chord okay

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.730 
been open E so we can play C chord okay
cuz<00:03:19.579> the<00:03:19.640> ease<00:03:19.819> in<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.060> chord<00:03:20.299> so<00:03:20.750> we<00:03:20.900> one<00:03:22.840> look

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:24.740 
cuz the ease in the chord so we one look

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.130 
cuz the ease in the chord so we one look
NASA<00:03:24.980> just<00:03:25.220> and<00:03:26.120> that<00:03:26.150> come<00:03:26.450> out<00:03:26.600> okay<00:03:26.870> that's

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
NASA just and that come out okay that's

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.710 
NASA just and that come out okay that's
the<00:03:27.320> didn't<00:03:27.920> over<00:03:28.040> here<00:03:28.220> there<00:03:28.370> at<00:03:28.490> all<00:03:28.720> it's

fifth one two and three and then I'm

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.040 
fifth one two and three and then I'm
going<00:03:49.190> to<00:03:49.250> pop<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:50.120> one<00:03:50.330> two<00:03:50.450> three<00:03:50.630> four<00:03:50.930> so

going to pop the one two three four so

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.580 
going to pop the one two three four so
the<00:03:51.140> base<00:03:51.290> notes<00:03:51.320> 92<00:03:51.770> for<00:03:52.210> so<00:03:53.210> again<00:03:53.590> then

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
the base notes 92 for so again then

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.670 
the base notes 92 for so again then
there's<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:55.370> two<00:03:55.520> notes<00:03:55.700> that's<00:03:55.940> you<00:03:56.060> see<00:03:56.300> and

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
there's the two notes that's you see and

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.070 
there's the two notes that's you see and
your<00:03:57.680> he<00:03:57.830> and<00:03:58.580> we<00:03:58.730> want<00:03:58.940> it<00:03:59.030> remember<00:03:59.360> g<00:03:59.780> g--

your he and we want it remember g g--
e--<00:04:01.480> c<00:04:02.480> e<00:04:03.190> and<00:04:04.190> the<00:04:04.400> last<00:04:04.580> nut<00:04:04.730> was<00:04:04.850> F<00:04:05.600> sharp<00:04:05.930> so

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:06.710 
e-- c e and the last nut was F sharp so

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.660 
e-- c e and the last nut was F sharp so
look<00:04:07.120> in<00:04:08.120> the<00:04:08.300> D<00:04:08.510> we've<00:04:08.930> got<00:04:09.050> an<00:04:09.140> F<00:04:09.260> sharp<00:04:09.290> there

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
look in the D we've got an F sharp there

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.660 
look in the D we've got an F sharp there
the<00:04:10.670> F<00:04:11.000> sharp<00:04:11.030> a<00:04:11.570> sharp<00:04:12.350> B<00:04:12.440> the<00:04:12.590> third<00:04:12.800> okay

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
the F sharp a sharp B the third okay

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.180 
the F sharp a sharp B the third okay
major<00:04:14.540> third<00:04:14.810> so<00:04:15.050> we<00:04:15.320> can<00:04:15.470> go<00:04:15.590> to<00:04:15.650> the<00:04:15.800> D<00:04:15.950> chord

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
major third so we can go to the D chord

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.980 
major third so we can go to the D chord
so<00:04:16.280> we're<00:04:16.400> gonna<00:04:16.489> have

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990
