00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.410 

all<00:00:29.419> the<00:00:29.630> points<00:00:29.839> are<00:00:30.650> electrically<00:00:31.250> operated

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.470 

and<00:00:34.780> all<00:00:35.170> of<00:00:35.320> the<00:00:35.530> rolling<00:00:35.950> stock<00:00:36.309> employs<00:00:36.940> the

which needs to be uncoupled the stick

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.930 
which needs to be uncoupled the stick
like<00:00:44.989> so

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.950 

it's<00:00:48.390> much<00:00:48.600> easier<00:00:49.110> than<00:00:49.320> using<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:50.160> hook<00:00:51.150> and<00:00:51.780> a

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
it's much easier than using a hook and a

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.550 
it's much easier than using a hook and a
chain<00:00:52.430> which<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.790> most<00:00:53.970> popular<00:00:54.690> form<00:00:55.380> of

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:55.560 
chain which is the most popular form of

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:38.160 
chain which is the most popular form of
coupling<00:00:56.370> in<00:00:56.580> this<00:00:56.910> large-scale

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.280 

as<00:01:39.170> can<00:01:39.500> be<00:01:39.650> seen<00:01:39.950> in<00:01:40.400> this<00:01:40.580> video<00:01:41.290> this

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
as can be seen in this video this

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.859 
as can be seen in this video this
locomotive<00:01:42.799> is<00:01:43.580> now<00:01:43.790> shunting<00:01:44.360> up<00:01:44.509> to<00:01:44.720> the

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
locomotive is now shunting up to the

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.270 
locomotive is now shunting up to the
goods<00:01:45.080> wagons

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
goods wagons

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.630 
goods wagons
connecting<00:01:49.100> changing<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.250> points<00:01:51.170> with<00:01:52.170> the

buttons on the control panel

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.600 
buttons on the control panel
like<00:01:56.700> so

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
like so

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.580 
like so
and<00:01:58.790> drawing<00:01:59.390> forward

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.090 

this<00:02:03.159> automatic<00:02:04.049> coupling<00:02:05.049> makes<00:02:05.710> it<00:02:05.890> very

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
this automatic coupling makes it very

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.880 
this automatic coupling makes it very
easy<00:02:06.250> to<00:02:07.149> drive<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:07.659> model<00:02:07.840> engines<00:02:08.440> on<00:02:08.709> the

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
easy to drive the model engines on the

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.559 
easy to drive the model engines on the
layout

this<00:02:23.550> end<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.120> layout<00:02:24.860> will<00:02:25.860> be<00:02:25.890> hidden

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
this end of the layout will be hidden

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.459 
this end of the layout will be hidden
in<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.769> future<00:02:28.069> as<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.909> layout<00:02:29.469> progresses

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:30.469 
in the future as the layout progresses

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:37.870
