what<00:00:53.649> what<00:00:53.859> will<00:00:54.070> one<00:00:54.430> have<00:00:54.609> learned<00:00:54.909> from

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
this experience well I think there are a

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.859 
this experience well I think there are a
couple<00:00:57.070> things<00:00:57.339> to<00:00:57.489> weaken<00:00:57.760> money<00:00:57.939> number<00:00:58.659> one

00:00:58.859 --> 00:00:58.869 
couple things to weaken money number one

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:00.959 
couple things to weaken money number one
is<00:00:59.109> you<00:00:59.170> don't<00:00:59.559> go<00:00:59.829> to<00:00:59.890> war<00:01:00.129> based<00:01:00.460> on<00:01:00.699> faulty

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
is you don't go to war based on faulty

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.029 
is you don't go to war based on faulty
intelligence<00:01:01.390> we're<00:01:02.259> going<00:01:02.379> to<00:01:02.439> have<00:01:02.589> to<00:01:02.769> I

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
intelligence we're going to have to I

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:04.799 
intelligence we're going to have to I
think<00:01:03.460> be<00:01:03.729> much<00:01:03.939> more<00:01:04.149> aggressive<00:01:04.570> in<00:01:04.659> terms

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
think be much more aggressive in terms

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.749 
think be much more aggressive in terms
of<00:01:04.960> diplomacy<00:01:05.379> in<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:05.619> region<00:01:05.950> both<00:01:06.340> inside

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
of diplomacy in the region both inside

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:09.149 
of diplomacy in the region both inside
Iraq<00:01:07.060> and<00:01:07.330> outside<00:01:08.020> of<00:01:08.140> Iraq<00:01:08.259> and<00:01:08.649> I<00:01:08.830> think<00:01:09.039> we

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
Iraq and outside of Iraq and I think we

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:10.859

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
say let's think in practical

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.430

common-sense ways about solving problems
and<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:44.090> let's<00:02:44.300> get<00:02:44.420> beyond<00:02:44.660> some<00:02:44.690> of<00:02:44.930> the

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
and and let's get beyond some of the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.480 
and and let's get beyond some of the
partisanship<00:02:45.470> we've<00:02:45.800> involved<00:02:46.040> in<00:02:46.340> the

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.520 
partisanship we've involved in the
bickering<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.570> slash-and-burn

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
bickering and the slash-and-burn

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.620 
bickering and the slash-and-burn
politics<00:02:49.190> people<00:02:49.760> really<00:02:49.910> respond<00:02:50.360> that<00:02:50.510> I

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
politics people really respond that I

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.910 
politics people really respond that I
think<00:02:50.810> that's<00:02:50.960> the<00:02:51.050> reason<00:02:51.200> why<00:02:51.560> we're<00:02:51.740> doing

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920
