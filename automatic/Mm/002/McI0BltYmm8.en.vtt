that<00:00:28.609> will<00:00:28.760> no<00:00:28.910> longer<00:00:29.119> work<00:00:29.320> but<00:00:30.320> I<00:00:30.349> don't<00:00:30.500> fly

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
that will no longer work but I don't fly

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.420 
that will no longer work but I don't fly
with<00:00:31.039> this<00:00:31.160> case<00:00:31.429> all<00:00:31.640> that<00:00:31.820> often

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
with this case all that often

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.390 
with this case all that often
these<00:00:34.430> are<00:00:34.640> adhesively<00:00:35.390> mounted<00:00:35.900> to<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:36.950> the

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400 
these are adhesively mounted to the the

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.790 
these are adhesively mounted to the the
case<00:00:37.640> these<00:00:37.940> are<00:00:38.000> just<00:00:38.270> PVC<00:00:39.080> end<00:00:39.260> caps<00:00:39.560> for

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
case these are just PVC end caps for

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.650 
case these are just PVC end caps for
plate<00:00:40.010> I<00:00:40.480> travel<00:00:41.480> with<00:00:41.600> a<00:00:41.630> bunch<00:00:41.990> of<00:00:42.640> tripods

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
plate I travel with a bunch of tripods

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.770 
plate I travel with a bunch of tripods
so<00:00:44.660> what<00:00:44.930> I<00:00:44.960> do<00:00:45.190> is<00:00:46.190> each<00:00:47.090> one<00:00:47.270> of<00:00:47.360> these<00:00:47.420> cups

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
so what I do is each one of these cups

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.580 
so what I do is each one of these cups
is<00:00:48.170> set<00:00:48.470> to<00:00:49.250> essentially<00:00:49.700> take<00:00:49.970> a<00:00:50.380> leg<00:00:51.380> of<00:00:51.530> a

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
is set to essentially take a leg of a

00:00:51.590 --> 00:01:01.210 
is set to essentially take a leg of a
tripod<00:00:55.720> along<00:00:56.720> with<00:00:57.580> why

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.900 

wiggle<00:01:02.150> stick<00:01:02.420> and<00:01:03.290> the<00:01:03.739> third<00:01:04.040> light<00:01:04.250> tripod

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
wiggle stick and the third light tripod

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.640 
wiggle stick and the third light tripod
which<00:01:05.120> is<00:01:05.300> the<00:01:05.660> hero<00:01:05.900> is<00:01:06.080> currently<00:01:06.440> sitting

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
which is the hero is currently sitting

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.350 
which is the hero is currently sitting
on<00:01:06.830> will<00:01:07.460> go<00:01:07.670> here<00:01:08.030> and<00:01:08.180> then<00:01:09.080> using<00:01:09.470> a<00:01:09.560> bungee

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
on will go here and then using a bungee

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.480 
on will go here and then using a bungee
makes<00:01:11.360> easier<00:01:11.720> for<00:01:11.990> transporting<00:01:15.190> okay<00:01:16.190> this

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
makes easier for transporting okay this

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.450 
makes easier for transporting okay this
is<00:01:16.670> one<00:01:16.880> of<00:01:16.910> the<00:01:17.120> more<00:01:17.540> interesting<00:01:18.280> things<00:01:19.280> I

sixteen thread on the top here it also

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.770 
sixteen thread on the top here it also
gives<00:02:14.390> me<00:02:14.569> the<00:02:14.599> ability<00:02:16.390> actually<00:02:17.390> this<00:02:17.569> is

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
gives me the ability actually this is

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.210 
gives me the ability actually this is
the<00:02:17.900> end<00:02:18.050> I<00:02:18.170> use<00:02:18.349> for<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.650> GoPro<00:02:19.099> mount<00:02:21.220> pull

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
the end I use for the GoPro mount pull

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.180 
the end I use for the GoPro mount pull
this<00:02:22.400> out<00:02:22.720> and<00:02:23.720> use<00:02:24.560> also<00:02:24.830> got<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:27.290> 3/8<00:02:27.830> or

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
this out and use also got the the 3/8 or

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.400 
this out and use also got the the 3/8 or
the<00:02:28.340> 5/16<00:02:29.270> mount<00:02:29.480> whichever<00:02:29.810> one<00:02:29.959> that<00:02:29.989> one<00:02:30.260> is

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
the 5/16 mount whichever one that one is

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.190 
the 5/16 mount whichever one that one is
it's<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.650> larger<00:02:31.010> amount<00:02:31.160> so<00:02:32.060> I<00:02:32.090> can<00:02:32.450> flip<00:02:32.720> top

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
it's the larger amount so I can flip top

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.550 
it's the larger amount so I can flip top
to<00:02:33.410> bottom<00:02:33.760> for<00:02:34.760> either<00:02:34.970> my<00:02:35.239> quick<00:02:35.510> mounts<00:02:35.959> or
