unless<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.850> packaging<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:10.710> know<00:01:10.799> open

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
unless this packaging is you know open

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.679 
unless this packaging is you know open
in<00:01:11.250> some<00:01:11.460> way<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.030> something<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.540> you

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
in some way this is something that you

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.200 
in some way this is something that you
can<00:01:12.960> wrap<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.740> burn<00:01:13.920> patient<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.549> before<00:01:15.090> you

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
can wrap the burn patient in before you

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.030 
can wrap the burn patient in before you
transform<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.049> hospital<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:16.680> that's<00:01:16.860> one

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
transform to the hospital so that's one

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.649 
transform to the hospital so that's one
thing<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.310> we<00:01:17.610> might<00:01:17.790> be<00:01:17.970> able<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.270> put<00:01:18.479> into

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
thing that we might be able to put into

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.420 
thing that we might be able to put into
our<00:01:18.869> kit<00:01:20.509> so<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.750> idea<00:01:22.380> here<00:01:22.619> again<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.189> this

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
our kit so the idea here again is this

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.520 
our kit so the idea here again is this
is<00:01:23.610> going<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.820> be<00:01:23.909> incredibly<00:01:24.450> sensitive<00:01:24.810> to

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
is going to be incredibly sensitive to

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.160 
is going to be incredibly sensitive to
any<00:01:26.189> kind<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.490> air<00:01:26.700> moving<00:01:27.060> across<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.720> burn

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
any kind of air moving across this burn

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.630 
any kind of air moving across this burn
nerve<00:01:28.530> endings<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.100> we<00:01:29.189> want<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.460> try<00:01:29.549> to

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
nerve endings so we want to try to

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.340 
nerve endings so we want to try to
protect<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.150> as<00:01:30.360> much<00:01:30.540> as<00:01:30.570> possible<00:01:30.780> with<00:01:31.320> a

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
protect that as much as possible with a

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.020 
protect that as much as possible with a
clean<00:01:31.650> sterile<00:01:32.130> dress<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.610> we've<00:01:32.700> done<00:01:32.850> the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
clean sterile dress and we've done the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.210 
clean sterile dress and we've done the
best<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.450> we<00:01:33.570> can<00:01:33.780> with<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.740> improvised

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
best that we can with this improvised

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.460 
best that we can with this improvised
t-shirt<00:01:35.759> phil<00:01:36.390> was<00:01:36.570> doing<00:01:36.780> some<00:01:36.960> stop<00:01:37.170> drop

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.380 
put a whole lot of pressure on this
again<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.130> idea<00:03:24.489> here<00:03:24.730> is<00:03:24.760> just<00:03:25.120> to<00:03:25.209> protect

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
again the idea here is just to protect

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.360 
again the idea here is just to protect
the<00:03:25.690> wound<00:03:25.900> as<00:03:26.049> much<00:03:26.230> as<00:03:26.380> we<00:03:26.530> can<00:03:26.709> but<00:03:26.950> it<00:03:27.040> still

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
the wound as much as we can but it still

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.490 
the wound as much as we can but it still
hurts<00:03:27.579> like<00:03:27.790> crap<00:03:28.120> yeah<00:03:28.510> it<00:03:28.780> does<00:03:28.989> it<00:03:29.290> hurts

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
hurts like crap yeah it does it hurts

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.460 
hurts like crap yeah it does it hurts
bad<00:03:29.829> now<00:03:30.640> we've<00:03:30.880> left<00:03:31.180> this<00:03:31.660> loosely<00:03:32.170> wrapped

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
bad now we've left this loosely wrapped

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.800 
bad now we've left this loosely wrapped
here<00:03:33.070> so<00:03:33.310> that<00:03:33.400> he<00:03:33.489> can<00:03:33.640> breathe<00:03:33.940> and<00:03:34.480> we<00:03:34.630> left

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
here so that he can breathe and we left

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.090 
here so that he can breathe and we left
it<00:03:34.930> up<00:03:35.049> to<00:03:35.079> the<00:03:35.290> patient<00:03:35.739> we<00:03:35.799> could<00:03:35.980> have

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
it up to the patient we could have

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.789 
it up to the patient we could have
wrapped<00:03:36.340> his<00:03:36.519> eyes<00:03:36.730> but<00:03:37.570> for<00:03:37.959> patient<00:03:38.350> comfort

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
wrapped his eyes but for patient comfort

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.920 
wrapped his eyes but for patient comfort
and<00:03:39.040> security<00:03:39.459> he<00:03:39.940> wanted<00:03:40.180> to<00:03:40.239> be<00:03:40.329> able<00:03:40.420> to<00:03:40.570> see

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
and security he wanted to be able to see

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.539 
and security he wanted to be able to see
so<00:03:41.140> we<00:03:41.230> went<00:03:41.410> ahead<00:03:41.470> and<00:03:41.680> just<00:03:41.920> left<00:03:42.160> his<00:03:42.400> eyes

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
so we went ahead and just left his eyes

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.520 
so we went ahead and just left his eyes
so<00:03:43.360> that<00:03:43.480> he<00:03:43.540> could<00:03:43.690> see<00:03:43.930> what<00:03:44.079> was<00:03:44.170> going<00:03:44.260> on

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
so that he could see what was going on

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.440 
so that he could see what was going on
and<00:03:44.769> keep<00:03:44.890> him<00:03:45.070> a<00:03:45.100> little<00:03:45.130> bit<00:03:45.400> calmer<00:03:45.910> if

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
and keep him a little bit calmer if

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.180 
and keep him a little bit calmer if
that's<00:03:46.900> not<00:03:47.110> working<00:03:47.470> out<00:03:47.590> I<00:03:47.650> wanted<00:03:47.890> to<00:03:47.980> see

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
could have gone ahead and wrapped the

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.870 
could have gone ahead and wrapped the
eyes<00:03:53.140> and<00:03:53.470> protected<00:03:54.340> those<00:03:54.459> a<00:03:54.489> little<00:03:54.730> bit
