00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:25.349 
about it so this is how it looks kind of

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:27.980 
about it so this is how it looks kind of
crazy<00:06:25.680> at<00:06:26.190> the<00:06:26.400> top<00:06:26.699> I<00:06:27.090> don't<00:06:27.750> know<00:06:27.810> what

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
crazy at the top I don't know what

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.790 
crazy at the top I don't know what
happened<00:06:28.349> there

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
happened there

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.379 
happened there
those<00:06:29.250> cameras<00:06:29.669> aren't<00:06:29.819> gonna<00:06:29.970> pick<00:06:30.210> up

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:30.389 
those cameras aren't gonna pick up

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:33.260 
those cameras aren't gonna pick up
through<00:06:30.780> the<00:06:31.550> through<00:06:32.550> the<00:06:32.580> hair<00:06:32.910> but<00:06:33.090> there's

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
through the through the hair but there's

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.300 
through the through the hair but there's
red<00:06:33.449> streaks<00:06:33.810> going<00:06:34.110> through<00:06:34.319> but<00:06:34.560> the<00:06:34.710> top

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310 
red streaks going through but the top

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.909 
red streaks going through but the top
just<00:06:35.669> looks<00:06:35.849> crazy<00:06:36.210> so<00:06:36.840> I<00:06:37.110> guess<00:06:37.740> that's

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 
just looks crazy so I guess that's

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:39.379 
just looks crazy so I guess that's
something<00:06:38.310> I'm<00:06:38.400> gonna<00:06:38.520> have<00:06:38.729> to<00:06:38.880> get<00:06:39.030> used<00:06:39.270> to

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:39.389 
something I'm gonna have to get used to

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:42.589 
something I'm gonna have to get used to
but<00:06:39.720> um<00:06:40.789> yeah<00:06:41.789> I<00:06:41.820> think<00:06:41.940> I<00:06:42.180> might<00:06:42.330> just<00:06:42.509> buy

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:42.599 
but um yeah I think I might just buy

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:43.580 
but um yeah I think I might just buy
another<00:06:42.630> highlight<00:06:43.229> key<00:06:43.349> and<00:06:43.500> just

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590 
another highlight key and just

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:44.930 
another highlight key and just
concentrate<00:06:44.099> on<00:06:44.190> the<00:06:44.310> pits<00:06:44.520> on<00:06:44.699> the<00:06:44.729> end

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 
concentrate on the pits on the end

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.210 
concentrate on the pits on the end
because<00:06:45.210> what<00:06:46.080> I<00:06:46.110> dyed<00:06:46.410> my<00:06:46.590> hair<00:06:46.620> black<00:06:47.009> is

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.220 
because what I dyed my hair black is

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.249 
because what I dyed my hair black is
really<00:06:47.250> difficult<00:06:47.940> to<00:06:48.300> die<00:06:48.449> any<00:06:48.750> other<00:06:48.990> color

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:49.259 
really difficult to die any other color

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:52.640 
really difficult to die any other color
so<00:06:50.360> one<00:06:51.360> thing<00:06:51.570> to<00:06:51.690> bear<00:06:51.810> in<00:06:51.870> mind<00:06:51.990> with<00:06:52.530> this
