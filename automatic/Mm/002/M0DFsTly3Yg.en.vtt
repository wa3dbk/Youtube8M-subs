up for debate in a moment because we

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.570 
up for debate in a moment because we
were<00:01:22.500> doing<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:22.950> well<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.310> league

 we're<00:01:24.390> at<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> top<00:01:24.810> for<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.200> long<00:01:25.500> it

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
 we're at the top for so long it

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.300 
 we're at the top for so long it
was<00:01:25.830> looking<00:01:26.280> good<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:28.040> basically<00:01:29.040> we've<00:01:29.280> got

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
was looking good and basically we've got

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.609 
was looking good and basically we've got
smashed<00:01:29.880> by<00:01:30.000> all<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.360> teams<00:01:30.509> above<00:01:30.930> us<00:01:31.079> and

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
smashed by all the teams above us and

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.010 
smashed by all the teams above us and
it's<00:01:32.250> sort<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.060> created<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.509> little<00:01:33.540> bit<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.930> an

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
it's sort of created a little bit of an

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.700 
it's sort of created a little bit of an
anti-climax<00:01:34.170> but<00:01:35.130> I'm<00:01:35.579> sure<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.659> if<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:37.020> can

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
anti-climax but I'm sure that if we can

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.980 
anti-climax but I'm sure that if we can
achieve<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:38.040> fourth<00:01:38.460> place<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.030> at<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.869> end

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
achieve that fourth place and at the end

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.960 
achieve that fourth place and at the end

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
in Chelsea and United and now Liverpool

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.270 
in Chelsea and United and now Liverpool
must<00:02:39.450> really<00:02:39.630> be<00:02:39.810> going<00:02:39.930> in<00:02:40.200> for<00:02:40.410> for<00:02:40.739> me<00:02:40.980> I

would<00:02:41.700> take<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.030> FA<00:02:42.299> Cup<00:02:42.569> and<00:02:42.750> if<00:02:42.810> they

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
would take the FA Cup and if they

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.320 
would take the FA Cup and if they
slipped<00:02:43.260> out<00:02:43.440> in<00:02:43.560> fifth<00:02:44.130> place<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.610> think<00:02:44.940> that

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
slipped out in fifth place I think that

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.910 
slipped out in fifth place I think that
the<00:02:45.420> pressure<00:02:45.720> that<00:02:45.840> will<00:02:46.110> take<00:02:46.319> off<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.799> the

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
the pressure that will take off of the

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.229 
the pressure that will take off of the
club<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.459> players<00:02:47.760> that<00:02:47.880> are<00:02:48.030> there<00:02:48.209> now

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
club and the players that are there now

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.020 
club and the players that are there now
for<00:02:48.989> him<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.260> build<00:02:49.500> would<00:02:50.099> help<00:02:50.340> them<00:02:50.489> because

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
for him to build would help them because

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.009 
for him to build would help them because
I<00:02:51.120> think<00:02:51.180> they're<00:02:51.420> under<00:02:51.569> a<00:02:51.690> lot<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:51.930> pressure

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
I think they're under a lot of pressure

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.800 
I think they're under a lot of pressure
with<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.640> history<00:02:54.239> of<00:02:54.390> what's<00:02:54.569> happening

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
of that back but then I take Clinton's

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.220 
of that back but then I take Clinton's
point<00:03:40.769> as<00:03:40.920> well<00:03:41.100> though<00:03:41.280> if<00:03:42.269> we<00:03:42.569> don't<00:03:42.840> have<00:03:43.079> it

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
point as well though if we don't have it

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.620 
point as well though if we don't have it
then<00:03:43.889> you<00:03:44.250> you<00:03:44.670> say<00:03:45.060> we've<00:03:45.269> had<00:03:45.299> problems

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
spend now that it's definitely very

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.340 
spend now that it's definitely very
definitely<00:03:56.579> a<00:03:56.700> hundred<00:03:57.090> not<00:03:57.299> million<00:03:58.139> there

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
definitely a hundred not million there

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.030 
definitely a hundred not million there
so<00:03:58.650> if<00:03:59.250> we've<00:03:59.850> got<00:03:59.880> the<00:04:00.150> Champions<00:04:00.569> League<00:04:00.600> and
