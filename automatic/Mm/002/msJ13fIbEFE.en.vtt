 I think I want to blow blow Youtube degree or blog or yes yes ah 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:54.110
 If you do not want to be a student and you are going to be able to earn something yourself 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.110

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.690

 Apart also entitled door Well employment 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:13.880
 I think it's good, but I think people who have that kind of thing 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:17.780
 Nde because low wages in the workshop I that long working hours, such as medium-Yeah is commonplace anymore 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.720
 People wings to app employment from the other now 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:25.210
 Young people 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:29.670
 As earn in it attached to the firm learn something this way my ability without'm kind of 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.670
 I think it is best to be 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.740
 Or hey 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:42.520
 A company that can do its own business while getting paid 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:48.470
 I think that way of working that I think has increased recently 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:55.280
 Because I think that it is really what one in this for Tteyuu to depend on whether the risk 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:59.270
 Nde are substantial large companies Toka I ne training Toka various business etiquette and feather That's a it 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.460
 It is very good, but after all I entered and my sister 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:06.440
 What I mean even better 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:08.160
 I get bored, there is no stimulation, and I can not improve my ability 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.090
 Quite 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:19.050
 SMEs conversely training and mother at all 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:24.650
 There are a lot of people who are not fulfilling and want to cut their own stomach 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:26.690
 You will have a lot of opportunities for yourself in minutes, so you can compete 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.640
 It will come to rock 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:37.720
 It is also in large companies in the small and medium-sized enterprises, of course not 's only good company 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.720
 Try not selected Toka it Nde full there it is because strange company 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:48.100
 In The most important thing is still is its full capacity 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.970
 I have always been making money with my own ability 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:58.230
 It's finally good to move 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:03:04.440
 Feeling like a Nowak salary if they were arrived at work for days to why what poster or in order to get the salary 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:06.770
 As I think I think it will be good from now on, I firmly use my own ability for one month 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:13.250
 Even if it works 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:16.270
 I think the best condition is that you can make a profit enough and you have income . 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.270
 By all means 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:24.170
 Those who do job hunting from now on are like that 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.319
 But it might be slow speaking now Te him from now 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:34.340
 I think a good idea to sleep that kind of preparation 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:36.720
 If I can go back, dance at the first year of college and go back at 18 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:41.940
 Yeah I used the Internet 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:45.050
 Blogs, youtube, etc. I already have spare time everyday 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.050
 University student 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:54.210
 Nde be sold with or Toka did you Toka and out of class often I still spare time 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:59.080
 I wish I was Hoshiya in the so called time 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:05.590
 And or crazy to take this kind of tube I or crazy to write blog 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:08.880
 I think Nde a span of four years can be quite a lot of countries You know if there 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:13.890
 Difficult-to-work it that he can enjoy 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:18.040
 I think that it will be possible to earn income by doing it at work 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:21.760
 I think I can work for a long time without hesitation 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.310

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.310

 18 is because I wish I should have done at the time of 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:36.230
 There is a bit 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:39.550
 I think that 18-year-old people are really a chance now 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:42.760
 Firm ne of the last four years 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:47.289
 No say a state in which there is an income without a job 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:50.190
 I think it is the best choice to make 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:54.969
 If the sub-channel in such a thing 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:05:01.529
