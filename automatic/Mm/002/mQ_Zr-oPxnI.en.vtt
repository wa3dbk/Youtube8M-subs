going<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.610> want<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.970> power<00:02:03.150> supply<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:05.360> for

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
going to want a power supply and for

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.410 
going to want a power supply and for
this<00:02:06.450> computer<00:02:06.930> we're<00:02:07.140> going<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.320> be<00:02:07.409> using<00:02:07.439> a

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
this computer we're going to be using a

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.240 
this computer we're going to be using a
PSP<00:02:09.420> power<00:02:09.750> supply<00:02:10.400> it's<00:02:11.400> got<00:02:12.290> this<00:02:13.290> end

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
PSP power supply it's got this end

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.860 
PSP power supply it's got this end
and<00:02:14.690> got<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.840> plug<00:02:16.760> you<00:02:17.760> can<00:02:17.910> see<00:02:18.150> this<00:02:18.690> is

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
and got the plug you can see this is

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.870 
and got the plug you can see this is
more<00:02:19.260> this<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.620> overkill<00:02:20.010> for<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.610> kind<00:02:20.820> of

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
more this is overkill for the kind of

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.490 
more this is overkill for the kind of
computer<00:02:21.120> we're<00:02:21.360> building<00:02:23.000> more<00:02:24.000> fans<00:02:24.500> this

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
computer we're building more fans this

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.949 
computer we're building more fans this
is<00:02:25.740> too<00:02:26.340> cool<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:27.890> processor<00:02:29.360> in<00:02:30.360> this<00:02:30.690> case

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
is too cool the processor in this case

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.630 
is too cool the processor in this case
we're<00:02:31.140> going<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.320> be<00:02:31.440> using<00:02:31.500> an<00:02:31.950> eight-core

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
we're going to be using an eight-core

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.690 
we're going to be using an eight-core
processor<00:02:33.230> so<00:02:34.230> this<00:02:34.440> it<00:02:35.100> should<00:02:35.310> be<00:02:35.459> enough<00:02:35.640> to

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
processor so this it should be enough to

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.240 
processor so this it should be enough to
cool<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.270> a<00:02:37.010> general-purpose<00:02:38.010> USB<00:02:38.940> cord<00:02:39.390> oh

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
cool it a general-purpose USB cord oh

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.630 
cool it a general-purpose USB cord oh
yeah<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.280> almost<00:02:41.370> forgot<00:02:43.430> you're<00:02:44.430> going<00:02:44.580> to

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
yeah I almost forgot you're going to

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.449 
yeah I almost forgot you're going to
want<00:02:44.820> some<00:02:44.910> speakers<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.750> play<00:02:45.959> your<00:02:46.459> new

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
want some speakers to play your new

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.790 
want some speakers to play your new
music<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.300> whatnot<00:02:48.810> on<00:02:49.080> so<00:02:49.890> we<00:02:50.070> got<00:02:51.110> no<00:02:52.110> see

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
music and whatnot on so we got no see

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.720 
music and whatnot on so we got no see

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
take the wire okay I'm we just zoom in

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:41.060 
take the wire okay I'm we just zoom in
on<00:04:30.990> this<00:04:31.580> right<00:04:32.580> right<00:04:33.120> down<00:04:33.390> her<00:04:38.930> ok<00:04:39.979> so<00:04:40.979> you

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
on this right right down her ok so you

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.600 
on this right right down her ok so you
should<00:04:41.430> have<00:04:41.669> won<00:04:41.910> this<00:04:42.030> is<00:04:42.180> eight<00:04:42.450> right<00:04:42.870> here

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
should have won this is eight right here

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:51.100 
should have won this is eight right here
you're<00:04:44.610> just<00:04:44.700> going<00:04:44.880> to<00:04:44.970> want<00:04:45.120> to<00:04:45.180> take<00:04:45.360> it<00:04:45.630> and

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.409 

make<00:04:52.110> sure<00:04:52.140> it's<00:04:52.500> touching<00:04:52.860> the<00:04:53.729> connection

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
make sure it's touching the connection

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:59.230 
make sure it's touching the connection
and<00:04:56.930> until<00:04:57.930> use<00:04:58.020> wired<00:04:58.349> right<00:04:58.620> into<00:04:58.680> eighth

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
and until use wired right into eighth

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:06.050 
and until use wired right into eighth
that<00:05:00.240> should<00:05:00.300> power<00:05:01.340> then<00:05:02.599> process<00:05:03.599> it<00:05:05.060> okay

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
that should power then process it okay

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.600 
that should power then process it okay
next<00:05:06.380> we<00:05:07.380> gotta<00:05:07.849> hook<00:05:08.849> up<00:05:09.060> the<00:05:09.210> power<00:05:09.419> supply

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
next we gotta hook up the power supply

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.430 
next we gotta hook up the power supply
so<00:05:12.500> so<00:05:13.500> as<00:05:13.800> usual<00:05:14.180> you<00:05:15.180> get<00:05:15.360> a<00:05:15.390> see<00:05:15.930> where<00:05:16.320> it

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
so so as usual you get a see where it

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.740 
so so as usual you get a see where it
says<00:05:16.500> batteries<00:05:17.310> but<00:05:17.610> this<00:05:17.789> is<00:05:18.000> it's<00:05:18.330> a<00:05:18.599> high

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
says batteries but this is it's a high

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.010 
says batteries but this is it's a high
quality<00:05:18.780> computer<00:05:19.710> so<00:05:20.400> we're<00:05:20.640> just<00:05:20.940> going<00:05:21.930> to

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
quality computer so we're just going to

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.460 
quality computer so we're just going to
UM<00:05:22.640> although<00:05:23.640> I<00:05:23.669> let<00:05:23.849> me<00:05:23.970> get<00:05:24.090> my<00:05:24.150> stuff<00:05:24.360> okay

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
get a nice chunk of tape right and

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.500 
get a nice chunk of tape right and
you're<00:05:32.039> going<00:05:32.220> to<00:05:32.280> want<00:05:32.490> to<00:05:32.610> route<00:05:33.330> this<00:05:35.510> so

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
you're going to want to route this so

you're going to want to route this so
it's<00:05:36.750> touching<00:05:37.110> this<00:05:37.740> one<00:05:37.800> negative<00:05:38.580> and<00:05:40.159> just

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 
it's touching this one negative and just

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:48.620 
it's touching this one negative and just
route<00:05:42.539> it<00:05:43.550> cable<00:05:44.550> management<00:05:45.890> and<00:05:47.450> you<00:05:48.450> can

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
route it cable management and you can

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.180 
route it cable management and you can
see<00:05:48.840> that<00:05:48.870> right<00:05:49.229> yeah<00:05:49.680> it's<00:05:49.890> got<00:05:50.039> to<00:05:50.130> be

see that right yeah it's got to be
touching<00:05:50.580> the<00:05:50.880> negative<00:05:51.720> and<00:05:51.990> then<00:05:52.710> just<00:05:53.120> tape

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
touching the negative and then just tape

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:01.010 
touching the negative and then just tape
that<00:05:54.390> in<00:05:54.659> place<00:05:56.450> okay<00:05:57.979> then<00:05:58.979> obviously<00:06:00.020> the
