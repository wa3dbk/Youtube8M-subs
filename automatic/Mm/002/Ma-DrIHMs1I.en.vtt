00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
that looks incredibly dangerous right

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.900 
that looks incredibly dangerous right
because<00:00:31.530> if<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.740> were<00:00:31.860> to<00:00:31.950> build<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.400> in<00:00:32.610> the

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
because if you were to build this in the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.790 
because if you were to build this in the
real<00:00:33.090> world<00:00:33.330> you<00:00:34.080> can<00:00:34.230> see<00:00:34.410> obviously<00:00:34.739> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
real world you can see obviously the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.500

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
pit that I built here and if you were to

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.200 
pit that I built here and if you were to
actually<00:00:38.430> build<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:38.970> you<00:00:39.090> would<00:00:39.180> probably

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
actually build this you would probably

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.760 
actually build this you would probably
come<00:00:39.570> away<00:00:39.750> with<00:00:39.870> like<00:00:39.989> third-degree<00:00:40.410> burns

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
here obviously if I walk - maybe it's

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.310 
here obviously if I walk - maybe it's
not<00:00:56.879> too<00:00:57.059> far<00:00:57.239> away<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:57.570> just<00:00:57.600> it's<00:00:58.140> just

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
not too far away it's just it's just

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.540 
not too far away it's just it's just
when<00:00:58.409> you<00:00:58.500> do<00:00:58.650> certain<00:00:58.890> things<00:00:59.040> for<00:00:59.400> some

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
when you do certain things for some

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.700 
when you do certain things for some
reason<00:00:59.790> it'll<00:00:59.940> glitch<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.379> fire<00:01:01.559> will

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
reason it'll glitch and in the fire will

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.049 
reason it'll glitch and in the fire will
disappear<00:01:02.040> for<00:01:02.159> like<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.309> split<00:01:02.580> second<00:01:02.909> but

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
disappear for like a split second but

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.579 
disappear for like a split second but
then<00:01:03.180> if<00:01:03.479> you<00:01:03.600> walk<00:01:03.839> it'll<00:01:04.140> come<00:01:04.290> right<00:01:04.320> back

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
then if you walk it'll come right back

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.690 
then if you walk it'll come right back
if<00:01:04.799> you're<00:01:04.890> standing<00:01:05.190> at<00:01:05.250> like<00:01:05.370> a<00:01:05.400> certain

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
if you're standing at like a certain

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.880 
if you're standing at like a certain
angle<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.870> can<00:01:07.049> see<00:01:07.260> there<00:01:07.440> actually<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.740> kind

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
angle you can see there actually I kind

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.469 
angle you can see there actually I kind
of<00:01:07.920> messed<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.190> up<00:01:08.250> there<00:01:08.430> but<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.210> can<00:01:09.360> see

of messed it up there but you can see
that<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.720> fire<00:01:09.930> kind<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.440> there<00:01:10.530> see<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:10.920> you

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
that the fire kind of there see so you

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.710 
that the fire kind of there see so you
saw<00:01:11.190> it<00:01:11.220> kind<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.520> disappeared<00:01:11.940> sometimes<00:01:12.600> it

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
saw it kind of disappeared sometimes it

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.609 
saw it kind of disappeared sometimes it
does<00:01:12.840> glitch<00:01:13.080> that's<00:01:13.229> because<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.440> is<00:01:13.590> a

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
does glitch that's because this is a

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.590 
does glitch that's because this is a
little<00:01:13.920> bit<00:01:14.009> of<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.159> glitch<00:01:14.399> and<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.360> guys<00:01:15.509> will

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
little bit of a glitch and you guys will

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.490 
little bit of a glitch and you guys will
see<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:15.869> just<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.079> moment<00:01:16.140> when<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.380> show

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
see that in just a moment when I show

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.539 
see that in just a moment when I show
you<00:01:16.560> how<00:01:16.649> to<00:01:16.710> do<00:01:16.829> this<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.039> anyway<00:01:17.250> this<00:01:17.430> is

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
you how to do this so anyway this is

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.010 
you how to do this so anyway this is
obviously<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.909> video<00:01:18.180> on<00:01:18.329> how<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.539> make<00:01:18.840> a

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
obviously a video on how to make a

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.679 
obviously a video on how to make a
cool-looking<00:01:19.560> bonfire<00:01:20.219> or<00:01:20.460> much<00:01:21.149> larger

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
cool-looking bonfire or much larger

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.200 
cool-looking bonfire or much larger
flames<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.380> typically<00:01:22.770> can<00:01:23.000> if<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.060> go

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
flames and you typically can if I go

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.459 
flames and you typically can if I go
ahead<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.509> grab<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.719> flint<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.140> steel<00:01:25.170> here

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:25.469 
ahead and I grab a flint and steel here

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:27.440 
ahead and I grab a flint and steel here
you<00:01:25.560> can<00:01:25.680> see<00:01:25.829> just<00:01:26.039> exactly<00:01:26.130> what<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.149> flame

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
you can see just exactly what the flame

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.849 
you can see just exactly what the flame
size<00:01:27.719> difference<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.289> here<00:01:28.500> here<00:01:28.770> is

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:28.859 
size difference is here here is

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:30.080 
size difference is here here is
obviously<00:01:29.159> what<00:01:29.280> normal<00:01:29.549> fire<00:01:29.670> looks<00:01:29.909> like

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
obviously what normal fire looks like

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.179 
obviously what normal fire looks like
and<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:31.049> here's<00:01:31.259> what<00:01:31.409> our<00:01:31.500> bonfire<00:01:31.710> flame

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
and and here's what our bonfire flame

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.130 
and and here's what our bonfire flame
looks<00:01:32.369> like<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:33.240> make<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.689> very<00:01:33.960> very

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
looks like so to make this is very very

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.770

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
demonstration here I'm just gonna make

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.289 
demonstration here I'm just gonna make
it<00:01:46.649> 4<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.009> then<00:01:47.340> we're<00:01:47.460> gonna<00:01:47.609> put<00:01:47.850> some<00:01:47.880> lava

it 4 and then we're gonna put some lava

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.599 
it 4 and then we're gonna put some lava
in<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.689> bottom<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.679> this<00:01:49.799> little<00:01:50.070> pit<00:01:50.250> we<00:01:50.369> just

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:50.609 
in the bottom of this little pit we just

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:52.609 
in the bottom of this little pit we just
made<00:01:50.789> followed<00:01:51.659> by<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:51.929> know<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.200> little<00:01:52.439> fire

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
made followed by you know a little fire

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.200 
made followed by you know a little fire
pit<00:01:52.649> ring<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.520> supposed<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.909> keep<00:01:54.060> the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
pit ring that is supposed to keep the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.849 
pit ring that is supposed to keep the
flames<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.719> but<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.170> think<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.469> can<00:01:55.619> probably

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:55.859 
flames in but I think you can probably

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:57.169 
flames in but I think you can probably
tell<00:01:56.159> them<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.429> one<00:01:56.549> over<00:01:56.729> there<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:56.909> doesn't

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
tell them that one over there it doesn't

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.359 
tell them that one over there it doesn't
do<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.810> real<00:01:58.229> accurate<00:01:58.590> job<00:01:58.859> of<00:01:59.070> actually

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
do a a real accurate job of actually

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.770 
do a a real accurate job of actually
keeping<00:01:59.609> the<00:01:59.670> flames<00:01:59.999> you<00:02:00.210> know<00:02:00.240> suppressed

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
keeping the flames you know suppressed

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.929 
keeping the flames you know suppressed
and<00:02:00.929> not<00:02:01.049> burning<00:02:01.350> everybody<00:02:01.829> who's<00:02:02.100> here<00:02:02.399> to

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
uh to enjoy the fire but like I said

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.830 
uh to enjoy the fire but like I said
it's<00:02:05.729> on<00:02:05.819> minecraft<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:06.420> it's<00:02:06.509> not<00:02:06.569> that<00:02:06.630> big

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
it's on minecraft so it's not that big

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.819 
it's on minecraft so it's not that big
of<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.960> deal<00:02:07.109> so<00:02:07.289> you're<00:02:07.439> just<00:02:07.499> gonna<00:02:07.619> go<00:02:07.770> ahead

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
of a deal so you're just gonna go ahead

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.139 
of a deal so you're just gonna go ahead
and<00:02:07.920> Brailled<00:02:08.160> your<00:02:08.340> little<00:02:08.550> ring<00:02:08.700> here<00:02:09.000> and

and Brailled your little ring here and
then<00:02:09.539> all<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.810> really<00:02:09.960> need<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.259> do<00:02:10.380> is<00:02:10.560> just

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
then all you really need to do is just

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.650 
then all you really need to do is just
plop<00:02:11.009> some<00:02:11.280> boats<00:02:11.610> down<00:02:11.880> in<00:02:12.090> there<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.450> they

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
plop some boats down in there and they

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.480 
plop some boats down in there and they
will<00:02:12.810> burn<00:02:13.080> literally<00:02:14.069> forever<00:02:14.280> now<00:02:14.460> you

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
will burn literally forever now you

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
will burn literally forever now you
don't<00:02:14.640> want<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.790> get<00:02:14.880> into<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.150> boat<00:02:15.240> like<00:02:15.420> I

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
don't want to get into the boat like I

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.400 
don't want to get into the boat like I
just<00:02:15.569> did<00:02:15.780> there<00:02:15.930> because<00:02:16.170> that'll<00:02:16.380> uh

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
just did there because that'll uh

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.140 
just did there because that'll uh
that'll<00:02:17.190> kind<00:02:17.340> of<00:02:17.400> mess<00:02:17.550> it<00:02:17.670> up<00:02:17.760> as<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.120> can

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
that'll kind of mess it up as you can

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.240 
that'll kind of mess it up as you can
see<00:02:18.270> I<00:02:18.480> did<00:02:19.230> there<00:02:19.470> okay<00:02:19.710> so<00:02:19.770> let's<00:02:19.920> break<00:02:20.040> that

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
see I did there okay so let's break that

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.160 
see I did there okay so let's break that
it's<00:02:20.700> gonna<00:02:20.820> put<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.000> boat<00:02:21.180> there<00:02:21.450> you're<00:02:22.080> gonna

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
it's gonna put a boat there you're gonna

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.210 
it's gonna put a boat there you're gonna
put<00:02:22.380> a<00:02:22.410> boat<00:02:22.560> there

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
put a boat there

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.380 
put a boat there
I'm<00:02:23.610> gonna<00:02:23.760> put<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:23.970> boat<00:02:24.120> there<00:02:24.270> so<00:02:24.360> I

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
I'm gonna put a boat there so I

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.180 
I'm gonna put a boat there so I
typically<00:02:24.750> try<00:02:24.960> and<00:02:25.200> have<00:02:25.380> you<00:02:25.950> know<00:02:26.040> like

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
typically try and have you know like

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.560 
typically try and have you know like
four<00:02:26.460> boats<00:02:26.700> so<00:02:26.910> it<00:02:27.000> looks<00:02:27.150> like<00:02:27.240> there<00:02:27.390> is<00:02:27.420> a

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
four boats so it looks like there is a

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.810 
four boats so it looks like there is a
raging<00:02:28.230> fire<00:02:28.440> from<00:02:28.710> all<00:02:28.860> around<00:02:29.010> now<00:02:29.700> you're

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
raging fire from all around now you're

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.220 
raging fire from all around now you're
gonna<00:02:29.910> notice<00:02:30.120> when<00:02:30.390> I<00:02:30.450> go<00:02:30.600> ahead<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:30.870> do<00:02:31.080> that

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
gonna notice when I go ahead and do that

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.870 
gonna notice when I go ahead and do that
you<00:02:31.350> can<00:02:31.470> see<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.860> boats<00:02:32.070> are<00:02:32.310> kind<00:02:32.730> of

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
you can see that the boats are kind of

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.070 
you can see that the boats are kind of
sticking<00:02:33.150> through<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.480> outside<00:02:33.780> of<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.900> fire

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
sticking through the outside of the fire

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.720 
sticking through the outside of the fire
pit<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.500> that's<00:02:34.920> gonna<00:02:35.040> be<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.250> little<00:02:35.430> bit<00:02:35.640> of

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
pit and that's gonna be a little bit of

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:36.980 
pit and that's gonna be a little bit of
a<00:02:35.790> problem<00:02:36.030> because<00:02:36.240> it<00:02:36.480> kind<00:02:36.660> of<00:02:36.720> gets<00:02:36.870> where

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
a problem because it kind of gets where

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.810 
a problem because it kind of gets where
the<00:02:37.080> effect<00:02:37.410> of<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.710> fire<00:02:37.890> pit<00:02:38.130> so<00:02:38.610> what<00:02:38.730> you

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
the effect of the fire pit so what you

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
the effect of the fire pit so what you
want<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.000> do<00:02:39.120> is<00:02:39.270> you<00:02:39.330> just<00:02:39.360> want<00:02:39.570> to<00:02:39.600> go<00:02:39.720> ahead

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
want to do is you just want to go ahead

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.630 
want to do is you just want to go ahead
and<00:02:40.020> just<00:02:40.110> kind<00:02:40.320> of<00:02:40.380> walk<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:41.010> push<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.430> boats

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
and just kind of walk and push the boats

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
here I did the exact same thing here

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.390

with<00:03:11.970> with<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.600> boat<00:03:12.810> trick<00:03:13.200> I<00:03:13.230> guess<00:03:13.590> up<00:03:13.800> here

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
with with the boat trick I guess up here

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.130 
with with the boat trick I guess up here
it's<00:03:14.610> just<00:03:14.700> just<00:03:15.240> kind<00:03:15.360> of<00:03:15.480> elevated<00:03:15.930> so<00:03:16.020> it's

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
it's just just kind of elevated so it's

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.230 
it's just just kind of elevated so it's
kind<00:03:16.380> of<00:03:16.470> like<00:03:16.680> a<00:03:16.950> like<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.340> torch<00:03:17.670> like<00:03:18.209> a

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
kind of like a like a torch like a

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.990 
kind of like a like a torch like a
really<00:03:18.630> big<00:03:18.780> torch<00:03:19.080> and<00:03:19.490> yes<00:03:20.490> so<00:03:20.640> you<00:03:20.730> can<00:03:20.880> just

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
really big torch and yes so you can just

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.280 
really big torch and yes so you can just
use<00:03:21.120> in<00:03:21.330> your<00:03:21.420> world<00:03:21.600> if<00:03:21.750> you'd<00:03:21.870> like<00:03:21.990> to<00:03:22.170> you

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
know to create maybe like a campfire

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.610 
know to create maybe like a campfire
site<00:03:23.970> or<00:03:24.450> something<00:03:24.840> like<00:03:24.930> that<00:03:24.990> in<00:03:25.260> since

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
site or something like that in since

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.770 
site or something like that in since
boats<00:03:25.920> for<00:03:26.160> whatever<00:03:26.310> reason<00:03:26.790> do<00:03:27.030> not<00:03:27.060> ever

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
boats for whatever reason do not ever

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.020 
boats for whatever reason do not ever
disappear<00:03:28.590> when<00:03:28.739> they're<00:03:28.860> in<00:03:28.980> lava<00:03:29.220> I<00:03:29.519> don't

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
disappear when they're in lava I don't

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.190 
disappear when they're in lava I don't
know<00:03:30.150> they<00:03:30.269> would<00:03:30.390> literally<00:03:30.600> burn<00:03:30.870> forever

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
know they would literally burn forever

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.660 
know they would literally burn forever
and<00:03:31.560> that's<00:03:31.620> why<00:03:31.830> this<00:03:31.890> is<00:03:32.040> kind<00:03:32.310> of<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.459> glitch

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
and that's why this is kind of a glitch

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.910 
and that's why this is kind of a glitch
because<00:03:33.269> like<00:03:33.959> I<00:03:34.050> said<00:03:34.110> boats<00:03:34.470> probably

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
because like I said boats probably

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.009 
because like I said boats probably
aren't<00:03:35.100> supposed<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.340> burn<00:03:35.489> forever<00:03:35.840> so<00:03:36.840> yeah

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
aren't supposed to burn forever so yeah

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.470 
aren't supposed to burn forever so yeah
that's<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:37.290> thing<00:03:37.440> so<00:03:37.850> anyway<00:03:38.850> this<00:03:39.180> is<00:03:39.239> how<00:03:39.360> you

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
that's a thing so anyway this is how you

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.240 
that's a thing so anyway this is how you
make<00:03:39.750> a<00:03:39.900> really<00:03:40.200> kind<00:03:40.350> of<00:03:40.500> cool<00:03:40.680> realistic

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250
