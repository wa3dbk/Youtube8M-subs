 the reference value 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.990
 in this $ 20 tournament program 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.080
 The play is already here 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.860
 was made and should bring you gains for the first time you would like to 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.479
 and enable them so that s 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.870
 I have to operate with loss of 4 gb of ram 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.779
 I'm going to take care of my accident so they recognize 

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:46.779
 so come on, let's just say yes 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:54.860
 here it opened to have the two options we have the system memory and I 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.960
 I asked him what is the fifth lead placed with 15 points 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:06.530
 the maximum capacity should stay here with glasses four gigabytes 3928 medium and 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.779
 You're going to have to have that wiggle for how much you want to be 

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:13.849
 so let's leave it here with say 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:17.209
 approximately 1 city of mohali 24 months 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:21.710
 here it says that the flash drive and flash memories if it is possible 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.849
 must recommend to queiroz on average you will get a speed of 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:27.820
 boot and up to 5 times higher 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.110
 the random access of the sides the size commissioned by the team of which is to be of 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:33.110
 one to two digits 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.389
 depending on the number of programs you have to speak 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:40.860
 being can only create a cheese file larger than four gigabytes in 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.100
 system 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.789
 he wants to have 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:46.789
 - we choose to adopt or we will click ok 

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:54.379
 At this moment the message here is waiting to allocate queiroz file 

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:57.919
 so it's just we wait here until he reaches the conclusion 

00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:00.550
 in this work 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.960
 and here they ask 'would you like to create a text file and this 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:05.949
 device 

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:08.069
 Let's say yes 

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:11.069
 and wait to note that that fact of the system 

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:17.580
 has information that Ashton will give here the percentage is just waiting for the 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.539
 certain is that 100% 

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:20.569
 to be there 

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:23.569
 ready for use 

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:30.759
 once created that s 

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:35.810
 it already gives results as active and there it is only you then you can use 

00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:37.069
 from your computer 

00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:42.360
 to realize what really gets faster the north on you your 

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.309
