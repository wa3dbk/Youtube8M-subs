welcome to barnyard effects I'm Greg
Aronowitz<00:00:01.800> and<00:00:02.370> I<00:00:02.429> am<00:00:02.520> designing<00:00:02.850> Minecon<00:00:07.820> the

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
Aronowitz and I am designing Minecon the

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.850 
Aronowitz and I am designing Minecon the
furring<00:00:09.179> begins<00:00:09.510> with<00:00:09.719> finding<00:00:10.320> all<00:00:10.530> of<00:00:10.559> the

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
furring begins with finding all of the

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.820 
furring begins with finding all of the
fur<00:00:11.130> that<00:00:11.550> we<00:00:11.700> need<00:00:11.940> it's<00:00:12.540> all<00:00:12.719> synthetic<00:00:13.320> but

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
fur that we need it's all synthetic but

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.470 
fur that we need it's all synthetic but
I<00:00:13.889> really<00:00:14.280> wanted<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.610> capture<00:00:14.849> the

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
I really wanted to capture the

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.080 
I really wanted to capture the
equivalent<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.800> real<00:00:17.039> life<00:00:17.369> animal<00:00:17.850> you

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
equivalent to the real life animal you

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.599 
equivalent to the real life animal you
know<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.359> wolf<00:00:18.570> would<00:00:18.810> have<00:00:18.960> like<00:00:19.170> long<00:00:19.770> hair

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
know the wolf would have like long hair

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.790 
know the wolf would have like long hair
shaggy<00:00:21.060> hair<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.930> cow<00:00:22.109> would<00:00:22.380> have<00:00:22.560> liked

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
shaggy hair and the cow would have liked

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.939 
shaggy hair and the cow would have liked
low<00:00:23.250> pile<00:00:23.580> smooth<00:00:24.330> hair<00:00:24.750> we<00:00:25.380> had<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.650> find<00:00:25.830> it

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
low pile smooth hair we had to find it

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.050 
low pile smooth hair we had to find it
from<00:00:26.099> all<00:00:26.279> these<00:00:26.460> different<00:00:26.609> distributors

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
from all these different distributors

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.630 
from all these different distributors
all<00:00:27.480> around<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.900> world<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.410> then<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:29.220> make<00:00:29.490> it

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
all around the world and then to make it

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.410 
all around the world and then to make it
even<00:00:29.730> harder<00:00:30.060> each<00:00:30.449> animal<00:00:31.109> has<00:00:31.550> up<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.910> you

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
even harder each animal has up to you

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.380 
even harder each animal has up to you
know<00:00:33.540> 15<00:00:34.140> different<00:00:34.620> colors<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:35.850> some

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
know 15 different colors and so some

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.060 
know 15 different colors and so some
like<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.660> cow<00:00:36.870> has<00:00:37.260> like<00:00:37.559> eight<00:00:37.739> different

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
like the cow has like eight different

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.910 
like the cow has like eight different
Browns<00:00:38.550> on<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.120> so<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.570> may<00:00:39.809> find<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.620> perfect

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
Browns on it so you may find the perfect

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.090 
Browns on it so you may find the perfect
length<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.879> texture<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.660> one<00:00:42.960> color<00:00:43.260> but<00:00:43.590> then

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
length and texture in one color but then

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.250 
length and texture in one color but then
you<00:00:44.280> have<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.460> like<00:00:44.789> have<00:00:45.420> matches<00:00:45.960> for<00:00:46.140> all

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
you have to like have matches for all

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.959 
you have to like have matches for all
the<00:00:46.440> different<00:00:46.800> shades<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.430> then<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.879> know

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
the different shades and then you know

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.310 
the different shades and then you know
the<00:00:48.090> grays<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.690> whites<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.260> blacks

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
the grays and the whites and the blacks

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.220 
the grays and the whites and the blacks
so<00:00:50.309> we<00:00:50.399> ended<00:00:50.640> up<00:00:50.730> buying<00:00:50.870> hundreds<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:52.020> yards

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
so we ended up buying hundreds of yards

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.080 
so we ended up buying hundreds of yards
of<00:00:52.590> different<00:00:52.949> fabric<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.520> all<00:00:53.699> different

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
of different fabric of all different

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.080 
of different fabric of all different
kinds<00:00:54.260> ultimately<00:00:55.260> cutting<00:00:56.250> them<00:00:56.399> all<00:00:56.670> into

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
kinds ultimately cutting them all into

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.660 
kinds ultimately cutting them all into
squares<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.289> there's<00:00:58.530> one<00:00:58.829> inch<00:00:59.070> squares<00:00:59.399> and

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
squares and there's one inch squares and

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.549 
squares and there's one inch squares and
two<00:00:59.910> inch<00:01:00.120> squares<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.840> each<00:01:01.020> animal<00:01:01.530> has

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
two inch squares and each animal has

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.130 
two inch squares and each animal has
like<00:01:01.859> set<00:01:02.309> rules<00:01:02.730> but<00:01:03.239> amongst<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.019> different

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
like set rules but amongst the different

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.570 
like set rules but amongst the different
animals<00:01:04.650> there<00:01:04.830> are<00:01:04.920> actually<00:01:05.430> different

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
animals there are actually different

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.420 
animals there are actually different
size<00:01:05.909> pixels<00:01:06.680> after<00:01:07.680> all<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.040> construction

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
size pixels after all the construction

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.380 
size pixels after all the construction
and<00:01:08.760> gritting<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.600> was<00:01:09.900> weeks<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.680> cutting<00:01:11.250> fur

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
and gritting it was weeks of cutting fur

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.690 
and gritting it was weeks of cutting fur
the<00:01:14.260> biggest<00:01:14.440> challenge<00:01:14.920> color<00:01:15.190> match<00:01:15.400> wise

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
the biggest challenge color match wise

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.020 
the biggest challenge color match wise
were<00:01:16.180> probably<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.620> Sheep<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:18.610> white<00:01:18.760> sheep

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
were probably the Sheep the white sheep

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.420 
were probably the Sheep the white sheep
were<00:01:19.210> no<00:01:19.360> problem<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:20.140> synthetic<00:01:20.800> wool<00:01:21.250> that

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
were no problem the synthetic wool that

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.550 
were no problem the synthetic wool that
were<00:01:21.580> using<00:01:21.760> comes<00:01:22.240> in<00:01:22.540> obviously<00:01:23.050> white<00:01:23.320> and

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
were using comes in obviously white and

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.560 
were using comes in obviously white and
off-white<00:01:23.710> and<00:01:24.040> ivory<00:01:24.700> and<00:01:24.940> everything<00:01:25.450> you

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
off-white and ivory and everything you

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.800 
off-white and ivory and everything you
can<00:01:25.750> imagine<00:01:25.950> within<00:01:26.950> that<00:01:27.340> spectrum<00:01:28.000> what<00:01:28.780> I

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
can imagine within that spectrum what I

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:29.910 
can imagine within that spectrum what I
really<00:01:29.080> wanted<00:01:29.260> to<00:01:29.320> have<00:01:29.440> this<00:01:29.590> year<00:01:29.770> was<00:01:29.890> a

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
really wanted to have this year was a

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.980 
really wanted to have this year was a
whole<00:01:30.100> family<00:01:30.400> of<00:01:30.580> the<00:01:30.940> dyed<00:01:31.180> sheep<00:01:31.570> from<00:01:31.900> the

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
whole family of the dyed sheep from the

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.140 
whole family of the dyed sheep from the
game<00:01:32.320> as<00:01:32.650> hard<00:01:33.190> as<00:01:33.250> we<00:01:33.280> tried<00:01:33.580> we<00:01:33.820> couldn't

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
game as hard as we tried we couldn't

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.620 
game as hard as we tried we couldn't
find<00:01:34.420> the<00:01:34.900> wool<00:01:35.380> pre<00:01:35.800> died<00:01:36.100> in<00:01:36.580> all<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.420> range

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
find the wool pre died in all the range

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.120 
find the wool pre died in all the range
of<00:01:37.750> colors<00:01:38.050> that<00:01:38.200> we<00:01:38.320> wanted<00:01:38.680> for<00:01:38.860> the<00:01:38.920> Sheep

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
of colors that we wanted for the Sheep

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.070 
of colors that we wanted for the Sheep
so<00:01:39.550> we<00:01:39.640> had<00:01:39.729> to<00:01:39.820> do<00:01:39.940> it<00:01:40.030> ourselves<00:01:40.150> it's

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
so we had to do it ourselves it's

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.780 
so we had to do it ourselves it's
synthetic<00:01:41.409> so<00:01:42.040> it<00:01:42.190> doesn't<00:01:42.369> take<00:01:42.640> the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
synthetic so it doesn't take the

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.139 
synthetic so it doesn't take the
standardized<00:01:43.300> that<00:01:43.540> you<00:01:43.630> can<00:01:43.750> go<00:01:43.900> out<00:01:44.050> and<00:01:44.080> buy

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
standardized that you can go out and buy

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.880 
standardized that you can go out and buy
the<00:01:46.149> industrial<00:01:46.690> dyes<00:01:46.869> that<00:01:46.899> handle<00:01:47.530> it<00:01:47.649> you

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
the industrial dyes that handle it you

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.350 
the industrial dyes that handle it you
have<00:01:48.070> to<00:01:48.190> do<00:01:48.310> like<00:01:48.460> these<00:01:48.640> huge<00:01:49.090> mass

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
have to do like these huge mass

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.779 
have to do like these huge mass
quantities<00:01:49.869> as<00:01:50.110> if<00:01:50.380> I<00:01:50.590> was<00:01:50.890> manufacturing<00:01:51.610> a

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
quantities as if I was manufacturing a

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:53.580 
quantities as if I was manufacturing a
sheep<00:01:52.030> for<00:01:52.270> everyone<00:01:52.690> attending<00:01:52.960> Minecon

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
sheep for everyone attending Minecon

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.700 
sheep for everyone attending Minecon
which<00:01:54.100> don't<00:01:54.700> get<00:01:54.789> excited<00:01:55.500> it's<00:01:56.500> not

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
which don't get excited it's not

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.130 
which don't get excited it's not
happening<00:01:57.160> so<00:01:58.149> we<00:01:58.300> had<00:01:58.479> to<00:01:58.509> figure<00:01:58.750> out<00:01:58.899> a<00:01:58.960> way

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
happening so we had to figure out a way

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.609 
happening so we had to figure out a way
to<00:01:59.800> hand<00:02:00.789> I<00:02:01.090> these<00:02:01.450> smaller<00:02:01.869> batches<00:02:02.259> of

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
to hand I these smaller batches of

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.350 
to hand I these smaller batches of
colors<00:02:02.920> and<00:02:02.950> now<00:02:03.160> keep<00:02:03.399> in<00:02:03.490> mind<00:02:03.550> these<00:02:04.090> baby

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
colors and now keep in mind these baby

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.139 
colors and now keep in mind these baby
sheep<00:02:04.630> are<00:02:04.780> really<00:02:05.020> small<00:02:05.320> and<00:02:05.789> it's<00:02:06.789> not<00:02:07.119> a

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
sheep are really small and it's not a

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.080 
sheep are really small and it's not a
solid<00:02:07.570> color<00:02:07.750> so<00:02:08.019> the<00:02:08.140> blue<00:02:08.380> sheep<00:02:08.769> has<00:02:09.250> six

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
solid color so the blue sheep has six

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.060 
solid color so the blue sheep has six
different<00:02:10.479> color<00:02:10.630> blues<00:02:10.959> on<00:02:11.290> it<00:02:11.470> so<00:02:11.680> it<00:02:11.860> ends

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
different color blues on it so it ends

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.729 
different color blues on it so it ends
up<00:02:12.130> being<00:02:12.340> just<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.700> few<00:02:13.390> hundred<00:02:13.630> squares<00:02:14.440> of

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
up being just a few hundred squares of

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.620 
up being just a few hundred squares of
each<00:02:14.890> color<00:02:15.130> which<00:02:15.610> really<00:02:15.880> is<00:02:16.060> just<00:02:16.239> a<00:02:16.390> couple

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
each color which really is just a couple

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.710 
each color which really is just a couple
feet<00:02:17.410> like<00:02:17.709> maybe<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:17.980> yard<00:02:18.310> of<00:02:18.579> fabric<00:02:18.790> we

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
feet like maybe a yard of fabric we

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.440 
feet like maybe a yard of fabric we
ended<00:02:20.110> up<00:02:20.200> creating<00:02:20.470> this<00:02:20.709> whole<00:02:21.010> system<00:02:21.760> that

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
ended up creating this whole system that

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.490 
ended up creating this whole system that
allowed<00:02:22.989> us<00:02:23.019> to<00:02:23.230> use<00:02:23.410> like<00:02:24.220> acrylic<00:02:24.579> dyes<00:02:24.940> that

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
allowed us to use like acrylic dyes that

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.830 
allowed us to use like acrylic dyes that
the<00:02:26.500> fabric<00:02:26.739> was<00:02:27.610> processed<00:02:28.180> through<00:02:28.420> and<00:02:28.630> we

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
the fabric was processed through and we

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.870 
the fabric was processed through and we
had<00:02:28.959> to<00:02:29.110> diet<00:02:29.620> multiple<00:02:30.280> times<00:02:30.489> to<00:02:30.610> get<00:02:30.760> the

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
had to diet multiple times to get the

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.150 
had to diet multiple times to get the
different<00:02:31.150> densities<00:02:31.900> of<00:02:31.930> color<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.709> then

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
different densities of color and then

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.830 
different densities of color and then
there<00:02:33.459> was<00:02:33.519> a<00:02:33.610> whole<00:02:33.760> drying<00:02:34.120> system<00:02:34.630> with

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
there was a whole drying system with

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.979 
there was a whole drying system with
these<00:02:35.019> blowers<00:02:35.620> that<00:02:35.950> were<00:02:36.040> created<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:36.989> it

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
these blowers that were created and it

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.660 
these blowers that were created and it
became<00:02:38.230> quite<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.829> project<00:02:39.010> but<00:02:39.280> in<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.549> end

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
became quite the project but in the end

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.400 
became quite the project but in the end
I<00:02:40.030> think<00:02:40.299> it<00:02:40.600> was<00:02:40.690> worth<00:02:40.810> it<00:02:41.019> because<00:02:41.200> the

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
I think it was worth it because the

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.410 
I think it was worth it because the
whole<00:02:41.530> rainbow<00:02:41.769> of<00:02:41.950> she<00:02:42.340> is<00:02:42.579> going<00:02:43.239> to<00:02:43.299> be

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
whole rainbow of she is going to be

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.170 
whole rainbow of she is going to be
something<00:02:43.660> very<00:02:44.620> exciting<00:02:44.890> to<00:02:45.160> see<00:02:48.030> once<00:02:49.030> all

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
something very exciting to see once all

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.660 
something very exciting to see once all
the<00:02:49.209> first<00:02:49.510> cut<00:02:49.930> we<00:02:50.829> have<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.100> begin<00:02:51.250> the

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
the first cut we have to begin the

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.910 
the first cut we have to begin the
process<00:02:51.970> of<00:02:52.269> gluing<00:02:52.750> it<00:02:52.840> actually<00:02:53.350> onto<00:02:53.799> the

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
process of gluing it actually onto the

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.590 
process of gluing it actually onto the
body<00:02:54.070> we<00:02:54.340> use<00:02:54.489> a<00:02:54.519> contact<00:02:55.090> cement<00:02:55.269> that<00:02:55.570> holds

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
body we use a contact cement that holds

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.830 
body we use a contact cement that holds
both<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.680> wood<00:02:56.860> and<00:02:57.269> to<00:02:58.269> the<00:02:58.390> back<00:02:58.570> of<00:02:58.600> the

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
both to the wood and to the back of the

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.380 
both to the wood and to the back of the
fur<00:02:59.049> it's<00:02:59.950> a<00:03:00.070> painstaking<00:03:00.310> process<00:03:00.820> because

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
fur it's a painstaking process because

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.080 
fur it's a painstaking process because
each<00:03:01.570> animal<00:03:02.019> has<00:03:02.049> to<00:03:02.290> have<00:03:02.440> its<00:03:02.590> fur<00:03:03.160> laid<00:03:03.700> in

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
each animal has to have its fur laid in

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.810 
each animal has to have its fur laid in
a<00:03:04.480> specific<00:03:04.959> direction<00:03:05.560> in<00:03:06.250> order<00:03:06.459> to<00:03:06.670> keep

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
a specific direction in order to keep

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.380 
a specific direction in order to keep
the<00:03:06.880> flow<00:03:07.329> of<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.690> hair<00:03:08.019> consistent<00:03:08.380> and<00:03:09.390> it's

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
the flow of the hair consistent and it's

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.690 
the flow of the hair consistent and it's
square<00:03:10.750> by<00:03:10.900> square<00:03:10.959> it<00:03:11.500> gets<00:03:11.709> glued<00:03:12.010> down<00:03:12.280> and

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
square by square it gets glued down and

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.910 
square by square it gets glued down and
we<00:03:12.850> build<00:03:13.150> it<00:03:13.269> up<00:03:13.390> until<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.900> whole<00:03:14.109> animal<00:03:14.799> is

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
we build it up until the whole animal is

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:35.750 
we build it up until the whole animal is
covered

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.280 

I<00:03:36.650> think<00:03:37.650> this<00:03:37.890> year<00:03:38.340> we<00:03:38.549> did<00:03:38.849> about<00:03:39.420> 30

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
I think this year we did about 30

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.789 
I think this year we did about 30
animals<00:03:40.799> and<00:03:41.659> the<00:03:42.659> whole<00:03:42.900> process<00:03:43.500> took

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
animals and the whole process took

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.080 
animals and the whole process took
around<00:03:44.159> six<00:03:44.640> weeks<00:03:46.400> I'm<00:03:47.400> really<00:03:47.700> excited

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
around six weeks I'm really excited

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.339 
around six weeks I'm really excited
about<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:48.480> animals<00:03:48.840> and<00:03:48.930> we're<00:03:49.079> definitely

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
about the animals and we're definitely

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:50.990 
about the animals and we're definitely
going<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:49.769> be<00:03:49.860> posting<00:03:50.040> lots<00:03:50.310> of<00:03:50.640> pictures<00:03:50.700> and

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
going to be posting lots of pictures and

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.910 
going to be posting lots of pictures and
trying<00:03:51.450> to<00:03:51.599> make<00:03:51.720> sure<00:03:51.870> everybody<00:03:52.530> can<00:03:52.680> see

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
trying to make sure everybody can see

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.680 
trying to make sure everybody can see
them<00:03:53.159> but<00:03:53.489> of<00:03:53.579> course<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:53.879> real<00:03:54.030> joy<00:03:54.329> will<00:03:54.569> be

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
them but of course the real joy will be

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.240 
them but of course the real joy will be
for<00:03:54.900> all<00:03:54.930> those<00:03:55.140> people<00:03:55.200> attending<00:03:55.769> Minecon
