00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
in the vintage vibe and in the original

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.790 
in the vintage vibe and in the original
circuit<00:01:32.690> there<00:01:32.810> was<00:01:32.930> a<00:01:32.960> slight<00:01:33.290> loss<00:01:33.560> the

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
circuit there was a slight loss the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.250 
circuit there was a slight loss the
effect<00:01:34.160> much<00:01:34.400> like<00:01:34.610> a<00:01:34.640> wah-wah<00:01:34.910> pedal<00:01:35.090> and<00:01:35.600> you

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
effect much like a wah-wah pedal and you

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.460 
effect much like a wah-wah pedal and you
can<00:01:36.410> hear<00:01:36.620> that<00:01:36.830> here<00:01:37.430> now<00:01:37.970> this<00:01:41.350> just<00:01:42.350> very

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
can hear that here now this just very

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.850 
can hear that here now this just very
subtle<00:01:43.100> not<00:01:43.310> a<00:01:43.340> huge<00:01:43.820> difference<00:01:44.120> but<00:01:44.710> to<00:01:45.710> me

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
subtle not a huge difference but to me

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.110 
subtle not a huge difference but to me
one<00:01:46.040> of<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:46.220> things<00:01:46.430> that<00:01:46.610> makes<00:01:46.790> this<00:01:46.910> vibe

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
one of the things that makes this vibe

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.300 
one of the things that makes this vibe
sound<00:01:47.510> so<00:01:47.690> good<00:01:47.870> is<00:01:48.140> that<00:01:48.350> it<00:01:48.500> it's<00:01:48.800> an<00:01:48.950> exact

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
sound so good is that it it's an exact

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.760 
sound so good is that it it's an exact
copy<00:01:49.640> of<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:49.940> original<00:01:50.230> univibe<00:01:51.230> and<00:01:51.440> in<00:01:51.530> fact

copy of the original univibe and in fact

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.890 
copy of the original univibe and in fact
you<00:01:51.980> can<00:01:52.160> swap<00:01:52.760> parts<00:01:53.150> in<00:01:53.300> and<00:01:53.450> out<00:01:53.540> from<00:01:53.780> an

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
you can swap parts in and out from an

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.780 
you can swap parts in and out from an
original<00:01:54.080> to<00:01:54.440> this<00:01:54.560> or<00:01:54.830> vice<00:01:54.860> versa

original to this or vice versa

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.020 
original to this or vice versa
there's<00:01:56.540> no<00:01:56.800> attempt<00:01:57.800> to<00:01:57.890> buffer<00:01:58.400> and<00:01:58.760> to

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
there's no attempt to buffer and to

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.860 
there's no attempt to buffer and to
create<00:01:59.840> op<00:01:59.990> amp<00:02:00.290> kind<00:02:01.070> of<00:02:01.160> buffered<00:02:01.940> outputs

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
create op amp kind of buffered outputs

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.980 
create op amp kind of buffered outputs
to<00:02:03.020> make<00:02:03.200> things<00:02:03.470> louder<00:02:04.000> and<00:02:05.000> increase<00:02:05.780> the

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
to make things louder and increase the

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.750 
to make things louder and increase the
gain<00:02:06.140> like<00:02:06.350> you<00:02:06.500> see<00:02:06.680> in<00:02:06.740> some<00:02:07.010> and<00:02:07.370> I<00:02:07.550> think

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
gain like you see in some and I think

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.130 
gain like you see in some and I think
that's<00:02:07.910> what<00:02:08.090> contributes<00:02:08.599> to<00:02:08.660> this<00:02:08.899> thing

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
that's what contributes to this thing

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.860 
that's what contributes to this thing
having<00:02:09.500> such<00:02:09.739> a<00:02:09.770> vintage<00:02:10.160> effect<00:02:10.550> and<00:02:10.840> such<00:02:11.840> a

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
having such a vintage effect and such a

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:33.510 
having such a vintage effect and such a
great<00:02:12.379> vibe<00:02:12.620> if<00:02:12.950> you<00:02:13.069> will

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.920 

both<00:02:34.520> try<00:02:34.790> changing<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.690> intensity

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:57.350 

making<00:02:40.769> the<00:02:40.890> speed<00:02:41.129> a<00:02:41.159> little<00:02:41.280> slower<00:02:56.209> you<00:02:57.209> can

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
making the speed a little slower you can

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:08.750 
making the speed a little slower you can
hear<00:02:57.629> it<00:02:57.720> go<00:02:57.930> from<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.409> very<00:02:58.680> deep<00:03:07.430> to<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.459> more

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
hear it go from a very deep to a more

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:16.369 
hear it go from a very deep to a more
subtle<00:03:14.329> and<00:03:15.329> notice<00:03:15.629> how<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.810> sound<00:03:16.170> of<00:03:16.290> the

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
subtle and notice how the sound of the

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:32.420 
subtle and notice how the sound of the
guitar<00:03:28.099> remains<00:03:29.099> intact<00:03:30.709> does<00:03:31.709> not<00:03:31.920> process

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
guitar remains intact does not process

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.970 
guitar remains intact does not process
the<00:03:32.609> sound<00:03:32.849> overly<00:03:33.299> and<00:03:33.659> again<00:03:34.620> that's<00:03:34.859> what

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
the sound overly and again that's what

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.530 
the sound overly and again that's what
contributes<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.549> this<00:03:35.670> thing<00:03:35.909> sounding<00:03:36.329> so

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
contributes to this thing sounding so

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.110 
contributes to this thing sounding so
great<00:03:36.780> now<00:03:37.349> if<00:03:37.409> we<00:03:37.500> get<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:37.709> back<00:03:37.859> up<00:03:38.069> to<00:03:38.400> what

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
great now if we get it back up to what

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.630 
great now if we get it back up to what
the<00:03:39.540> recommended<00:03:39.989> sort<00:03:40.200> of<00:03:40.290> Jimi<00:03:40.620> setting<00:03:41.459> is

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
the recommended sort of Jimi setting is

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.240 
the recommended sort of Jimi setting is
for<00:03:41.970> it<00:03:45.260> and<00:03:46.260> let's<00:03:46.530> add<00:03:46.709> a<00:03:46.739> little<00:03:47.010> bit<00:03:47.160> of

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
for it and let's add a little bit of

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.409 
for it and let's add a little bit of
fuzz<00:03:47.489> I'm<00:03:47.669> going<00:03:47.790> to<00:03:47.849> turn<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.090> guitars

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
fuzz I'm going to turn the guitars

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:50.300 
fuzz I'm going to turn the guitars
volume<00:03:48.780> down<00:03:48.959> because<00:03:49.319> the<00:03:49.470> fuzz<00:03:49.680> sounds<00:03:50.040> best

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
volume down because the fuzz sounds best

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.159 
volume down because the fuzz sounds best
