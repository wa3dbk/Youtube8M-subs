the end three sniping it's a etc so I

the end three sniping it's a etc so I
just<00:00:43.140> wanted<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.440> clear<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.710> few<00:00:44.010> things<00:00:44.070> up

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
just wanted to clear a few things up

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.080 
just wanted to clear a few things up
essentially<00:00:45.809> as<00:00:46.020> far<00:00:46.469> as<00:00:46.649> we<00:00:46.829> know<00:00:47.070> there<00:00:47.940> is

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
essentially as far as we know there is

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.240 
essentially as far as we know there is
no<00:00:48.329> reason<00:00:48.750> for<00:00:48.989> us<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.230> feel<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:50.100> you

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
no reason for us to feel that you

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.229 
no reason for us to feel that you
sniping<00:00:50.700> will<00:00:50.820> not<00:00:51.030> be<00:00:51.239> viable<00:00:51.840> for<00:00:52.520> ghosts<00:00:53.520> we

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
sniping will not be viable for ghosts we

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.260 
sniping will not be viable for ghosts we
think<00:00:54.510> from<00:00:55.050> what<00:00:55.199> we've<00:00:55.350> heard<00:00:55.379> that

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
think from what we've heard that

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.880 
think from what we've heard that
although<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.570> may<00:00:57.780> take<00:00:58.020> something<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.800> an

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
although it may take something of an

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.529 
although it may take something of an
adjustment<00:00:59.309> on<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.579> players<00:00:59.879> part<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.390> may

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
adjustment on the players part it may

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.150 
adjustment on the players part it may
take<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.780> bit<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:01.050> getting<00:01:01.140> used<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.980> will

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
take a bit of getting used to it will

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.910 
take a bit of getting used to it will
probably<00:01:02.430> be<00:01:02.730> different<00:01:03.270> as<00:01:03.840> far<00:01:04.229> as<00:01:04.710> we<00:01:04.890> are

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
probably be different as far as we are

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.580 
probably be different as far as we are
concerned<00:01:05.240> East<00:01:06.240> Liping<00:01:06.750> will<00:01:07.080> still<00:01:07.409> be

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
concerned East Liping will still be

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.399 
concerned East Liping will still be
completely<00:01:08.340> viable<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.970> call<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.600> duty<00:01:09.720> ghosts

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
completely viable in call of duty ghosts

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.070 
completely viable in call of duty ghosts
that<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.040> our<00:01:11.490> current<00:01:12.000> feeling<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.540> until<00:01:12.869> we

a lot of the players that have tried
that<00:02:34.959> quite<00:02:35.439> enjoyed<00:02:35.799> it<00:02:35.950> they<00:02:36.099> said<00:02:36.310> that<00:02:36.489> it

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
that quite enjoyed it they said that it

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.789 
that quite enjoyed it they said that it
was<00:02:36.750> more<00:02:37.750> entertaining<00:02:38.019> that<00:02:38.439> way<00:02:38.590> so<00:02:38.650> that

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
was more entertaining that way so that

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:39.929 
was more entertaining that way so that
is<00:02:39.010> certainly<00:02:39.310> something<00:02:39.370> that<00:02:39.639> we<00:02:39.819> will

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:39.939 
is certainly something that we will

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:41.970 
is certainly something that we will
consider<00:02:40.269> going<00:02:41.079> into<00:02:41.319> the<00:02:41.469> call<00:02:41.650> of<00:02:41.769> duty

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
consider going into the call of duty

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.390 
consider going into the call of duty
ghosts<00:02:42.189> obviously<00:02:43.079> it<00:02:44.079> will<00:02:44.349> we<00:02:44.859> will<00:02:45.040> have<00:02:45.189> to

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
ghosts obviously it will we will have to

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.629 
ghosts obviously it will we will have to
consider<00:02:46.299> the<00:02:46.859> specifics<00:02:47.859> won't<00:02:48.069> we<00:02:48.159> act<00:02:48.340> once

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:48.639 
consider the specifics won't we act once

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:50.490 
consider the specifics won't we act once
we<00:02:48.760> actually<00:02:48.849> get<00:02:49.150> on<00:02:49.269> to<00:02:49.389> the<00:02:49.419> game<00:02:49.689> we're<00:02:50.379> not

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
we actually get on to the game we're not

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.319 
we actually get on to the game we're not
going<00:02:50.650> to<00:02:50.709> make<00:02:50.769> any<00:02:50.829> judgments<00:02:51.489> about<00:02:51.639> it<00:02:52.090> how

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
going to make any judgments about it how

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.199 
going to make any judgments about it how
competitively<00:02:53.049> viable<00:02:53.469> it<00:02:53.620> will<00:02:53.769> be<00:02:53.889> until<00:02:54.760> we

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
competitively viable it will be until we

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.179 
competitively viable it will be until we
actually<00:02:55.379> experience<00:02:56.379> it<00:02:56.530> however<00:02:56.919> that<00:02:57.040> is

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:57.189 
actually experience it however that is

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:58.500 
actually experience it however that is
potentially<00:02:57.849> something<00:02:58.120> that<00:02:58.239> we<00:02:58.329> could

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
potentially something that we could

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.559 
potentially something that we could
consider<00:02:58.780> for<00:02:59.530> ghosts<00:03:00.040> so<00:03:00.459> those<00:03:01.150> of<00:03:01.180> you<00:03:01.419> who

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
consider for ghosts so those of you who

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.000 
consider for ghosts so those of you who
have<00:03:01.689> been<00:03:01.870> asking<00:03:02.230> about<00:03:02.439> the<00:03:02.560> roof<00:03:02.739> set

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
have been asking about the roof set

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.439 
have been asking about the roof set
given<00:03:03.340> that<00:03:03.459> some<00:03:03.760> people<00:03:04.030> have<00:03:04.060> been<00:03:04.150> trying

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:04.449 
given that some people have been trying

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:07.259 
given that some people have been trying
out<00:03:04.859> some<00:03:05.859> variations<00:03:06.459> to<00:03:06.549> that<00:03:06.819> recently

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
out some variations to that recently

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.629 
out some variations to that recently
that<00:03:07.750> is<00:03:07.870> your<00:03:07.989> answer<00:03:08.139> for<00:03:08.469> you<00:03:08.680> we<00:03:08.949> do<00:03:09.310> not

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:09.639 
that is your answer for you we do not

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.729 
that is your answer for you we do not
have<00:03:09.879> any<00:03:09.939> plans<00:03:10.329> of<00:03:10.599> changing<00:03:11.439> for<00:03:11.590> black<00:03:11.709> ops

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.099 
have any plans of changing for black ops
2<00:03:12.099> however<00:03:12.370> moving<00:03:13.359> into<00:03:13.540> ghosts<00:03:13.750> it<00:03:13.989> is

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
2 however moving into ghosts it is

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:16.679 
2 however moving into ghosts it is
possible<00:03:14.709> and<00:03:14.919> that<00:03:14.980> is<00:03:15.819> not<00:03:16.120> set<00:03:16.359> and<00:03:16.480> so<00:03:16.629> on

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:16.689 
possible and that is not set and so on

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:18.360 
possible and that is not set and so on
obviously<00:03:17.230> we<00:03:17.500> will<00:03:17.650> see<00:03:18.009> what<00:03:18.099> the<00:03:18.220> community

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
obviously we will see what the community

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.969 
obviously we will see what the community
wants<00:03:18.639> we<00:03:19.090> will<00:03:19.120> see<00:03:19.419> how<00:03:19.540> it<00:03:19.569> plays<00:03:19.840> but<00:03:20.709> it<00:03:20.829> is

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:20.979 
wants we will see how it plays but it is

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:22.170 
wants we will see how it plays but it is
possible<00:03:21.280> that<00:03:21.699> we<00:03:21.759> will<00:03:21.909> make<00:03:22.060> some

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
possible that we will make some

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.659 
possible that we will make some
adjustments<00:03:22.659> of<00:03:22.840> that<00:03:23.379> form<00:03:23.709> going<00:03:24.459> into

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:24.669 
adjustments of that form going into

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:27.119 
adjustments of that form going into
college<00:03:24.819> egos<00:03:25.299> so<00:03:25.750> essentially<00:03:26.319> those<00:03:26.949> are

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
college egos so essentially those are

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:28.979 
college egos so essentially those are
our<00:03:27.250> plans<00:03:27.489> free<00:03:27.879> sniping<00:03:28.329> going<00:03:28.629> into<00:03:28.840> call
