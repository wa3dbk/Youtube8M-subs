00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:06.509
 and or charles bronson here 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:12.809
 and in this video I'm going to show hamburg 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:14.940
 ex of nintendo 3ds xl or nintendo 3ds 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.199
 excel 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.710
 so this is the box brings some 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:27.420
 information on the 3d screen and 90 percent 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:33.660
 larger than 3 ds original but let's 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:35.280
 open the zero box that is afraid inside 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.530
 of the carton 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.719
 here are some augmented cards 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.059
 reality I do not know 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.090
 correct pronunciation in Portuguese then 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:52.410
 I'd rather not talk about five more cards 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:56.969
 that you can use the link in 3ds to 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:00.690
 do some some interactive games and 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.090
 so then comes five free cards 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:12.540
 or a card you can register 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:18.500
 your 3ds in the club understand the manual is well 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.500
 bacana color photos in english 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.619
 the quick manual in the afternoon 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.970
 You use it this way faster. 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.970
 possible 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:40.759
 direct information information 3ds and 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:53.490
 here it is 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:57.070
 this is the 3ds xl excel that deals with the 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:00.100
 black as you can see very handsome 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.320
 it's part of 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.610
 so as you can see he is well 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.740
 large and larger than the original 90% 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.360
 bigger 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.360
 I did not get near here. 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.620
 so here it is is if the 3d screen up there in 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.440
 top 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:25.530
 here you can choose the intensity of the 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.530
 3d in logic 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:45.390
 unfortunately only one analog 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:49.630
 second you have to buy the volume 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:53.500
 here is the wifi and it came with a 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:03:05.820
 four gigs or so it already comes with 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:05.820
 card and four garters a good thing 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:17.190
 so this one I understand 3 ds xl well 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.190
 beautiful 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:28.700
 with headphones sorry for loud speakers here 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:32.019
 the speakers and the first thing I noticed 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.700
 which is very heavy I found very heavy 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:37.040
 heavier than the playstation vita that 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:41.410
 playstation vita and to compare you 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.410
 can see from the mother 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:55.480
 there is having a 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.900
 that you can have a sense of the 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:11.580
 size of the islands schmidt a little 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:13.980
 greater is clear but there is also 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:21.470
 playstation vita is a little bigger 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:28.800
 the ong also in 3d are two screens 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:32.940
 So it's very similar to size and I 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.010
 I paid 220 euros before people 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:39.720
 start asking me how much I paid 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:45.660
 I paid 220 euros and I bought it on 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:48.270
 amazon of england was 220 euros and one 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.390
 What I find annoying is that you need 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:56.820
 buy the club 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:05:00.840
 load your nintendo 3ds 3 ds xl it 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:04.160
 does not come with an adapter to charge the 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:08.010
 which indicates how you can see here 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:12.750
 ridiculous part of nintendo do this 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:15.120
 I found none that has to come is 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.690
 with the adapter you have purchased by 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.510
 separate but this is personal and not 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.250
 show the system working because I 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.320
 I intend to do some videos but then 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.050
 anyone who has questions about the console 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:31.140
 Please ask, please leave the 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.560
 comments that I will be happy in 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:38.870
 answer the 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.870
 but that's it until the next video i
