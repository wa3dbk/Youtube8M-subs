00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
pressed paper and on the right we have a

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.380 
pressed paper and on the right we have a
sheet<00:00:54.710> of<00:00:54.800> rough<00:00:54.980> paper<00:00:55.220> and<00:00:55.550> this<00:00:56.000> is<00:00:56.120> just<00:00:56.270> to

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
sheet of rough paper and this is just to

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.549 
sheet of rough paper and this is just to
demonstrate<00:00:56.420> the<00:00:56.960> big<00:00:57.109> difference<00:00:57.500> that

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
demonstrate the big difference that

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.799 
demonstrate the big difference that
paper<00:00:57.890> makes<00:00:58.190> to<00:00:58.370> watercolor<00:00:58.640> painting<00:00:59.329> and

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
paper makes to watercolor painting and

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.240 
paper makes to watercolor painting and
you'll<00:00:59.930> find<00:01:00.170> it<00:01:00.289> is<00:01:00.410> much<00:01:00.770> much<00:01:01.010> more

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
you'll find it is much much more

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.189 
you'll find it is much much more
difficult<00:01:01.730> to<00:01:02.030> get<00:01:02.149> an<00:01:02.269> even<00:01:02.600> wash<00:01:02.870> on<00:01:03.109> the

difficult to get an even wash on the
smooth<00:01:03.410> paper<00:01:03.739> if<00:01:04.100> I<00:01:04.430> give<00:01:04.610> some<00:01:04.910> nice<00:01:05.089> watery

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
smooth paper if I give some nice watery

smooth paper if I give some nice watery

the<00:01:08.090> paper<00:01:08.450> you<00:01:08.960> can<00:01:09.140> see<00:01:09.440> just<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.100> way<00:01:10.250> the

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
the paper you can see just the way the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.160 
the paper you can see just the way the
pin<00:01:11.690> runs<00:01:12.080> it<00:01:12.530> forms<00:01:13.250> lines<00:01:13.610> and<00:01:14.179> it's<00:01:14.810> not

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
pin runs it forms lines and it's not

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.200 
pin runs it forms lines and it's not
terribly<00:01:15.740> even<00:01:16.369> at<00:01:16.490> all<00:01:16.640> it's<00:01:16.880> quite

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
terribly even at all it's quite

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.719 
terribly even at all it's quite
difficult<00:01:17.630> to<00:01:17.990> control<00:01:18.500> on<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:19.250> hot<00:01:19.399> pressed

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
difficult to control on the hot pressed

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.060 
difficult to control on the hot pressed
paper<00:01:19.820> and<00:01:20.539> for<00:01:20.690> this<00:01:20.780> reason<00:01:21.020> people<00:01:21.470> tend<00:01:21.920> to

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
paper and for this reason people tend to

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.760 
paper and for this reason people tend to
use<00:01:22.190> a<00:01:22.820> slightly<00:01:23.539> coarse<00:01:23.810> or<00:01:23.990> paper<00:01:24.200> in<00:01:24.649> this

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
use a slightly coarse or paper in this

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.050 
use a slightly coarse or paper in this
case<00:01:24.950> with<00:01:25.130> the<00:01:25.280> rough<00:01:25.429> paper<00:01:25.640> at<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:25.940> other

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
case with the rough paper at the other

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.850 
case with the rough paper at the other
extreme<00:01:26.479> I'll<00:01:26.660> do<00:01:26.780> exactly<00:01:27.140> the<00:01:27.350> same<00:01:27.380> thing

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
extreme I'll do exactly the same thing

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.859 
extreme I'll do exactly the same thing
with<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:28.490> same<00:01:28.670> mix<00:01:28.939> of<00:01:29.119> burnt<00:01:29.329> sienna<00:01:29.659> and

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
with the same mix of burnt sienna and

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.929 
with the same mix of burnt sienna and
you<00:01:30.380> will<00:01:30.530> see<00:01:30.799> this<00:01:30.979> time<00:01:31.310> that<00:01:31.549> the<00:01:31.729> wash

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
you will see this time that the wash

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.300 
you will see this time that the wash
goes<00:01:32.180> on<00:01:32.329> much<00:01:32.509> more<00:01:32.780> evenly<00:01:33.140> just<00:01:33.829> exactly

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
goes on much more evenly just exactly

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.710 
goes on much more evenly just exactly
the<00:01:34.430> same<00:01:34.640> thing<00:01:34.909> running<00:01:35.210> and<00:01:35.360> dyeing<00:01:35.600> the

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
the same thing running and dyeing the

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.870 
the same thing running and dyeing the
paper<00:01:35.960> same<00:01:36.560> strength<00:01:36.920> of<00:01:37.100> mix<00:01:37.310> just<00:01:37.579> pick<00:01:37.790> up

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
paper same strength of mix just pick up

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.030 
paper same strength of mix just pick up
some<00:01:38.119> more<00:01:38.329> there<00:01:38.540> run<00:01:39.470> it<00:01:39.590> down<00:01:39.740> you'll<00:01:39.920> see

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
some more there run it down you'll see

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.590 
some more there run it down you'll see
there<00:01:40.189> are<00:01:40.280> no<00:01:40.460> lines<00:01:40.759> this<00:01:41.060> time<00:01:41.299> and<00:01:41.479> there

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
there are no lines this time and there

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.240 
there are no lines this time and there
are<00:01:41.720> no<00:01:41.930> drips<00:01:42.200> and<00:01:42.439> that's<00:01:42.860> the<00:01:42.979> essential

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
are no drips and that's the essential

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.770 
are no drips and that's the essential
difference<00:01:43.790> between<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:44.180> two<00:01:44.329> types<00:01:44.600> of

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
rough paper is really slightly easier to

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.399 
rough paper is really slightly easier to
paint<00:01:50.210> on<00:01:50.420> than<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.750> smooth<00:01:50.960> paper<00:01:51.229> and

paint on than the smooth paper and
smooth<00:01:51.619> paper<00:01:51.920> would<00:01:52.100> not<00:01:52.310> be<00:01:52.460> recommended

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790
