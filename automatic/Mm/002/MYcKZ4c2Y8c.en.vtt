00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:07.610
 creative windows xp 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.439
 for this we are going to start 

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:11.469
 control Panel 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.519
 and we go there where he puts user accounts 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.009
 we use accept 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.009
 and of mosquito nets that to the two javier 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:25.569
 what is guest administrator this guest account 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:27.599
 we can activate it 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.599
 so that if we stop a computer someone can use it 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:32.550
 siin 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.590
 that can modify our programs are our applications 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.310
 also can not visualize are not documents that ctk if we activate 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.960
 supplement 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.960
 that are here active account your have the user account 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.420
 this practice 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.620
 and you can already use it end password and without any kind of right 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.530
 d 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.190
 ID 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.420
 we deactivate the account 2000 half order does not work right now 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.100
 and we are going to create a new account create a new account 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.619
 write a man for the new account 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:07.810
 Lets put 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.810
 Javier 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.900
 following 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.900
 and tells us administrator team polymita 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.300
 if we can take us to the right of the team, you can do whatever you want 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.960
 our operating system 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.890
 modify deleted 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.170
 Everything you want 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.370
 mistral programs and so on 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.460
 if we put limited account 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.460
 the user may have his files 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.140
 change passwords change images and so on and 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.540
 to install programs 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.490
 I can be certain programs because there are some 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.940
 that asks us in its edition to be 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.940
 let's fight the clinic 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.890
 when we create an account 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.120
 asks for a password as xavi was set to enter the password 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.830
 click on that account 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.280
 and tell him 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.560
 do we want to create a password here 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.560
 we write the password we want a password 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:15.559
 we repeat the password 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:18.559
 i the question with secret phrases 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:22.089
 stressed that this will will not serve to 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:25.769
 recover our password in case we forget 

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:29.139
 so we are here 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:32.139
 what is my weight called for example 

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:37.429
 and we are to oton cracks is already created points 

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:40.710
 State account 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.529
 activated but never log in 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:46.699
 will not have any kind of configuration file 

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:50.159
 for the configuration files we are going to intercede 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.059
 local disk c document settings we see that we have javier that the account 

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:56.999
 expressing myself 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:03:01.769
 and all the buses do not use it is to be all the things that were all 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:02.809
 users 

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:05.809
 for example desktop all the roles that we believe will have 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.869
 the disc I do not say this 

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:13.639
 the favorites for that the users in the Basque nyse that will have 

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:17.479
 the shared documents 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:22.900
 Insa well because I have my own things that besides not being returned is that 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.289
 will appear 

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:26.369
 for example internet explorer 

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:29.369
 this is apart from what comes out 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.389
 with lights because I for example I have internet explorer here but I do not have 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.389
 They overturned and yet we are private 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.680
 more than 100 thousand documents showed him the documents that we have been creating 

00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:47.099
 to those who can not access 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.689
 javier dos not be able to access these documents even if I enter from here 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:55.029
 because he does not have permission they can only make swords 

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:58.029
 the accounts of other users the users administer 

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:03.430
 Well, with the rest, very simple method, they lack accounts 

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:04.729
 user 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:06.969
 and I hope to leave has served 

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:07.639
 until another
