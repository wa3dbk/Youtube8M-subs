better without the stickers on it so

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.500 
better without the stickers on it so

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
so these bikes are really reliable

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.830 
so these bikes are really reliable
they're<00:05:08.639> like<00:05:08.759> freaking<00:05:09.090> tanks<00:05:09.509> on<00:05:09.659> two

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
they're like freaking tanks on two

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.959 
they're like freaking tanks on two
wheels<00:05:10.110> I<00:05:10.469> mean<00:05:11.099> you<00:05:11.310> can<00:05:11.460> take<00:05:11.639> this<00:05:11.789> thing

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:11.969 
wheels I mean you can take this thing

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:13.909 
wheels I mean you can take this thing
wherever<00:05:12.389> you<00:05:12.539> want<00:05:12.750> the<00:05:13.259> only<00:05:13.440> downfall<00:05:13.680> is

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
wherever you want the only downfall is

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.260 
wherever you want the only downfall is
that's<00:05:14.190> so<00:05:14.430> heavy<00:05:14.669> but<00:05:15.830> it's<00:05:16.830> a<00:05:17.009> it's<00:05:17.520> doable<00:05:17.909> I

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
that's so heavy but it's a it's doable I

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.119 
that's so heavy but it's a it's doable I
mean<00:05:18.629> it<00:05:18.870> has<00:05:18.990> enough<00:05:19.289> power<00:05:19.319> to<00:05:19.620> handle<00:05:20.009> its

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:20.129 
mean it has enough power to handle its

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:23.689 
mean it has enough power to handle its
weight<00:05:20.340> so<00:05:21.379> the<00:05:22.379> fast<00:05:22.590> side<00:05:22.770> I<00:05:23.069> got<00:05:23.400> this<00:05:23.520> thing

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 
weight so the fast side I got this thing

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:29.119 
weight so the fast side I got this thing
going<00:05:23.759> is<00:05:24.120> like<00:05:24.300> around<00:05:24.539> 60<00:05:25.280> 65<00:05:27.110> and<00:05:28.110> yeah<00:05:28.560> so

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:29.129 
going is like around 60 65 and yeah so

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:30.709 
going is like around 60 65 and yeah so
that's<00:05:29.370> basically<00:05:30.150> it

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:30.719 
that's basically it

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:33.709 
that's basically it
oh<00:05:31.639> wow<00:05:32.639> I<00:05:32.879> thought<00:05:33.090> this<00:05:33.270> was<00:05:33.389> gonna<00:05:33.539> be<00:05:33.629> a

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:33.719

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
dang so yeah kind of battery in it I'm
