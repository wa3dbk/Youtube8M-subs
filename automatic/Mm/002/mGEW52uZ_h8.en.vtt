alternative<00:01:10.020> like<00:01:10.410> you<00:01:10.500> were<00:01:10.590> saying<00:01:10.830> if<00:01:10.950> you

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
alternative like you were saying if you

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.500 
alternative like you were saying if you
don't<00:01:11.160> want<00:01:11.370> that<00:01:11.460> jittery<00:01:11.790> boost<00:01:12.120> but<00:01:12.390> then

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
don't want that jittery boost but then

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.570 
don't want that jittery boost but then
also<00:01:12.840> if<00:01:13.140> you're<00:01:13.290> not<00:01:13.410> a<00:01:13.470> coffee<00:01:13.830> drinker<00:01:14.400> you

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
also if you're not a coffee drinker you

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.620 
also if you're not a coffee drinker you
know<00:01:14.760> maybe<00:01:14.940> this<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.360> good<00:01:15.540> alternative

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
know maybe this is a good alternative

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.500 
know maybe this is a good alternative
for<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.170> but<00:01:16.800> is<00:01:17.100> everything<00:01:17.700> positive<00:01:18.300> and

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
for you but is everything positive and

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.320 
for you but is everything positive and
so<00:01:18.660> there's<00:01:19.200> some<00:01:19.350> negative<00:01:19.710> things<00:01:20.060> not<00:01:21.060> all

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
so there's some negative things not all

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.990 
so there's some negative things not all
of<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.630> research<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.260> glowing<00:01:22.670> some<00:01:23.670> studies

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
of the research is glowing some studies

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.580 
of the research is glowing some studies
that<00:01:24.120> have<00:01:24.240> central<00:01:24.600> in<00:01:24.690> South<00:01:24.900> America<00:01:25.380> have

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
that have central in South America have

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.590 
that have central in South America have

found that drinking high quantities of

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.980 
found that drinking high quantities of
the<00:01:27.690> month

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
the month

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.570 
the month
matcha<00:01:28.320> have<00:01:28.620> been<00:01:28.770> linked<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.010> esophageal

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
matcha have been linked to esophageal

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.580 
matcha have been linked to esophageal
cancer<00:01:30.090> but<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.659> might<00:01:30.870> not<00:01:31.020> just<00:01:31.050> not

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
cancer but it might not just not

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.070 
cancer but it might not just not
necessarily<00:01:32.130> be<00:01:32.490> from<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.120> plant<00:01:33.360> per<00:01:33.540> se<00:01:33.750> so

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
necessarily be from the plant per se so

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.990 
necessarily be from the plant per se so
there's<00:01:34.680> another<00:01:34.950> risk<00:01:35.250> associated<00:01:35.640> with

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
there's another risk associated with

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.730 
there's another risk associated with
drinking<00:01:36.480> you<00:01:36.600> know<00:01:36.690> really<00:01:37.110> hot<00:01:37.380> scalding

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
drinking you know really hot scalding

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.090 
drinking you know really hot scalding
