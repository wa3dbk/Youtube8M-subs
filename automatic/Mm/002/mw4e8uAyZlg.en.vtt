00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
going to look like this

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.100 
going to look like this
we<00:03:28.670> slip<00:03:29.000> this<00:03:29.180> there's<00:03:29.390> a<00:03:29.450> lot<00:03:29.660> of<00:03:29.840> different

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
ways to do it and we'll probably show

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.310 
ways to do it and we'll probably show
you<00:03:31.550> a<00:03:31.670> bunch<00:03:31.940> it's<00:03:32.600> gonna<00:03:32.720> slide<00:03:33.080> right<00:03:33.290> over

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
you a bunch it's gonna slide right over

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 
offset it slightly right there we don't

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:44.980 
offset it slightly right there we don't
want<00:03:43.610> to<00:03:43.670> line<00:03:43.850> it<00:03:43.880> up<00:03:44.060> exactly<00:03:44.270> because<00:03:44.810> it'll
