they didn't figure this out yet but then

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.589 
they didn't figure this out yet but then
I<00:02:25.950> thought<00:02:26.040> about<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.609> after<00:02:26.969> a<00:02:27.000> while<00:02:27.090> um

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
I thought about it after a while um

I thought about it after a while um
they've<00:02:28.590> had<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:28.920> lot<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.370> other<00:02:29.549> stuff<00:02:29.639> to<00:02:29.849> deal

almost getting killed by fishface and
dogpound<00:02:35.129> and<00:02:35.879> last<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:36.329> know<00:02:36.389> that<00:02:36.629> in<00:02:36.840> the

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
dogpound and last you know that in the

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.050 
dogpound and last you know that in the

lot on their plate so I guess that was
the<00:02:44.219> last<00:02:44.489> thing<00:02:44.700> on<00:02:44.819> their<00:02:44.970> mind<00:02:45.239> um<00:02:46.639> but<00:02:47.639> uh

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
the last thing on their mind um but uh

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:54.649 
the last thing on their mind um but uh
yeah<00:02:49.049> so<00:02:50.120> so<00:02:51.650> she<00:02:52.650> decides<00:02:53.159> that<00:02:53.659> karai

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659 
yeah so so she decides that karai

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:58.940 
yeah so so she decides that karai
decides<00:02:55.139> to<00:02:55.680> you<00:02:55.919> know<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.970> get<00:02:57.359> them<00:02:57.829> you<00:02:58.829> know

decides to you know to get them you know
a<00:03:00.260> missile<00:03:01.260> launcher<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.739> mini<00:03:02.069> like<00:03:02.489> a<00:03:02.730> soldier

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
a missile launcher a mini like a soldier

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.539 
a missile launcher a mini like a soldier
length<00:03:03.540> missile<00:03:04.260> launcher<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:04.769> they're

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
length missile launcher and they're

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:06.709 
length missile launcher and they're
wondering<00:03:05.849> how<00:03:06.060> are<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.239> going<00:03:06.359> to<00:03:06.450> do<00:03:06.540> that

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:06.719 
wondering how are you going to do that

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:11.599 
wondering how are you going to do that
well<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:09.049> thing<00:03:10.049> is<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:11.250> shredder<00:03:11.489> is

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
well the thing is the shredder is

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.339 
well the thing is the shredder is
expecting<00:03:12.120> a<00:03:12.209> shipment<00:03:12.239> of<00:03:12.599> weapons<00:03:13.049> soon

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
expecting a shipment of weapons soon

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.740 
expecting a shipment of weapons soon
right<00:03:14.189> so<00:03:14.700> all<00:03:14.969> she<00:03:15.480> gotta<00:03:15.689> do<00:03:15.870> is<00:03:16.169> take<00:03:16.379> it<00:03:16.590> and

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
right so all she gotta do is take it and

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.649 
right so all she gotta do is take it and
it's<00:03:19.310> it<00:03:20.310> seems<00:03:20.790> like<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:21.090> foolproof<00:03:21.419> plan

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:21.659 
it's it seems like a foolproof plan

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.319 
it's it seems like a foolproof plan
because<00:03:22.500> all<00:03:22.680> she<00:03:22.709> wants<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.370> do<00:03:23.489> is<00:03:23.699> get<00:03:24.269> rid

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
because all she wants to do is get rid

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.270 
because all she wants to do is get rid
of<00:03:24.479> the<00:03:24.569> kraang<00:03:24.870> she<00:03:25.379> just<00:03:25.560> wants<00:03:25.829> to<00:03:26.010> shoot

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
of the kraang she just wants to shoot

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.890 
of the kraang she just wants to shoot
down<00:03:26.549> that<00:03:26.579> you<00:03:26.940> know<00:03:27.060> that<00:03:27.239> scattered<00:03:27.659> ship

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
down that you know that scattered ship

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.179 
down that you know that scattered ship
and<00:03:28.049> find<00:03:28.260> out<00:03:28.409> what<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.650> kraang<00:03:28.919> ur<00:03:29.040> up<00:03:29.159> to

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:29.189 
and find out what the kraang ur up to

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:32.179 
and find out what the kraang ur up to
whereas<00:03:30.090> shredder<00:03:30.840> has<00:03:31.139> his<00:03:31.439> vendetta<00:03:31.919> and

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:32.189 
whereas shredder has his vendetta and

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:34.429 
whereas shredder has his vendetta and
the<00:03:32.760> turtles<00:03:33.120> are<00:03:33.239> now<00:03:33.389> thinking<00:03:33.689> of<00:03:34.019> hey

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:34.439 
the turtles are now thinking of hey

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:35.780 
the turtles are now thinking of hey
maybe<00:03:34.620> we<00:03:34.769> can<00:03:34.859> get<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.129> drop<00:03:35.159> on<00:03:35.489> shredder

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
maybe we can get the drop on shredder

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.759 
maybe we can get the drop on shredder
finally<00:03:36.329> right<00:03:36.780> so<00:03:37.139> we<00:03:37.290> get<00:03:37.439> the<00:03:37.560> rocket

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
finally right so we get the rocket

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.589 
finally right so we get the rocket
launcher<00:03:37.919> we<00:03:38.459> take<00:03:38.639> down<00:03:38.819> the<00:03:38.970> kraang<00:03:39.239> we<00:03:39.479> get

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
launcher we take down the kraang we get

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.339 
launcher we take down the kraang we get
the<00:03:39.689> drop<00:03:39.870> on<00:03:40.049> shredder<00:03:40.319> um<00:03:41.209> but<00:03:42.209> that<00:03:42.870> plan

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
the drop on shredder um but that plan

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.369 
the drop on shredder um but that plan
doesn't<00:03:43.560> really<00:03:43.859> go<00:03:44.129> well<00:03:44.430> when<00:03:45.180> they<00:03:45.540> when

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
doesn't really go well when they when

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.210 
doesn't really go well when they when
they<00:03:46.560> actually<00:03:47.099> do<00:03:47.669> try<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:48.090> you<00:03:48.299> know<00:03:48.359> try<00:03:48.569> to

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
they actually do try to you know try to

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.619 
they actually do try to you know try to
try<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.280> get<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.519> drop<00:03:50.639> on<00:03:50.790> shredder<00:03:51.030> by<00:03:51.419> using

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
try to get the drop on shredder by using

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.999 
try to get the drop on shredder by using
this<00:03:51.930> really<00:03:53.299> a<00:03:54.299> left<00:03:55.199> when<00:03:55.470> that<00:03:55.620> elaborate

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:56.009 
this really a left when that elaborate

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:59.300 
this really a left when that elaborate
but<00:03:56.489> kind<00:03:56.759> of<00:03:56.790> ingenious<00:03:57.180> thing<00:03:57.659> by<00:03:58.310> by

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
but kind of ingenious thing by by

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.809 
but kind of ingenious thing by by
Donatello<00:03:59.819> it's<00:04:00.239> like<00:04:00.449> an<00:04:00.569> electrified<00:04:01.819> ball

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
Donatello it's like an electrified ball
