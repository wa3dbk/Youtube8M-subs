 these games for sure you've heard 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.940
 talk of final fantasy is just 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.399

 if you do not know final young fantasy 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.000
 For god's sake, try to know more. 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.250
 how this developer managed 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.329
 cross generations and win millions 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.360
 of fans 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.469
 now starts the big games company 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.440
 business choose software 30 years ago 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.690
 was founded to choose in Yokohama by the 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.000
 recently graduated in massafumi computing 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.210
 my bike and it was a division of the company 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.060
 him his father's tea working with 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.010
 power transmission technology 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.100
 choose was in charge of producing 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.770
 digital games as an example project for 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.130
 the diversity the sour from where my motorcycle 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.840
 was formed while at that time the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.210
 games were produced by a single 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.850
 programmer but my bike trail 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.610
 believed it would be more efficient to have 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.750
 a team with which various graphics 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.049
 programmers and writers 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.079
 so he hired the students to laugh at the 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.180
 nobu sakaguchi and romiti tanaka that 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.280
 dropped out of college and went on to 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.350
 work full time at school 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.490
 the first games of the square were the 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:56.130
 death trip and the sequence the df picchu to 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:58.880
 mac computers mac pc 8801 mac pc 9801 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.890
 and fujitsu fm 7 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.350
 these games are interactive fiction 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.540
 this genre is basically clicking on the 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.860
 things that surrounds the character and this 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:13.240
 running puzzles and advancing 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.760
 in September 1986 to choose 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.100
 separated tea from dengue to become 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.380
 and advise you to choose 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.480
 limited company won the 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.000
 contract when you understand and have moved 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.710
 to tokyo and sakaguchi became 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.080
 president of planning and 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.130
 development 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.550
 after developing and distributing 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.520
 several unsuccessful games like cross and 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.830
 celesc that was the game of robots that 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.640
 was not quite a rpg but with fights for 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.400
 shifts 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.500
 whom the site was a cycle in which shutter 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.330
 it was kind of like these games and in the neighboring view 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.760
 from above and the screen is moving forward 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.370
 alone but instead of ship it was the 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.180
 knight tossing a sword or casting a saber 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.290
 there three of rodrigo ana was something like 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.020
 with knight 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.040
 but seen from another angle simulating 3d and 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.959
 as the title of the game speaks and reiser was 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.550
 a game very similar to the topiqueiro a 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:12.010
 super - within a year the company already 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.049
 was almost entering big bankruptcy 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.030
 part was the fault of the great team of 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.670
 developers required by miyamoto 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.019
 because if the company were small with 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.120
 few employees 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.920
 the games would be profit but also 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.870
 could be that the games did not have 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.720
 reached the expected quality and thus 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.820
 request - in life is so the young you 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.370
 You have to invest to risk to win. 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.370
 money have to spend money on r 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.049
 You have to make me laugh and this, unfortunately. 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.380
 forced me on the motorcycle until I dismissed 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.459
 half of the people left over to make 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.680
 one last game 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.830
 this one and if it did not work to choose 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:52.510
 I would close and miyamoto I trusted 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:54.280
 in sakaguchi said this our 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.250
 last chance to thrive 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.280
 so go child develop our last 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.480
 project 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.910
 johnny this will be my final fantasy 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.700
 and safo sakaguchi fucking 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.490
 see the enix sales success with rpg 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.850
 dragon quest decided to create a rpg 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:18.489
 launching the final fantasy on 18 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.040
 December 1987 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.620
 sakaguchi your ultimate fantasy name 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.990
 because he had a philosophy that 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.210
 we must give our utmost to deliver everything 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.370
 our potential at once without 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.280
 save anything for a sequence and when 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.530
 finish you 're empty just from the 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.660
 times of their ideas again and again. 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.090
 allows you to create new materials 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.900
 that's why every new title at the end 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.060
 fantasy 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.430
 it is not a continuation of 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.590
 story and the characters change 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.530
 another reason to call it fantasy 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.330
 end is because this would in fact be the 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.580
 last project in the 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.590
 video games for him and then him 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.110
 would continue his engineering faculty 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.380
 if the game fails again 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:05.200
 but fortunately your game saved school 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.840
 air turned success selling 400,000 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:12.340
 and became the main series of the 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:15.130
 choose to launch sequence and 88 and 89 if 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.710
 making a reference in final rpg 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.810
 fantasy meets complex stories to 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.090
 be a film and interaction with 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.990
 characters that leaves everything very rich 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.479
 it's catchy 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.410
 along with each game could be released 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:28.600
 a book 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:31.750
 the stories are so long and complex 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.729
 that the script of final fantasy 5 had 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.620
 to be reduced to chip Hair 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:38.380
 super nintendo and how the hydrogram 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:41.080
 Japanese take up less memory space 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.850
 three Japanese syllables are equivalent to 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.310
 four western syllables 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.950
 this led to even small changes in the 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.630
 story and in the names of the characters 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.570
 when the game was exported to america 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:55.060
 Europe and this is the end of the first 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.190
 of the young leave their liquidity her 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.020
 comment for me to know if this series 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:03.000
 is giving good results 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.000
 Thank you for watching and see you next time.
