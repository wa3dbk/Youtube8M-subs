00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 windows has some bars that call them 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:09.540
 of tools are four address 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.759
 Touch keyboard and desktop links are 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.490
 useful to facilitate some things 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.440
 to see them we just right click on 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.539
 the taskbar and in the part 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.359
 top we see this option that says 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.580
 toolbar here are the 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.890
 four that I just mentioned with 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.510
 address let's add a bar 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.880
 address directly in the bar 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.109
 tasks is the kind that we see in the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.660
 web browsers 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.899
 and precisely it serves for that to 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.850
 add web addresses or even 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.890
 local or network addresses 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.530
 I'm going to select it we see it as 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.410
 select it appears this bar from 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.680
 where we can write an address by 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.410
 example I'll put google and note how 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.600
 even giving me these suggestions 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.199
 suggestions the takings of the sites that 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.910
 we have already visited using internet 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.210
 explorer for example that is already google 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.619
 I'm going to select it and see how 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.420
 the program automatically opens 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.369
 aforementioned 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.549
 web address we can write it 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.740
 directly from this bar and that's 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.080
 one of the advantages that it has because 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.210
 there will be a need to first open the 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.189
 browser and then write the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.229
 address we can write it 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.840
 directly here and once 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.940
 press enter will open the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.610
 program was telling you that we can also 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.490
 write local addresses for example 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.210
 of two points we see how to press 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.060
 enter opens the unit if we know the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.100
 name or the full path of a folder 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.069
 specific for example files of 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.490
 programs that are really handled in 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:49.830
 english i'm going to press enter let's see how 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.990
 has opened program files this 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.420
 is a quick way to access a 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.539
 website or directly 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.970
 in a unit that we have in our 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.610
 computer either in the root directory as 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.200
 I did it in the beginning or in a 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.429
 specific folder 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.190
 this is the toolbar of 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:10.950
 address we have another bar I'm going to do 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.110
 again right click and I will remove 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.520
 the address bar 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.900
 Now I'm going to show you the other one that is 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:21.210
 links links what it does is show 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.790
 shortcuts that we have added in 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.220
 he can be shortcuts of 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.590
 programs folders addresses 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.010
 Internet pages etc. I'm going to 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.750
 show the desktop icons and by 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.580
 example I'm going to select this one that I have 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.070
 here and I'm going to drag it to where it says 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.430
 links we see how to do it appears 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:44.430
 move to links I will release the button 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:48.870
 of the mouse now I have added a 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.730
 link I can do with those who want 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.330
 in this case I'm just adding 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.420
 shortcuts to programs but you can 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.489
 be to a file for example or as I said 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.110
 to an internet page later with 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.170
 just click we can 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.420
 quickly access any of the 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.690
 accesses that we have in it I'm going to 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.790
 close it I'm going to hide that bar and now 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.070
 I'll show you the other keyboard 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.770
 touch the touch keyboard serves to 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.740
 use it mainly with screens 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.420
 although it can also be used in a 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.520
 normal computer using the mouse 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.640
 this keyboard together with the other one that has 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.860
 windows on the screen I already showed them to you 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.650
 another video and precisely in that video 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.920
 you can see in which cases it is useful and 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:38.130
 advisable to use this type of keyboards 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.180
 I'm going to close the touch keyboard and 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.990
 last we have one that says desk 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.490
 desktop what you are going to do is show 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:49.140
 as a drop-down list everything 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.020
 that we have in our team by 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.150
 example here I have equipment precisely 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:57.120
 is showing me the units that I have 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.400
 the first two are units of state 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.100
 solid the third is a reading unit 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.280
 of dvd and recorder also if I select 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:08.160
 the unit will continue to deploy 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.990
 diverse folders is like having the 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.960
 file explorer in one version 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:15.720
 small and also organized in menus 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.760
 drop-down as you're seeing conforming 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.040
 let's go entering the various 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.650
 folders are going to keep showing more 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.520
 folders of course this will depend 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.590
 of the 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.900
 contains each of them as in this 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.520
 case up here in this folder no longer 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.069
 there are more folders there are only files 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.039
 but there will be exceptions where still 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:37.020
 there are more folders like in this case and 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:40.500
 see what happens windows starts to 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.960
 unfold now in the inverted order and 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.909
 so on it's going to go goes to 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.710
 unfold the folders first of 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:48.900
 right to left after skhir's 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.090
 the right then again it's going to 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.610
 go back from right to left and so on 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.720
 successively this is a form of power 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:00.449
 access folders hard drives 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.340
 units or network computers using a 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:05.099
 drop-down menu like the one you're 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.250
 seeing and these are the four bars of 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:09.870
 tools that has windows in the 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.539
 next video I'll show you how 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.159
 create a toolbar on its own 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:16.680
 the notes at the end an option appears 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:18.180
 that says new toolbar in 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.699
 this video I will explain how 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:24.110
 create it and you'll also see the 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.110
 utility that has
