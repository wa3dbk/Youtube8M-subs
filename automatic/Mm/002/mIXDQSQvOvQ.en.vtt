all<00:00:45.879> the<00:00:45.909> way<00:00:46.059> down<00:00:46.269> before<00:00:47.260> I<00:00:47.320> did<00:00:47.500> that<00:00:47.530> I

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
all the way down before I did that I

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.369 
all the way down before I did that I
took<00:00:47.829> a<00:00:47.949> couple<00:00:48.309> pieces<00:00:48.489> of<00:00:48.760> paper<00:00:49.059> and<00:00:49.479> slip

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
took a couple pieces of paper and slip

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.910 
took a couple pieces of paper and slip
them<00:00:50.680> between<00:00:51.070> the<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:53.110> windshield<00:00:53.619> and<00:00:53.830> the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
them between the the windshield and the

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.660 
them between the the windshield and the
top<00:00:54.129> and<00:00:54.970> taped<00:00:55.869> them<00:00:56.199> down<00:00:56.890> in<00:00:57.040> place<00:00:57.280> and

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
top and taped them down in place and

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.179 
top and taped them down in place and
folded<00:00:58.299> them<00:00:58.449> and<00:00:58.809> then<00:00:59.500> I've<00:00:59.650> tried<00:00:59.920> to<00:01:00.040> go

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:00.189 
folded them and then I've tried to go

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:02.009 
folded them and then I've tried to go
ahead<00:01:00.430> and<00:01:00.699> screw<00:01:01.059> the<00:01:01.210> bolts<00:01:01.540> in<00:01:01.720> from<00:01:01.900> the

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
ahead and screw the bolts in from the

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:05.750 
ahead and screw the bolts in from the
bottom<00:01:02.890> up<00:01:03.100> and<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:04.629> want<00:01:04.989> to<00:01:05.080> see<00:01:05.260> where<00:01:05.500> the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
bottom up and I want to see where the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.690 
bottom up and I want to see where the
bolts<00:01:06.760> in<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.060> lower<00:01:07.270> portion<00:01:08.430> aligned<00:01:09.430> with

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
bolts in the lower portion aligned with

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.730 
bolts in the lower portion aligned with
the<00:01:09.850> top<00:01:09.880> so<00:01:10.869> that's<00:01:11.080> what<00:01:11.259> I'm<00:01:11.320> working<00:01:11.680> on

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
the top so that's what I'm working on

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.940 
the top so that's what I'm working on
now

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.889 

the<00:01:18.130> card<00:01:18.399> sitting<00:01:18.909> on<00:01:19.030> a<00:01:19.060> nice<00:01:19.299> cushioned

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
the card sitting on a nice cushioned

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:21.450 
the card sitting on a nice cushioned
blanket<00:01:20.289> now<00:01:20.409> I<00:01:20.439> can<00:01:20.770> get<00:01:20.950> a<00:01:20.979> pretty<00:01:21.159> good<00:01:21.280> idea

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
blanket now I can get a pretty good idea

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.959 
blanket now I can get a pretty good idea
of<00:01:21.789> what's<00:01:21.969> going<00:01:22.240> on<00:01:23.100> take<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.340> piece<00:01:24.939> of

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:24.969 
of what's going on take the piece of

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:28.649 
of what's going on take the piece of
paper<00:01:25.420> that<00:01:25.840> I<00:01:25.979> had<00:01:26.979> slipped<00:01:27.369> in<00:01:27.549> there<00:01:27.759> and<00:01:28.060> I

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
paper that I had slipped in there and I

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.419 
paper that I had slipped in there and I
had<00:01:28.899> made<00:01:29.079> a<00:01:29.140> fold<00:01:29.469> line<00:01:29.619> across<00:01:30.070> the<00:01:30.399> bottom

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
had made a fold line across the bottom

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:33.569 
had made a fold line across the bottom
here<00:01:31.000> across<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:32.110> edge<00:01:32.229> here<00:01:32.619> and<00:01:32.950> so<00:01:33.369> as<00:01:33.460> I

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
here across the edge here and so as I

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:35.279 
here across the edge here and so as I
pull<00:01:33.789> it<00:01:33.909> back<00:01:33.939> in<00:01:34.270> a<00:01:34.329> position<00:01:34.630> that<00:01:34.840> I<00:01:35.079> can

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
pull it back in a position that I can

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.029 
pull it back in a position that I can
see<00:01:35.500> where<00:01:35.710> the<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:37.090> screw<00:01:37.840> head<00:01:38.590> meet<00:01:38.829> has

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
see where the the screw head meet has

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:40.980 
see where the the screw head meet has
made<00:01:39.280> an<00:01:39.399> indentation<00:01:39.909> in<00:01:40.210> the<00:01:40.299> paper<00:01:40.569> and

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
made an indentation in the paper and

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.319 
made an indentation in the paper and
then<00:01:41.469> compare<00:01:42.250> that<00:01:42.460> relative<00:01:42.939> to<00:01:43.090> where<00:01:43.179> the

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
then compare that relative to where the

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.350 
then compare that relative to where the
socket<00:01:43.780> is<00:01:43.899> in<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.289> top<00:01:44.829> itself<00:01:45.250> and<00:01:46.090> I<00:01:46.179> can

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
socket is in the top itself and I can

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.270 
socket is in the top itself and I can
see<00:01:46.539> that<00:01:46.719> I've<00:01:46.840> got<00:01:46.869> a<00:01:47.500> little<00:01:47.890> bit<00:01:48.069> of<00:01:48.189> a

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
see that I've got a little bit of a

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.880 
see that I've got a little bit of a
mismatch<00:01:48.490> going<00:01:49.090> on<00:01:49.240> it's<00:01:49.450> not<00:01:49.600> a<00:01:49.659> lot<00:01:49.929> when<00:01:50.830> I

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
mismatch going on it's not a lot when I

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.649 
mismatch going on it's not a lot when I
look<00:01:51.159> closely<00:01:51.429> at<00:01:51.729> these<00:01:51.909> brackets<00:01:52.270> that<00:01:52.630> are

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
look closely at these brackets that are

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.109 
look closely at these brackets that are
on<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:52.959> top<00:01:53.200> I<00:01:53.590> can<00:01:54.369> see<00:01:54.580> that<00:01:54.759> they've<00:01:54.970> been

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
on the top I can see that they've been

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.779 
on the top I can see that they've been
moved<00:01:55.390> at<00:01:55.539> some<00:01:55.750> point<00:01:56.020> in<00:01:56.140> time<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:57.399> can<00:01:57.459> see

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
moved at some point in time you can see

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.889 
moved at some point in time you can see
there's<00:01:58.420> two<00:01:58.479> little<00:02:00.209> holes<00:02:01.209> in<00:02:01.599> the<00:02:01.630> top

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
there's two little holes in the top

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:04.380 
there's two little holes in the top
right<00:02:02.200> there<00:02:02.470> and<00:02:03.130> on<00:02:03.459> this<00:02:03.640> bracket<00:02:03.970> they're

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
right there and on this bracket they're

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.020 
right there and on this bracket they're
fairly<00:02:04.720> even<00:02:05.289> if<00:02:05.829> I<00:02:06.039> go<00:02:06.220> over<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.520> other<00:02:06.670> side

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
fairly even if I go over the other side

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.699 
fairly even if I go over the other side
I<00:02:07.979> can<00:02:08.979> see<00:02:09.190> that<00:02:09.549> they're<00:02:09.759> skewed<00:02:10.299> the<00:02:11.170> gap<00:02:11.470> is

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
I can see that they're skewed the gap is

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.190 
I can see that they're skewed the gap is
wider<00:02:12.010> here<00:02:12.340> that<00:02:12.549> it<00:02:12.670> is<00:02:12.790> here<00:02:13.150> so<00:02:13.480> I'm<00:02:14.049> going

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
wider here that it is here so I'm going

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.780 
wider here that it is here so I'm going
to<00:02:14.290> take<00:02:14.440> a<00:02:14.470> Torx<00:02:14.860> bit<00:02:15.099> and<00:02:15.280> see<00:02:15.400> if<00:02:15.489> I<00:02:15.610> can

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
to take a Torx bit and see if I can

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.069 
to take a Torx bit and see if I can
loosen<00:02:16.290> these<00:02:17.290> up<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:18.130> then<00:02:18.450> set<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.840> top

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:20.079 
loosen these up and then set the top

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:22.979 
loosen these up and then set the top
back<00:02:20.349> on<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.709> car<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.880> get<00:02:22.120> it<00:02:22.209> to<00:02:22.329> line<00:02:22.540> on<00:02:22.720> it

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
back on the car and get it to line on it

loose there Torx number 40s and it

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.710 
loose there Torx number 40s and it
started<00:02:30.790> off<00:02:30.880> with<00:02:31.000> torques<00:02:31.329> fitting<00:02:31.660> a

impact with a Torx 40 in the end of it
that<00:02:40.329> works<00:02:40.600> great

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.580 

so<00:02:47.810> though

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
so though

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.940 
so though
you<00:02:49.920> can<00:02:50.069> now<00:02:50.220> see<00:02:50.489> if<00:02:50.640> this<00:02:51.800> bracket<00:02:52.800> that's

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
you can now see if this bracket that's

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.710 
you can now see if this bracket that's
on<00:02:53.129> the<00:02:53.220> top<00:02:53.459> will<00:02:53.700> move<00:02:53.879> around<00:02:54.030> easily<00:02:54.390> and

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
on the top will move around easily and

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.990 
on the top will move around easily and
we<00:02:54.959> can<00:02:54.989> position<00:02:55.620> it<00:02:55.739> in<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:55.860> right<00:02:56.040> spot<00:02:56.400> I'm

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
we can position it in the right spot I'm

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.640 
we can position it in the right spot I'm
going<00:02:57.300> to<00:02:57.420> tighten<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.810> screws<00:02:58.080> back<00:02:58.319> down

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
going to tighten the screws back down

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.220 
going to tighten the screws back down
enough<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.250> just<00:02:59.489> snug<00:03:00.060> them<00:03:00.090> up<00:03:00.269> a<00:03:00.690> little<00:03:01.080> bit

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
enough to just snug them up a little bit

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.290 
enough to just snug them up a little bit
so<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:01.650> this<00:03:02.010> part<00:03:02.370> will<00:03:02.550> still<00:03:02.819> move<00:03:03.030> I

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
so that this part will still move I

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.869 
so that this part will still move I
reposition<00:03:03.989> it<00:03:04.080> on<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.379> car<00:03:04.680> well<00:03:05.489> I<00:03:05.519> put<00:03:05.790> the

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
reposition it on the car well I put the

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.809 
reposition it on the car well I put the
top<00:03:06.090> back<00:03:06.120> on<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.690> car<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.500> it<00:03:08.069> fit<00:03:08.400> very<00:03:08.430> well

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
top back on the car and it fit very well

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.690 
top back on the car and it fit very well
I<00:03:09.330> kind<00:03:09.690> of<00:03:09.750> gambled<00:03:10.140> a<00:03:10.200> little<00:03:10.500> bit<00:03:10.650> we<00:03:11.549> went

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
I kind of gambled a little bit we went

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.080 
I kind of gambled a little bit we went
ahead<00:03:11.790> just<00:03:12.150> tighten<00:03:12.810> that<00:03:13.670> exercise<00:03:14.670> right

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
ahead just tighten that exercise right

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.270 
ahead just tighten that exercise right
front<00:03:15.560> bracket<00:03:16.560> that<00:03:16.709> needed<00:03:16.980> some

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
front bracket that needed some

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.780 
front bracket that needed some
adjustment<00:03:18.239> and<00:03:18.830> once<00:03:19.830> you<00:03:19.980> set<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.250> top<00:03:20.549> back

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
adjustment and once you set the top back

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.789 
adjustment and once you set the top back
on<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.120> car<00:03:21.360> hopefully<00:03:21.870> you<00:03:21.959> can<00:03:22.110> put<00:03:22.620> your

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
on the car hopefully you can put your

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.620 
on the car hopefully you can put your
top<00:03:23.010> on<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.430> car<00:03:23.670> when<00:03:23.940> it's<00:03:24.090> in<00:03:24.239> a<00:03:24.269> level

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
top on the car when it's in a level

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.589 
top on the car when it's in a level
position<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:25.739> my<00:03:26.459> opinion<00:03:26.880> anyway<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.390> right

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
position and my opinion anyway the right

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.150 
position and my opinion anyway the right
way<00:03:27.780> to<00:03:27.840> tighten<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.410> bolts<00:03:28.769> or<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:28.980> right

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
way to tighten the bolts or the right

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.000 
way to tighten the bolts or the right
sequence<00:03:29.430> would<00:03:29.790> be<00:03:29.849> to<00:03:30.030> tighten<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:31.010> the

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
sequence would be to tighten the the

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.280 
sequence would be to tighten the the
rear<00:03:32.220> bolts<00:03:32.549> first<00:03:32.849> one<00:03:33.180> on<00:03:33.329> each<00:03:33.510> side<00:03:33.540> and

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
rear bolts first one on each side and

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.559 
rear bolts first one on each side and
get<00:03:34.590> those<00:03:34.799> reasonably<00:03:35.610> Tyre<00:03:35.879> maybe<00:03:36.209> even<00:03:36.420> all

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
get those reasonably Tyre maybe even all

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.660 
get those reasonably Tyre maybe even all
the<00:03:36.690> way<00:03:36.810> tight<00:03:37.079> and<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.980> will<00:03:38.160> pull<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.430> top

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
the way tight and that will pull the top

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.270 
the way tight and that will pull the top
back<00:03:39.000> into<00:03:39.360> position<00:03:39.510> and<00:03:40.019> then<00:03:40.709> you<00:03:40.829> run<00:03:41.040> the

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
back into position and then you run the

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.280 
back into position and then you run the
front<00:03:41.849> bolts<00:03:42.209> up<00:03:42.390> from<00:03:42.569> the<00:03:42.660> bottom<00:03:42.870> into

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
front bolts up from the bottom into

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.339 
front bolts up from the bottom into
their<00:03:44.090> sockets<00:03:45.090> and<00:03:45.269> that<00:03:45.780> should<00:03:45.959> work<00:03:46.110> well

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
their sockets and that should work well

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.619 
their sockets and that should work well
for<00:03:46.590> you<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:46.860> it<00:03:46.980> seems<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.370> work<00:03:47.760> well<00:03:48.360> here

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
for you and it seems to work well here

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.440 
for you and it seems to work well here
this<00:03:48.810> time<00:03:49.079> as<00:03:49.230> well
