his consistency and that's where it
comes<00:04:08.760> down<00:04:08.970> to<00:04:09.210> I<00:04:09.240> think<00:04:09.440> is<00:04:11.420> the<00:04:12.420> amount<00:04:12.600> of

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
comes down to I think is the amount of

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.500 
comes down to I think is the amount of
time<00:04:13.080> he<00:04:13.230> puts<00:04:13.530> in<00:04:13.740> what<00:04:14.220> he<00:04:14.310> does<00:04:14.520> how<00:04:15.030> long<00:04:15.300> he

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
time he puts in what he does how long he

time he puts in what he does how long he
does<00:04:15.690> it<00:04:16.019> and<00:04:16.920> such<00:04:17.280> so<00:04:17.880> and<00:04:18.209> I<00:04:19.020> think<00:04:19.230> it's

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
does it and such so and I think it's

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.810 
does it and such so and I think it's
even<00:04:19.620> more<00:04:19.650> impressive<00:04:20.010> there<00:04:20.459> he<00:04:20.549> has<00:04:20.669> away

even more impressive there he has away

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:58.299 
even more impressive there he has away
