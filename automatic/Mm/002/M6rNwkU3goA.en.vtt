00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
my whole mindset was I'm either gonna

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.079

get a big barrel or I'm gonna get super
pounded<00:00:06.750> turned<00:00:07.680> out<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:07.890> got<00:00:08.189> really<00:00:08.910> pounded

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.460 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.560 

basically<00:00:14.460> was<00:00:14.670> out<00:00:14.790> for<00:00:15.120> probably<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.509> couple

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
basically was out for probably a couple

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.859 
basically was out for probably a couple
hours<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:17.029> just<00:00:18.029> getting<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.359> feel<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.600> it

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
hours and just getting the feel of it

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.160 
hours and just getting the feel of it
the<00:00:19.410> size<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.920> but<00:00:20.520> solid<00:00:20.939> 20<00:00:21.270> feet<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.900> wind

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
the size is but solid 20 feet the wind

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.800 
the size is but solid 20 feet the wind
was<00:00:22.380> like<00:00:22.560> super<00:00:23.220> crucial<00:00:23.460> out<00:00:23.760> there<00:00:23.970> so<00:00:24.240> none

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
was like super crucial out there so none

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.109 
was like super crucial out there so none
of<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.050> conditions<00:00:25.260> get<00:00:25.710> pretty<00:00:26.010> hectic<00:00:26.730> when

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
of the conditions get pretty hectic when

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.080 
of the conditions get pretty hectic when
it's<00:00:27.269> like<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.710> you<00:00:28.710> have<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:29.010> commit<00:00:29.429> no

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
it's like that you have to commit no

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.240 
it's like that you have to commit no
matter<00:00:30.269> what<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:31.050> when<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.380> wave<00:00:31.529> came<00:00:31.830> in<00:00:32.009> is

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:15.469 
so everything went kind of slow motion

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:17.800
