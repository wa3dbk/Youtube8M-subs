at any branch gone out set is gone and

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.779 
at any branch gone out set is gone and
now<00:00:56.059> I'm<00:00:56.210> came<00:00:56.479> to<00:00:56.600> see<00:00:56.719> it<00:00:57.019> is<00:00:57.170> it's<00:00:57.440> like<00:00:57.789> you

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
now I'm came to see it is it's like you

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:19.040 
now I'm came to see it is it's like you
doubt<00:00:59.059> that

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.690 

it's<00:01:20.050> actually<00:01:20.170> a<00:01:20.380> lot<00:01:20.560> windier<00:01:20.950> than<00:01:20.980> what

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
it's actually a lot windier than what

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.390 
it's actually a lot windier than what
the<00:01:22.000> weather<00:01:22.270> forecast<00:01:22.570> predictor

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
the weather forecast predictor

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.560 
the weather forecast predictor
definitely<00:01:24.400> got<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:24.820> potential<00:01:25.120> that<00:01:25.360> wave

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
definitely got the potential that wave

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.960 
definitely got the potential that wave
to<00:01:25.840> get<00:01:26.020> you<00:01:26.500> know<00:01:26.620> as<00:01:26.950> big<00:01:27.190> as<00:01:27.340> any<00:01:27.610> wave<00:01:27.820> in

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
to get you know as big as any wave in

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:34.950 
to get you know as big as any wave in
Australia<00:01:28.480> if<00:01:28.900> not<00:01:29.170> in<00:01:29.530> any<00:01:30.010> way<00:01:33.390> away<00:01:34.390> faces

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
Australia if not in any way away faces

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.120 
Australia if not in any way away faces
were<00:01:35.080> actually<00:01:35.410> smoother<00:01:35.710> than<00:01:36.010> they

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
were actually smoother than they

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.460 
were actually smoother than they
actually<00:01:36.220> get<00:01:36.520> into<00:01:36.730> and<00:01:37.030> was<00:01:37.320> not<00:01:38.320> gonna

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
actually get into and was not gonna

00:01:38.470 --> 00:02:27.980 
actually get into and was not gonna
realize<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.730> top<00:01:40.240> of<00:01:40.360> the<00:01:40.480> world

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.240 

Queen<00:02:28.990> the<00:02:29.140> hell<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:29.920> weather's

Queen the hell and the weather's

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.680 
Queen the hell and the weather's
terrible<00:02:30.520> but<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.060> looks<00:02:31.240> like<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.510> waves

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
terrible but the looks like the waves

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.570 
terrible but the looks like the waves
are<00:02:31.900> massive<00:02:32.560> so<00:02:32.830> might<00:02:33.100> as<00:02:33.190> well<00:02:33.280> just<00:02:33.400> take

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
are massive so might as well just take

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.500 
are massive so might as well just take
the<00:02:33.700> weather<00:02:33.910> on<00:02:34.000> otherwise<00:02:34.510> bleak<00:02:36.510> that's

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
the weather on otherwise bleak that's

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.400 
the weather on otherwise bleak that's
always<00:02:37.900> I<00:02:37.930> love<00:02:38.110> 20<00:02:38.680> feet<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.780> play<00:02:41.050> baby

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
always I love 20 feet and the play baby

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.950

toes<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.670> biggest<00:02:43.000> one<00:02:43.150> wouldn't<00:02:43.480> stand<00:02:43.720> out

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
toes the biggest one wouldn't stand out

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.590 
toes the biggest one wouldn't stand out
speed<00:02:44.590> wired<00:02:44.980> lamps<00:02:45.490> I<00:02:45.670> think<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.180> wind<00:02:46.450> was

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
speed wired lamps I think the wind was

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.110 
speed wired lamps I think the wind was
too<00:02:46.630> strong<00:02:46.870> knocking<00:02:47.740> them<00:02:47.920> top<00:02:48.910> of<00:02:49.030> the

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
too strong knocking them top of the

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.140 
too strong knocking them top of the
swell<00:02:49.420> officer<00:02:50.010> so<00:02:51.010> unsure<00:02:51.280> that<00:02:51.550> kind<00:02:52.060> of

swell officer so unsure that kind of

00:02:52.150 --> 00:04:21.099 
swell officer so unsure that kind of
trusted<00:02:52.720> a<00:02:52.780> bit

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.879 

victory<00:04:22.109> that<00:04:22.500> was<00:04:22.680> vigorously<00:04:24.710> that<00:04:25.710> was<00:04:25.800> the

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
victory that was vigorously that was the

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.879 
victory that was vigorously that was the
biggest<00:04:26.070> waves<00:04:26.310> of<00:04:26.490> head<00:04:26.639> for<00:04:26.940> cover<00:04:27.900> years<00:04:28.260> so

day<00:04:34.280> definitely<00:04:35.280> got<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:35.700> potential<00:04:36.000> that

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
day definitely got the potential that

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.719 
day definitely got the potential that
wave<00:04:36.450> to<00:04:36.720> get<00:04:36.900> you<00:04:37.380> know<00:04:37.500> as<00:04:37.830> big<00:04:38.070> as<00:04:38.220> any<00:04:38.490> wave
