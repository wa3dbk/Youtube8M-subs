that and for um nose and tail you're
just<00:02:50.560> going<00:02:50.739> to<00:02:50.800> be<00:02:50.950> like<00:02:51.070> that<00:02:51.130> to<00:02:51.640> make<00:02:51.790> it

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
just going to be like that to make it

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.940 
just going to be like that to make it
and<00:02:52.330> smooth<00:02:52.630> it<00:02:52.660> out<00:02:55.620> if<00:02:56.620> you<00:02:56.709> have<00:02:56.799> an

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
and smooth it out if you have an

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.430 
and smooth it out if you have an
electric<00:02:57.040> sander<00:02:57.580> that<00:02:58.000> would<00:02:58.120> be<00:02:58.330> much<00:02:59.200> more

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
electric sander that would be much more

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.650 
electric sander that would be much more
useful<00:03:00.480> but<00:03:01.590> normal<00:03:02.590> sandpaper<00:03:03.010> is<00:03:03.160> fine<00:03:03.370> too

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
saddened down to the base um and all

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.770 
saddened down to the base um and all
around<00:03:17.500> it<00:03:17.709> and<00:03:17.860> a<00:03:18.220> bit<00:03:18.430> of<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.640> top<00:03:18.850> but<00:03:19.720> it

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
around it and a bit of the top but it

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:20.759 
around it and a bit of the top but it
doesn't<00:03:20.019> matter<00:03:20.079> because<00:03:20.260> there's<00:03:20.590> going<00:03:20.709> to

going<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:32.330> put<00:03:33.330> your<00:03:33.360> tech<00:03:33.810> deck<00:03:35.060> on<00:03:36.060> top<00:03:36.120> of

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
going to put your tech deck on top of

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.540 
going to put your tech deck on top of
your<00:03:38.130> wooden<00:03:38.489> one<00:03:38.959> and<00:03:39.980> then<00:03:40.980> what<00:03:41.400> you're

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
your wooden one and then what you're

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.960 
your wooden one and then what you're
going<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:41.760> do<00:03:41.910> with<00:03:42.030> this<00:03:43.220> you<00:03:44.220> get<00:03:44.430> a<00:03:44.459> line

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
going to do with this you get a line

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.600 
going to do with this you get a line
these<00:03:45.180> up<00:03:45.239> just<00:03:45.900> make<00:03:46.110> a<00:03:46.140> straight<00:03:46.500> line<00:03:46.739> from

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
these up just make a straight line from

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.250 
these up just make a straight line from
the<00:03:47.910> bottom<00:03:47.940> hole<00:03:48.800> right<00:03:49.800> across<00:03:50.450> and<00:03:51.450> same

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
the bottom hole right across and same

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.790 
the bottom hole right across and same
other<00:03:53.069> one<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:54.090> bottom<00:03:54.480> hole<00:03:55.459> right<00:03:56.459> across

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
other one the bottom hole right across

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.699 
other one the bottom hole right across
then<00:03:58.800> you're<00:03:58.980> left<00:03:59.130> with<00:03:59.370> this<00:03:59.519> rectangle

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
then you're left with this rectangle

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.990 
then you're left with this rectangle
make<00:04:01.709> it<00:04:01.860> picked<00:04:02.340> up<00:04:03.140> and<00:04:04.580> that's<00:04:05.580> the<00:04:05.700> space

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
make it picked up and that's the space

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.809 
make it picked up and that's the space
you're<00:04:06.180> going<00:04:06.239> to<00:04:06.390> be<00:04:06.510> able<00:04:06.690> to<00:04:07.049> draw<00:04:07.319> with<00:04:07.819> so
