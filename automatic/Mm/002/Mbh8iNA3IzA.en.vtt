this post popped up on reddit so who

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.760 
this post popped up on reddit so who
really<00:01:03.090> knows<00:01:03.420> how<00:01:03.690> legit<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.500> or<00:01:04.680> not<00:01:04.970> but

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.800 
anyways apparently it's from a insider
and<00:01:10.350> we<00:01:10.979> will<00:01:11.100> put<00:01:11.340> some<00:01:11.640> massive<00:01:12.150> quotation

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
and we will put some massive quotation

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.770 
and we will put some massive quotation
marks<00:01:13.080> around<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.740> but<00:01:14.780> apparently

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
marks around that but apparently

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.310 
marks around that but apparently

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
DLC issues for a Dawnguard and hearth

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.830 
DLC issues for a Dawnguard and hearth
fire<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:23.930> um<00:01:25.100> we<00:01:26.100> have<00:01:26.369> two<00:01:26.820> more<00:01:27.119> full

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
fire and um we have two more full

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.920 
fire and um we have two more full
fledged<00:01:28.229> DLCs<00:01:28.950> coming<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.700> both<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.509> them<00:01:30.750> are

fledged DLCs coming and both of them are

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.590 
fledged DLCs coming and both of them are
going<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.200> be<00:01:31.290> big<00:01:32.159> like<00:01:32.490> Dragonborn<00:01:33.150> one<00:01:33.570> a

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
going to be big like Dragonborn one a

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.490 
going to be big like Dragonborn one a
bit<00:01:34.020> smaller<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.799> one<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.610> bit<00:01:35.850> larger<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.500> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
bit smaller and one a bit larger so the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.990 
bit smaller and one a bit larger so the
one<00:01:37.680> I'm<00:01:37.890> assuming<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.880> larger<00:01:39.270> one<00:01:39.450> is

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
one I'm assuming is the larger one is

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.359 
one I'm assuming is the larger one is
the<00:01:42.000> one<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.450> will<00:01:42.750> explore<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.890> beginning

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
the one that will explore the beginning

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.310 
the one that will explore the beginning
of<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.579> Nords<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.270> Skyrim's<00:01:45.720> culture<00:01:46.140> as

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
of the Nords and Skyrim's culture as

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.609 
of the Nords and Skyrim's culture as
well<00:01:46.649> as<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.070> snow<00:01:47.340> elves<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:48.060> dwarves<00:01:48.619> so

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
well as the snow elves and dwarves so

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.200 
well as the snow elves and dwarves so
how<00:01:49.890> are<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.070> going<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.369> pack<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.820> into

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
how are you going to pack that into

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.340 
how are you going to pack that into
skyrim<00:01:51.509> now<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:52.799> might<00:01:53.310> just<00:01:53.610> be<00:01:54.030> me<00:01:54.689> hoping

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
skyrim now this might just be me hoping

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.889 
skyrim now this might just be me hoping
for<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.680> stars<00:01:55.950> but<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.939> think<00:01:57.540> this<00:01:57.840> might

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
for the stars but I think this might

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.260 
for the stars but I think this might
actually<00:01:58.560> take<00:01:59.189> us<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.880> northern

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
actually take us to the northern

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.749 
actually take us to the northern
continent<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.930> at<00:02:01.079> moreh<00:02:01.350> where<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.460> Nords

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
continent of at moreh where the Nords

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.550 
continent of at moreh where the Nords
are<00:02:02.909> supposed<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.570> have<00:02:03.750> originated<00:02:04.290> just

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
are supposed to have originated just

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.910 
are supposed to have originated just
because<00:02:05.159> hey<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.729> covers<00:02:06.119> their<00:02:06.329> origins

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
because hey it covers their origins

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.559 
because hey it covers their origins
against<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.250> all<00:02:08.429> like

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
up in the air we don't even know if this

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.970 
up in the air we don't even know if this
is<00:02:11.549> just<00:02:11.579> some<00:02:11.849> guy<00:02:12.499> lying<00:02:13.499> through<00:02:13.829> his<00:02:13.920> teeth

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
is just some guy lying through his teeth

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.000 
is just some guy lying through his teeth
or<00:02:14.370> whatever<00:02:14.670> but<00:02:15.389> I<00:02:15.659> don't<00:02:16.349> know<00:02:16.409> it<00:02:16.590> actually

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
or whatever but I don't know it actually

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.280 
or whatever but I don't know it actually
sounds<00:02:17.310> kind<00:02:17.760> of<00:02:17.879> legit<00:02:18.090> but<00:02:18.719> again<00:02:18.989> I<00:02:19.019> might

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
sounds kind of legit but again I might

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.440 
sounds kind of legit but again I might
just<00:02:19.439> be<00:02:19.560> hoping<00:02:19.799> for<00:02:19.859> it<00:02:20.099> now<00:02:20.639> why<00:02:20.969> I<00:02:20.999> think

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
just be hoping for it now why I think

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.989 
just be hoping for it now why I think
it's<00:02:21.569> at<00:02:21.689> Mora<00:02:21.959> is<00:02:22.290> again<00:02:23.129> because<00:02:23.459> it'd<00:02:23.969> be

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:23.999 
it's at Mora is again because it'd be

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.660 
it's at Mora is again because it'd be
really<00:02:24.269> hard<00:02:24.389> to<00:02:24.629> fit<00:02:25.230> I'm<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.069> bunch<00:02:26.340> of<00:02:26.459> snow

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
really hard to fit I'm a bunch of snow

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.330 
really hard to fit I'm a bunch of snow
elves<00:02:26.879> and<00:02:27.180> dwarves<00:02:27.299> hiding<00:02:27.959> in<00:02:28.049> Skyrim<00:02:28.530> also

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
elves and dwarves hiding in Skyrim also

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.440 
elves and dwarves hiding in Skyrim also
add<00:02:29.579> more<00:02:30.109> excuse<00:02:31.109> me<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:31.409> perfect<00:02:32.329> for<00:02:33.329> this

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
add more excuse me is perfect for this

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.170 
add more excuse me is perfect for this
just<00:02:34.049> because<00:02:34.500> it<00:02:34.889> would<00:02:35.040> keep<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.609> two<00:02:35.760> races

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
just because it would keep the two races

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.300 
just because it would keep the two races
tucked<00:02:36.540> well<00:02:36.810> out<00:02:37.019> of<00:02:37.049> the<00:02:37.230> way<00:02:37.379> and<00:02:37.590> at<00:02:38.069> moreh

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
tucked well out of the way and at moreh

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.909 
tucked well out of the way and at moreh
would<00:02:38.609> easily<00:02:38.909> explain<00:02:39.689> the<00:02:40.230> beginnings<00:02:40.709> of

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:40.919 
would easily explain the beginnings of

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:43.429 
would easily explain the beginnings of
Nords<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.519> whatnot<00:02:41.819> now<00:02:42.689> if<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:43.019> take<00:02:43.200> a<00:02:43.230> look

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:43.439 
Nords and whatnot now if you take a look

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.110 
Nords and whatnot now if you take a look
at<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.680> map<00:02:44.159> and<00:02:44.430> there's<00:02:44.609> only<00:02:44.790> like<00:02:44.939> one

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
at a map and there's only like one

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.689 
at a map and there's only like one
available<00:02:46.049> we<00:02:46.560> actually<00:02:46.980> have<00:02:47.129> four<00:02:47.340> at<00:02:47.459> Mora

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:47.699 
available we actually have four at Mora

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:49.699 
available we actually have four at Mora
and<00:02:47.969> even<00:02:48.209> that<00:02:48.449> I<00:02:48.480> think<00:02:48.900> it's<00:02:49.049> fan<00:02:49.349> drawing

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
and even that I think it's fan drawing

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.110 
and even that I think it's fan drawing
I've<00:02:49.980> actually<00:02:50.329> featured<00:02:51.329> it<00:02:51.449> in<00:02:52.849> my<00:02:53.849> older

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
I've actually featured it in my older

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.000 
I've actually featured it in my older
Scrolls<00:02:54.449> lore<00:02:54.569> at<00:02:54.989> more<00:02:55.230> episode<00:02:55.680> and

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
Scrolls lore at more episode and

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.649 
Scrolls lore at more episode and
actually<00:02:56.639> that's<00:02:56.699> just<00:02:56.969> a<00:02:57.060> map<00:02:57.239> of<00:02:57.419> nirn

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
actually that's just a map of nirn

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.409 
actually that's just a map of nirn
that's<00:02:58.439> zoomed<00:02:58.799> in<00:02:58.980> on<00:02:59.099> at<00:02:59.310> moreh<00:02:59.549> so<00:03:00.150> who

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:00.419 
that's zoomed in on at moreh so who

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:01.939 
that's zoomed in on at moreh so who
knows<00:03:00.449> how<00:03:00.780> big<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.109> islands<00:03:01.409> going<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.769> be

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:01.949 
knows how big the islands going to be

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:05.330 
knows how big the islands going to be
well<00:03:02.819> support<00:03:03.689> it's<00:03:04.169> a<00:03:04.439> continent<00:03:04.919> but<00:03:05.069> it's<00:03:05.250> a

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
well support it's a continent but it's a

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.709 
well support it's a continent but it's a
lot<00:03:05.609> smaller<00:03:06.209> than<00:03:06.569> Tamriel<00:03:07.079> so<00:03:08.689> yeah<00:03:09.689> I

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:09.719 
lot smaller than Tamriel so yeah I

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:14.059 
lot smaller than Tamriel so yeah I
definitely<00:03:10.650> think<00:03:11.609> that's<00:03:12.199> kind<00:03:13.199> of<00:03:13.439> well

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
definitely think that's kind of well

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.699 
definitely think that's kind of well
possible<00:03:14.579> at<00:03:14.699> the<00:03:14.790> very<00:03:14.970> least<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.500> would<00:03:16.500> be

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
possible at the very least and would be

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.409 
possible at the very least and would be
really<00:03:17.099> interesting<00:03:17.639> to<00:03:17.669> see<00:03:17.909> this<00:03:18.090> one<00:03:18.299> is

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419 
really interesting to see this one is

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.770 
really interesting to see this one is
also<00:03:18.599> supposed<00:03:19.139> to<00:03:19.349> have<00:03:19.849> Spears<00:03:20.849> and<00:03:21.150> that

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
also supposed to have Spears and that

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.569 
also supposed to have Spears and that
apparently<00:03:22.290> will<00:03:22.500> make<00:03:22.650> a<00:03:22.680> lot<00:03:22.949> more<00:03:22.979> sense<00:03:23.400> in

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
apparently will make a lot more sense in

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:28.610 
apparently will make a lot more sense in
the<00:03:23.669> context<00:03:24.090> of<00:03:24.180> this<00:03:24.449> and<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:27.290> also<00:03:28.290> they're

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
the context of this and the also they're

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.629 
the context of this and the also they're
going<00:03:28.919> to<00:03:29.269> raise<00:03:30.269> the<00:03:30.569> level<00:03:30.870> cap<00:03:30.900> on<00:03:31.349> above<00:03:32.129> 81

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
going to raise the level cap on above 81

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.149 
going to raise the level cap on above 81
that's<00:03:33.239> one<00:03:34.169> of<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.349> reasons<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:34.799> states<00:03:35.040> here

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.159 
that's one of the reasons it states here

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:39.399 
that's one of the reasons it states here
why<00:03:36.229> usable<00:03:37.229> Spears<00:03:37.739> or<00:03:37.919> a<00:03:37.979> new<00:03:38.129> perk<00:03:38.459> tree<00:03:38.819> ah

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:39.409 
why usable Spears or a new perk tree ah

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:42.140 
why usable Spears or a new perk tree ah
warrant<00:03:40.409> in<00:03:40.560> Dragonborns<00:03:41.430> because<00:03:41.790> it<00:03:41.939> won't

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
warrant in Dragonborns because it won't

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.619 
warrant in Dragonborns because it won't
be<00:03:42.299> fair<00:03:42.689> to<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.049> level<00:03:43.680> 81<00:03:43.919> characters<00:03:44.629> so

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
be fair to the level 81 characters so

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.539 
be fair to the level 81 characters so
the<00:03:45.870> other<00:03:46.019> one<00:03:46.229> which<00:03:46.470> I'm<00:03:46.650> assuming<00:03:46.799> is<00:03:47.400> the

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
the other one which I'm assuming is the

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.550 
the other one which I'm assuming is the
smaller<00:03:47.819> one<00:03:48.060> even<00:03:48.449> though<00:03:48.599> i<00:03:48.629> have<00:03:49.049> no<00:03:49.349> idea

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
smaller one even though i have no idea

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:56.899 
smaller one even though i have no idea
is<00:03:50.629> the<00:03:51.889> Second<00:03:52.889> Great<00:03:53.069> War<00:03:53.900> so<00:03:55.609> where<00:03:56.609> you

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
is the Second Great War so where you

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:00.679 
is the Second Great War so where you
choose<00:03:57.719> a<00:03:58.139> new<00:03:58.500> High<00:03:58.739> King<00:03:59.009> of<00:03:59.099> Skyrim<00:03:59.689> my

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:00.689 
choose a new High King of Skyrim my

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:02.659 
choose a new High King of Skyrim my
guessing<00:04:01.500> you<00:04:01.620> just<00:04:01.829> pick<00:04:02.069> from<00:04:02.310> one<00:04:02.489> of<00:04:02.579> the

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:02.669 
guessing you just pick from one of the

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:05.449 
guessing you just pick from one of the
Yarl's<00:04:03.030> and<00:04:03.359> Wade<00:04:04.229> a<00:04:04.530> war<00:04:04.919> against<00:04:05.310> the

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
Yarl's and Wade a war against the

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.080 
Yarl's and Wade a war against the
thalmor<00:04:05.939> so<00:04:07.039> I'm<00:04:08.039> just<00:04:08.250> kind<00:04:08.400> of<00:04:08.549> assuming

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
thalmor so I'm just kind of assuming

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.879 
thalmor so I'm just kind of assuming
this<00:04:09.239> is<00:04:09.419> a<00:04:09.449> smaller<00:04:09.930> one<00:04:10.199> because<00:04:10.439> they're

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
this is a smaller one because they're

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.369 
this is a smaller one because they're
probably<00:04:11.280> won't<00:04:11.729> be<00:04:11.849> a<00:04:11.879> new<00:04:12.030> area<00:04:12.239> for<00:04:12.569> it<00:04:12.750> but

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
probably won't be a new area for it but

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.039 
probably won't be a new area for it but
again<00:04:13.799> I<00:04:14.039> have<00:04:14.310> absolutely<00:04:14.759> no<00:04:14.849> idea

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
again I have absolutely no idea

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.529 
again I have absolutely no idea
and<00:04:16.169> this<00:04:16.979> is<00:04:17.129> just<00:04:17.340> me<00:04:17.519> further<00:04:17.789> speculating

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
and this is just me further speculating

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.659 
and this is just me further speculating

off a random reddit post that is
probably<00:04:21.659> not<00:04:21.870> even<00:04:22.199> real<00:04:22.229> but<00:04:22.770> I'd<00:04:23.039> still

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
probably not even real but I'd still

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.460 
probably not even real but I'd still
love<00:04:23.490> to<00:04:23.550> see<00:04:23.819> these<00:04:24.000> two<00:04:24.240> expansions<00:04:24.840> because

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
love to see these two expansions because

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.770 
love to see these two expansions because
they<00:04:25.590> sound<00:04:25.830> really<00:04:25.889> cool<00:04:26.340> and<00:04:26.669> they<00:04:26.909> actually

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
they sound really cool and they actually

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.960 
they sound really cool and they actually
sound<00:04:28.139> like<00:04:28.259> something<00:04:28.740> Bethesda<00:04:29.370> might<00:04:29.729> be

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
sound like something Bethesda might be

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:37.760 
sound like something Bethesda might be
doing<00:04:30.330> but<00:04:31.289> still<00:04:31.889> who<00:04:32.340> knows<00:04:35.810> also<00:04:36.810> this<00:04:37.229> post

modders that's actually why a lot of the

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
modders because bethesda kind of

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.879 
modders because bethesda kind of
suspects<00:04:56.909> quite<00:04:57.780> rightly<00:04:57.990> that<00:04:58.139> people<00:04:58.680> are

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
suspects quite rightly that people are

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.909 
suspects quite rightly that people are
making<00:04:59.729> total<00:05:00.719> conversion<00:05:01.139> mods<00:05:01.349> moorland

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
making total conversion mods moorland

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.159 
making total conversion mods moorland
and<00:05:02.150> Oblivion<00:05:03.150> so<00:05:03.360> that<00:05:03.539> will<00:05:03.690> make<00:05:03.870> it<00:05:03.960> a<00:05:04.020> lot

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
and Oblivion so that will make it a lot

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.589 
and Oblivion so that will make it a lot
easier<00:05:04.460> but<00:05:05.460> that<00:05:05.849> just<00:05:05.879> seems<00:05:06.120> kind<00:05:06.509> of

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:06.599 
easier but that just seems kind of

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:11.600 
easier but that just seems kind of
obvious<00:05:06.979> so<00:05:08.300> yeah<00:05:09.300> I'd<00:05:09.690> have<00:05:10.409> to<00:05:10.770> give<00:05:11.069> this<00:05:11.280> 1a

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
obvious so yeah I'd have to give this 1a

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.100 
obvious so yeah I'd have to give this 1a
seems<00:05:12.419> legit<00:05:13.250> even<00:05:14.250> though<00:05:14.539> yeah<00:05:15.539> I<00:05:15.569> really

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
seems legit even though yeah I really

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.899 
seems legit even though yeah I really
have<00:05:16.349> no<00:05:16.560> idea<00:05:16.860> but<00:05:17.219> it's<00:05:17.400> something<00:05:17.580> I<00:05:17.759> hope

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:17.909
