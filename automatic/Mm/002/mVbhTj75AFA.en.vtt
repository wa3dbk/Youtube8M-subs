00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
the table went for a curb stomp but he

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.550 
the table went for a curb stomp but he
kind<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.130> slid<00:01:14.520> through<00:01:15.180> John<00:01:15.900> Cena<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
kind of slid through John Cena and the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.580 
kind of slid through John Cena and the
table<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.509> that<00:01:18.509> kind<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.720> led<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.110> ref<00:01:19.320> bump

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
table and that kind of led to a ref bump

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.980 
table and that kind of led to a ref bump
and<00:01:19.830> then<00:01:19.950> scene<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.280> gave<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.790> super<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> through

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
and then scene I gave a super a through

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.350 
and then scene I gave a super a through
a<00:01:22.049> table<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:23.130> security<00:01:23.700> guards<00:01:23.909> jumped<00:01:24.210> right

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
a table the security guards jumped right

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.690 
a table the security guards jumped right
back<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.890> start<00:01:25.890> beating<00:01:26.159> up<00:01:26.250> scene<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.610> I

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
back in start beating up scene and I

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.520 
back in start beating up scene and I
thought<00:01:26.939> if<00:01:27.270> they<00:01:27.840> were<00:01:27.990> gonna<00:01:28.170> end<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.350> match

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
thought if they were gonna end the match

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.289 
thought if they were gonna end the match
and<00:01:28.680> have<00:01:28.799> Rollins<00:01:28.979> win<00:01:29.310> it's<00:01:29.880> pretty<00:01:30.090> much

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
and have Rollins win it's pretty much

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.539 
and have Rollins win it's pretty much

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
like that he is the one who broke

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.130 
like that he is the one who broke
through<00:01:47.880> rather<00:01:48.060> than<00:01:48.329> Seth<00:01:48.600> Rollins<00:01:48.810> that

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
would have been I guess a clever way you

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.960 
would have been I guess a clever way you
know<00:01:51.060> kind<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.299> reminds<00:01:51.750> me<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.930> um<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.970> don't

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
you know but that has nothing to do with

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.790 
you know but that has nothing to do with
anyways<00:02:08.399> never<00:02:09.330> mind<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.660> just<00:02:09.690> said<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:09.989> but

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
anyways never mind I just said that but

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.470 
anyways never mind I just said that but
it<00:02:10.920> was<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.550> would<00:02:11.700> have<00:02:11.790> been<00:02:11.910> one<00:02:12.150> finish

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
it was that would have been one finish

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.460 
it was that would have been one finish
if<00:02:12.599> you're<00:02:12.750> going<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:12.959> have<00:02:13.050> Rollins

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
if you're going to have Rollins

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.680 
if you're going to have Rollins
I<00:02:13.500> guess<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.340> plane<00:02:14.550> was<00:02:14.700> stuff<00:02:14.880> Cena<00:02:15.270> win<00:02:15.420> and

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
I guess the plane was stuff Cena win and

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.810 
I guess the plane was stuff Cena win and
then<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.590> little<00:02:16.680> bit<00:02:16.920> later<00:02:17.070> on<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.460> had<00:02:17.610> both

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
then a little bit later on you had both

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.270 
then a little bit later on you had both
guys<00:02:18.120> going<00:02:18.480> through<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.720> table<00:02:19.020> together

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.660 
guys going through the table together
which<00:02:20.280> was<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.640> kind<00:02:21.240> of<00:02:21.330> reminiscent<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:22.020> of

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
which was a kind of reminiscent of of

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.160 
which was a kind of reminiscent of of
Batista<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:23.790> John<00:02:24.000> Cena<00:02:24.210> going<00:02:24.540> over<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.960> top

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.050 
rope together and they restart the match

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
and he's really expecting fence to run

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.490 
and he's really expecting fence to run
