00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.540
 in six guys when you stayed 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.640
 for a long time he will begin to move 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.010
 and there you will have little crosses 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.250
 you touch anything but who wants to grow 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.450
 just you can type cydia that's it and 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.080
 when you double type you go 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.780
 apparatchiks 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.030
