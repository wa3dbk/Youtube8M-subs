and then the tongue is going to be about

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.930 
and then the tongue is going to be about
sixteenth<00:02:00.350> of<00:02:00.410> an<00:02:00.590> inch<00:02:00.710> shorter<00:02:01.430> because<00:02:01.790> I

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
sixteenth of an inch shorter because I

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.000 
sixteenth of an inch shorter because I
don't<00:02:02.180> want<00:02:02.330> the<00:02:02.480> tongue<00:02:02.720> to<00:02:03.380> be<00:02:03.410> battling<00:02:03.890> it

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
don't want the tongue to be battling it

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.700 
don't want the tongue to be battling it
out<00:02:04.130> on<00:02:04.340> my<00:02:04.550> mortise<00:02:04.910> so<00:02:05.780> to<00:02:05.840> mark<00:02:06.350> out<00:02:06.530> my

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
out on my mortise so to mark out my

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.620 
out on my mortise so to mark out my
mortise<00:02:09.710> here<00:02:10.040> or<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.460> groove<00:02:10.670> I'm<00:02:11.450> gonna

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
mortise here or the groove I'm gonna

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.750 
mortise here or the groove I'm gonna
find<00:02:11.870> Center<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:12.710> I<00:02:12.860> want<00:02:13.100> the<00:02:13.310> groove<00:02:13.520> to<00:02:13.670> be

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
find Center and I want the groove to be

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.420 
find Center and I want the groove to be
approximately<00:02:14.360> 5/16<00:02:15.230> it<00:02:15.830> doesn't<00:02:16.130> have<00:02:16.250> to<00:02:16.370> be

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
approximately 5/16 it doesn't have to be

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.910 
approximately 5/16 it doesn't have to be
exact<00:02:16.790> it<00:02:16.910> is<00:02:17.000> approximate<00:02:17.570> so<00:02:18.260> I'm<00:02:18.740> just

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
exact it is approximate so I'm just

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.270 
exact it is approximate so I'm just
gonna<00:02:19.070> put<00:02:19.280> my<00:02:19.310> ruler<00:02:19.670> here<00:02:20.380> find<00:02:21.380> Center<00:02:21.740> and

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
gonna put my ruler here find Center and

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.850 
gonna put my ruler here find Center and
maybe<00:02:22.520> the<00:02:22.900> 5/32<00:02:23.900> on<00:02:24.020> each<00:02:24.170> side<00:02:24.410> I<00:02:24.440> would<00:02:24.710> give

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
maybe the 5/32 on each side I would give

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.540 
maybe the 5/32 on each side I would give
me<00:02:24.950> about<00:02:25.070> 5/16<00:02:26.530> now<00:02:27.530> it's<00:02:27.950> very<00:02:28.130> important

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
me about 5/16 now it's very important

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.790 
me about 5/16 now it's very important
that<00:02:28.580> when<00:02:29.240> I'm<00:02:29.360> cutting<00:02:29.780> that<00:02:30.260> I<00:02:30.320> would<00:02:30.560> cut

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
that when I'm cutting that I would cut

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.290 
that when I'm cutting that I would cut
the<00:02:31.790> top<00:02:32.030> mark<00:02:32.300> off<00:02:32.540> first<00:02:32.900> because<00:02:34.000> if<00:02:35.000> for

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
the top mark off first because if for

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.090 
the top mark off first because if for
any<00:02:35.390> reason<00:02:35.510> if<00:02:36.050> my<00:02:36.200> brickwork<00:02:36.590> comes<00:02:36.770> off<00:02:36.950> the

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
any reason if my brickwork comes off the

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.180 
any reason if my brickwork comes off the
table<00:02:37.250> I'll<00:02:38.030> be<00:02:38.239> cutting<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:39.290> bottom<00:02:40.010> side

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
table I'll be cutting the bottom side

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.030 
table I'll be cutting the bottom side
the<00:02:40.370> wayside<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:42.110> there's<00:02:42.410> no<00:02:42.590> way<00:02:42.770> that<00:02:42.920> you

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
the wayside and there's no way that you

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.380 
the wayside and there's no way that you
can<00:02:43.160> ever<00:02:43.310> push<00:02:43.520> hard<00:02:43.760> enough<00:02:43.850> they<00:02:44.150> whatever

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
can ever push hard enough they whatever

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.810 
can ever push hard enough they whatever
cut<00:02:45.020> past<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:45.500> line<00:02:45.680> on<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:45.920> top<00:02:46.130> because<00:02:46.610> the

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
cut past the line on the top because the

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.460 
cut past the line on the top because the
table<00:02:47.120> will<00:02:47.480> prevent<00:02:47.870> you<00:02:47.989> from<00:02:48.050> doing<00:02:48.260> that

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
table will prevent you from doing that

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.320 
table will prevent you from doing that
so<00:02:49.190> I'm<00:02:49.310> going<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.520> go<00:02:49.610> to<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.820> router<00:02:50.000> table

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
so I'm going to go to the router table

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.479 
so I'm going to go to the router table
and<00:02:50.420> I'm<00:02:50.510> going<00:02:50.600> to<00:02:50.690> set<00:02:50.810> up<00:02:50.840> my<00:02:50.980> router<00:02:51.980> bit<00:02:52.250> to

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
and I'm going to set up my router bit to

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.880 
and I'm going to set up my router bit to
be<00:02:52.610> cutting<00:02:52.910> my<00:02:52.940> top<00:02:53.239> cut<00:02:53.840> first<00:02:54.050> okay<00:02:54.350> and

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
be cutting my top cut first okay and

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.699 
be cutting my top cut first okay and
then<00:02:55.220> I<00:02:55.340> want<00:02:55.520> to<00:02:55.640> start<00:02:56.110> inch<00:02:57.110> away<00:02:57.260> from<00:02:57.410> each

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
then I want to start inch away from each

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.620 
then I want to start inch away from each
side<00:02:57.980> I'm<00:02:58.190> going<00:02:58.459> to<00:02:58.519> start<00:02:58.700> right<00:02:58.850> about<00:02:59.000> here

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
side I'm going to start right about here

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.320 
side I'm going to start right about here
and<00:02:59.750> I'm<00:03:00.320> gonna<00:03:00.440> round<00:03:00.650> across<00:03:01.010> and<00:03:01.400> I'll<00:03:02.090> just

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
and I'm gonna round across and I'll just

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.400 
and I'm gonna round across and I'll just
stop<00:03:02.540> over<00:03:02.660> there<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:02.930> not<00:03:03.019> just<00:03:03.170> pull<00:03:03.380> out

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
stop over there and not just pull out

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.490 
stop over there and not just pull out
I'll<00:03:04.220> flip<00:03:04.489> it<00:03:04.519> over<00:03:04.700> and<00:03:05.420> I'll<00:03:05.660> do<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:06.350> same

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
I'll flip it over and I'll do the same

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.530 
I'll flip it over and I'll do the same
cut<00:03:06.769> this<00:03:07.160> way<00:03:07.400> my<00:03:07.820> groove<00:03:08.030> will<00:03:08.150> be<00:03:08.269> exactly

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
cut this way my groove will be exactly

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.840 
cut this way my groove will be exactly
dead<00:03:08.900> on<00:03:09.050> center<00:03:09.230> so<00:03:10.130> I'm<00:03:10.430> gonna<00:03:10.550> go<00:03:10.640> through

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
dead on center so I'm gonna go through

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.590 
dead on center so I'm gonna go through
our<00:03:10.940> table<00:03:11.330> and<00:03:11.840> let's<00:03:12.019> do<00:03:12.140> this<00:03:13.150> so<00:03:14.150> I<00:03:14.180> got<00:03:14.420> my

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
our table and let's do this so I got my

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.470 
our table and let's do this so I got my
router<00:03:14.959> bit<00:03:15.530> right<00:03:16.519> there<00:03:16.550> right<00:03:17.090> at<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.239> top

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
router bit right there right at the top

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.850 
router bit right there right at the top
line<00:03:17.780> so<00:03:18.170> I'm<00:03:18.230> going<00:03:18.380> to<00:03:18.440> cut<00:03:18.530> that<00:03:18.650> one<00:03:18.830> first

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
line so I'm going to cut that one first

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.550 
line so I'm going to cut that one first
lock<00:03:21.860> it<00:03:22.040> in

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:34.300 

I'll<00:03:25.459> bring<00:03:25.610> my<00:03:25.670> fence<00:03:26.030> across<00:03:26.150> I<00:03:32.680> have<00:03:33.680> a<00:03:33.709> few

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
I'll bring my fence across I have a few

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.430 
I'll bring my fence across I have a few
marks<00:03:35.180> right<00:03:35.390> here<00:03:35.600> and<00:03:35.720> that<00:03:35.870> tells<00:03:36.080> me<00:03:36.230> when

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
marks right here and that tells me when

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.830 
marks right here and that tells me when
I'm<00:03:36.560> going<00:03:36.680> to<00:03:36.740> start<00:03:36.980> and<00:03:37.190> where<00:03:37.340> I<00:03:37.370> gonna

pull out it's about an inch away from
the<00:03:40.750> router<00:03:41.750> bit<00:03:41.959> it<00:03:42.290> really<00:03:42.500> doesn't<00:03:42.860> matter

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
the router bit it really doesn't matter
