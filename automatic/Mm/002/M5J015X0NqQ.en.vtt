00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.440
 about hot money is that in Portuguese 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.240

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.849

 just look how cute is the hot money right 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.350
 a ten dollar bill catching fire 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.300
 well that we do not want our life 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.590

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.420
 real catching fire 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.240
 let alone a grade of 10 or 100 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.640
 dollars hot money is a term market 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.390
 financial and means a very 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.520
 specific lending operations 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.780
 hot money are very short term loans 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.750
 term 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.620
 has a normal period between 1 and 29 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.020
 days 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.680
 I need a break to report that 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.989
 some institutions carry out operations that 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.110
 are designated as hot money operations 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.090
 that extrapolate these 29 days 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.329
 I have seen some institutions that do 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.140
 this hot money operation for up to 45 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.840
 days 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.660
 but as a form of term context 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.610
 conventional hot money operations is 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.280
 really not very short 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.810
 term within the financial market is 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.820
 one of 29 days 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.580
 this loan but usually was 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.130
 they are usually made to attend 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.659
 immediate cash requirements of one 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.220
 company for example pay suppliers 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.540
 of the person explains in a more 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.950
 clear 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.140
 you are the owner of a company and you 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.100
 you need to pay your suppliers from here 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.439
 three days 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.479
 but you do not have money your customers 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.759
 They'll pay you in 15 days. 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.490
 i you have this option to get money 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.890
 borrowed from the bank in the form of hot 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.420
 money deleted the bank in 15 days 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.670
 who with their customers will pay 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.350
 that way you would not go without paying 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.240
 their suppliers 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.280
 the guarantees normally 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.890
 Financial Institution 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.180
 ask to offer hot loans 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.490
 money is the first guarantee 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.320
 duplication of vehicles and 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.420
 alienation of machines 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.329
 the guarantee is a type of guarantee that the 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.550
 so that there is no commitment on the part of 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:12.120
 pay that debt if the company does not 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.380
 pay for duplicates, for example if 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.050
 Fits in what I say. 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.970
 now you have duplicates 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.770
 to receive from customers in the amount of 20 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.600
 thousand reais you only need ten thousand 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.150
 in this hot money operation 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.160
 so you can offer your duplicates 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.260
 how to guarantee your customers' bank 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.370
 where you pay and you guarantee the bank the 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.290
 payment 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.170
 vehicles and machinery in the form of 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.540
 for example you give your 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.270
 vehicle of your company as collateral 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.000
 Assuming you do not pay the bank you can 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.340
 to perform this warranty and then 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.470
 vehicle is given at the place of payment 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.670
 the machines that make your company 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.080
 to function 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.600
 for example if you work with 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.310
 industry is the same as the vehicle 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.720
 this hot money operation that is 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.480
 important to remember that the operation 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.390
 very short term that goes from 1 and 29 days 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.790
 it has a simple interest rate and is 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.790
 the company pays in a 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.130
 lump sum or installment as you wish for 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.700
 example to buy new equipment 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:15.030
 even the jeans get 10 thousand reais with term 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.550
 20 days at a rate of 7% per month 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.290
 you see in this example we have the value 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.660
 than 10 thousand reais 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.120
 we have the deadline that was set in 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.310
 hiring that is 20 days 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.970
 and we have the interest rate that also 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.450
 was fixed at the contracting rate of 7% 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.250
 month 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.960
 in this example if we have seven per 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.040
 one hundred for every 30 days 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:41.610
 then for each day we will have 0.23 in 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.970
 20 days out of a total of 4.66 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:47.300
 interest it will focus on what we 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.780
 we borrowed the ten thousand reais 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:55.650
 10 thousand reais times 4.66 percent gives a 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:58.320
 total of 466 reais and sixty cents 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.900
 soon the total amount we will pay 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.850
 is ten thousand four hundred and sixty 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.700
 six reais and sixty 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.580
 we had a defined value a term 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.980
 in days also defined and a rate of 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.230
 interest rate also defined in the 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.980

 now that you have returned from the break 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.790
