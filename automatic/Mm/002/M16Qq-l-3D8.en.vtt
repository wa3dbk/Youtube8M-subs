00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.200
 motors 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.960
 the first trace of the plugged design 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:47.000
 I started doing this on a piece of paper 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.930
 in the year 2008 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.299
 at the time I thought oh nava seek support 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.929
 and the level of banking institutions 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.460
 to give life to this project 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:00.020
 unfortunately due to the financial conditions 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.509
 that he presented at the time was not 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.210
 possible to import but not yet 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:08.060
 I gave up the project and I was betting on it. 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.299
 as you invoice anything 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:15.890
 build and what I was and always 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:19.340
 seen the brand won eight models 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.190
 designed to think about the market in the year 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.830
 one of the new brand data groups 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.700
 band we are new jobs for every 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.980
 model that represented the tradition of 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.860
 I did my training outside the store 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.200
 rivaled outside of Angola along the 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.299
 execution of this project took many months 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.760
 distant family from the spring of 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:44.510
 my land and I believe it would be a 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.069
 fair 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.620
 Today I do not know, I could present 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.930
 that's what my root 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.920
 I am a home I am the way gives the 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.470
 Cunene 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:03:00.380
 and it was on this basis that what I 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:01.489
 I started the project started in 2008 was 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.190
 developed by engineers 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.920
 Americans and Canadians who have 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.590
 manufacture and assembly part of china 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.650
 was raped more than 8 million 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.680
 cars per year for various brands of 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.560
 top world 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.750
 the other part of the assembly of the 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.209
 human brand is made in our territory 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:26.189
 by local professionals 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.189
 find a job in this line 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.109
 at this time the program plus four 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:33.489
 employees in these four mechanics 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:37.299
 professionals will receive training in 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:39.879
 to be able to work in 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:42.219
 handle with the mounting of the 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:45.549
 care mainly to care for them come 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:48.790
 for Angola let's say 50% assembled by 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:52.090
 cause only the chassis the motor to 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.819
 electrical installation and the next plating 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.780
 the place therefore all other everything 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.829
 accessories 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.829
 we ride locally 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.939
 the Angolan small jeep reaches a 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.219
 speed of 140 kilometers per hour 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:09.790
 printing on all four wheels and 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:11.290
 agility to circulate in potter turn 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.060
 the only difference from cars 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.260
 is that it does not have an air 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.229
 conditioning 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.209
 so it 's a jeep blog boy but 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.370
 how much has all the required standards 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.330
 by the national road and 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.330
 Traffic 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.510
 so much so that we have our trademark 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.039
 we have the license that authorizes us to 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.690
 to be able to move freely however 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:34.090
 they have to have an enrollment they have to 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:37.620
 pay the circulation fee and must have 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.620
 compulsory insurance 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:47.600
 so they can circle the beaches 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:50.030
 do but it is in the field on the road so 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.220
 they can circulate freely in 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.650
 any location you have 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.160
 road or conditions so that they 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.160
 can circulate 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.390
 the new Angolan brand will still make 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.610
 more attractive the quality of the 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.020
 entrepreneurship to carry out a 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.230
 investment that the Angolan youth 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.770
 have to invest in various sectors of the 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.770
 economic market
