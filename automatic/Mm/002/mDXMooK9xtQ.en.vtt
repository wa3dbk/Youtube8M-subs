hi i'm josh from espares and in this

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.870 
hi i'm josh from espares and in this
video<00:00:10.139> i'm<00:00:10.620> going<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:11.010> show<00:00:11.190> you<00:00:11.250> how<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.550> fit<00:00:11.849> a

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
video i'm going to show you how to fit a

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.589 
video i'm going to show you how to fit a
multi-position<00:00:12.570> switch<00:00:13.170> on<00:00:13.469> your<00:00:14.099> hop<00:00:14.599> hobbes

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
multi-position switch on your hop hobbes

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.330 
multi-position switch on your hop hobbes
can<00:00:15.839> have<00:00:15.990> two<00:00:16.230> different<00:00:16.379> types<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.920> switches

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
can have two different types of switches

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.939 
can have two different types of switches
one<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.820> sim<00:00:18.150> estat<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.810> that's<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.470> variable

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
one is a sim estat and that's a variable

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.279 
one is a sim estat and that's a variable
position<00:00:20.580> switch<00:00:20.760> which<00:00:21.210> can<00:00:21.420> be<00:00:21.539> set<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.810> any

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
position switch which can be set to any

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.640 
position switch which can be set to any
position<00:00:22.740> within<00:00:23.580> its<00:00:23.820> rotation<00:00:24.570> other<00:00:25.140> hobs

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
position within its rotation other hobs

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.910 
position within its rotation other hobs
use<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.430> multi<00:00:27.330> position<00:00:27.570> switch<00:00:28.019> like<00:00:28.590> this

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
use a multi position switch like this

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.970 
use a multi position switch like this
one<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:29.789> has<00:00:30.029> fixed<00:00:30.510> positions<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.830> it

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
one and this has fixed positions that it

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.030 
one and this has fixed positions that it
can<00:00:32.160> be<00:00:32.340> turned<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:34.079> process<00:00:34.500> for<00:00:34.710> fitting

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
can be turned to the process for fitting

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.520 
can be turned to the process for fitting
either<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.640> multi<00:00:36.030> position<00:00:36.239> switch<00:00:36.780> or<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.079> sim

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
either a multi position switch or a sim

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.430 
either a multi position switch or a sim
estat<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.610> very<00:00:38.910> similar<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.600> in<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.230> video

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
estat is very similar and in this video

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.920 
estat is very similar and in this video
i'm<00:00:40.829> using<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:41.370> micro<00:00:41.940> mark<00:00:42.210> hub<00:00:42.510> but<00:00:42.840> the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
i'm using a micro mark hub but the

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.660 
i'm using a micro mark hub but the
process<00:00:43.350> should<00:00:43.530> be<00:00:43.649> fairly<00:00:43.680> similar<00:00:44.190> for

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
process should be fairly similar for

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.920 
process should be fairly similar for
most<00:00:44.969> types<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.870> hob<00:00:46.160> now<00:00:47.160> before<00:00:47.520> we<00:00:47.610> begin

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
most types of hob now before we begin

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.930 
most types of hob now before we begin
make<00:00:48.930> sure<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.260> your<00:00:49.410> hob<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.800> turned<00:00:50.370> off<00:00:50.670> at

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
make sure that your hob is turned off at

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.740 
make sure that your hob is turned off at
the<00:00:51.300> mains<00:00:52.160> most<00:00:53.160> hubs<00:00:53.430> are<00:00:53.579> also<00:00:53.730> hard<00:00:54.270> wired

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
the mains most hubs are also hard wired

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.540 
the mains most hubs are also hard wired
so<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.140> won't<00:00:55.350> actually<00:00:55.590> be<00:00:55.829> able<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.129> unplug

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
so you won't actually be able to unplug

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.310 
so you won't actually be able to unplug
it<00:00:56.760> but<00:00:57.090> if<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.270> want<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.510> be<00:00:57.600> extra<00:00:57.899> safe<00:00:58.079> you

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
it but if you want to be extra safe you

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.920 
it but if you want to be extra safe you
can<00:00:58.559> turn<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.920> off<00:00:59.070> at<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.760> fuse<00:01:00.329> board<00:01:00.600> as

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
can turn it off at the fuse board as

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.180 
can turn it off at the fuse board as
well

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
well

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.030 
well
hobs<00:01:02.550> tend<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.969> be<00:01:03.090> set<00:01:03.390> into<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.780> cavity<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
hobs tend to be set into a cavity in the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.609 
hobs tend to be set into a cavity in the
worktop<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.119> some<00:01:06.510> are<00:01:06.659> also<00:01:06.810> clipped<00:01:07.380> in

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
worktop and some are also clipped in

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.300 
worktop and some are also clipped in
place<00:01:07.920> underneath<00:01:08.549> for<00:01:09.180> safety<00:01:10.070> just<00:01:11.070> have<00:01:11.280> a

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
place underneath for safety just have a

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.980 
place underneath for safety just have a
check<00:01:11.610> before<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.030> try<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.360> get<00:01:12.600> yours<00:01:12.780> out

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
check before you try to get yours out

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.149 
check before you try to get yours out
that<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.260> isn't<00:01:13.380> clipped<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:13.890> place

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
that it isn't clipped in place

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.640 
that it isn't clipped in place
underneath<00:01:14.909> obviously<00:01:15.630> if<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:15.990> just<00:01:16.259> undo

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
underneath obviously if it is just undo

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.640 
underneath obviously if it is just undo
those<00:01:16.830> clips<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.689> can<00:01:18.900> lift<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.500> out

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
those clips so that you can lift it out

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.350 
those clips so that you can lift it out
and<00:01:19.920> once<00:01:20.520> you've<00:01:20.640> got<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.820> out<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.150> first

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
and once you've got it out the first

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.390 
and once you've got it out the first
thing<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.720> need<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.960> do<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.380> remove<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.860> knob

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
thing you need to do is remove the knob

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.999 
thing you need to do is remove the knob
on<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.840> switch<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.080> you're<00:01:25.259> replacing<00:01:25.500> now

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
on the switch that you're replacing now

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.219 
on the switch that you're replacing now
in<00:01:26.100> most<00:01:26.280> cases<00:01:26.580> these<00:01:26.909> simply<00:01:27.360> pull<00:01:27.630> straight

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
in most cases these simply pull straight

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.880 
in most cases these simply pull straight
off<00:01:28.490> like<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:30.229> once<00:01:31.229> you've<00:01:31.350> got<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> knob<00:01:31.740> off

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
off like so once you've got the knob off

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.789 
off like so once you've got the knob off
and<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.729> next<00:01:33.000> thing<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.270> do<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.750> grab<00:01:34.170> some

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
and the next thing to do is grab some

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.920 
and the next thing to do is grab some
pliers<00:01:35.040> or<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.430> spanner<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.090> undo<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.659> nut

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
pliers or a spanner and undo the nut

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:46.569 
pliers or a spanner and undo the nut
that's<00:01:37.439> holding<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.700> switch<00:01:39.000> onto<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.259> hob

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.639 

now<00:01:47.579> I've<00:01:47.700> got<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.970> nut<00:01:48.149> off<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.659> can<00:01:49.140> just<00:01:49.350> turn

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
now I've got the nut off I can just turn

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.450 
now I've got the nut off I can just turn
the<00:01:50.070> whole<00:01:50.280> hob<00:01:50.670> onto<00:01:51.299> its<00:01:51.450> front<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:53.340> very

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
the whole hob onto its front and very

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.830 
the whole hob onto its front and very
gently<00:01:53.790> lay<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.180> down<00:01:54.320> and<00:01:56.299> I<00:01:57.299> now<00:01:57.509> need<00:01:57.719> to

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
gently lay it down and I now need to

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.560 
gently lay it down and I now need to
separate<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.710> base<00:01:59.250> plate<00:01:59.460> from<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.360> rest

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
separate this base plate from the rest

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.630 
separate this base plate from the rest
of<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.869> hob<00:02:01.049> now<00:02:01.290> on<00:02:01.439> this<00:02:01.590> one<00:02:01.829> it's<00:02:02.130> held<00:02:02.430> in

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
of the hob now on this one it's held in

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.630 
of the hob now on this one it's held in
by<00:02:02.850> four<00:02:03.570> screws<00:02:03.950> here<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.189> I'm<00:02:05.280> just<00:02:05.430> going<00:02:05.610> to

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
by four screws here so I'm just going to

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.900 
by four screws here so I'm just going to
go<00:02:05.759> ahead<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.119> unscrew<00:02:06.299> those

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.430 

so<00:02:12.910> I've<00:02:13.000> got<00:02:13.150> those<00:02:13.300> four<00:02:13.570> screws<00:02:13.750> off<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.290> can

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
so I've got those four screws off I can

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.040 
so I've got those four screws off I can
just<00:02:14.620> lift<00:02:14.830> that<00:02:14.950> baseplate<00:02:15.810> straight<00:02:16.810> off

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
just lift that baseplate straight off

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.150 
just lift that baseplate straight off
and<00:02:17.260> I'll<00:02:17.320> just<00:02:17.440> pop<00:02:17.650> that<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:19.420> one<00:02:19.450> side<00:02:22.020> and

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
and I'll just pop that to one side and

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.580 
and I'll just pop that to one side and
here<00:02:24.160> we<00:02:24.460> can<00:02:24.610> see<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.300> switches<00:02:25.990> underneath

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
here we can see the switches underneath

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.340 
here we can see the switches underneath
and<00:02:27.100> now<00:02:27.430> this<00:02:27.580> is<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.940> switch<00:02:28.360> I'm<00:02:28.660> going<00:02:29.050> to

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
and now this is the switch I'm going to

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.510 
and now this is the switch I'm going to
be<00:02:30.010> replacing<00:02:30.630> in<00:02:31.630> normal<00:02:32.290> circumstances<00:02:33.160> and

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
be replacing in normal circumstances and

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.820 
be replacing in normal circumstances and
we'd<00:02:33.790> tell<00:02:34.060> you<00:02:34.240> to<00:02:34.360> take<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.570> photo<00:02:34.930> of<00:02:35.500> the

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
we'd tell you to take a photo of the

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.490 
we'd tell you to take a photo of the
connections<00:02:36.640> as<00:02:36.940> a<00:02:37.000> reminder<00:02:37.630> of<00:02:37.660> how<00:02:38.050> to<00:02:38.110> fit

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
connections as a reminder of how to fit

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.220 
connections as a reminder of how to fit
the<00:02:38.740> new<00:02:39.280> part<00:02:39.610> but<00:02:40.390> in<00:02:40.510> this<00:02:40.690> case<00:02:40.960> there's

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
the new part but in this case there's

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.170 
the new part but in this case there's
actually<00:02:41.590> a<00:02:41.740> couple<00:02:42.310> of<00:02:42.400> wires<00:02:42.670> that<00:02:42.970> are<00:02:43.030> the

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
actually a couple of wires that are the

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.240 
actually a couple of wires that are the
same<00:02:43.390> color<00:02:43.450> so<00:02:44.260> there<00:02:44.500> is<00:02:44.620> potential<00:02:44.950> for

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
same color so there is potential for

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.070 
same color so there is potential for
them<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.550> be<00:02:45.670> mixed<00:02:46.360> up<00:02:46.540> when<00:02:46.750> you're<00:02:46.870> swapping

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
them to be mixed up when you're swapping

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.950 
them to be mixed up when you're swapping
them<00:02:47.380> over<00:02:47.650> so<00:02:48.130> for<00:02:48.520> that<00:02:48.610> reason<00:02:49.210> it's

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
them over so for that reason it's

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.680 
them over so for that reason it's
actually<00:02:50.380> better<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.830> simply<00:02:51.580> swap<00:02:52.030> one<00:02:52.360> wire

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
actually better to simply swap one wire

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.260 
actually better to simply swap one wire
onto<00:02:53.050> the<00:02:53.680> replacement<00:02:54.370> switch<00:02:54.640> at<00:02:54.910> a<00:02:55.030> time

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
onto the replacement switch at a time

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.090 
onto the replacement switch at a time
and<00:02:55.450> that<00:02:55.570> means<00:02:55.780> you're<00:02:56.050> less<00:02:56.440> likely<00:02:56.860> to<00:02:56.890> get

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
and that means you're less likely to get

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.930 
and that means you're less likely to get
them<00:02:57.280> muddled<00:02:57.610> up

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
them muddled up

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.330 
them muddled up
these<00:02:58.510> are<00:02:58.690> simple<00:02:58.990> Spade<00:02:59.590> connector<00:03:00.100> wires

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
these are simple Spade connector wires

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.520 
these are simple Spade connector wires
so<00:03:00.640> you<00:03:00.670> can<00:03:00.910> just<00:03:01.090> pull<00:03:01.270> them<00:03:01.450> straight<00:03:01.630> off

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.450 

and<00:03:06.000> then<00:03:07.000> fit<00:03:07.450> them<00:03:07.660> onto<00:03:07.900> your<00:03:08.500> replacement

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
and then fit them onto your replacement

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.050 
and then fit them onto your replacement
switch<00:03:10.950> okay<00:03:11.950> so<00:03:12.160> now<00:03:12.430> I've<00:03:12.550> swapped<00:03:12.820> the

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
switch okay so now I've swapped the

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.900 
switch okay so now I've swapped the
connections<00:03:13.600> over<00:03:13.810> I<00:03:14.140> can<00:03:15.040> take<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.400> old

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
connections over I can take the old

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.960 
connections over I can take the old
switch<00:03:16.360> out<00:03:16.660> and<00:03:17.050> pop<00:03:17.770> the<00:03:17.920> new<00:03:17.950> one<00:03:18.280> in<00:03:18.640> its

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
switch out and pop the new one in its

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.190 
switch out and pop the new one in its
place<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:21.489> I'm<00:03:21.610> just<00:03:21.790> going<00:03:21.970> to<00:03:22.090> refit<00:03:23.050> the

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
place and I'm just going to refit the

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.380 
place and I'm just going to refit the
nuts<00:03:23.470> to<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:23.950> shaft<00:03:24.459> of<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:24.760> switch<00:03:25.060> on<00:03:25.300> the

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
nuts to the shaft of the switch on the

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.240 
nuts to the shaft of the switch on the
other<00:03:25.540> side<00:03:25.750> to<00:03:26.260> make<00:03:26.410> sure<00:03:26.620> it's<00:03:26.800> in<00:03:26.950> the

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
other side to make sure it's in the

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.570 
other side to make sure it's in the
correct<00:03:27.370> position<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.950> now<00:03:33.070> that's<00:03:33.220> in<00:03:33.400> place

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
correct position and now that's in place

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:43.110 
correct position and now that's in place
I<00:03:33.820> need<00:03:33.970> to<00:03:34.090> reattach<00:03:34.420> the<00:03:34.840> base<00:03:34.989> plate<00:03:42.120> and

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
I need to reattach the base plate and

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.699 
I need to reattach the base plate and
now<00:03:43.330> all<00:03:43.600> the<00:03:43.750> remains<00:03:45.959> is<00:03:46.959> to<00:03:47.230> fit<00:03:47.440> the<00:03:47.470> knob

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
now all the remains is to fit the knob

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.830 
now all the remains is to fit the knob
back<00:03:47.950> on<00:03:48.190> to<00:03:48.580> the<00:03:48.790> shaft<00:03:49.090> and<00:03:50.880> that's<00:03:51.880> it<00:03:52.090> now

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
back on to the shaft and that's it now

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.780 
back on to the shaft and that's it now
if<00:03:52.989> you've<00:03:53.140> had<00:03:53.350> to<00:03:53.650> disturb<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.459> seal<00:03:54.760> that
