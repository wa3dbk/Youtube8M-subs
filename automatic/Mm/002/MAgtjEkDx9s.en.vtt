00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.759
 Hello, my name is Dmitry 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.040
 Moiseenko 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.750
 I am a traveler photographer and I want 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.150
 tell you about what should be in 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.640
 backpack of any traveler who 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.449
 going to photograph this filters 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.400
 photographer Dmitry Moiseenko in the past 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.550
 worked on television in programs about 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.600
 travels behind Dmitri photo and 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.140
 video filming in more than 90 countries 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.559
 panoramic photographer epson by awards 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.270
 2013 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:45.200
 one of the authors of the project airpano for example 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.120
 I carry protective filters with me 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.800
 polarizing and gradient filters 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.039
 filters so-called filters 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.170
 neutral density and so now i'm 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.600
 I want to show the filter first 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.539
 protective camera lenses can 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.250
 exposed to various influences 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:05.610
 can a photographer get into a dust storm 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.030
 or for example the camera can he 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.810
 just fall out of hand and there fall on 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.450
 the lens and at this point the lens which 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.570
 much more expensive than this filter 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.290
 turns out to be protected the filter can 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.299
 crack or dust there lenses 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.200
 the camera will remain intact and 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:31.439
 safety still protective filters 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.570
 possess certain properties of delay 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.079
 ultraviolet rays and 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.759
 it allows you to get rid of some 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.729
 such bloom and blue 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.540
 in the frame that we get takes 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.149
 protective filter 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.070
 the oldest and probably the most important filter 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.939
 I carried with me this 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:54.509
 polarizing filter it consists of 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.670
 main ring and rotating ring 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.200
 when we rotate one ring 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.200
 regarding another 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.600
 we change the polarization of passing 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.260
 Light for what it is done I will not 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.060
 go into physically details but 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.350
 and if we screw this filter on 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.920
 lens and see the viewfinder and 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.970
 twist the ring 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:21.960
 then we will notice that at the moment of rotation 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:25.490
 the sky changes its shade and out for example 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:28.710
 such a dull blue it becomes 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.750
 bright blue and it very much allows 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.660
 increase the impression of the frame 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.880
 strengthen if there are clouds in the sky that they 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.790
 become bright white and very good 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.850
 stand out against the sky 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.730
 also the polarizing filter allows 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.290
 fight reflections 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.040
 eg 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.530
 in windows of cars or on reservoirs when us 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.200
 need to get rid of parasitic reflections 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.409
 then using this filter we are from them 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.750
 get rid and this filter i use 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:03.359
 very often sometimes i just don't him 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.659
 rented out during the day because always 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:10.230
 I want to have a bright sky that much 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:12.510
 differ from what is available to ours 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.700
 camera without this polarizing 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.230
 tinka 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.129
 today we talked with you about various 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.090
 filters 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:23.159
 protective filters polarizing filters 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.790
 with you was a photographer Dmitry Moiseenko before 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:25.790
 new meetings
