00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
model of the tuning fork we're using a

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.369

software<00:00:13.280> package<00:00:13.670> called<00:00:13.700> abacus<00:00:14.420> so<00:00:15.230> here

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.379 
software package called abacus so here

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:16.990 
software package called abacus so here
we<00:00:15.469> can<00:00:15.559> see<00:00:15.710> the<00:00:15.830> three-dimensional<00:00:16.070> mesh

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
we can see the three-dimensional mesh

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.540 
we can see the three-dimensional mesh
model<00:00:17.600> of<00:00:17.780> the<00:00:17.960> fork<00:00:18.199> we're<00:00:19.190> using<00:00:19.340> the

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
model of the fork we're using the

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.920

software<00:00:19.940> to<00:00:20.090> perform<00:00:20.449> what's<00:00:20.600> called<00:00:20.690> a

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
software to perform what's called a

modal<00:00:21.260> analysis<00:00:21.770> of<00:00:21.949> the<00:00:22.010> tuning<00:00:22.279> fork<00:00:22.310> it

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
modal analysis of the tuning fork it

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.310 
modal analysis of the tuning fork it
will<00:00:23.330> show<00:00:23.510> us<00:00:23.660> all<00:00:23.869> of<00:00:23.929> the<00:00:24.170> natural

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
will show us all of the natural

simulation<00:00:29.539> is<00:00:29.720> of<00:00:29.990> unconstrained<00:00:30.890> motion<00:00:31.369> so

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
simulation is of unconstrained motion so

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.460 
simulation is of unconstrained motion so
we<00:00:31.999> don't<00:00:32.150> have<00:00:32.270> any<00:00:32.390> boundary<00:00:32.780> conditions<00:00:33.230> on

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
we don't have any boundary conditions on

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.890 
we don't have any boundary conditions on
the<00:00:33.680> end<00:00:33.860> of<00:00:34.010> the<00:00:34.070> tuning<00:00:34.310> fork<00:00:34.360> the<00:00:35.360> result<00:00:35.720> is

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
the end of the tuning fork the result is

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.470 
the end of the tuning fork the result is
we<00:00:36.079> get<00:00:36.200> six<00:00:36.590> rigid<00:00:37.310> body<00:00:37.520> modes<00:00:38.030> that

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
we get six rigid body modes that

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.709 
we get six rigid body modes that
correspond<00:00:39.020> to<00:00:39.110> the<00:00:39.260> unconstrained<00:00:39.920> motion

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
correspond to the unconstrained motion

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.880 
correspond to the unconstrained motion
alright<00:00:41.719> so<00:00:41.840> the<00:00:41.930> first<00:00:41.960> real<00:00:42.500> mode<00:00:42.710> of

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
alright so the first real mode of

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.729 
alright so the first real mode of
vibration<00:00:43.370> is<00:00:43.520> the<00:00:43.789> seventh<00:00:44.180> mode<00:00:44.420> and<00:00:44.739> here

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
vibration is the seventh mode and here

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.099 
vibration is the seventh mode and here
it's<00:00:45.829> reporting<00:00:46.219> a<00:00:46.280> frequency<00:00:46.789> of<00:00:47.030> about<00:00:47.300> 550

00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:48.109 
it's reporting a frequency of about 550

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:50.380 
it's reporting a frequency of about 550
that's<00:00:49.100> a<00:00:49.160> little<00:00:49.309> larger<00:00:49.699> than<00:00:49.730> our<00:00:50.030> than<00:00:50.270> our

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
that's a little larger than our than our

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.180 
that's a little larger than our than our
fork<00:00:50.719> is<00:00:50.930> but<00:00:51.289> we<00:00:51.559> don't<00:00:51.649> know<00:00:51.800> the<00:00:51.829> exact

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
fork is but we don't know the exact

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.590 
fork is but we don't know the exact
material<00:00:52.579> properties<00:00:53.030> of<00:00:53.180> the<00:00:53.300> tuning<00:00:53.570> fork

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
material properties of the tuning fork

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.500 
material properties of the tuning fork
so<00:00:54.170> we<00:00:54.260> had<00:00:54.379> to<00:00:54.469> estimate<00:00:54.620> those<00:00:55.329> again<00:00:56.329> this

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
so we had to estimate those again this

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.240 
so we had to estimate those again this
window<00:00:56.809> is<00:00:56.930> listing<00:00:57.350> all<00:00:57.530> of<00:00:57.590> the<00:00:57.859> modes

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
window is listing all of the modes

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.970 
window is listing all of the modes
identified<00:00:59.120> by<00:00:59.300> the<00:00:59.359> modal<00:00:59.660> analysis<00:01:00.170> again

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
identified by the modal analysis again

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.889 
identified by the modal analysis again
the<00:01:01.100> first<00:01:01.280> six<00:01:01.640> are<00:01:01.910> rigid<00:01:02.210> body<00:01:02.420> motion

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
the first six are rigid body motion

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:04.479 
the first six are rigid body motion
modes<00:01:03.109> because<00:01:03.469> this<00:01:03.620> is<00:01:03.739> an<00:01:03.829> unconstrained

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
modes because this is an unconstrained

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.150 
modes because this is an unconstrained
simulation<00:01:05.090> mode<00:01:05.930> seven<00:01:06.380> is<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:06.650> first<00:01:06.890> mode

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
simulation mode seven is the first mode

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.770 
simulation mode seven is the first mode
that<00:01:07.370> we<00:01:07.550> hear<00:01:07.910> and<00:01:08.090> that's<00:01:09.340> 547<00:01:10.340> here<00:01:10.550> and<00:01:11.090> we

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
that we hear and that's 547 here and we

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.150 
that we hear and that's 547 here and we
have<00:01:11.930> several<00:01:12.140> other<00:01:12.350> modes<00:01:12.590> of<00:01:12.710> vibration

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
have several other modes of vibration

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.680 
have several other modes of vibration
we're<00:01:13.250> going<00:01:13.370> to<00:01:13.430> visualize<00:01:13.550> in<00:01:14.150> a<00:01:14.360> little<00:01:14.570> bit

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
we're going to visualize in a little bit

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.170 
we're going to visualize in a little bit
and<00:01:15.160> again<00:01:16.160> the<00:01:16.310> higher<00:01:16.460> frequency<00:01:16.910> that<00:01:17.030> we

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
and again the higher frequency that we

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.780 
and again the higher frequency that we
hear<00:01:17.360> on<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:17.510> tuning<00:01:17.780> fork<00:01:17.810> is<00:01:18.230> mode<00:01:18.500> 11<00:01:19.040> which

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
hear on the tuning fork is mode 11 which

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.080 
hear on the tuning fork is mode 11 which
is<00:01:19.880> vibrating<00:01:20.060> at<00:01:20.510> 32<00:01:21.170> 88<00:01:21.590> this<00:01:22.580> is<00:01:22.730> the<00:01:22.820> first

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
is vibrating at 32 88 this is the first

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.630 
is vibrating at 32 88 this is the first
or<00:01:23.360> fundamental<00:01:24.200> mode<00:01:24.470> which<00:01:24.860> corresponds<00:01:25.580> to

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
or fundamental mode which corresponds to

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.460 
or fundamental mode which corresponds to
the<00:01:25.850> frequency<00:01:26.000> that<00:01:26.420> we<00:01:26.540> hear<00:01:26.840> of<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.200> tuning

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
the frequency that we hear of the tuning

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.890 
the frequency that we hear of the tuning
fork<00:01:28.240> obviously<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.360> amplitude<00:01:29.750> of<00:01:29.810> this

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
fork obviously the amplitude of this

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.930 
fork obviously the amplitude of this
motion<00:01:30.290> is<00:01:30.380> exaggerated<00:01:31.070> in<00:01:31.250> this<00:01:31.520> animation

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
motion is exaggerated in this animation

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.240 
motion is exaggerated in this animation
so<00:01:32.480> we<00:01:32.570> can<00:01:32.720> clearly<00:01:32.960> see<00:01:33.230> the<00:01:33.440> the<00:01:33.770> mode<00:01:33.950> shape

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
so we can clearly see the the mode shape

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.310 
so we can clearly see the the mode shape
and<00:01:34.490> its<00:01:34.700> motion<00:01:34.940> you'll<00:01:35.750> notice<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.140> time

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
and its motion you'll notice the time

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.830 
and its motion you'll notice the time
motion<00:01:36.740> is<00:01:36.830> symmetric<00:01:37.400> this<00:01:38.330> results<00:01:38.750> in

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
motion is symmetric this results in

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.840 
motion is symmetric this results in
balanced<00:01:39.320> forces<00:01:39.710> so<00:01:40.190> we<00:01:40.220> don't<00:01:40.460> feel<00:01:40.640> any

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
balanced forces so we don't feel any

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.990 
balanced forces so we don't feel any
strong<00:01:41.750> force<00:01:42.140> at<00:01:42.410> the<00:01:42.800> support<00:01:43.040> so<00:01:43.850> our

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
strong force at the support so our

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.030 
strong force at the support so our
fingers<00:01:44.240> do<00:01:44.540> not<00:01:44.690> dampen<00:01:45.170> this<00:01:45.290> motion<00:01:45.710> it's

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
fingers do not dampen this motion it's

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.750 
fingers do not dampen this motion it's
allowed<00:01:46.280> to<00:01:46.490> ring<00:01:47.890> this<00:01:48.890> is<00:01:49.070> the<00:01:49.190> second<00:01:49.580> mode

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
allowed to ring this is the second mode

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.150 
allowed to ring this is the second mode
of<00:01:49.790> vibration<00:01:50.560> each<00:01:51.560> higher<00:01:51.890> mode

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
of vibration each higher mode

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.910 
of vibration each higher mode
corresponds<00:01:52.790> to<00:01:52.820> a<00:01:52.940> higher<00:01:53.180> frequency<00:01:53.920> this

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
corresponds to a higher frequency this

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.890 
corresponds to a higher frequency this
is<00:01:55.100> an<00:01:55.220> example<00:01:55.490> of<00:01:55.670> an<00:01:55.790> unbalanced<00:01:56.420> mode<00:01:56.660> as

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
is an example of an unbalanced mode as

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.220 
is an example of an unbalanced mode as
the<00:01:57.800> fork<00:01:58.190> vibrates<00:01:58.700> this<00:01:58.850> way<00:01:59.060> we<00:01:59.630> have<00:01:59.810> large

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
the fork vibrates this way we have large

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.770 
the fork vibrates this way we have large
motion<00:02:00.800> at<00:02:01.010> the<00:02:01.220> support<00:02:01.640> so<00:02:02.270> obviously<00:02:02.660> our

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
motion at the support so obviously our

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.270 
motion at the support so obviously our
fingers<00:02:03.140> would<00:02:03.320> dampen<00:02:03.530> this<00:02:03.770> motion<00:02:04.130> out

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
fingers would dampen this motion out

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.150 
fingers would dampen this motion out
early<00:02:04.670> on<00:02:04.700> after<00:02:05.450> hitting<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:05.720> fork<00:02:06.040> so<00:02:07.040> we

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
early on after hitting the fork so we

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.219 
early on after hitting the fork so we
don't<00:02:07.310> hear<00:02:07.490> this<00:02:07.700> frequency<00:02:08.209> in<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:08.810> tuning

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
don't hear this frequency in the tuning

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.860 
don't hear this frequency in the tuning
fork<00:02:09.259> motion<00:02:10.120> this<00:02:11.120> is<00:02:11.270> the<00:02:11.390> third<00:02:11.599> mode<00:02:11.840> of

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
fork motion this is the third mode of

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.710 
fork motion this is the third mode of
vibration<00:02:12.470> which<00:02:12.680> is<00:02:13.310> also<00:02:13.580> unbalanced<00:02:14.330> so<00:02:14.629> we

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
vibration which is also unbalanced so we

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.899 
vibration which is also unbalanced so we
have<00:02:14.810> large<00:02:15.050> motion<00:02:15.440> at<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.650> support<00:02:16.010> so

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:16.909 
have large motion at the support so

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:18.280 
have large motion at the support so
obviously<00:02:17.269> our<00:02:17.420> fingers<00:02:17.719> would<00:02:17.870> dampen<00:02:18.049> this

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
obviously our fingers would dampen this

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.960 
obviously our fingers would dampen this
motion<00:02:18.620> as<00:02:18.739> well<00:02:19.120> this<00:02:20.120> is<00:02:20.269> the<00:02:20.390> fourth<00:02:20.629> mode

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
motion as well this is the fourth mode

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.210 
motion as well this is the fourth mode
also<00:02:21.660> unbalanced<00:02:22.320> it's<00:02:22.560> an<00:02:22.680> out<00:02:22.860> of<00:02:22.890> plane

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
also unbalanced it's an out of plane

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.850 
also unbalanced it's an out of plane
vibration<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:24.170> this<00:02:25.170> is<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.380> fifth<00:02:25.620> mode

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
vibration and this is the fifth mode

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.340 
vibration and this is the fifth mode
this<00:02:26.550> is<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.910> next<00:02:27.300> mode<00:02:27.480> which<00:02:27.780> which<00:02:28.170> is

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
this is the next mode which which is

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.350 
this is the next mode which which is
balanced<00:02:28.860> we<00:02:29.370> have<00:02:29.490> very<00:02:29.730> little<00:02:29.910> motion<00:02:30.270> at

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
balanced we have very little motion at

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.330 
balanced we have very little motion at
the<00:02:30.450> support<00:02:30.780> so<00:02:31.740> when<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.010> strike<00:02:32.220> the

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
the support so when you strike the

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.130 
the support so when you strike the
tuning<00:02:32.610> fork<00:02:32.640> this<00:02:33.150> high<00:02:33.330> frequency<00:02:33.570> sound

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
tuning fork this high frequency sound

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.320 
tuning fork this high frequency sound
can<00:02:34.440> be<00:02:34.470> heard<00:02:34.620> although<00:02:35.610> it<00:02:35.730> does<00:02:35.910> die<00:02:36.120> out

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
can be heard although it does die out

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.590 
can be heard although it does die out
faster<00:02:36.870> than<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.260> first<00:02:37.590> mode<00:02:37.860> vibration

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
faster than the first mode vibration

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.120 
faster than the first mode vibration
again<00:02:39.600> notice<00:02:40.110> that<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.380> time<00:02:40.620> motion<00:02:41.010> is

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
again notice that the time motion is

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.980 
again notice that the time motion is
symmetrical<00:02:41.700> helping<00:02:42.600> to<00:02:42.690> create<00:02:42.840> this

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
symmetrical helping to create this

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.780 
symmetrical helping to create this
balanced<00:02:43.410> motion<00:02:43.770> and<00:02:43.950> no<00:02:44.220> motion<00:02:44.580> of<00:02:44.700> the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
balanced motion and no motion of the

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.110 
balanced motion and no motion of the
support<00:02:45.680> this<00:02:46.680> is<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:46.920> sixth<00:02:47.340> mode<00:02:47.520> which<00:02:47.970> is

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
support this is the sixth mode which is

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.610 
support this is the sixth mode which is
actually<00:02:48.420> very<00:02:48.450> similar<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.080> second<00:02:49.530> mode

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
actually very similar to the second mode

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.170 
actually very similar to the second mode
of<00:02:49.650> vibration<00:02:50.220> which<00:02:50.370> is<00:02:50.490> a<00:02:50.580> torsional

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
of vibration which is a torsional

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.170 
of vibration which is a torsional
vibration<00:02:52.220> we<00:02:53.220> just<00:02:53.400> have<00:02:53.550> more<00:02:53.700> complex

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
vibration we just have more complex

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.360 
vibration we just have more complex
motion<00:02:54.540> in<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.900> tines<00:02:55.170> during<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.010> twisting

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
motion in the tines during the twisting

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.190 
motion in the tines during the twisting
again<00:02:56.970> it's<00:02:57.120> unbalanced<00:02:57.750> because<00:02:58.020> of<00:02:58.110> the

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
again it's unbalanced because of the

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.280 
again it's unbalanced because of the
motion<00:02:58.470> at<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.680> bottom<00:02:59.750> with<00:03:00.750> higher<00:03:00.990> modes

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
motion at the bottom with higher modes

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.470 
motion at the bottom with higher modes
the<00:03:01.830> mode<00:03:02.070> shapes<00:03:02.400> become<00:03:02.760> more<00:03:02.910> complicated

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
the mode shapes become more complicated

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.630 
the mode shapes become more complicated
more<00:03:03.870> sinusoidal<00:03:04.470> but<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.070> motions<00:03:05.370> are<00:03:05.460> very

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
more sinusoidal but the motions are very

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.310 
more sinusoidal but the motions are very
similar<00:03:05.910> to<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.270> lower<00:03:06.450> modes<00:03:06.720> but<00:03:07.110> again

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
similar to the lower modes but again

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.480 
similar to the lower modes but again
they<00:03:07.410> are<00:03:07.440> occurring<00:03:07.860> at<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:08.010> higher<00:03:08.220> frequency

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
they are occurring at a higher frequency

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.360 
they are occurring at a higher frequency
and<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:09.180> more<00:03:09.360> complicated<00:03:09.660> shape<00:03:10.160> this<00:03:11.160> is<00:03:11.310> the

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
and a more complicated shape this is the

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.100 
and a more complicated shape this is the
eighth<00:03:11.520> mode<00:03:11.790> again<00:03:12.480> it's<00:03:12.600> out<00:03:12.750> of<00:03:12.900> plane

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
eighth mode again it's out of plane

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.840 
eighth mode again it's out of plane
vibration<00:03:13.140> with<00:03:13.920> a<00:03:13.950> more<00:03:14.160> complicated<00:03:14.460> mode

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
vibration with a more complicated mode

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.210 
vibration with a more complicated mode
shape<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.270> higher<00:03:15.750> frequency<00:03:16.260> this<00:03:16.980> is<00:03:17.130> the

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
shape and higher frequency this is the

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.610 
shape and higher frequency this is the
9th<00:03:17.460> mode<00:03:17.700> it's<00:03:18.120> frequency<00:03:18.540> is<00:03:18.900> more<00:03:19.260> than<00:03:19.380> ten

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
9th mode it's frequency is more than ten

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.550 
9th mode it's frequency is more than ten
times<00:03:19.860> the<00:03:20.280> first<00:03:20.460> mode<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:21.170> we're<00:03:22.170> getting<00:03:22.260> a

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
times the first mode and we're getting a

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.250 
times the first mode and we're getting a
complicated<00:03:23.280> piston<00:03:23.670> type<00:03:23.790> motion<00:03:24.240> of<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:25.020> x

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
complicated piston type motion of the x

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.680 
complicated piston type motion of the x
caused<00:03:25.860> by<00:03:26.130> more<00:03:26.550> vibration<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:27.510> base<00:03:27.660> of

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
caused by more vibration and the base of

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.510 
caused by more vibration and the base of
the<00:03:27.930> fork<00:03:28.140> and<00:03:28.440> again<00:03:29.070> this<00:03:29.130> is<00:03:29.280> a<00:03:29.310> very

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
the fork and again this is a very

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.280 
the fork and again this is a very
unbalanced<00:03:30.120> mode<00:03:30.330> because<00:03:30.690> of<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.870> extreme

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
unbalanced mode because of the extreme

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.040 
unbalanced mode because of the extreme
motion<00:03:31.590> of<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:31.920> support

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.050 

the<00:03:37.830> first<00:03:38.040> simulation<00:03:38.250> was<00:03:38.790> of

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
the first simulation was of

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.030 
the first simulation was of
unconstrained<00:03:39.720> motion<00:03:40.110> so<00:03:40.530> we<00:03:40.650> had<00:03:40.830> no

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
unconstrained motion so we had no

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.460 
unconstrained motion so we had no
support<00:03:41.790> on<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.120> end<00:03:42.240> but<00:03:42.960> when<00:03:43.080> you<00:03:43.200> hold<00:03:43.320> a

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
support on the end but when you hold a

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.560 
support on the end but when you hold a
tuning<00:03:43.710> fork<00:03:43.920> you're<00:03:44.670> adding<00:03:44.970> constraints

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
tuning fork you're adding constraints

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.080 
tuning fork you're adding constraints
and<00:03:45.750> adding<00:03:46.320> structure<00:03:46.650> which<00:03:47.340> has<00:03:47.550> material

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
and adding structure which has material

simulation<00:05:36.680> as<00:05:37.680> you<00:05:37.890> can<00:05:38.010> see<00:05:38.160> with<00:05:38.310> this<00:05:38.430> mode

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
simulation as you can see with this mode

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.430 
simulation as you can see with this mode
there<00:05:39.060> is<00:05:39.180> a<00:05:39.210> slight<00:05:39.600> amount<00:05:39.810> of<00:05:39.960> motion<00:05:40.290> of

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
there is a slight amount of motion of

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.950 
there is a slight amount of motion of
the<00:05:40.710> base<00:05:41.120> due<00:05:42.120> to<00:05:42.330> the<00:05:42.450> motion<00:05:42.780> of<00:05:42.870> these

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
the base due to the motion of these

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.270 
the base due to the motion of these
tines<00:05:44.690> so<00:05:45.690> there<00:05:46.200> would<00:05:46.350> be<00:05:46.380> some<00:05:46.500> damping<00:05:47.100> in

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
tines so there would be some damping in

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.340 
tines so there would be some damping in
our<00:05:47.490> fingers<00:05:47.880> holding<00:05:48.570> the<00:05:48.690> support<00:05:49.050> this<00:05:49.229> is

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
our fingers holding the support this is

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:50.840 
our fingers holding the support this is
not<00:05:49.500> a<00:05:49.530> totally<00:05:50.010> balanced<00:05:50.370> mode

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
not a totally balanced mode

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.580 
not a totally balanced mode
so<00:05:51.750> you<00:05:51.840> would<00:05:51.960> expect<00:05:52.050> this<00:05:52.380> higher

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
so you would expect this higher

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.650 
so you would expect this higher
frequency<00:05:53.070> sound<00:05:53.340> to<00:05:53.580> dampen<00:05:53.940> out<00:05:54.030> faster<00:05:54.540> and

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
frequency sound to dampen out faster and

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.870 
frequency sound to dampen out faster and
that<00:05:55.260> is<00:05:55.380> the<00:05:55.500> case<00:05:55.650> when<00:05:55.980> you<00:05:56.160> listen<00:05:56.700> to<00:05:56.730> the

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
that is the case when you listen to the

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.700 
that is the case when you listen to the
fork<00:05:57.120> you<00:05:57.540> hear<00:05:57.690> the<00:05:57.810> higher<00:05:57.960> pitch<00:05:58.230> dampen

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
fork you hear the higher pitch dampen

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.520 
fork you hear the higher pitch dampen
out<00:05:58.830> faster
