00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.559
 very effective in strengthening hair in 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.750

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.390
 satisfied in general she is preparing on the basis 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.570
 Here is a manure that I advance 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.130
 prepared in advance because you need it 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.809
 boiling water 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.440
 and so i will use further 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:41.790
 egg and don't want it boiled 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.370
 so I made this basis in advance 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.239

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.100

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.930

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.320
 that it will strengthen the hair gives them shine 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:10.020
 elasticity effectively eliminates 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.470
 peeling us softens hair creates 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.470
 luxurious volume and much more and 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.020
 most importantly they give shade to hair 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.560
 some dark red and still 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.009

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.659
 twice and I have one more left 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.450

 hair gives them elasticity and 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.220
 elasticity prevents dryness

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:54.730
 yolk apa so 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.330
 a little bit of olive oil 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:02.890
 again 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:04.330

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.480

 my hair doesn't like it dries from it 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.690
 so my favorite oil is 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.640
 olive 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:17.199
 Well, if there's something in my arsenal 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:23.310
 almond or peach a.p. it is generally 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:29.200
 just for the happiness of all we mix the mask 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:31.750
 Well, of course not metal so here we are 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.690
 and interfere to homogeneous 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:38.110
 consistency here it is with us in the end 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:41.590
 it should work out then I put this 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.810
 Mask on clean hair rubbing into the roots then 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.789
 there is actively actively working on their 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.389
 roots also this mask exactly 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:51.910
 firming in on the length of my hair I'm this 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:54.760
 sea, but how is it? 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.840
 because for the main hair length I 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.270
 I'll just put it 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.930
 olive oil especially at my tips 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.240
 hair 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:05.500

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.010
 she said leave on your hair clean on 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.710
 the roots 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:17.889
 the whole thing is a hat that's such a hat 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:19.720
 and of course some more 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:22.139
 I do not know whether the team probably towel 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.430
 I will wear a hat and I will walk for minutes 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:28.150
 twenty to thirty in general so much 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.700
 How much time do I have in general? 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.740
 and all then wash off with water and it turns out 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.599
 really wonderful effect 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.310

 madly in love with these components all 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.050
 very simple fast simple but 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:46.680
 works very well 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.680
