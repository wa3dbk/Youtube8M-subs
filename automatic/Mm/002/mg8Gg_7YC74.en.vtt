00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.649
 we will need a filling or donut that 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:09.809
 You can buy in drugstores or in stores 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:09.809
 hairdressing clip forks 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.910
 bow pins and a rubber band 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.670
 Start by brushing your hair 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.060
 and then with a comb do the 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.570
 partition of the bangs 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.019
 make a line to the side that you 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.019
 you prefer 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.950
 and another diagonal line in the sense 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.080
 contrary 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.930
 if you have short bangs, so 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.090
 you can carry forward or if 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.980
 you prefer you can collect all your hair 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.320
 backwards 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.970
 I have put a fork to hold the 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.750
 bangs and do not disturb while 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.750
 we make the bun 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.550
 you see brushing all the hair up 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.670
 and taking it to make a ponytail 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.670
 high 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.820
 help yourself with lacquer and a brush so that 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.270
 the sides and the back part fit 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.270
 polished 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.800
 Take your time in this step and once 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.960
 you have it 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.960
 Make the ponytail that is well caught 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:07.500
 take the filling and insert the pigtail 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.500
 as if it were a rubber band 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.090
 Then you open the tufts 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:21.290
 and surrounding the filling that is left 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.290
 totally covered 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.350
 when this begins to roll up the hair 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.550
 about yourself 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.550
 around the filling 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.689
 exposing clip forks all 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.689
 around at the base of the bun 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.319
 when it is well attached I start to put 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.879
 the bow hairpins also all 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.420
 around to prevent them from loosening 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.420
 tufts 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.540
 uses a strong lacquer to fix it 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:52.670
 also put the flesh the fringe for 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.670
 help it stay fixed and not move 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.550
 and toss it aside 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.060
 and hold it from behind with two forks 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.060
 clip 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.920
 uses the lacquer and the brush so that 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.750
 the sides and the back part fit 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.750
 polished and there are no loose hairs 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:32.540
 now choose a handkerchief that goes to 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:35.630
 combine with your clothes fold what is placed 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.860
 in front of the bow and pass it doing 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.860
 a knot in the back 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.900
 they pass the ends forward and 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.720
 knot it in the front part so 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.370
 that there is a little oil left if you 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.090
