high<00:01:21.760> performance<00:01:22.480> unit<00:01:22.980> we<00:01:23.980> sold<00:01:24.310> quite<00:01:24.820> a

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
high performance unit we sold quite a

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.300 
high performance unit we sold quite a
few<00:01:25.030> in<00:01:25.960> the<00:01:26.170> industry<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:26.710> last<00:01:26.950> four<00:01:27.220> or
