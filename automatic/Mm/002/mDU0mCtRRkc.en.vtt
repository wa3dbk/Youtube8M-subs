all<00:00:01.110> right<00:00:01.290> here's<00:00:01.589> a<00:00:02.060> picture<00:00:03.170> what<00:00:04.170> it's

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
all right here's a picture what it's

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:14.650 
all right here's a picture what it's
supposed<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.650> look<00:00:04.770> like<00:00:11.450> 90-degree<00:00:12.450> angles

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
supposed to look like 90-degree angles

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.400 
supposed to look like 90-degree angles
those<00:00:15.660> are<00:00:15.900> pi<00:00:16.080> stairs<00:00:17.690> Eric<00:00:18.690> knows<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.199> woods

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
those are pi stairs Eric knows the woods

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.210 
those are pi stairs Eric knows the woods
the<00:00:19.859> same<00:00:20.539> width<00:00:21.539> from<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.170> carpet<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.830> the

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
the same width from the carpet to the

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.330 
the same width from the carpet to the
wall<00:00:24.470> and<00:00:25.470> just<00:00:26.539> prime<00:00:27.539> stairs<00:00:28.039> that's<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.160> nice

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
wall and just prime stairs that's a nice

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:37.000 
wall and just prime stairs that's a nice
example<00:00:30.260> see<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.380> corner<00:00:33.860> is<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.920> nice<00:00:35.219> example

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
example see the corner is a nice example

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.740 
example see the corner is a nice example
PI<00:00:38.010> space<00:00:38.430> now<00:00:39.559> here's<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.829> job<00:00:41.540> that<00:00:42.540> these

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
PI space now here's the job that these

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:50.840 
PI space now here's the job that these
guys<00:00:43.050> did<00:00:49.160> don't<00:00:50.160> think<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.399> matches<00:00:50.579> up

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
guys did don't think it matches up

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.299 
guys did don't think it matches up
either<00:00:51.809> side<00:00:53.390> or<00:00:54.390> back<00:00:54.660> there

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
either side or back there

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.080 
either side or back there
or<00:00:56.309> over<00:00:56.699> here<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.559> mean<00:00:58.640> what<00:00:59.640> he<00:00:59.730> measured<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
or over here I mean what he measured the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.580 
or over here I mean what he measured the
equal<00:01:00.600> amount<00:01:00.780> from<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:01.140> side<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.530> side

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
equal amount from this side to this side

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.020 
equal amount from this side to this side
but<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.160> went<00:01:02.340> straight<00:01:02.910> back<00:01:04.760> here's<00:01:05.760> my

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
but you went straight back here's my

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.210 
but you went straight back here's my
90-degree<00:01:06.689> going<00:01:06.960> angle<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.710> guy<00:01:07.920> doesn't

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
90-degree going angle this guy doesn't

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.710 
90-degree going angle this guy doesn't
know<00:01:09.590> how<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.619> lay<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> carpet<00:01:11.540> and<00:01:12.540> when<00:01:12.630> how

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
know how to lay a carpet and when how

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.060 
know how to lay a carpet and when how
much<00:01:12.810> he<00:01:13.049> shouts<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.860> he<00:01:13.920> does<00:01:19.070> totally

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
much he shouts that he does totally

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.870 
much he shouts that he does totally
different<00:01:21.320> piecemeal<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:23.220> one's<00:01:23.490> over<00:01:23.610> that

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
different piecemeal this one's over that

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.170 
different piecemeal this one's over that
way<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.299> one's<00:01:24.479> without<00:01:25.909> then<00:01:26.909> over<00:01:27.150> here

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
way that one's without then over here

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.880 
way that one's without then over here
where<00:01:27.630> there's<00:01:27.780> no<00:01:27.900> border<00:01:28.259> it'd<00:01:28.350> all<00:01:28.470> be<00:01:28.710> so

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
where there's no border it'd all be so

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.910 
where there's no border it'd all be so
easy<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.220> do<00:01:29.869> it<00:01:30.869> could<00:01:31.049> even<00:01:31.170> manage<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.710> here

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
easy to do it could even manage it here

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.899 
easy to do it could even manage it here
without<00:01:32.040> even<00:01:32.400> have<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.579> worry<00:01:32.729> about<00:01:32.820> a

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
without even have to worry about a

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:40.660 
without even have to worry about a
border<00:01:35.479> he's<00:01:36.479> never<00:01:36.659> seen<00:01:37.079> any<00:01:37.320> work<00:01:39.590> good

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
border he's never seen any work good

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.740 
border he's never seen any work good
running<00:01:41.670> over<00:01:41.880> here

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.819 

and<00:01:45.750> then<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.590> come<00:01:46.770> down<00:01:48.469> it's<00:01:49.469> not<00:01:49.619> even

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
and then you come down it's not even

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.359 
and then you come down it's not even
even<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:51.060> you'd<00:01:51.960> think<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.320> would<00:01:52.469> be<00:01:52.619> it's

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
even a and you'd think it would be it's

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.899 
even a and you'd think it would be it's
short<00:01:56.960> all<00:01:57.960> right

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
short all right

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:08.410 
short all right
that's<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.590> style<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:02.240> poor<00:02:03.240> craftsmanship

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.629 

it's<00:02:09.420> weird
