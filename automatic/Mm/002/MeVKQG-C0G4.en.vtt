 2.0 system before extension of our 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.690
 interchange engelmann system and the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.850
 Two things can be singled out that 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.430
 It has been extended for more 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.800
 Cameras can not only use cameras 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.050
 the in ims mount on the camera side 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:33.570
 but also have more cameras like that 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.920
 alexa the red epic and sony 555 cameras 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.750
 the other one 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.090
 one had to be able to sing out of it is 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.710
 canon i found with a dazzle 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.140
 Control you a lot 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.510
 photo lenses canon lenses with 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.090
 electronic iris available for 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.920
 for example the sony of the five camera or 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.699
 if you want on the alexa or the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.129
 red epic here a composition with the canon 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.969
 ef mount and small box here is the 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.859
 control 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.379
 she will be using cables with the farmer for 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.449
 Customer 's power supply is also in 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.600
 the little box in there and I can 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.040
 here now understand the blind in the 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.450
 small boxes are also several 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.400
 functions with built-in 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.110
 You can then if you blind his 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.119
 has found settings to focus on 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.070
 continue to open aperture 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.810
 you have the possibility to dazzle 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.460
 to program ramp 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.119
 We have set it here before 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.610
 the first aperture would now be 1.4, for example 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.030
 yes set 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.680
 and then it should drive to the aperture 4.5 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.200
 then i can still do the timing 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.350
 program and then I have the here 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.770
 active button then he drives the aperture 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.979
 and I can do it wirelessly 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.870
 I can control the second unit 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.320
 so that from a long distance to 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.580
 150 meters also change the aperture 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.600
 device still has a connection for 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.670
 power supplies but also for software 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.560
 Extension or handle and the red 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.380
 Hebel is perhaps we noticed 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.900

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.270
 mound worked with that the objective 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.820
 really tight and safe sitting in the tree 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.400
 So it's not easy with us 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.700
 a clamping mechanism with built-in 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.980
