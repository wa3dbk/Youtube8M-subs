00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
never you know 40 or whatever but uh

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.740 
never you know 40 or whatever but uh
hopefully<00:03:41.640> it<00:03:42.209> won't<00:03:42.420> be<00:03:43.280> no<00:03:44.280> too<00:03:45.209> much<00:03:45.420> on

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
hopefully it won't be no too much on

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.660 
hopefully it won't be no too much on
them<00:03:46.019> or<00:03:46.170> whatever<00:03:46.350> I<00:03:46.560> think<00:03:46.829> he<00:03:46.980> still<00:03:47.220> can

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
them or whatever I think he still can

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.670 
them or whatever I think he still can
put<00:03:47.880> on<00:03:47.970> a<00:03:48.000> good<00:03:48.209> performance<00:03:48.269> and<00:03:48.959> I<00:03:49.380> really

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
put on a good performance and I really

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.150 
put on a good performance and I really
think<00:03:49.890> that<00:03:50.250> he<00:03:51.090> has<00:03:51.480> a<00:03:51.510> chance<00:03:51.989> to<00:03:52.140> get<00:03:53.040> an

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
think that he has a chance to get an

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.140 
think that he has a chance to get an
upset<00:03:53.959> you<00:03:54.959> know<00:03:55.140> but<00:03:55.920> I<00:03:55.950> still<00:03:56.130> lean<00:03:56.700> towards

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150
