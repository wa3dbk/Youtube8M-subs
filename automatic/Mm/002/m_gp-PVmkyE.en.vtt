kind<00:00:13.840> of<00:00:13.929> sits<00:00:14.170> like<00:00:14.349> this<00:00:14.650> and<00:00:15.130> that<00:00:15.610> you<00:00:15.730> can

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:15.880 
kind of sits like this and that you can

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.060 
kind of sits like this and that you can
see<00:00:16.059> I've<00:00:16.179> got<00:00:16.329> the<00:00:16.509> lid<00:00:16.720> flipped<00:00:16.989> up<00:00:17.349> the<00:00:17.829> lid

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
see I've got the lid flipped up the lid

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.239 
see I've got the lid flipped up the lid
has<00:00:18.249> on<00:00:18.489> it<00:00:18.609> the<00:00:18.900> DC<00:00:19.900> to<00:00:19.960> DC<00:00:20.109> converter<00:00:20.679> and<00:00:21.039> the

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:21.249 
has on it the DC to DC converter and the

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:23.819 
has on it the DC to DC converter and the
throttle<00:00:21.759> and<00:00:21.970> the<00:00:22.630> AC<00:00:22.839> compressor<00:00:23.319> sitting

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:23.829 
throttle and the AC compressor sitting

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:25.189

up<00:00:23.919> here<00:00:24.069> waiting<00:00:24.399> for<00:00:24.550> me<00:00:24.640> to<00:00:24.730> finish<00:00:24.909> this

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
up here waiting for me to finish this

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.499 
up here waiting for me to finish this
but<00:00:26.199> right<00:00:26.649> now<00:00:26.829> I've<00:00:27.039> got<00:00:27.310> it<00:00:27.339> charging<00:00:28.029> and

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:28.509 
but right now I've got it charging and

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.829 
but right now I've got it charging and
you<00:00:28.630> can<00:00:28.810> see<00:00:29.019> I've<00:00:29.229> got<00:00:29.470> two<00:00:29.949> legs<00:00:30.659> coming<00:00:31.659> in

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:31.839 
you can see I've got two legs coming in

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:34.410 
you can see I've got two legs coming in
okay<00:00:32.710> one<00:00:33.010> leg<00:00:33.250> goes<00:00:33.520> through<00:00:33.760> this<00:00:33.910> bank<00:00:34.240> of

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
okay one leg goes through this bank of

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.180 
okay one leg goes through this bank of
capacitors<00:00:34.630> here<00:00:35.790> okay<00:00:36.790> so<00:00:36.820> that's<00:00:37.240> AC<00:00:38.190> one

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
capacitors here okay so that's AC one

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.820 
capacitors here okay so that's AC one
leg<00:00:39.460> 120<00:00:40.120> coming<00:00:40.450> in<00:00:40.600> okay<00:00:41.080> goes<00:00:41.290> around<00:00:41.500> here

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 
leg 120 coming in okay goes around here

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.620 
leg 120 coming in okay goes around here
loops<00:00:42.610> down<00:00:42.820> goes<00:00:43.060> down<00:00:43.240> to<00:00:43.330> the<00:00:43.420> bridge

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:43.630 
loops down goes down to the bridge

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.260 
loops down goes down to the bridge
rectifiers<00:00:44.230> down<00:00:44.500> there<00:00:44.730> second<00:00:45.730> leg<00:00:45.850> is<00:00:46.030> over

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
rectifiers down there second leg is over

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.400 
rectifiers down there second leg is over
here<00:00:46.540> comes<00:00:47.140> in<00:00:47.380> with<00:00:47.620> 120<00:00:48.370> volts<00:00:49.210> AC<00:00:49.410> goes

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
here comes in with 120 volts AC goes

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.100 
here comes in with 120 volts AC goes
around<00:00:50.650> this<00:00:50.980> bank<00:00:51.310> of<00:00:51.550> capacitors<00:00:51.840> then<00:00:52.840> goes

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
around this bank of capacitors then goes

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.390 
around this bank of capacitors then goes
to<00:00:53.470> the<00:00:53.829> DC<00:00:54.900> bridge<00:00:55.900> rectifier<00:00:56.440> down<00:00:56.680> there<00:00:56.860> so

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
to the DC bridge rectifier down there so

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.040 
to the DC bridge rectifier down there so
we<00:00:57.490> have<00:00:57.579> two<00:00:57.790> rectifiers<00:00:58.390> then<00:00:58.600> coming<00:00:58.960> up

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
we have two rectifiers then coming up

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.510 
we have two rectifiers then coming up
together<00:01:00.120> into<00:01:01.120> these<00:01:01.329> I<00:01:01.950> have<00:01:02.950> to<00:01:03.100> lean<00:01:03.340> over

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
together into these I have to lean over

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.999 
together into these I have to lean over
here<00:01:03.910> if<00:01:04.000> you<00:01:04.030> can<00:01:04.119> see<00:01:04.239> them<00:01:04.509> the<00:01:04.629> two

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
here if you can see them the two

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:06.920 
here if you can see them the two
terminals<00:01:06.009> down<00:01:06.340> in<00:01:06.490> there

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
terminals down in there

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.710 
terminals down in there
know<00:01:07.050> if<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.200> can<00:01:07.410> see<00:01:07.590> them<00:01:07.710> all<00:01:08.700> right<00:01:08.910> now

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
know if you can see them all right now

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.640 
know if you can see them all right now
the<00:01:10.290> charge<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:11.190> coming<00:01:11.790> from<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:14.810> Jay<00:01:15.810> Jay

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
the charge is coming from the Jay Jay

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.350 
the charge is coming from the Jay Jay
1772<00:01:17.490> Inlet<00:01:18.060> which<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.420> right<00:01:18.630> here

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
1772 Inlet which is right here

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.420 
1772 Inlet which is right here
what<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.479> can<00:01:21.660> see<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.560> plugged<00:01:23.010> into<00:01:23.220> the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
what you can see is plugged into the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.290 
what you can see is plugged into the
back<00:01:24.440> which<00:01:25.440> goes<00:01:25.650> up<00:01:25.830> into<00:01:26.010> the<00:01:26.220> box<00:01:26.790> up<00:01:27.090> there

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
back which goes up into the box up there

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.660 
back which goes up into the box up there
on<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.570> wall<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:28.110> got<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.979> cover<00:01:29.190> off<00:01:29.430> because

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
on the wall I got the cover off because

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.219 
on the wall I got the cover off because
I<00:01:29.910> was<00:01:30.060> doing<00:01:30.300> something<00:01:30.510> with<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.810> just

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
I was doing something with it just

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.640 
I was doing something with it just
testing<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.790> okay<00:01:32.790> now<00:01:33.260> this<00:01:34.260> is<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
testing it okay now this is the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.050 
testing it okay now this is the
batteries<00:01:35.180> case<00:01:36.180> back<00:01:36.510> here<00:01:36.810> there's<00:01:38.060> 35

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
batteries case back here there's 35

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.639 
batteries case back here there's 35
batteries<00:01:39.720> underneath<00:01:40.229> this<00:01:41.570> so<00:01:42.570> there's<00:01:42.930> 35

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
batteries underneath this so there's 35

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.020 
batteries underneath this so there's 35
cells<00:01:44.100> there<00:01:44.550> and<00:01:45.030> then<00:01:45.950> totals<00:01:46.950> up<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.100> all<00:01:47.340> 58

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
cells there and then totals up to all 58

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.749 
cells there and then totals up to all 58
totals<00:01:48.770> up<00:01:49.770> here<00:01:50.310> underneath<00:01:51.800> this<00:01:52.800> box<00:01:53.160> and

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
totals up here underneath this box and

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.930 
totals up here underneath this box and
the<00:01:53.940> cells<00:01:54.320> kind<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.500> look<00:01:55.619> like<00:01:55.649> this<00:01:56.520> right

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
the cells kind of look like this right

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.830 
the cells kind of look like this right
in<00:01:57.450> here

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
in here

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.180 
in here
which<00:01:59.840> you<00:01:59.960> can't<00:02:00.230> really<00:02:00.380> see<00:02:00.710> but<00:02:00.950> they're

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
which you can't really see but they're

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.870 
which you can't really see but they're
basically<00:02:01.940> 100<00:02:02.510> amp<00:02:02.630> by<00:02:02.780> ourselves<00:02:03.190> if<00:02:04.190> I<00:02:04.520> lift

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
basically 100 amp by ourselves if I lift

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.750 
basically 100 amp by ourselves if I lift
this<00:02:05.060> up

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
this up

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.250 
this up
you<00:02:07.060> may<00:02:07.180> be<00:02:07.240> able<00:02:07.510> to<00:02:07.600> see<00:02:07.780> him<00:02:07.870> there<00:02:08.020> for<00:02:08.050> a

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.260 
you may be able to see him there for a

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.080 
you may be able to see him there for a
second<00:02:08.590> but<00:02:08.770> yeah<00:02:09.369> it's<00:02:09.490> dark<00:02:09.729> under<00:02:09.970> there

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
second but yeah it's dark under there

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.040 
second but yeah it's dark under there
not<00:02:10.300> gonna<00:02:10.390> be<00:02:10.540> okay

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
not gonna be okay

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:18.960 
not gonna be okay
anyway<00:02:11.350> so<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:16.840> can<00:02:17.020> see<00:02:17.230> down<00:02:17.440> here<00:02:17.970> this

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
anyway so you can see down here this

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.540 
anyway so you can see down here this
isn't<00:02:19.330> really<00:02:19.510> gonna<00:02:20.470> show<00:02:20.830> up<00:02:20.980> very<00:02:21.220> well<00:02:21.280> is

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
isn't really gonna show up very well is

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:28.830 
isn't really gonna show up very well is
it<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:26.620> don't<00:02:26.770> really<00:02:26.890> see<00:02:27.220> this<00:02:27.430> its<00:02:28.330> glaring

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
it you don't really see this its glaring

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.200 
it you don't really see this its glaring
too<00:02:29.170> much<00:02:29.370> anyway<00:02:30.370> so<00:02:30.430> everything's<00:02:30.910> sitting

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
too much anyway so everything's sitting

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.920 
too much anyway so everything's sitting
in<00:02:31.270> about<00:02:31.380> 3.3<00:02:32.380> volts<00:02:32.740> per<00:02:32.980> cell<00:02:33.250> okay<00:02:34.120> with

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
in about 3.3 volts per cell okay with

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.040 
in about 3.3 volts per cell okay with
the<00:02:35.050> BMS<00:02:35.470> so<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.710> BMS<00:02:36.130> is<00:02:36.160> showing<00:02:36.690> 3.3<00:02:37.690> volts

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
the BMS so the BMS is showing 3.3 volts

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.050 
the BMS so the BMS is showing 3.3 volts
per<00:02:38.290> cell<00:02:38.590> and<00:02:39.780> we're<00:02:40.780> trying<00:02:41.110> to<00:02:41.170> get<00:02:41.290> it<00:02:41.380> up

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
per cell and we're trying to get it up

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:49.440 
per cell and we're trying to get it up
as<00:02:43.060> high<00:02:43.390> as<00:02:46.080> 3<00:02:47.080> point<00:02:47.950> 6<00:02:48.280> volts<00:02:48.370> per<00:02:48.850> cell<00:02:49.150> if

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
as high as 3 point 6 volts per cell if

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.940 
as high as 3 point 6 volts per cell if
that's<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.840> charge<00:02:50.110> voltage<00:02:50.590> so<00:02:50.830> we're

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
that's the charge voltage so we're

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.040 
that's the charge voltage so we're
trying<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.280> do<00:02:51.400> that<00:02:51.580> and<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.570> other<00:02:52.690> thing<00:02:52.960> I

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
trying to do that and the other thing I

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.900 
trying to do that and the other thing I
was<00:02:53.110> going<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.380> do<00:02:53.500> here<00:02:53.830> is<00:02:54.100> I'll<00:02:54.490> put<00:02:54.670> on<00:02:54.730> the

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
was going to do here is I'll put on the

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.030 
was going to do here is I'll put on the
clip<00:02:55.150> on<00:02:55.390> here

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.600 

here<00:03:00.040> I<00:03:00.280> don't<00:03:00.640> know<00:03:00.760> if<00:03:00.790> you<00:03:00.940> can<00:03:01.060> see<00:03:01.300> it<00:03:02.610> four

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
here I don't know if you can see it four

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:14.550 
here I don't know if you can see it four
point<00:03:03.910> five<00:03:05.069> amps<00:03:06.069> coming<00:03:06.370> in<00:03:09.810> alright<00:03:13.560> and

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
point five amps coming in alright and

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.860 
point five amps coming in alright and
this<00:03:14.739> is<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.069> back<00:03:15.280> of<00:03:15.489> the

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
this is the back of the

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:24.260 
this is the back of the
of<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.500> Jeep<00:03:19.860> so<00:03:20.860> it's<00:03:21.430> charging

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.000 

and<00:03:24.360> it's<00:03:24.930> got<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.550> batteries<00:03:26.550> in<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.820> back
