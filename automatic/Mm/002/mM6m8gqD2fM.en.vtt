00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
but it's a little more challenging to be

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.769 
but it's a little more challenging to be
able<00:00:03.419> to<00:00:03.750> be<00:00:04.170> aware<00:00:04.440> of<00:00:04.500> what<00:00:05.130> notes<00:00:06.060> are<00:00:06.480> in

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
able to be aware of what notes are in

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.839 
able to be aware of what notes are in
the<00:00:06.930> cord<00:00:07.259> at<00:00:07.620> that<00:00:07.830> measure<00:00:08.250> in<00:00:08.700> that

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
the cord at that measure in that

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.470 
the cord at that measure in that
particular<00:00:09.179> moment<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.990> time<00:00:10.550> so<00:00:11.550> what<00:00:12.360> I'd

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
particular moment of time so what I'd

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.220 
particular moment of time so what I'd
like<00:00:12.509> you<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.929> start<00:00:13.290> doing<00:00:13.799> is<00:00:14.900> working<00:00:15.900> on

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
like you to start doing is working on

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.550 
like you to start doing is working on
each<00:00:16.830> chord<00:00:19.189> try<00:00:20.189> doing<00:00:20.400> arpeggios<00:00:21.380> so<00:00:22.380> that

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
each chord try doing arpeggios so that

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.980 
each chord try doing arpeggios so that
you<00:00:22.740> only<00:00:22.949> are<00:00:23.310> selecting<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.119> notes<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.689> C

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
you only are selecting the notes of C

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.590 
you only are selecting the notes of C
minor

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:28.600 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.070 

so<00:00:29.290> you<00:00:29.350> can<00:00:29.560> do<00:00:29.740> them<00:00:29.890> in<00:00:30.100> my<00:00:31.090> fashion<00:00:31.570> where

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.080 
so you can do them in my fashion where

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.880 
so you can do them in my fashion where
you<00:00:33.780> mean<00:00:34.780> like<00:00:34.960> if<00:00:35.110> you<00:00:35.230> can<00:00:35.380> just<00:00:35.410> get<00:00:35.740> your

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
you mean like if you can just get your

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.500 
you mean like if you can just get your
thumb<00:00:36.130> under<00:00:36.520> you<00:00:36.730> could<00:00:37.030> repeat<00:00:37.360> that

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
thumb under you could repeat that

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.600 
thumb under you could repeat that
pattern<00:00:37.780> again

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.550 

should<00:00:43.060> be<00:00:43.210> a<00:00:43.240> good<00:00:43.450> exercise<00:00:43.750> to<00:00:44.170> get<00:00:44.320> you<00:00:44.440> to

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:44.560 
should be a good exercise to get you to

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.280 
should be a good exercise to get you to
know

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.390 

you<00:00:47.500> could<00:00:47.650> also<00:00:47.830> change<00:00:48.250> the<00:00:48.430> oil

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
you could also change the oil

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.720 
you could also change the oil
do<00:00:51.180> like<00:00:51.480> every<00:00:51.720> other<00:00:51.870> no

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:03.200 

or<00:00:56.730> just<00:00:57.269> fellow<00:01:01.190> for<00:01:02.190> any<00:01:02.579> note<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.120> you

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
or just fellow for any note that you

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.720 
or just fellow for any note that you
want<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.479> play

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:06.730 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.090 

and<00:01:07.300> then<00:01:07.510> you<00:01:07.630> link<00:01:07.900> up<00:01:08.050> those<00:01:08.290> noes<00:01:08.590> to<00:01:08.620> see

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
and then you link up those noes to see

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.250 
and then you link up those noes to see
my<00:01:09.310> seven

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.770 

Oh

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.920 

so<00:01:24.649> let's<00:01:24.950> try<00:01:25.159> the<00:01:25.220> f7

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.580 

etios

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.210 

you<00:01:34.590> could<00:01:34.740> also<00:01:34.890> try<00:01:35.100> patterns<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:37.220> say

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
you could also try patterns of the say

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.240 
you could also try patterns of the say
we<00:01:38.370> do<00:01:38.580> triplets<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.240> could<00:01:39.420> try<00:01:39.980> us<00:01:40.980> three

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
we do triplets you could try us three

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.590 
we do triplets you could try us three
notes

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:55.290 

the<00:01:44.930> next<00:01:45.229> three<00:01:45.439> notes<00:01:46.150> so<00:01:47.150> we're<00:01:47.270> going

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.530

let me go a little slower here i'm
taking<00:02:01.159> the<00:02:01.280> f7

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
taking the f7

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.880

and I'm going up one and i'm taking the

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.010 
and I'm going up one and i'm taking the
inversion<00:02:07.400> of<00:02:07.490> the<00:02:07.550> car

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
inversion of the car

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.950 
inversion of the car
is<00:02:09.380> doing<00:02:09.800> inversions<00:02:10.630> playing<00:02:11.630> this

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
is doing inversions playing this

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.559 
is doing inversions playing this
individual<00:02:12.530> knows

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.720 

Oh

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.430 

excuse<00:02:23.730> me<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:23.910> facility<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.569> know<00:02:24.870> those<00:02:25.080> four

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
excuse me a facility to know those four

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.000 
excuse me a facility to know those four
notes<00:02:25.740> in<00:02:25.920> any<00:02:26.220> combination<00:02:26.700> any<00:02:27.450> any

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
notes in any combination any any

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:37.000 
notes in any combination any any
position<00:02:29.010> that<00:02:29.280> my<00:02:29.430> hand<00:02:29.819> happens<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.390> be<00:02:30.540> in

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.490 

so<00:02:38.010> we're<00:02:38.430> not<00:02:38.760> only<00:02:38.819> knowing<00:02:39.450> now<00:02:39.660> by<00:02:40.110> doing

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
so we're not only knowing now by doing

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.559 
so we're not only knowing now by doing
this<00:02:40.530> with<00:02:40.830> all<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.190> chords<00:02:41.640> in<00:02:41.910> it<00:02:42.180> in<00:02:42.540> the

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
this with all the chords in it in the

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.140 
this with all the chords in it in the
tomb<00:02:43.069> we<00:02:44.069> know<00:02:44.280> this<00:02:44.430> field<00:02:46.640> and<00:02:47.640> then<00:02:47.790> we<00:02:47.970> know

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
tomb we know this field and then we know

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.780 
tomb we know this field and then we know
when<00:02:48.420> we're<00:02:48.600> on<00:02:48.630> t<00:02:48.989> minus<00:02:49.230> seven<00:02:49.590> that<00:02:50.130> reason

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
when we're on t minus seven that reason

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.710 
when we're on t minus seven that reason
we're<00:02:51.300> striving<00:02:51.840> for<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:53.150> that<00:02:54.150> we<00:02:54.330> can<00:02:54.510> link

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
we're striving for and that we can link

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:03.720 
we're striving for and that we can link
up<00:02:55.610> with<00:02:56.610> any<00:02:56.820> us

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.940 

we<00:03:04.730> even<00:03:04.880> have<00:03:05.210> every<00:03:05.900> note<00:03:06.080> on<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.410> piano<00:03:06.440> as

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
we even have every note on the piano as

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.000 
we even have every note on the piano as
a<00:03:06.980> possibility<00:03:07.550> as<00:03:08.300> long<00:03:08.570> as<00:03:08.780> we're<00:03:09.050> quickly

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
a possibility as long as we're quickly

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.180 
a possibility as long as we're quickly
passing<00:03:10.610> through<00:03:10.910> so<00:03:11.540> if<00:03:11.900> we<00:03:11.960> need<00:03:12.350> this<00:03:12.530> we're

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
passing through so if we need this we're

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.560 
passing through so if we need this we're
trying<00:03:13.430> to<00:03:13.520> get<00:03:13.610> to<00:03:13.790> this<00:03:13.940> note<00:03:14.210> we<00:03:14.420> can

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
trying to get to this note we can

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.170 
trying to get to this note we can
actually<00:03:14.750> go<00:03:15.670> there<00:03:16.670> will<00:03:16.820> come<00:03:16.970> at

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
actually go there will come at

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.690 
actually go there will come at
chromatically<00:03:17.900> chromatic<00:03:18.680> means<00:03:19.070> every<00:03:19.490> half

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
chromatically chromatic means every half

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.610 
chromatically chromatic means every half
step<00:03:21.160> okay<00:03:22.480> we<00:03:23.480> can<00:03:23.630> get<00:03:23.780> from<00:03:23.930> you<00:03:24.340> any<00:03:25.340> note

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
step okay we can get from you any note

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.230 
step okay we can get from you any note
any<00:03:27.620> notes<00:03:27.950> there<00:03:28.250> so<00:03:28.550> we<00:03:28.670> can<00:03:28.820> just<00:03:29.060> use<00:03:29.209> a

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240
