scheme<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.400> can<00:02:20.730> use<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.540> actually<00:02:21.690> see

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
scheme so you can use it to actually see

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.199 
scheme so you can use it to actually see
what<00:02:22.230> status<00:02:22.709> your<00:02:22.980> effects<00:02:23.490> are<00:02:23.640> on<00:02:23.760> as<00:02:24.030> well

it very easy for the user to know what's
going<00:02:30.720> on<00:02:30.810> within<00:02:30.990> their<00:02:31.200> rig<00:02:31.380> plus<00:02:31.860> a<00:02:31.890> really

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
going on within their rig plus a really

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.000 
going on within their rig plus a really
large<00:02:32.459> display<00:02:33.200> so<00:02:34.200> it's<00:02:34.349> easy<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.680> read<00:02:34.830> it's

large display so it's easy to read it's

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.250 
large display so it's easy to read it's
transflective<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.910> even<00:02:36.480> broad<00:02:36.660> daylight<00:02:36.870> it

transflective and even broad daylight it

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.890 
transflective and even broad daylight it
really<00:02:38.069> does<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.370> job<00:02:38.610> that<00:02:39.420> looks<00:02:39.599> great

really does the job that looks great

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.449 
really does the job that looks great
alright<00:02:40.230> so<00:02:40.349> let's<00:02:40.560> let's<00:02:40.980> hear<00:02:41.160> what<00:02:41.340> this

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
alright so let's let's hear what this

00:02:41.459 --> 00:03:15.160 
alright so let's let's hear what this
thing<00:02:41.520> can<00:02:41.730> do

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.300 

right<00:03:16.170> now<00:03:16.290> we've<00:03:16.440> chosen<00:03:16.740> to<00:03:16.890> have<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.100> first

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
right now we've chosen to have the first

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.940 
right now we've chosen to have the first
row<00:03:17.520> be<00:03:17.730> presets<00:03:18.240> and<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.690> second<00:03:19.140> two<00:03:19.740> rows

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
row be presets and the second two rows

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.890 
row be presets and the second two rows
and<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.459> top<00:03:20.640> two<00:03:20.850> buttons<00:03:21.150> on<00:03:21.270> the<00:03:21.300> last<00:03:21.630> row

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
and the top two buttons on the last row

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.050 
and the top two buttons on the last row
are<00:03:22.680> all<00:03:22.890> instant<00:03:23.280> access<00:03:23.400> switches<00:03:23.790> so<00:03:23.970> you

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
are all instant access switches so you

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.850 
are all instant access switches so you
can<00:03:24.209> see<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.600> different<00:03:25.020> effects<00:03:25.709> are

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
can see the different effects are

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
can see the different effects are
labeled<00:03:26.190> there<00:03:26.310> you've<00:03:26.490> got<00:03:26.640> you<00:03:26.790> know

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
labeled there you've got you know

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.810 
labeled there you've got you know
tremolo<00:03:27.300> delay<00:03:28.080> reverb<00:03:28.380> phaser<00:03:29.010> chorus<00:03:29.580> and

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
tremolo delay reverb phaser chorus and

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.220 
tremolo delay reverb phaser chorus and
those<00:03:29.940> are<00:03:30.090> instant<00:03:30.450> access<00:03:30.720> switches<00:03:30.930> and

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
those are instant access switches and

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.440 
those are instant access switches and
the<00:03:31.440> red<00:03:31.680> state<00:03:32.070> shows<00:03:32.400> you<00:03:32.580> that<00:03:32.730> there<00:03:33.030> is<00:03:33.209> an

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
the red state shows you that there is an

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.470 
the red state shows you that there is an
effect<00:03:33.750> present<00:03:34.170> under<00:03:34.560> that<00:03:34.680> switch<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.480> as

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
effect present under that switch and as

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.910 
effect present under that switch and as
we<00:03:36.690> click<00:03:36.900> them<00:03:37.080> on<00:03:37.230> which<00:03:37.380> we're<00:03:37.530> about<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.709> do

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
we click them on which we're about to do

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.460 
we click them on which we're about to do
you'll<00:03:38.430> see<00:03:38.490> that<00:03:38.850> it<00:03:39.239> turns<00:03:39.390> them<00:03:39.660> on<00:03:39.780> if

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
you'll see that it turns them on if

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.110 
you'll see that it turns them on if
there's<00:03:40.680> in<00:03:40.890> the<00:03:41.160> case<00:03:41.340> of<00:03:41.459> this<00:03:41.610> channel<00:03:41.850> here

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
there's in the case of this channel here

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.210 
there's in the case of this channel here
there's<00:03:42.420> uh<00:03:42.510> there's<00:03:43.500> no<00:03:43.620> there's<00:03:43.830> no<00:03:43.950> effect

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
there's uh there's no there's no effect

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.210 
there's uh there's no there's no effect
present<00:03:44.550> so<00:03:44.640> there's<00:03:44.790> no<00:03:44.910> light<00:03:45.090> on<00:03:46.010> so<00:03:47.010> let's

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
present so there's no light on so let's

00:03:47.220 --> 00:04:06.300 
present so there's no light on so let's
kick<00:03:47.670> in<00:03:47.850> a<00:03:47.940> little<00:03:48.120> delay<00:03:48.360> here

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:18.650 

at<00:04:07.310> fazer

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.780 

here's<00:04:19.260> an<00:04:19.350> example<00:04:19.590> of<00:04:19.950> the<00:04:20.130> clean<00:04:20.400> rag<00:04:20.579> and<00:04:20.609> I

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
here's an example of the clean rag and I

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.220 
here's an example of the clean rag and I
think<00:04:20.970> this<00:04:21.090> is<00:04:21.180> actually<00:04:21.329> the<00:04:21.540> new<00:04:21.720> Shiva

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
think this is actually the new Shiva

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:35.290 
think this is actually the new Shiva
clean

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.610 

it's<00:04:36.300> adding<00:04:36.690> a<00:04:36.840> little<00:04:37.050> bit<00:04:37.139> of<00:04:37.229> flanger

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
it's adding a little bit of flanger

00:04:37.620 --> 00:05:29.270 
it's adding a little bit of flanger
there

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.950 

one<00:05:30.280> of<00:05:30.370> the<00:05:30.430> unique<00:05:30.669> features<00:05:30.849> about<00:05:31.330> the<00:05:31.509> MFC

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
one of the unique features about the MFC

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.260 
one of the unique features about the MFC
101<00:05:32.440> is<00:05:32.710> that<00:05:33.039> when<00:05:33.610> you<00:05:33.729> change<00:05:33.759> from<00:05:34.180> one

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
101 is that when you change from one

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.969 
101 is that when you change from one
preset<00:05:34.720> to<00:05:34.810> another<00:05:35.050> it<00:05:35.289> will<00:05:35.410> rearrange<00:05:35.650> the

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
preset to another it will rearrange the

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:38.520 
preset to another it will rearrange the
entire<00:05:36.569> preset<00:05:37.569> structure<00:05:37.990> for<00:05:38.199> you<00:05:38.319> so<00:05:38.440> you

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
entire preset structure for you so you

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:39.960 
entire preset structure for you so you
can<00:05:38.620> see<00:05:38.800> what's<00:05:39.009> on<00:05:39.130> what's<00:05:39.460> off<00:05:39.639> and<00:05:39.849> let's

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
can see what's on what's off and let's

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.309 
can see what's on what's off and let's
go<00:05:40.000> down<00:05:40.180> and<00:05:40.300> actually<00:05:40.539> take<00:05:40.690> a<00:05:40.720> look<00:05:40.900> at<00:05:41.020> that

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:41.319 
go down and actually take a look at that

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:43.219 
go down and actually take a look at that
so<00:05:41.530> as<00:05:41.740> you<00:05:41.889> change<00:05:42.160> a<00:05:42.310> separate<00:05:42.639> preset

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
so as you change a separate preset

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:45.600 
so as you change a separate preset
you'll<00:05:44.229> see<00:05:44.470> that<00:05:44.650> it<00:05:44.830> will<00:05:45.250> change<00:05:45.430> the<00:05:45.580> whole

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
you'll see that it will change the whole

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.240 
you'll see that it will change the whole
status<00:05:46.330> of<00:05:46.479> the<00:05:46.569> rig<00:05:46.720> and<00:05:46.750> you<00:05:46.900> can<00:05:47.050> see<00:05:47.250> what's

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
status of the rig and you can see what's

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:55.469 
status of the rig and you can see what's
populated<00:05:48.909> what's<00:05:49.090> on<00:05:49.270> and<00:05:49.539> what<00:05:49.780> is<00:05:49.870> off<00:05:54.479> what

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 
populated what's on and what is off what

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:57.080 
populated what's on and what is off what
can<00:05:55.599> people<00:05:55.720> go<00:05:55.930> to<00:05:56.020> find<00:05:56.110> out<00:05:56.349> more<00:05:56.409> about

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
can people go to find out more about

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.059 
can people go to find out more about
both<00:05:58.090> these<00:05:58.270> products<00:05:58.810> well<00:05:59.500> you<00:05:59.650> need<00:05:59.860> to<00:05:59.979> go
