00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:04.840 

when<00:00:03.410> I<00:00:03.440> look<00:00:03.740> at<00:00:03.830> this<00:00:04.040> and<00:00:04.279> I<00:00:04.370> look<00:00:04.609> at<00:00:04.730> the

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:04.850 
when I look at this and I look at the

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.320 
when I look at this and I look at the
label<00:00:05.210> and<00:00:05.240> I<00:00:05.420> look<00:00:05.600> at<00:00:05.690> the<00:00:05.810> word<00:00:05.990> sugars<00:00:07.330> the

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.330 
label and I look at the word sugars the

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.180 
label and I look at the word sugars the
problem<00:00:08.960> with<00:00:09.080> the<00:00:09.200> labeling<00:00:09.650> system<00:00:10.040> right

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 
problem with the labeling system right

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.450 
problem with the labeling system right
now<00:00:10.250> is<00:00:10.670> we<00:00:10.879> cannot<00:00:11.330> tell<00:00:11.839> whether<00:00:12.650> or<00:00:12.799> not<00:00:13.070> the

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.460 
now is we cannot tell whether or not the

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.000 
now is we cannot tell whether or not the
word<00:00:13.669> sugars<00:00:14.240> on<00:00:14.509> there<00:00:14.780> is<00:00:14.990> added<00:00:15.650> sugar

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
word sugars on there is added sugar

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.410 
word sugars on there is added sugar
meaning<00:00:16.370> did<00:00:16.490> they<00:00:16.610> dump<00:00:16.820> a<00:00:16.910> bunch<00:00:17.060> of<00:00:17.180> white

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
meaning did they dump a bunch of white

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.780 
meaning did they dump a bunch of white
table<00:00:17.720> sugar<00:00:17.960> in<00:00:18.080> there<00:00:18.289> or<00:00:18.710> is<00:00:19.280> it<00:00:19.430> sugar<00:00:19.580> that

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:19.790 
table sugar in there or is it sugar that

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.870 
table sugar in there or is it sugar that
naturally<00:00:20.300> comes<00:00:20.540> in<00:00:20.690> the<00:00:20.780> product<00:00:21.170> like<00:00:21.320> milk

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
naturally comes in the product like milk

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.160 
naturally comes in the product like milk
so<00:00:22.880> I'm<00:00:22.940> going<00:00:23.090> to<00:00:23.120> give<00:00:23.240> you<00:00:23.360> an<00:00:23.540> example<00:00:23.870> of

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.370 
so I'm going to give you an example of
two<00:00:26.050> nutrition<00:00:27.050> labels<00:00:28.930> and<00:00:29.930> I<00:00:30.050> want<00:00:30.200> you<00:00:30.320> to

good good fiber okay and so are you if
you're<00:00:59.360> looking<00:00:59.660> at<00:00:59.780> fiber<00:01:00.079> are<00:01:00.440> you<00:01:00.530> thinking

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
you're looking at fiber are you thinking

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.389 
you're looking at fiber are you thinking
I<00:01:00.860> want<00:01:01.040> more<00:01:01.220> fiber<00:01:01.550> I<00:01:01.670> want<00:01:01.910> less<00:01:02.030> fiber<00:01:06.369> okay

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:07.399 
I want more fiber I want less fiber okay

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:09.669 
I want more fiber I want less fiber okay
so<00:01:07.729> here's<00:01:07.939> something<00:01:08.149> to<00:01:08.359> know<00:01:08.509> if<00:01:08.899> you<00:01:09.530> are

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:09.679 
so here's something to know if you are

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:11.260 
so here's something to know if you are
an<00:01:09.829> athlete<00:01:09.979> I<00:01:10.249> do<00:01:10.399> not<00:01:10.700> want<00:01:10.939> you<00:01:10.999> to<00:01:11.119> eat<00:01:11.240> a

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
an athlete I do not want you to eat a

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.730 
an athlete I do not want you to eat a
bunch<00:01:11.479> of<00:01:11.569> fiber<00:01:11.810> around<00:01:12.259> when<00:01:12.439> you're<00:01:12.590> about

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
bunch of fiber around when you're about

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.700 
bunch of fiber around when you're about
ready<00:01:12.889> to<00:01:13.039> compete<00:01:13.539> and<00:01:14.539> the<00:01:14.689> reason<00:01:15.049> why<00:01:15.229> is

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
ready to compete and the reason why is

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.279 
ready to compete and the reason why is
you<00:01:16.009> know<00:01:16.340> a<00:01:16.369> few<00:01:16.759> things<00:01:16.969> right<00:01:17.149> but<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:18.020> big

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
you know a few things right but the big

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:22.449 
you know a few things right but the big
thing<00:01:18.319> is<00:01:18.590> that<00:01:19.100> fiber<00:01:20.109> slows<00:01:21.109> down<00:01:21.770> digestion

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:22.459 
thing is that fiber slows down digestion

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:24.639 
thing is that fiber slows down digestion
time<00:01:22.880> which<00:01:23.659> is<00:01:23.780> really<00:01:24.049> good<00:01:24.200> if<00:01:24.319> we<00:01:24.409> want<00:01:24.590> to

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
time which is really good if we want to

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.249 
time which is really good if we want to
feel<00:01:24.889> full<00:01:25.479> but<00:01:26.479> when<00:01:26.600> we<00:01:26.689> want<00:01:26.840> to<00:01:26.959> get<00:01:27.079> food

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
feel full but when we want to get food

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.020 
feel full but when we want to get food
into<00:01:27.499> our<00:01:27.590> system<00:01:27.920> pretty<00:01:28.069> quickly<00:01:28.340> we<00:01:28.939> don't

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
into our system pretty quickly we don't

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.370 
into our system pretty quickly we don't
want<00:01:29.299> to<00:01:29.359> be<00:01:29.450> eating<00:01:29.689> a<00:01:29.749> bunch<00:01:29.899> of<00:01:29.990> fiber<00:01:30.170> I

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
want to be eating a bunch of fiber I

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.899 
want to be eating a bunch of fiber I
don't<00:01:30.560> want<00:01:30.770> you<00:01:30.920> to<00:01:30.979> eat<00:01:31.069> three<00:01:31.310> bran<00:01:31.520> muffins

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679 
system so to speak right so I want you

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:41.590 
system so to speak right so I want you
to<00:01:39.740> think<00:01:39.950> about<00:01:40.130> actually<00:01:40.340> I'm<00:01:40.759> keeping<00:01:41.509> the

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
to think about actually I'm keeping the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.319 
to think about actually I'm keeping the
fiber<00:01:42.289> at<00:01:42.499> bay<00:01:42.679> immediately<00:01:43.060> before<00:01:44.060> your

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
fiber at bay immediately before your

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:45.999 
fiber at bay immediately before your
performance<00:01:44.420> and<00:01:44.929> immediately<00:01:45.499> after<00:01:45.920> your

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
performance and immediately after your

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.440 
performance and immediately after your
performance<00:01:46.219> it<00:01:46.880> doesn't<00:01:47.149> mean<00:01:47.240> that<00:01:47.270> you

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
performance it doesn't mean that you

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.330 
performance it doesn't mean that you
can't<00:01:47.689> eat<00:01:47.869> brown<00:01:48.079> rice<00:01:48.289> but<00:01:48.920> it<00:01:49.009> just<00:01:49.130> means

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
can't eat brown rice but it just means

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.129 
can't eat brown rice but it just means
don't<00:01:49.639> go<00:01:49.759> crazy<00:01:49.999> that's<00:01:50.420> not<00:01:50.749> when<00:01:50.899> you<00:01:50.990> want

00:01:51.129 --> 00:01:51.139 
don't go crazy that's not when you want

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:52.449 
don't go crazy that's not when you want
to<00:01:51.170> take<00:01:51.319> like<00:01:51.469> your<00:01:51.590> fiber<00:01:51.799> supplement<00:01:52.369> or

00:01:52.449 --> 00:01:52.459 
to take like your fiber supplement or

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:54.309 
to take like your fiber supplement or
something<00:01:52.789> so<00:01:53.509> when<00:01:53.659> we're<00:01:53.810> comparing<00:01:54.139> these

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:54.319 
something so when we're comparing these

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:55.120 
something so when we're comparing these
two<00:01:54.619> labels

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
two labels

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.649 
two labels
I<00:01:55.189> love<00:01:55.399> how<00:01:55.579> everyone<00:01:56.179> kind<00:01:56.359> of<00:01:56.389> has<00:01:56.539> their

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
own thing that they look at I think one

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.309 
own thing that they look at I think one
of<00:01:58.909> the<00:01:59.090> good<00:01:59.329> things<00:01:59.569> to<00:01:59.779> look<00:01:59.869> at<00:02:00.049> that<00:02:00.200> we

of the good things to look at that we

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:01.510 
of the good things to look at that we
kind<00:02:00.560> of<00:02:00.619> forget<00:02:00.889> about<00:02:00.950> is<00:02:01.279> this<00:02:01.399> little

there
nothing<00:02:12.590> this<00:02:13.310> is<00:02:13.490> actually<00:02:13.880> a<00:02:13.910> banana<00:02:14.420> and

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
nothing this is actually a banana and

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.930 
nothing this is actually a banana and
this<00:02:15.800> one<00:02:16.010> is<00:02:16.130> actually<00:02:16.390> starbursts<00:02:18.790> but<00:02:19.790> it's

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
this one is actually starbursts but it's

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.520 
this one is actually starbursts but it's
interesting<00:02:20.300> how<00:02:20.600> if<00:02:20.870> we<00:02:20.930> don't<00:02:21.200> have<00:02:21.350> any

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
interesting how if we don't have any

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.410 
interesting how if we don't have any
more<00:02:21.710> information<00:02:22.400> when<00:02:22.880> we<00:02:23.000> look<00:02:23.180> at<00:02:23.300> the

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
more information when we look at the

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.440 
more information when we look at the
sugars<00:02:23.870> they<00:02:24.800> are<00:02:24.860> exactly<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.850> same<00:02:25.880> and

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
sugars they are exactly the same and

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.120 
sugars they are exactly the same and
everyone<00:02:27.260> would<00:02:27.380> agree<00:02:27.650> with<00:02:27.740> me<00:02:27.890> that<00:02:28.070> the

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
everyone would agree with me that the

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.780 
everyone would agree with me that the
banana<00:02:28.490> is<00:02:28.730> better<00:02:29.000> than<00:02:29.210> starbursts<00:02:29.710> right

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
banana is better than starbursts right

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.530 
banana is better than starbursts right
does<00:02:31.790> anyone<00:02:32.060> not<00:02:32.210> agree<00:02:32.480> with<00:02:32.510> me<00:02:33.460> okay<00:02:34.540> no

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
does anyone not agree with me okay no

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.000 
does anyone not agree with me okay no
but<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.810> idea<00:02:36.140> here<00:02:36.200> is<00:02:36.410> that<00:02:36.560> we<00:02:36.740> need<00:02:36.890> more

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
but the idea here is that we need more

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.620 
but the idea here is that we need more
information<00:02:37.310> and<00:02:37.760> I<00:02:37.820> love<00:02:38.030> how<00:02:38.180> someone<00:02:38.480> said

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
information and I love how someone said

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.880 
information and I love how someone said
hey<00:02:38.750> I<00:02:38.780> want<00:02:38.840> it<00:02:39.110> I<00:02:39.200> want<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.380> see<00:02:39.530> more<00:02:39.709> I<00:02:39.740> need

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
hey I want it I want to see more I need

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.800 
hey I want it I want to see more I need
to<00:02:39.980> see<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.220> ingredient<00:02:40.700> list<00:02:40.820> so<00:02:41.540> make<00:02:41.780> sure

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
to see the ingredient list so make sure

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.930 
to see the ingredient list so make sure
that<00:02:41.959> you<00:02:42.200> don't<00:02:42.380> take<00:02:42.620> a<00:02:42.650> label<00:02:43.010> at<00:02:43.700> face

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
that you don't take a label at face

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.699 
that you don't take a label at face
value<00:02:43.970> especially<00:02:44.720> when<00:02:44.810> it<00:02:44.930> comes<00:02:45.110> to<00:02:45.290> sugars

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
value especially when it comes to sugars

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.830 
value especially when it comes to sugars
because<00:02:46.400> we<00:02:46.520> did<00:02:46.640> not<00:02:46.790> add<00:02:46.940> any<00:02:47.209> sugar<00:02:47.360> to<00:02:47.720> this

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
because we did not add any sugar to this

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.330 
because we did not add any sugar to this
banana<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.610> sugar<00:02:49.610> is<00:02:49.850> carbohydrate<00:02:50.360> and

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
banana and sugar is carbohydrate and

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.170 
banana and sugar is carbohydrate and
carbohydrate<00:02:52.340> is<00:02:52.489> what<00:02:52.850> you're<00:02:52.970> going<00:02:53.060> to<00:02:53.120> use

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
carbohydrate is what you're going to use

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.880 
carbohydrate is what you're going to use
for<00:02:53.480> fuel<00:02:53.959> for<00:02:54.260> your<00:02:54.350> performance<00:02:55.070> okay
