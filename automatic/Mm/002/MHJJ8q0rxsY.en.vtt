window<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.930> it<00:00:21.930> looks<00:00:22.140> like<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.470> was<00:00:22.560> open<00:00:22.890> but

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
window and it looks like it was open but

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.099 
window and it looks like it was open but
it<00:00:23.430> wasn't<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.269> so<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.630> was<00:00:24.750> flying<00:00:24.900> really

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109
