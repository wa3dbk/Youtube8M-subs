00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
in the beginning on to user LMG but

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.540 
in the beginning on to user LMG but
thankfully<00:03:48.800> she<00:03:48.950> picked<00:03:49.130> it<00:03:49.250> up<00:03:49.310> like<00:03:49.490> I

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
thankfully she picked it up like I

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:50.830 
thankfully she picked it up like I
wasn't<00:03:49.730> even<00:03:49.880> paying<00:03:50.150> attention<00:03:50.270> to<00:03:50.720> her

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
wasn't even paying attention to her

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.810 
wasn't even paying attention to her
playing<00:03:51.080> like<00:03:51.350> when<00:03:51.890> she<00:03:52.070> told<00:03:52.340> me<00:03:52.430> like<00:03:52.580> she

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
playing like when she told me like she

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.640 
playing like when she told me like she
got<00:03:52.970> the<00:03:53.120> AGR<00:03:53.450> that's<00:03:54.260> where<00:03:54.500> I<00:03:54.530> started

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
got the AGR that's where I started

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.130 
got the AGR that's where I started
paying<00:03:55.100> attention<00:03:55.630> so<00:03:56.630> I<00:03:56.690> thought<00:03:56.840> she<00:03:57.020> was

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
paying attention so I thought she was

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.540 
paying attention so I thought she was
using<00:03:57.290> this<00:03:57.470> lmg<00:03:57.860> from<00:03:58.010> the<00:03:58.100> beginning<00:03:58.459> but

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
using this lmg from the beginning but

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.160 
using this lmg from the beginning but
she<00:03:58.670> actually<00:03:58.790> was<00:03:59.000> using<00:03:59.209> the<00:03:59.330> thar<00:03:59.510> she<00:03:59.540> gets

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
she actually was using the thar she gets

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.590 
she actually was using the thar she gets
to<00:04:00.440> swarm<00:04:00.800> and<00:04:01.010> just<00:04:01.310> this<00:04:01.820> one<00:04:02.060> goes<00:04:02.209> complete

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
to swarm and just this one goes complete

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.050 
to swarm and just this one goes complete
apeshit<00:04:02.780> over<00:04:03.220> here<00:04:04.220> she<00:04:04.459> just<00:04:04.490> dies<00:04:04.850> to<00:04:05.030> a

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
apeshit over here she just dies to a

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.240 
apeshit over here she just dies to a
sniper<00:04:05.390> and<00:04:05.740> that<00:04:06.740> was<00:04:06.830> the<00:04:06.920> end<00:04:06.950> of<00:04:07.100> it<00:04:07.190> that
