00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.119
 for this tutorial we will be 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.890
 recreating one of the most 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.480
 popular catwalk fashion 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.249
 this last season 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.990
 the combination of black eyeliner on the 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:33.750
 upper part of the eye with an eyeliner 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.580
 brown on the bottom for our 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.920
 makeup which is super simple and 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.200
 fast let's start with a base for 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.390
 shadows in this case I'm using the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.390
 mix high definition base for shadows 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.150
 for this tutorial we are going to work with 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.380
 the style palette in neutral colors 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.450
 we start our base color with this 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.400
 Pale pink color totally matte 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:03.440
 is here with a flat brush I'm going to 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.440
 Apply on all the movable eyelid 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.840
 Y 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.979
 as the lightest color of our 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:29.289
 paleta mate alike I'm going now is 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.960
 place and give light to the corners 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:34.829
 inside of my eye and the bone just 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.829
 under the eyebrows 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.010
 this look that we're going to work with is based 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.840
 of pencil and shadow in esteem to settle 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.610
 let's start with the color black I'll 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.920
 use for 20 that Jennifer got 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.130
 they linked thought of ferrol 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.440
 I will gently pass by the edge of 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.630
 my upper lashes what I want is 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.210
 create a line where you notice the 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.390
 density of my eyelashes obviously more 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.300
 light on the inside of the eye and 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.270
 with a small brush to blur 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.400
 I'm going to mobilize the product now 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.830
 the way I want and I'm going to lay it 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.190
 with the black shadow of our palette of 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.190
 style 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.859
 putting shadow on top of the texture 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:42.200
 creamy pencil is going to make this 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:44.000
 seal and stay for much longer 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.629
 in our eyes without running for 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.629
 no side 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.630
 to get the stroke that I wish to me 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.580
 it works to stretch my eye a bit with a 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.400
 index finger or with one of my fingers 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.350
 thick without much pressure but look 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.600
 who worked the eye to see the outline that 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.820
 I'm giving you can look for the method that 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.890
 more convenient for you but take into account that 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.850
 you must open the eye to see where it is going 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.850
 the line that you are trying 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.030
 when working with dark colors 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.280
 remember to remove the excesses of your 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.150
 brush you will not want this stain on the 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.150
 rest of your makeup 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.480
 adjust the shape of your stroke until 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.550
 be comfortable with both eyes remember that 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.160
 it is normal for you to have a different eye 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.650
 another do not make an effort to do both 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.640
 exactly identical but in that they are 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.640
 as even as possible 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.920
 ah 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.170
 for the stroke on the bottom of 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.160
 our I'm going to work with a pencil a 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.160
 olive green 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.980
 I'm just going to give traces throughout 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.980
 edge of my lower lashes 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.259
 with a small fine brush clean and 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.960
 now this brown color with my tones 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:30.699
 gold I will pass to settle in everything 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.030
 the pencil at the bottom of my 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:33.030
 tabs 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.020
 Y 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.020
 Y 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.130
 after you have applied the shadow 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.500
 and has been the way you want 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.570
 You can clean the area with a swab and 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:56.850
 finish fixing the form if so 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:05:00.680
 I'm going to use a mask in 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:02.539
 this case the bones super shock in black 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.340
 to give two layers to the eyelashes 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:06.759
 upper and one layer my eyelashes 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.759
 lower 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.389
 there was to further complement the look 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:25.069
 if you had brown mask you could 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.550
 use brown on the eyelashes 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:27.550
 lower 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:45.380
 I'm going to paste my be if I'm going to fill in 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.380
 an angled brush and shadow powder 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.940
 ah 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:15.000
 for blogs I have selected a color 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:17.190
 orange a little dark I will give 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.310
 light touches right on my cheekbone in the 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:23.630
 outside of my face above 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.630
 where have I done contour 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.850
 Y 

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:39.419
 for that face effect lit up like 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.489
 that is not yet the light of the candle I'm going to 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:45.360
 take a small brush and I'll 

00:06:41.489 --> 00:06:48.860
 accentuate the bridge of my nose the bone 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.860
 above our cheekbones 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:54.280
 over our upper lip a little 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.320
 in our chin and a little in the 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:59.050
 center of our forehead and this gives us 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:01.120
 an effect like moonlight 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.250
 for our lips I will use a 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.539
 long-lasting pencil eyeliner 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:06.539
 light pink 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.570
 to 

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.600
 ah 

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:38.940
 to complete what you selected a 

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.940
 Naked lipstick with pink tones 

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:43.500
 this completes our block on the day 

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.500
 from today 

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.730
