00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:18.000
 Talk to me, everyone, beauty with you. 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.039
 Welcome to another video this time. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.600
 released in this video that I 'm going to show 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.369
 five mistakes dowell players 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.980
 usually they make sure 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.080
 the first error is related to items 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.050
 some people do not know they have to 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.050
 do to empower your champion and 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.210
 this you resolve by reading some websites or 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.469
 even watching some stream 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.239
 problems 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.820
 the second mistake that some people 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.920
 they commit is to choose the champion 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.079
 be in the goal and not because you have 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.820
 experience with him then choose one 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.699
 champion you have experience that you 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.980
 has a certain ease of play with it 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.940
 that this will help you a lot to win 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.039
 the game 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.219
 the third error is the incorrect rating 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.070
 goal of the game is basically the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.680
 next if the team of ló x is a dragon 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.580
 does an actor take antônio 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.590
 if the team there take the tower make the dragon 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.409
 understood that it is not the exchange of objective 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.630
 I've always said this in other videos 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.810
 always try to change the objective in the game 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.570
 that you will not give yourself so badly and not 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.630
 will be so far behind and try to save by 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.479
 last to do trocentos goal 7 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.909
 the bedroom and is related to your 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.670
 positioning then try to train this 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.040
 enough because basically you have to 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.770
 to position itself very well to Fipe to 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.350
 you exercise your role as an example you 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.210
 It's kerry and you misplace yourself in the 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.930
 deat and you die 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.119
 this will take many chances of your 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.090
 winning team that is stf because you are 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.149
 the main source of damage your team the 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.399
 fifth mistake is the difficulty in finishing 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.920
 The game is very important to 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.050
 people try to work on this you go 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.420
 grow up 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.240
 make speed to take two and 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.010
 objectives and, consequently, to 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.810
 play fast 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:14.210
 so this is it now I hope you 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.630

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.630
