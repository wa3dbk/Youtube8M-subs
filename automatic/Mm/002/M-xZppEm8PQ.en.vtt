00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.689 
about what kind of styles you like maybe
a<00:00:18.779> color<00:00:18.960> concept<00:00:19.500> like<00:00:20.010> we<00:00:20.160> really<00:00:20.460> liked

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
a color concept like we really liked

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:21.920 
a color concept like we really liked
this<00:00:20.970> minty<00:00:21.359> blue

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
this minty blue

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.529 
this minty blue
I<00:00:21.960> think<00:00:22.529> it's<00:00:22.650> called<00:00:22.830> Harper<00:00:23.369> Harbor<00:00:24.029> and

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
I think it's called Harper Harbor and

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.570 
I think it's called Harper Harbor and
quick<00:00:25.050> tip<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:25.619> if<00:00:26.220> your<00:00:26.369> roommate

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
quick tip is that if your roommate

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.740 
quick tip is that if your roommate
doesn't<00:00:26.730> want<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:26.970> match<00:00:27.119> at<00:00:27.300> all<00:00:27.480> that's

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
doesn't want to match at all that's

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.509 
doesn't want to match at all that's
really<00:00:28.230> not<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.410> big<00:00:28.650> deal<00:00:28.890> my<00:00:29.130> best<00:00:29.340> friend

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
interest in matching her and her room

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
we live in different states so it was

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.729 
we live in different states so it was
kind<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.840> hard<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.110> get<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.410> know<00:00:37.500> each<00:00:37.530> other

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
kind of hard to get to know each other

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.910 
kind of hard to get to know each other
at<00:00:38.190> first<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.030> beginning<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:40.079> we<00:00:40.530> actually

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
at first in the beginning so we actually

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.860 
at first in the beginning so we actually
created<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.370> Pinterest<00:00:41.760> board<00:00:41.820> where<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:42.570> could

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
created a Pinterest board where we could

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.959

off it's definitely the focal point of
our<00:01:05.100> room<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.519> think<00:01:05.960> when<00:01:06.960> we<00:01:07.200> were<00:01:07.380> deciding

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
our room I think when we were deciding

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.920 
our room I think when we were deciding
we<00:01:08.159> picked<00:01:08.520> three<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.090> we<00:01:09.180> really<00:01:09.450> liked<00:01:09.659> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
we picked three that we really liked the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.950 
we picked three that we really liked the
pinwheel<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:11.159> infinity<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.540> live<00:01:12.720> one

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
pinwheel the infinity and the live one

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.350 
pinwheel the infinity and the live one
the<00:01:13.380> live<00:01:13.590> yeah<00:01:13.920> we<00:01:14.070> both<00:01:14.250> really<00:01:14.820> loved<00:01:15.150> to

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
the live yeah we both really loved to

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.880 
the live yeah we both really loved to
live<00:01:15.689> we<00:01:15.900> definitely<00:01:16.290> want<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.770> one

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
live we definitely want to have that one

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.530 
live we definitely want to have that one
but<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.220> was<00:01:17.340> great<00:01:17.670> because<00:01:18.000> they<00:01:18.509> are

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
but it was great because they are

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.570 
but it was great because they are
reversible<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.470> have<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.920> pinwheel<00:01:20.250> on<00:01:20.400> top

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
reversible so I have the pinwheel on top

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.179 
reversible so I have the pinwheel on top
but<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.479> live<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.990> on<00:01:22.110> my<00:01:22.259> reverse<00:01:22.530> side<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.040> I

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
but the live is on my reverse side and I

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.429 
but the live is on my reverse side and I
have<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.400> live<00:01:23.549> on<00:01:23.700> top<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.840> pinwheels<00:01:25.290> on

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
have to live on top and the pinwheels on

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.899 
have to live on top and the pinwheels on
this<00:01:25.590> side<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:26.040> it's<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.250> same<00:01:26.400> bedding<00:01:26.759> we

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
this side so it's the same bedding we

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.940 
this side so it's the same bedding we
just<00:01:27.119> flip<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.330> over<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:28.500> get<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.829> live

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
just flip it over and I get the live

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.319 
just flip it over and I get the live
sometimes<00:01:29.340> she<00:01:29.549> gets<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.790> little<00:01:29.820> sometimes

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
sometimes she gets a little sometimes

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.490 
sometimes she gets a little sometimes
and<00:01:30.659> we<00:01:30.750> don't<00:01:31.049> have<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.229> be<00:01:31.320> too

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500
