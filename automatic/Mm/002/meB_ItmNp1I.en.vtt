00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.550 
yourselves and and move forward with the
series<00:01:41.490> if<00:01:42.360> we<00:01:42.450> agreed<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.750> we<00:01:43.079> were<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> bit

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
series if we agreed that we were a bit

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.740 
series if we agreed that we were a bit
too<00:01:43.770> greedy<00:01:43.979> for<00:01:44.070> objectives<00:01:44.700> like<00:01:45.030> we<00:01:45.630> might

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
too greedy for objectives like we might

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.719 
too greedy for objectives like we might
for<00:01:45.960> Dragon<00:01:46.290> we<00:01:46.619> couldn't<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.250> instead<00:01:47.640> of

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
for Dragon we couldn't and instead of

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.090 
for Dragon we couldn't and instead of
fighting<00:01:48.000> them<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:48.930> we<00:01:49.200> said<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.439> if<00:01:49.860> we

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
fighting them so we said that if we

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.429 
fighting them so we said that if we
fight<00:01:50.399> next<00:01:50.820> time<00:01:51.090> instead<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.720> then<00:01:52.259> we

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
fight next time instead that then we

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.020 
fight next time instead that then we
will<00:01:52.530> be<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.860> games<00:01:53.040> because<00:01:53.460> we<00:01:53.820> felt

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
will be in the games because we felt

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.179 
will be in the games because we felt
like<00:01:54.090> we<00:01:54.329> were<00:01:54.360> capable<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.409> doing<00:01:55.740> the

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
like we were capable of doing the

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.950 
like we were capable of doing the
previous<00:01:56.549> games<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.969> then<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.509> course<00:01:57.540> in

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
previous games and then of course in

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.469 
previous games and then of course in

pick what it's you know why you chose it
in<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.380> matchup<00:02:07.649> specifically<00:02:08.520> things<00:02:09.030> like

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
in that matchup specifically things like

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.510 
in that matchup specifically things like
that<00:02:09.330> yeah<00:02:10.080> I've<00:02:10.440> been<00:02:10.679> practicing<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.400> lot

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
that yeah I've been practicing it a lot

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.690 
that yeah I've been practicing it a lot
of<00:02:11.550> times<00:02:11.970> against<00:02:12.300> mundo

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
of times against mundo

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.899 
of times against mundo
I<00:02:13.730> put<00:02:14.209> it<00:02:14.330> out<00:02:14.420> specifically<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.290> that<00:02:15.319> pig<00:02:15.909> he

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:16.909 
I put it out specifically to that pig he

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:19.839 
I put it out specifically to that pig he
needed<00:02:17.180> some<00:02:17.569> impactful<00:02:18.470> pigs<00:02:18.799> after<00:02:19.099> the<00:02:19.700> two

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
needed some impactful pigs after the two

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.839 
needed some impactful pigs after the two
losses<00:02:20.239> I<00:02:20.510> felt<00:02:20.780> like<00:02:20.989> and<00:02:21.260> picking<00:02:22.159> papa<00:02:22.549> gets

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
losses I felt like and picking papa gets

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.520 
losses I felt like and picking papa gets
a<00:02:22.970> really<00:02:23.209> huge<00:02:23.480> morale<00:02:23.840> boost<00:02:24.080> for<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.349> team

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
a really huge morale boost for the team

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.070 
a really huge morale boost for the team
as<00:02:24.680> well<00:02:24.860> I<00:02:25.040> was<00:02:25.790> about<00:02:25.879> to<00:02:26.000> say<00:02:26.330> what<00:02:26.810> is<00:02:26.930> that

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
as well I was about to say what is that

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.869 
as well I was about to say what is that
what<00:02:27.620> exactly<00:02:28.129> does<00:02:28.250> that<00:02:28.310> do<00:02:28.580> for<00:02:28.640> you

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
what exactly does that do for you

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:29.860 
what exactly does that do for you
knowing<00:02:29.060> that<00:02:29.209> you<00:02:29.360> kind<00:02:29.540> of<00:02:29.629> have<00:02:29.720> this

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
knowing that you kind of have this

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.449 
knowing that you kind of have this
pocket<00:02:30.110> pick<00:02:30.440> in<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.709> top<00:02:30.920> plane<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:31.370> then

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
pocket pick in the top plane and then

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:32.740 
pocket pick in the top plane and then
when<00:02:31.610> it<00:02:31.700> comes<00:02:31.879> out<00:02:32.030> and<00:02:32.060> it<00:02:32.180> performs<00:02:32.599> that

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
when it comes out and it performs that

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.059 
when it comes out and it performs that
well<00:02:32.959> that's<00:02:33.230> got<00:02:33.379> to<00:02:33.470> be<00:02:33.530> really<00:02:33.739> exciting

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
same actually when we played against

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.360 
same actually when we played against
that<00:02:37.640> IP<00:02:37.790> with<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.269> Swain<00:02:38.450> so<00:02:39.440> we<00:02:40.099> have<00:02:40.250> this

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
that IP with the Swain so we have this

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.580 
that IP with the Swain so we have this
kind<00:02:40.549> of<00:02:40.670> weird<00:02:40.910> pick<00:02:41.390> up<00:02:41.540> some<00:02:41.750> transom<00:02:42.230> it

feel like playing these kind of weird
picks<00:03:11.930> sometimes<00:03:12.319> can<00:03:12.500> actually<00:03:12.799> really<00:03:13.010> help

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
picks sometimes can actually really help

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:14.589 
picks sometimes can actually really help
you<00:03:13.340> against<00:03:13.760> some<00:03:14.090> really<00:03:14.299> good<00:03:14.390> teams

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
you against some really good teams

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.300 
you against some really good teams
because<00:03:14.989> they<00:03:15.440> can<00:03:15.590> never<00:03:15.650> expect<00:03:16.010> what<00:03:16.129> you

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
because they can never expect what you
