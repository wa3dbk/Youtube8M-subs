Gonzalez's<00:01:04.729> stamina<00:01:05.630> seem<00:01:06.319> to<00:01:06.469> be<00:01:06.590> failing

00:01:06.849 --> 00:01:06.859 
Gonzalez's stamina seem to be failing

Gonzalez's stamina seem to be failing
him<00:01:07.100> in<00:01:07.369> the<00:01:07.490> middle<00:01:07.670> rounds<00:01:07.880> because<00:01:08.209> it's

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
him in the middle rounds because it's

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.769 
him in the middle rounds because it's
jean<00:01:08.959> pascal<00:01:09.409> who's<00:01:09.770> normally<00:01:10.759> the<00:01:10.850> guy<00:01:11.029> with

jean pascal who's normally the guy with
poor<00:01:12.049> stamina<00:01:12.560> but<00:01:12.679> perhaps<00:01:12.920> this<00:01:13.310> catch<00:01:13.549> way

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:13.789 
poor stamina but perhaps this catch way

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:16.209 
poor stamina but perhaps this catch way
cuz<00:01:13.999> the<00:01:14.090> fight<00:01:14.270> was<00:01:14.450> full<00:01:14.659> i<00:01:14.840> believe<00:01:15.139> it<00:01:15.259> 177

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:16.219 
cuz the fight was full i believe it 177

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:18.969 
cuz the fight was full i believe it 177
178<00:01:17.119> pounds<00:01:17.299> maybe<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:18.200> catch<00:01:18.349> we<00:01:18.560> actually

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
178 pounds maybe the catch we actually

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.129 
178 pounds maybe the catch we actually
favored<00:01:19.340> jean<00:01:19.520> pascal<00:01:19.909> a<00:01:19.969> bit<00:01:20.240> because<00:01:20.420> he

00:01:21.129 --> 00:01:21.139 
favored jean pascal a bit because he

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:22.569

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:51.999 
the way he throws his right hand it's a
solid<00:01:50.359> shot<00:01:50.749> but<00:01:50.989> he<00:01:51.469> could<00:01:51.649> get<00:01:51.770> a<00:01:51.799> lot<00:01:51.979> more

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
solid shot but he could get a lot more

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.050 
solid shot but he could get a lot more
power<00:01:52.369> if<00:01:53.029> he<00:01:53.119> widened<00:01:53.599> his<00:01:53.689> starts<00:01:54.079> a<00:01:54.169> bit<00:01:54.380> and

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
power if he widened his starts a bit and

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.309 
power if he widened his starts a bit and
bent<00:01:56.060> his<00:01:56.179> knees<00:01:56.239> and<00:01:56.450> straightened<00:01:57.079> out<00:01:57.139> that

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
bent his knees and straightened out that

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:59.289 
bent his knees and straightened out that
right<00:01:57.529> hand<00:01:57.739> and<00:01:57.919> learned<00:01:58.099> to<00:01:58.219> throw<00:01:58.399> it<00:01:58.549> more

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
right hand and learned to throw it more

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.719 
right hand and learned to throw it more
correctly<00:01:59.719> but<00:02:00.439> his<00:02:00.679> jab<00:02:00.979> is<00:02:01.159> very<00:02:01.369> strong

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
correctly but his jab is very strong

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.249 
correctly but his jab is very strong
I'll<00:02:01.939> say<00:02:02.149> that<00:02:02.179> he's<00:02:02.450> got<00:02:02.569> nice<00:02:02.749> uppercuts

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
I'll say that he's got nice uppercuts

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.099 
I'll say that he's got nice uppercuts
and<00:02:03.409> his<00:02:03.529> jab<00:02:03.770> is<00:02:03.919> very<00:02:04.189> very<00:02:04.399> strong<00:02:04.819> and

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:05.109 
and his jab is very very strong and

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:07.779 
and his jab is very very strong and
because<00:02:06.109> he's<00:02:06.229> so<00:02:06.409> tall<00:02:06.649> and<00:02:06.709> got<00:02:07.340> such<00:02:07.549> long

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
because he's so tall and got such long

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.669 
because he's so tall and got such long
arms<00:02:08.119> that<00:02:08.270> could<00:02:08.450> be<00:02:08.569> a<00:02:08.599> serious<00:02:09.079> weapon<00:02:09.500> for

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
arms that could be a serious weapon for

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.440 
arms that could be a serious weapon for
him<00:02:09.799> in<00:02:10.340> a<00:02:10.489> light<00:02:10.640> heavyweight<00:02:11.000> division<00:02:11.030> I

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
him in a light heavyweight division I

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.600 
him in a light heavyweight division I
felt<00:02:11.659> he<00:02:11.750> was<00:02:11.870> hard<00:02:12.079> done<00:02:12.319> by<00:02:12.349> I'm<00:02:13.219> not<00:02:13.459> going

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
felt he was hard done by I'm not going

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.530 
felt he was hard done by I'm not going
to<00:02:13.670> say<00:02:13.790> it<00:02:13.879> was<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.030> rubber

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
to say it was a rubber

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.190 
to say it was a rubber
but<00:02:15.500> I<00:02:15.799> felt<00:02:16.430> Gonzalez<00:02:16.939> took<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.269> fight<00:02:17.510> so

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
but I felt Gonzalez took the fight so

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.780 
but I felt Gonzalez took the fight so

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
between jean pascal and gonzalez and

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.509 
between jean pascal and gonzalez and
where<00:02:24.409> do<00:02:24.500> you<00:02:24.590> see<00:02:24.799> both<00:02:24.950> fighters<00:02:25.219> going

where do you see both fighters going
from<00:02:25.670> here<00:02:25.849> pascal<00:02:26.659> obviously<00:02:27.079> is<00:02:27.170> chasing

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
from here pascal obviously is chasing

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.860 
from here pascal obviously is chasing
the<00:02:27.650> carbon<00:02:27.920> every<00:02:28.189> match<00:02:28.400> i<00:02:28.750> almost<00:02:29.750> feel

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
the carbon every match i almost feel

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.110 
the carbon every match i almost feel
like<00:02:29.930> gonzales<00:02:30.560> deserves<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.099> cove<00:02:31.280> level

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
like gonzales deserves the cove level

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.550 
like gonzales deserves the cove level
every<00:02:32.359> match<00:02:32.540> /<00:02:32.780> pascal<00:02:33.170> and<00:02:33.230> i'd<00:02:33.349> certainly

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
every match / pascal and i'd certainly

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.699 
every match / pascal and i'd certainly
rather<00:02:33.890> see<00:02:34.189> it<00:02:34.310> because<00:02:34.640> obviously<00:02:35.709> Gonzales

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
rather see it because obviously Gonzales

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.160 
rather see it because obviously Gonzales
has<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.340> full<00:02:37.700> covenant<00:02:38.450> before<00:02:38.720> we<00:02:38.840> all<00:02:38.959> know

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
has a full covenant before we all know

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.920 
has a full covenant before we all know
we<00:02:39.379> all<00:02:39.500> know<00:02:39.620> how<00:02:39.829> the<00:02:39.890> first<00:02:40.790> Kovalev<00:02:41.540> pascal

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
we all know how the first Kovalev pascal

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.920 
we all know how the first Kovalev pascal
fight<00:02:42.170> ended<00:02:42.500> so<00:02:43.340> yeah<00:02:43.609> I<00:02:43.639> think<00:02:43.780> Gonzalez<00:02:44.780> was

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
fight ended so yeah I think Gonzalez was

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.080 
fight ended so yeah I think Gonzalez was
a<00:02:44.959> bit<00:02:45.139> hard<00:02:45.379> done<00:02:45.590> by<00:02:45.620> here<00:02:46.010> if<00:02:46.219> you<00:02:46.790> agree<00:02:47.060> or
