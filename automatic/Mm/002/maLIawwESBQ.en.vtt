00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:35.890
 we have always had a 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:37.780
 concern about how we can apply 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.660
 the ultraviolet to the industry of 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.000
 food at this time only applies 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.000
 for what is water and juice clear is 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.940
 true without any color and it's a 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.579
 relatively very clean technology that 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.930
 does not generate waste of any kind 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.570
 all of us always had the 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.979
 concern how to apply it then 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.309
 we started working with fruits 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:03.820
 tropical of which we have three 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.860
 what is banana pineapple and - and we wanted to see 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.200
 how it affected the side of rays 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.560
 ultraviolet to the decrease of 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.259
 microorganisms and characteristics 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.140
 sensory of the three products because 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:20.830
 it may be a very good technique 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.990
 can truly be very clean and can 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.740
 apply but if you change sensorially 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.540
 the fruits or does not diminish enough 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.940
 the microorganism does not 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.790
 it's applicable because it's going to change 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.650
 really the fruits good because 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.810
 you know that ultraviolet rays 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.300
 equal heat generate equal they generate a 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.160
 cell damage that's why it's over 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.690
 eliminating bacteria then 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.350
 practically what we wanted 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:50.470
 see was if that was going to affect the taste or 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.870
 the color or texture of the fruits that 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:57.070
 we were going to try practically 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:59.890
 the project started seeing how much 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.619
 salmonella and listeria decreased 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.630
 fusarium in the three fruits in the 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.190
 surface the three fruits because 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.229
 we chose these three fruits good 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.540
 because they are different surfaces 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.900
 you can see how the banana 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:16.600
 the pineapple and the child have very shells 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.380
 different very different textures and 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:23.560
 of very different colors that in certain 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.090
 may influence the actions of the 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.340
 ultraviolet rays you know 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.680
 ultraviolet chlorination do not penetrate only 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.100
 they work superficially 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.550
 we wanted to see the effect 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:38.000
 of the rays on the surface of these 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.610
 three fruits later what we did was 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.210
 treat the fruits at different times and 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:47.960
 subject them to sensory testing and 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:51.980
 color and texture once made 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.990
 this we continue with a test of 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.360
 storage where the fruit is 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.120
 submitted to the best time of the two 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.820
 previous objectives that in that case 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.160
 it was three minutes then we submitted 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.530
 the fruits to three minutes and we leave it 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.690
 in storage for 12 days to see 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.860
 what was the behavior of those three 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:15.190
 fruits through time 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.890
 in general we realized that 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.170
 the ultraviolet light can be 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.410
 use at the company level for example 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.690
 of export fruits many of them 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.760
 they have problems with ways like fusarium 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.440
 you know that the pineapple that sometimes 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.260
 goes to europe has problems in the 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.990
 peduncle or crown at the level of 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.700
 deterioration by means of moss then to 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.150
 level of this project we 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:43.480
 we define that you can use this 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:47.020
 type of ultraviolet light instead of the 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.200
 chlorinated water let's say it brings many 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:53.830
 waste at the environmental level in this 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.020
 case we could see a 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.610
 application in this regard why 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.410
 because we also already define how much is 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.540
 maximum time that a fruit can be 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.160
 exposed, tunnels can be made 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.410
 exhibition the use of the work is in 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.030
 these fruits what happens is that the 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:11.810
 project of us was made to level 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.750
 of laboratory now what would follow and 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.579
 would be very good would be to expand it to 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.959
 an industry that wants to make a 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:23.120
 pilot project for this type of 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.669
 disinfection mechanisms the project 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.520
 had the support of don johnny armenta that 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:31.310
 is the representative of the bio company 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.100
 agricultural which we designed the team and 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:37.280
 with this he helped us to realize the 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.950
 research project form 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.200
 complete this was the team that 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.740
 designed specifically for the project 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:48.680
 of banana pineapple and melon is a device 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.460
 for disinfection and sterilization with 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.169
 all security mechanisms 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.210
 adequate as we observed when opening the 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.660
 gate in total security is 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:02.450
 they placed the products there and 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.280
 no light emission at the bottom 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:07.520
 Y 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:10.670
 superior was made for specifically 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.980
 for this project but what's interesting 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:15.710
 of these first systems that are 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:18.110
 ecological work very well 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.150
 fast we are talking about that level of 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.220
 surface is being handled was 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.260
 handling times from three seconds to 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.480
 floor level the 10 seconds at the level of 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.910
 surfaces and the environment in 5 hours 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.010
 they work by taking advantage of 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.410
 natural convection movement of 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.120
 air within the establishment between 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.910
 food industry of the health sector 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.650
 also or in case there is some 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.230
 forced movement of air 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.860
 functional way much more more 17 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:48.050
 Increase efficiency between 25 to 50 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:50.240
 times and we already have it installed in 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.830
 various industries in the specific case 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.560
 for example in the process plant 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.120
 industrial auto car market 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.890
 the whole system has been placed in 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.250
 this plant and the results have been 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.900
 really well very important and already 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.380
 We are in other industries in the country 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.970
 within the food industry thanks to 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.139
 all this work that together we have 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.639
 made with the 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:12.979
 with the university with the site 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:14.900
 specifically which has allowed us 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:17.470
 validate and develop all this type of 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.400
 research done in the country 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.400
