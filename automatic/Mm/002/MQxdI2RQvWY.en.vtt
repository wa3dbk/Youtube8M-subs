one<00:00:06.020> of<00:00:06.110> the<00:00:06.170> biggest<00:00:06.350> enemies<00:00:06.650> of

one of the biggest enemies of

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.280 
one of the biggest enemies of
photography<00:00:07.580> is<00:00:07.760> camera<00:00:08.210> shake<00:00:08.450> this<00:00:08.990> is<00:00:09.049> the

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:09.290 
photography is camera shake this is the

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.170 
photography is camera shake this is the
blurriness<00:00:09.710> of<00:00:09.950> your<00:00:10.100> pictures<00:00:10.460> caused<00:00:10.820> by

blurriness of your pictures caused by

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.270 
blurriness of your pictures caused by

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280 
having a shutter speed which is it's too

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.759 
having a shutter speed which is it's too

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
are advantages to sensor stabilization

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:53.800 
are advantages to sensor stabilization
the<00:01:51.979> main<00:01:52.130> one<00:01:52.340> is<00:01:52.490> that<00:01:52.729> because<00:01:53.509> it's<00:01:53.659> in<00:01:53.750> the

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
the main one is that because it's in the

the main one is that because it's in the
body<00:01:53.990> any<00:01:54.530> lens<00:01:54.950> that<00:01:55.189> you<00:01:55.250> attach<00:01:55.579> to<00:01:55.609> the

body any lens that you attach to the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.420 
body any lens that you attach to the
camera<00:01:56.210> is<00:01:56.390> therefore<00:01:57.109> stabilized<00:01:57.680> so<00:01:58.369> you

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
camera is therefore stabilized so you

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.889 
camera is therefore stabilized so you
can<00:01:58.549> attach<00:01:58.759> even<00:01:59.000> old<00:01:59.119> lenses<00:01:59.509> and<00:01:59.600> you<00:01:59.659> still

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
can attach even old lenses and you still

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.899 
can attach even old lenses and you still
get<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:00.079> stabilization<00:02:01.039> whereas<00:02:01.759> with

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
get the stabilization whereas with

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.690 
get the stabilization whereas with
optical<00:02:02.299> image<00:02:02.649> stabilization<00:02:03.649> you<00:02:04.429> have<00:02:04.549> to

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
optical image stabilization you have to

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.880 
optical image stabilization you have to
buy<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.240> stabilized<00:02:05.719> lenses<00:02:06.229> as<00:02:06.500> opposed<00:02:06.799> to

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
buy the stabilized lenses as opposed to

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.680 
buy the stabilized lenses as opposed to
the<00:02:07.009> non<00:02:07.159> stabilized<00:02:07.640> lenses<00:02:08.030> and<00:02:08.210> they<00:02:08.539> do

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
the non stabilized lenses and they do

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.600 
the non stabilized lenses and they do
cost<00:02:08.960> more<00:02:09.289> so<00:02:09.530> that's<00:02:10.009> a<00:02:10.100> factor<00:02:10.369> to<00:02:10.460> consider

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
cost more so that's a factor to consider

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.220 
cost more so that's a factor to consider
when<00:02:10.850> buying<00:02:11.120> a<00:02:11.270> camera<00:02:11.510> it's<00:02:12.050> how<00:02:12.170> many

when buying a camera it's how many

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.990 
when buying a camera it's how many

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
lenses you're likely to buy and how much

it's likely to cost you to get the
