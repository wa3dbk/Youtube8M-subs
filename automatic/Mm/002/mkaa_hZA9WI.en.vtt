00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:12.090
 hello and welcome back to the croton canal 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.459
 today I want to explain to you five reasons for 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.220
 to become vegan calists then the 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:19.560
 first reason is that with the life of the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.589
 cancer distance you can eat a quantity 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.869
 unlimited food without having without 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:27.150
 fatten this up because fruit and 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.999
 raw vegetables and a small amount of 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.180
 assemini nuts feed us feed 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:35.790
 fully understood they are in a manner 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.100
 incredible and therefore no need to 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.970
 go rummaging in the pantry 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.620
 to look for sweets and sweets for 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.930
 compensate for our craving for sweets and 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.860
 with this type of power supply 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.540
 you will always feel satisfied and energetic and beautiful 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.190
 then let's face it the truth does not exist 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.030
 no diet that allows you to 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.370
 eat so in abundance and not 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.040
 get fat because this then ends 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.990
 the real problem instead with the raw food we 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.060
 we can eat as much as we want without it 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:10.409
 put a pound more according to reason is 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.540
 the abundance of energy that comes to you from 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.090
 this type of power supply indeed 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.860
 digestion being much faster 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.740
 faster because ours 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.690
 body knows them immediately 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.390
 foods and then digests them just as much 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.280
 quickly we have more energy left then 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.920
 for other activities such as 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.810
 run biking myself 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.670
 by how much when i follow this kind of 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.830
 feeding I wake up every day 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.380
 just with the desire to get out of 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.810
 resign my tennis shoes and go 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.270
 immediately running to make me a good one 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.790
 walk and just like that need 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.490
 to get rid of taking advantage of all 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.560
 that energy that remains precisely for us 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.720
 all other activities of the day 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.909
 the third advantage is improvement 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.890
 sleep quality since 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.260
 precisely I follow this type of 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.540
 I wake up a lot more 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.330
 more rested accordingly or more 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.880
 energy and having more energy or even more 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.620
 more mental clarity to have even more 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.930
 stability 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.280
 mental and therefore not to deviate precisely 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.470
 from the raw food 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.210
 another advantage is certainly 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.620
 the cancellation of all the problems of 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.110
 constipation 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.660
 before starting to point one 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.360
 vegan diet I had strong problems of 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.610
 constipation, but no one ever had me 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.560
 said no doctor told me look 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.890
 no need to take laxatives 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.330
 strange pills supplements 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.420
 just a diet based on fruit and 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.880
 vegetable and passes the fear is like this or in 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.540
 this solved this too 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.970
 problem 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.860
 another problem that I solved thanks 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.770
 this type of power concerns 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.030
 the aspect in fact I have always suffered 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:53.570
 let's say I've always had oily skin 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.610
 greasy hair partners and I could not 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.250
 find a remedy indeed despite being 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.790
 I went to the dermatologist anyway 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.940
 filled with various crime creams 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.460
 also expensive however with these with 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.200
 these remedies I have not found alone 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.620
 otherwise these creams made me 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.950
 always dehydrate your skin a lot 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.660
 and in any case they were not for me 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.820
 solution to this problem instead 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.489
 it was solved with the adoption of 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.410
 a plant-based diet especially of 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.600
 fruit and raw vegetables and is 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.790
 above all thanks also 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.800
 at the sun or improved exposure of 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.709
 very much my problem 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.300
 another advantage I noticed with 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.970
 this type of feeding concerns 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.520
 certainly the taste indeed the fruit 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.950
 and the vegetables are as if they cleaned you up 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.350
 practically put us in new 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.690
 taste buds and consequently also 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.150
 the simplest flavors look like gods 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.660
 extraordinary stratospheric flavors 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.400
 in fact it allows you to eat bananas 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:58.130
 make me a very simple smoothie based 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:02.330
 of banal persimmon and a bit of peel of 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:06.739
 lemon and the eden that is precisely known one 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:08.480
 one that the taste buds are yes 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.630
 they are cleaned up and consequently 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.050
 they appreciate much more than they do 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.810
 before 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:18.230
 the simplest flavors another reason 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:22.070
 so become raw food vegan 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:24.320
 especially for us women and the 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.410
 resolution of the problem of the gods 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.840
 menstrual pains 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.720
 I since I had the first cycles 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.820
 I have always suffered from menstruation 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.220
 painful and especially on the first day 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:40.080
 in which I was forced to stay anyway a 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.520
 read to take strange sachets e 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.860
 in fact they are only medicines too 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.830
 strong enough to appease 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.510
 this type of pain and and in any case the 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.950
 my life was compromised in these 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:55.140
 days in the sense that I could not do 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:57.400
 nothing else and I always imagined that 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.160
 we say when I would have become more 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.630
 great I would have had a job 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.640
 I should have sacrificed myself anyway 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.480
 however, during and during the two days 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:09.880
 because I couldn't do anything e 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.290
 instead with the vegan diet that is far away 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.420
 however not even with the vegan one with 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.790
 the vegan pains were noticed 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.620
 which have eased quite however in 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.060
 particular with this with the diet 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.250
 precisely from cancer of st 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.270
 I noticed that the pains are 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.700
 disappeared in the sense that they do not welcome me 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.170
 in wine of the arrival of the cycle e 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.380
 this is a fundamental reason for me 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:31.690
 so according to me the women in 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.400
 particular should they should 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.220
 begin to insert more fruit and 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.500
 raw vegetables in one's diet well 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.730
 with this finished and I hope this 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.680
 video you enjoyed 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:44.169

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:54.250
 filled with various crime creams too 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:57.220
 however expensive with these with these 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:06:00.340
 remedies I found no relief indeed 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:03.030
 I always had dry skin and 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.030
 result
