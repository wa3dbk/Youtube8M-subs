curling<00:01:53.860> iron<00:01:54.010> and<00:01:54.280> I<00:01:55.030> just<00:01:55.210> put<00:01:55.420> it<00:01:55.510> on<00:01:55.630> the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
curling iron and I just put it on the

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.110 
curling iron and I just put it on the
400<00:01:56.530> degree<00:01:56.800> heat<00:01:57.040> setting<00:01:57.460> so<00:01:57.730> that's<00:01:57.970> the

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
400 degree heat setting so that's the

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.490 
400 degree heat setting so that's the
highest<00:01:58.300> i<00:01:58.660> always<00:01:58.870> put<00:01:59.020> it<00:01:59.080> on<00:01:59.260> the<00:01:59.350> highest

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.800 
doing this so I like to hold mine for
about<00:03:39.130> 10<00:03:39.430> seconds<00:03:39.850> just<00:03:39.970> so<00:03:40.120> it<00:03:40.240> curls<00:03:40.510> pretty

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
about 10 seconds just so it curls pretty

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.260 
about 10 seconds just so it curls pretty
well<00:03:40.990> and<00:03:41.260> then<00:03:42.250> you<00:03:42.280> could<00:03:42.550> let<00:03:42.700> it<00:03:42.820> go<00:03:43.030> and

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
well and then you could let it go and

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.100 
well and then you could let it go and
this<00:03:43.390> is<00:03:43.540> sort<00:03:44.530> of<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.970> you<00:03:46.270> know<00:03:46.390> natural
