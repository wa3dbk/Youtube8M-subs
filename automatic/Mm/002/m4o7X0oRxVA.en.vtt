responsibilities include working with
all<00:00:18.279> the<00:00:18.460> departments<00:00:18.910> to<00:00:19.029> make<00:00:19.210> sure<00:00:19.420> that

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
all the departments to make sure that

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.540 
all the departments to make sure that
every<00:00:19.990> aspect<00:00:20.140> of<00:00:20.470> the<00:00:20.590> game<00:00:20.619> is<00:00:21.040> integrated

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
every aspect of the game is integrated

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.640 
every aspect of the game is integrated
into<00:00:21.670> the<00:00:21.849> level<00:00:22.090> design<00:00:22.360> we<00:00:23.349> want<00:00:23.500> to<00:00:23.560> make

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
into the level design we want to make

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.690 
into the level design we want to make
sure<00:00:23.739> that<00:00:23.890> we're<00:00:24.009> not<00:00:24.130> working<00:00:24.279> in<00:00:24.520> a<00:00:24.579> vacuum

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:24.700 
sure that we're not working in a vacuum

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.550 
sure that we're not working in a vacuum
and<00:00:25.150> that<00:00:25.450> everything<00:00:25.989> comes<00:00:26.140> together<00:00:26.290> as<00:00:26.470> a

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
and that everything comes together as a

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.460 
and that everything comes together as a
cohesive<00:00:26.860> team<00:00:27.419> and<00:00:28.419> I<00:00:28.689> think<00:00:28.750> Unreal<00:00:29.140> 4<00:00:29.200> is

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
cohesive team and I think Unreal 4 is

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.409 
cohesive team and I think Unreal 4 is
great<00:00:29.649> at<00:00:29.800> doing<00:00:29.890> that<00:00:30.160> there's<00:00:30.939> a<00:00:31.000> variety<00:00:31.180> of

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:31.419 
great at doing that there's a variety of

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.120 
great at doing that there's a variety of
tools<00:00:31.660> that<00:00:31.869> help<00:00:32.050> us<00:00:32.259> quickly<00:00:32.410> speed<00:00:32.860> through

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.130 
tools that help us quickly speed through

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.860 
tools that help us quickly speed through
prototyping<00:00:33.730> phases<00:00:34.120> without<00:00:34.390> having<00:00:34.720> to

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
prototyping phases without having to

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.560 
prototyping phases without having to
worry<00:00:35.500> about<00:00:35.590> throwing<00:00:35.860> away<00:00:36.100> work<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:37.540> I

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
worry about throwing away work and I

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.150 
worry about throwing away work and I
think<00:00:38.230> it's<00:00:38.410> great<00:00:38.470> at<00:00:38.649> that<00:00:38.739> is<00:00:38.890> the<00:00:39.010> best

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
think it's great at that is the best

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.560 
think it's great at that is the best
engine<00:00:39.399> I've<00:00:39.489> used<00:00:39.730> for<00:00:39.820> prototyping<00:00:40.059> so<00:00:40.390> far

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
engine I've used for prototyping so far

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.180 
engine I've used for prototyping so far
the<00:00:41.260> blueprint<00:00:41.559> system<00:00:41.679> is<00:00:42.010> basically

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
the blueprint system is basically

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.160 
the blueprint system is basically
programming<00:00:42.910> so<00:00:43.690> if<00:00:43.750> you<00:00:43.840> have<00:00:43.960> some

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
programming so if you have some

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.450 
programming so if you have some
rudimentary<00:00:44.500> programming<00:00:45.100> knowledge<00:00:45.339> but

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
rudimentary programming knowledge but

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.130 
rudimentary programming knowledge but
don't<00:00:45.640> necessarily<00:00:45.730> know<00:00:46.120> the<00:00:46.359> syntax<00:00:46.870> for

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
don't necessarily know the syntax for

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.110 
don't necessarily know the syntax for
everything<00:00:47.500> you<00:00:48.010> can<00:00:48.129> take<00:00:48.280> that<00:00:48.429> logic<00:00:48.609> and

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
everything you can take that logic and

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.060 
everything you can take that logic and
put<00:00:49.300> together<00:00:49.449> a<00:00:49.870> game<00:00:50.109> mode<00:00:50.260> in<00:00:50.410> a<00:00:50.679> day<00:00:50.829> or<00:00:50.920> two

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
put together a game mode in a day or two

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.160 
put together a game mode in a day or two
and<00:00:51.940> that's<00:00:52.030> really<00:00:52.329> great<00:00:52.539> for<00:00:52.719> us<00:00:52.839> in<00:00:53.079> this

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
and that's really great for us in this

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.840 
and that's really great for us in this
early<00:00:53.379> stage<00:00:53.739> where<00:00:54.070> we're<00:00:54.489> throwing<00:00:54.730> out

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
early stage where we're throwing out

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.130 
early stage where we're throwing out
stuff<00:00:55.120> that<00:00:55.149> we're<00:00:55.390> trying<00:00:55.539> after<00:00:55.749> the<00:00:55.960> first

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
stuff that we're trying after the first

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.630 
stuff that we're trying after the first
time<00:00:56.289> we're<00:00:56.559> like<00:00:56.679> okay<00:00:56.890> business<00:00:57.280> this<00:00:57.399> isn't

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
time we're like okay business this isn't

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.540 
time we're like okay business this isn't
working<00:00:57.760> let's<00:00:58.059> start<00:00:58.269> over<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.920> the<00:01:00.370> pipe

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
working let's start over the the pipe

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.220 
working let's start over the the pipe
the<00:01:00.999> pipeline<00:01:01.269> frame<00:01:01.510> porting<00:01:01.719> art<00:01:01.870> is<00:01:01.989> also

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
the pipeline frame porting art is also

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.180 
the pipeline frame porting art is also
great<00:01:02.440> too

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
great too

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.799 
great too
if<00:01:03.429> you're<00:01:03.609> just<00:01:03.789> kind<00:01:03.909> of<00:01:03.999> a<00:01:04.089> mediocre<00:01:04.330> artist

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
if you're just kind of a mediocre artist

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.450 
if you're just kind of a mediocre artist
you<00:01:04.930> can<00:01:05.050> make<00:01:05.170> a<00:01:05.199> lot<00:01:05.409> of<00:01:05.440> great<00:01:05.620> temp<00:01:05.890> assets

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
you can make a lot of great temp assets

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.580 
you can make a lot of great temp assets
it's<00:01:07.300> a<00:01:07.390> instance<00:01:07.840> around<00:01:08.110> the<00:01:08.200> level<00:01:08.470> and

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
it's a instance around the level and

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.290 
it's a instance around the level and
sort<00:01:08.710> of<00:01:08.800> quickly<00:01:09.070> block<00:01:09.310> something<00:01:09.550> out<00:01:09.790> like

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
sort of quickly block something out like

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.850 
sort of quickly block something out like
I<00:01:10.450> had<00:01:10.600> blocked<00:01:10.840> out<00:01:10.990> a<00:01:11.020> level<00:01:11.259> in<00:01:11.500> about<00:01:11.680> a<00:01:11.710> day

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
I had blocked out a level in about a day

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.149 
I had blocked out a level in about a day
and<00:01:11.979> a<00:01:12.040> half<00:01:12.070> using<00:01:12.670> a<00:01:13.180> cube<00:01:13.840> and<00:01:14.110> I<00:01:14.950> think

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
and a half using a cube and I think

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:16.530 
and a half using a cube and I think
another<00:01:15.369> cube<00:01:15.700> that<00:01:15.820> had<00:01:15.970> a<00:01:16.000> couple<00:01:16.299> of<00:01:16.360> cuts

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
another cube that had a couple of cuts

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.880 
another cube that had a couple of cuts
in<00:01:16.689> it<00:01:16.869> so<00:01:16.960> I<00:01:17.020> could<00:01:17.200> I<00:01:17.320> can<00:01:17.470> make<00:01:17.560> a<00:01:17.590> different

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
in it so I could I can make a different

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.800 
in it so I could I can make a different
shape<00:01:17.920> but<00:01:18.340> being<00:01:19.119> able<00:01:19.210> to<00:01:19.299> scale<00:01:19.570> and

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
shape but being able to scale and

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.569 
shape but being able to scale and
stretch<00:01:20.079> and<00:01:20.380> just<00:01:20.590> shove<00:01:20.829> things<00:01:21.040> around<00:01:21.310> and

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:21.579 
stretch and just shove things around and

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:23.910 
stretch and just shove things around and
quickly<00:01:22.119> swap<00:01:22.390> materials<00:01:22.930> yeah<00:01:23.619> you<00:01:23.799> can

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
quickly swap materials yeah you can

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.550 
quickly swap materials yeah you can
prototype<00:01:24.189> a<00:01:24.369> level<00:01:24.610> really<00:01:25.119> quickly<00:01:25.560> and

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
prototype a level really quickly and

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.350 
prototype a level really quickly and
it's<00:01:26.799> also<00:01:27.040> really<00:01:27.310> easy<00:01:27.399> to<00:01:27.670> make<00:01:27.790> changes<00:01:27.820> I

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
it's also really easy to make changes I

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.880 
it's also really easy to make changes I
did<00:01:29.079> some<00:01:29.229> things<00:01:29.439> that<00:01:29.619> you're<00:01:29.770> not<00:01:29.799> supposed

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
did some things that you're not supposed

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.109 
did some things that you're not supposed
to<00:01:30.189> do<00:01:30.280> as<00:01:30.399> a<00:01:30.430> level<00:01:30.640> designer<00:01:30.700> in<00:01:31.000> other

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
to do as a level designer in other

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.719 
to do as a level designer in other
engines<00:01:31.509> where<00:01:32.469> I've<00:01:32.979> built<00:01:33.219> the<00:01:33.310> space<00:01:33.520> and

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
engines where I've built the space and

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.670 
engines where I've built the space and
we<00:01:33.820> tested<00:01:34.119> it<00:01:34.240> and<00:01:34.329> it<00:01:34.570> being<00:01:34.810> too<00:01:34.899> large<00:01:35.079> so<00:01:35.439> I

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
we tested it and it being too large so I

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.289 
we tested it and it being too large so I
took<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:36.039> entire<00:01:36.130> level<00:01:36.520> and<00:01:36.789> I<00:01:36.850> just<00:01:36.880> scaled

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
took the entire level and I just scaled

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.359 
took the entire level and I just scaled
it<00:01:37.420> down<00:01:37.450> by<00:01:37.659> 30%<00:01:37.990> all<00:01:38.380> at<00:01:38.469> once<00:01:38.619> and<00:01:39.250> that

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
it down by 30% all at once and that

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:40.620 
it down by 30% all at once and that
worked<00:01:39.579> and<00:01:39.759> that<00:01:39.850> took<00:01:40.000> me<00:01:40.180> about<00:01:40.299> 10<00:01:40.600> minutes

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
worked and that took me about 10 minutes

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.660 
worked and that took me about 10 minutes
just<00:01:41.049> kind<00:01:41.200> of<00:01:41.289> fix<00:01:41.439> a<00:01:41.560> couple<00:01:41.740> things<00:01:41.950> I<00:01:42.189> tried

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
just kind of fix a couple things I tried

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.100 
just kind of fix a couple things I tried
to<00:01:42.700> do<00:01:42.850> that<00:01:42.939> in<00:01:43.060> any<00:01:43.149> other<00:01:43.270> engine<00:01:43.689> I<00:01:43.810> think

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
to do that in any other engine I think

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.389 
to do that in any other engine I think
the<00:01:44.380> whole<00:01:44.530> thing<00:01:44.740> would<00:01:44.890> explode<00:01:45.159> it

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
the whole thing would explode it

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:51.010 
the whole thing would explode it
wouldn't<00:01:45.640> work

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.620

it's<00:03:22.220> just<00:03:22.549> a<00:03:22.670> teaser<00:03:22.880> and<00:03:23.150> there's<00:03:23.329> a<00:03:23.420> lot<00:03:23.569> of

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
it's just a teaser and there's a lot of

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.780 
it's just a teaser and there's a lot of
work<00:03:23.810> to<00:03:23.959> do<00:03:24.109> on<00:03:24.319> the<00:03:24.410> back<00:03:24.560> end<00:03:24.859> but<00:03:25.069> right<00:03:25.609> now

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
work to do on the back end but right now

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.520 
work to do on the back end but right now
I<00:03:25.819> think<00:03:26.060> it<00:03:26.329> is<00:03:26.450> getting<00:03:26.690> to<00:03:26.989> the<00:03:27.109> point<00:03:27.290> where

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
I think it is getting to the point where

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.460 
I think it is getting to the point where
we<00:03:27.709> actually<00:03:28.000> we<00:03:29.000> set<00:03:29.299> a<00:03:29.329> visual<00:03:29.780> bar<00:03:30.019> and

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
we actually we set a visual bar and

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:38.309 
we actually we set a visual bar and
that's<00:03:30.769> all<00:03:30.950> a<00:03:30.980> possible<00:03:31.519> due<00:03:31.910> to

boskie as a gameplay programmer one of
the<00:03:43.810> most<00:03:43.959> important<00:03:44.379> things<00:03:44.530> I<00:03:44.650> do<00:03:44.709> is<00:03:45.010> called

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:45.159 
the most important things I do is called

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:48.300 
the most important things I do is called
prototyping<00:03:46.019> and<00:03:47.019> during<00:03:47.230> the<00:03:47.319> first<00:03:47.560> six

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
prototyping and during the first six

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.729 
prototyping and during the first six
months<00:03:48.400> to<00:03:48.700> a<00:03:48.819> year<00:03:48.909> of<00:03:49.269> development<00:03:49.840> we<00:03:50.590> call

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
months to a year of development we call

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.619 
months to a year of development we call
that<00:03:50.859> pre-production<00:03:51.700> and<00:03:52.150> we<00:03:52.209> tend<00:03:52.389> to<00:03:52.450> do<00:03:52.599> a

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:52.629 
that pre-production and we tend to do a

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:55.440 
that pre-production and we tend to do a
lot<00:03:52.870> of<00:03:53.099> rapid<00:03:54.099> prototyping<00:03:54.639> of<00:03:54.760> ideas<00:03:55.150> to<00:03:55.299> try

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
lot of rapid prototyping of ideas to try

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.819 
lot of rapid prototyping of ideas to try
to<00:03:55.510> get<00:03:55.689> them<00:03:55.840> into<00:03:56.019> the<00:03:56.079> game<00:03:56.260> as<00:03:56.469> fast<00:03:56.590> as

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
to get them into the game as fast as

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.160 
to get them into the game as fast as
possible<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:58.180> idea<00:03:58.450> is<00:03:58.629> that<00:03:58.659> the<00:03:59.019> more

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
possible the idea is that the more

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.809 
possible the idea is that the more
prototypes<00:03:59.439> you<00:03:59.769> do<00:03:59.920> the<00:04:00.159> more<00:04:00.280> iterations

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
prototypes you do the more iterations

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.360 
prototypes you do the more iterations
you<00:04:00.969> do<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:02.079> more<00:04:02.260> ideas<00:04:02.379> you<00:04:02.650> can<00:04:02.859> try<00:04:03.069> out<00:04:03.219> in

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
you do the more ideas you can try out in

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.679 
you do the more ideas you can try out in
the<00:04:03.430> game<00:04:03.609> and<00:04:03.819> the<00:04:03.879> better<00:04:04.030> the<00:04:04.209> game<00:04:04.329> ends<00:04:04.599> up

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:04.689 
the game and the better the game ends up

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:08.309 
the game and the better the game ends up
being<00:04:04.900> and<00:04:05.169> so<00:04:05.829> one<00:04:06.519> of<00:04:06.549> the<00:04:06.730> key<00:04:07.540> factors<00:04:07.810> in

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
being and so one of the key factors in

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.110 
being and so one of the key factors in
iterating<00:04:08.859> quickly<00:04:08.889> that<00:04:09.579> Unreal<00:04:09.939> Engine

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
iterating quickly that Unreal Engine

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.629 
iterating quickly that Unreal Engine
provides<00:04:10.419> is<00:04:10.900> called<00:04:11.139> hot<00:04:11.439> reload<00:04:11.829> what<00:04:12.489> that

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
provides is called hot reload what that

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.030 
provides is called hot reload what that
means<00:04:12.879> is<00:04:13.109> while<00:04:14.109> the<00:04:14.260> engine<00:04:14.530> is<00:04:14.620> running<00:04:14.650> the

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
means is while the engine is running the

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.370 
means is while the engine is running the
editor<00:04:15.310> is<00:04:15.459> up<00:04:15.639> it's<00:04:15.819> loaded<00:04:16.239> I<00:04:16.389> can<00:04:17.139> go<00:04:17.229> into

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
editor is up it's loaded I can go into

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.689 
editor is up it's loaded I can go into
visual<00:04:17.680> studio<00:04:18.039> here<00:04:19.769> you<00:04:20.769> know<00:04:20.889> I<00:04:20.919> can<00:04:21.250> I<00:04:21.459> can

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:21.699 
visual studio here you know I can I can

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:24.629 
visual studio here you know I can I can
type<00:04:22.449> a<00:04:22.539> bunch<00:04:22.720> of<00:04:22.810> code<00:04:22.990> or<00:04:23.020> whatever<00:04:23.490> make<00:04:24.490> my

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
type a bunch of code or whatever make my

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.010 
type a bunch of code or whatever make my
changes<00:04:25.240> and<00:04:25.680> then<00:04:27.000> go<00:04:28.000> back<00:04:28.210> here<00:04:28.690> and<00:04:28.900> then

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
changes and then go back here and then

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.719 
changes and then go back here and then
there's<00:04:29.199> this<00:04:29.349> like<00:04:29.620> nifty<00:04:30.009> compile<00:04:30.430> button

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
there's this like nifty compile button

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.689 
there's this like nifty compile button
right<00:04:30.940> at<00:04:31.060> the<00:04:31.150> top<00:04:31.360> and<00:04:31.660> you<00:04:31.720> click<00:04:31.990> that<00:04:32.229> and

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
right at the top and you click that and

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:35.010 
right at the top and you click that and
it<00:04:33.699> will<00:04:33.759> load<00:04:34.090> your<00:04:34.270> changes<00:04:34.599> into<00:04:34.780> the<00:04:34.870> game

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
it will load your changes into the game

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.900 
it will load your changes into the game
automatically<00:04:35.680> and<00:04:36.070> without<00:04:36.520> having<00:04:36.820> to

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
automatically and without having to

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.060 
automatically and without having to
pause<00:04:37.090> your<00:04:37.270> work<00:04:37.509> really<00:04:37.840> rapidly<00:04:38.349> you<00:04:38.919> can

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
pause your work really rapidly you can

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.060 
pause your work really rapidly you can
test<00:04:39.310> those<00:04:39.400> changes<00:04:39.820> out<00:04:39.940> in<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:40.180> game<00:04:41.070> find

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
test those changes out in the game find

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.350 
test those changes out in the game find
out<00:04:42.190> if<00:04:42.310> it's<00:04:42.430> cool<00:04:42.610> find<00:04:42.909> out<00:04:43.030> if<00:04:43.120> it's<00:04:43.240> not

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
out if it's cool find out if it's not

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.629 
out if it's cool find out if it's not
cool<00:04:43.630> and<00:04:44.020> go<00:04:44.349> from<00:04:44.500> there<00:04:44.710> this<00:04:45.400> feature

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
cool and go from there this feature

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:47.640 
cool and go from there this feature
specifically<00:04:46.449> is<00:04:46.570> really<00:04:46.810> good<00:04:47.020> a<00:04:47.050> lot<00:04:47.199> of<00:04:47.380> a

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
specifically is really good a lot of a

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:48.899 
specifically is really good a lot of a
lot<00:04:47.830> of<00:04:47.949> tech<00:04:48.099> I've<00:04:48.250> work<00:04:48.430> with<00:04:48.580> in<00:04:48.669> the<00:04:48.759> past

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:48.909 
lot of tech I've work with in the past

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:50.850 
lot of tech I've work with in the past
doesn't<00:04:49.360> even<00:04:49.479> have<00:04:49.690> this<00:04:49.840> at<00:04:49.990> all<00:04:50.139> and<00:04:50.380> so<00:04:50.800> you

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
doesn't even have this at all and so you

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.520 
doesn't even have this at all and so you
have<00:04:51.009> to<00:04:51.130> rebuild<00:04:51.490> the<00:04:51.759> editor<00:04:52.120> entirely<00:04:53.110> for

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
have to rebuild the editor entirely for

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.189 
have to rebuild the editor entirely for
every<00:04:53.800> change<00:04:54.009> you<00:04:54.159> make<00:04:54.250> it<00:04:54.580> can<00:04:54.729> take<00:04:55.199> 15

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
every change you make it can take 15

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:58.649 
every change you make it can take 15
minutes<00:04:56.229> 20<00:04:56.919> minutes<00:04:56.949> to<00:04:57.370> get<00:04:57.490> even<00:04:58.210> a<00:04:58.300> simple

00:04:58.649 --> 00:04:58.659 
minutes 20 minutes to get even a simple

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:00.930 
minutes 20 minutes to get even a simple
code<00:04:58.870> change<00:04:59.199> test<00:04:59.530> it<00:04:59.680> out<00:04:59.770> with<00:05:00.370> this<00:05:00.580> it's

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
code change test it out with this it's

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.540 
code change test it out with this it's
30<00:05:01.389> seconds<00:05:01.810> and<00:05:02.620> that's<00:05:02.770> a<00:05:02.860> huge<00:05:03.220> huge

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
30 seconds and that's a huge huge

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.659 
30 seconds and that's a huge huge
difference<00:05:03.759> because<00:05:04.240> you<00:05:04.360> can<00:05:04.509> iterate<00:05:05.070> 10<00:05:06.070> 15

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
difference because you can iterate 10 15

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.320 
difference because you can iterate 10 15
20<00:05:07.509> times<00:05:07.690> a<00:05:07.960> day<00:05:07.990> 30<00:05:08.530> times<00:05:08.860> a<00:05:09.039> day<00:05:09.190> as<00:05:09.400> fast<00:05:10.180> as
