tell<00:04:26.169> me<00:04:26.289> a<00:04:26.319> little<00:04:26.439> bit<00:04:26.590> about<00:04:26.770> how<00:04:27.310> you<00:04:27.370> do

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
tell me a little bit about how you do

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.179 
tell me a little bit about how you do
take<00:04:28.000> off<00:04:28.180> in<00:04:28.360> this<00:04:28.479> airplane<00:04:28.840> we<00:04:29.530> used<00:04:29.770> a

00:04:30.179 --> 00:04:30.189 
take off in this airplane we used a

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:33.029 
take off in this airplane we used a
little<00:04:30.340> bit<00:04:30.520> of<00:04:30.610> flap<00:04:30.789> yes<00:04:31.720> so<00:04:31.960> for<00:04:32.379> the<00:04:32.650> novel

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
little bit of flap yes so for the novel

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.439 
little bit of flap yes so for the novel
taking<00:04:33.370> off<00:04:33.550> we<00:04:34.120> use<00:04:34.300> flaps<00:04:34.659> 150<00:04:35.530> degrees<00:04:35.860> and

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
taking off we use flaps 150 degrees and

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:39.869 
taking off we use flaps 150 degrees and
we<00:04:37.449> use<00:04:37.990> normal<00:04:38.500> full<00:04:38.800> forward<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.460> propeller

00:04:39.869 --> 00:04:39.879 
we use normal full forward the propeller

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:44.749 
we use normal full forward the propeller
and<00:04:40.240> picture<00:04:40.750> also<00:04:41.110> just<00:04:41.979> expect<00:04:42.750> rotating<00:04:43.750> at

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 
and picture also just expect rotating at

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:48.209 
and picture also just expect rotating at
63<00:04:45.759> notes<00:04:45.939> and<00:04:46.389> so<00:04:47.259> it<00:04:47.349> depends<00:04:47.710> on<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:47.979> weight

00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:48.219 
63 notes and so it depends on the weight

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:52.760 
63 notes and so it depends on the weight
of<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:49.270> aircraft<00:04:49.389> that<00:04:50.219> it<00:04:51.219> takes<00:04:51.520> with<00:04:52.330> the

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
of the aircraft that it takes with the

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.540 
of the aircraft that it takes with the
500<00:04:53.770> feet<00:04:54.039> to<00:04:54.310> 600<00:04:55.300> feet<00:04:55.479> as<00:04:56.139> you<00:04:56.169> saw<00:04:56.560> when<00:04:57.520> we

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
500 feet to 600 feet as you saw when we

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.670 
500 feet to 600 feet as you saw when we
climbing<00:04:57.909> and<00:04:58.270> try<00:04:58.449> to<00:04:58.509> pertaining<00:04:58.990> the

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
climbing and try to pertaining the

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.430 
climbing and try to pertaining the
clientele<00:05:00.129> speed<00:05:00.729> 80<00:05:00.969> the<00:05:01.659> angle<00:05:02.050> is<00:05:02.169> quite

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
clientele speed 80 the angle is quite

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:09.529 
clientele speed 80 the angle is quite
steep<00:05:03.219> and<00:05:03.669> so<00:05:05.400> performance<00:05:06.810> will<00:05:07.810> be<00:05:08.020> perform

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 
steep and so performance will be perform

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.140 
steep and so performance will be perform
quite<00:05:10.539> good<00:05:10.810> for<00:05:11.080> the<00:05:11.139> for<00:05:11.830> the<00:05:12.009> this<00:05:12.430> type<00:05:13.120> of

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
quite good for the for the this type of

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.330 
quite good for the for the this type of
sensor<00:05:13.479> now<00:05:13.990> that's<00:05:14.229> why<00:05:14.379> we've<00:05:14.680> been<00:05:15.159> up<00:05:15.310> to

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
sensor now that's why we've been up to

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.219 
sensor now that's why we've been up to
about<00:05:15.580> 5,000<00:05:16.330> feet

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229 
about 5,000 feet

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:19.499 
about 5,000 feet
we<00:05:17.469> saw<00:05:17.680> cruisers<00:05:18.340> the<00:05:18.370> true<00:05:18.879> airspeed<00:05:19.060> is

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:19.509 
we saw cruisers the true airspeed is

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:21.749 
we saw cruisers the true airspeed is
about<00:05:19.779> a<00:05:19.810> hundred<00:05:20.409> and<00:05:20.620> eighty<00:05:20.949> knots<00:05:21.219> or<00:05:21.520> so

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 
about a hundred and eighty knots or so

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:25.110 
about a hundred and eighty knots or so
yes<00:05:22.210> and<00:05:22.629> then<00:05:22.870> we<00:05:23.020> do<00:05:23.199> the<00:05:23.379> lean<00:05:23.849> edges<00:05:24.849> lean

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
yes and then we do the lean edges lean

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.570 
yes and then we do the lean edges lean
and<00:05:25.479> we<00:05:26.759> with<00:05:27.759> consumption<00:05:28.629> about<00:05:29.529> fifty<00:05:30.370> five

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
and we with consumption about fifty five

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.430 
and we with consumption about fifty five
liters<00:05:31.150> per<00:05:31.569> hour<00:05:31.840> we<00:05:32.740> do<00:05:33.389> exactly<00:05:34.389> what<00:05:35.289> the

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
liters per hour we do exactly what the

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.230 
liters per hour we do exactly what the
paper<00:05:35.680> says<00:05:36.069> so<00:05:36.279> depthless<00:05:37.229> 40<00:05:38.229> liters<00:05:38.620> and

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
paper says so depthless 40 liters and

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.869 
paper says so depthless 40 liters and
when<00:05:40.240> the<00:05:40.449> airspeed<00:05:40.870> was<00:05:41.110> constant<00:05:41.800> it<00:05:42.069> was<00:05:42.310> 38

00:05:42.869 --> 00:05:42.879 
when the airspeed was constant it was 38

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:46.890 
when the airspeed was constant it was 38
liters<00:05:43.539> per<00:05:43.750> hour<00:05:44.699> at<00:05:45.699> 38<00:05:46.150> liters<00:05:46.509> which<00:05:46.690> is

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
liters per hour at 38 liters which is

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.159 
liters per hour at 38 liters which is
right<00:05:47.370> 110<00:05:48.370> the<00:05:48.759> right<00:05:48.940> ramp<00:05:49.180> and<00:05:49.449> yeah<00:05:49.629> it<00:05:50.020> is

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 
right 110 the right ramp and yeah it is

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:52.649 
right 110 the right ramp and yeah it is
a<00:05:50.199> little<00:05:50.409> less<00:05:50.680> than<00:05:50.969> columns<00:05:51.969> per<00:05:52.120> hour<00:05:52.270> we

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:52.659 
a little less than columns per hour we

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:57.450 
a little less than columns per hour we
were<00:05:52.779> saying<00:05:52.990> about<00:05:53.490> 172<00:05:54.490> 173<00:05:55.469> you<00:05:56.469> you<00:05:57.279> were

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
were saying about 172 173 you you were

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.260 
were saying about 172 173 you you were
you<00:05:57.699> were<00:05:57.819> correct<00:05:58.120> as<00:05:59.250> this<00:06:00.250> speed<00:06:00.879> we<00:06:01.029> have

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
you were correct as this speed we have

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.860 
you were correct as this speed we have
we<00:06:02.229> have<00:06:02.500> exactly<00:06:03.250> same<00:06:03.610> gallons<00:06:04.060> proper<00:06:04.569> per

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
we have exactly same gallons proper per

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.559 
we have exactly same gallons proper per
hour<00:06:05.020> consumption<00:06:05.770> you<00:06:06.699> think<00:06:06.969> that<00:06:07.120> landing

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:07.569 
hour consumption you think that landing

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:09.600 
hour consumption you think that landing
something<00:06:07.990> is<00:06:08.139> slick-looking<00:06:08.409> as<00:06:08.949> a<00:06:08.979> Pantera

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
something is slick-looking as a Pantera

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.730 
something is slick-looking as a Pantera
would<00:06:09.849> be<00:06:10.000> demanding<00:06:10.629> but<00:06:10.659> it<00:06:11.080> actually<00:06:11.289> lands

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
would be demanding but it actually lands

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.100 
would be demanding but it actually lands

00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:22.089 
safely be a lot slower than that it's

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:23.939 
safely be a lot slower than that it's
too<00:06:22.300> soon<00:06:22.509> to<00:06:22.569> draw<00:06:22.870> series<00:06:23.319> conclusions
