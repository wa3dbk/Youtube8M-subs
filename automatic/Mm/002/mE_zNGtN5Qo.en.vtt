that and add insult injury there were

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.259 
that and add insult injury there were
two<00:02:41.680> embryos<00:02:42.040> in<00:02:42.340> it<00:02:42.430> would<00:02:42.640> likely<00:02:42.819> meaning

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
two embryos in it would likely meaning

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.890 
two embryos in it would likely meaning
it<00:02:43.360> was<00:02:43.450> a<00:02:43.480> twin<00:02:44.280> but<00:02:45.280> what<00:02:45.519> can<00:02:45.730> you<00:02:45.760> do<00:02:45.910> so<00:02:46.450> of

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
it was a twin but what can you do so of

it was a twin but what can you do so of
course<00:02:47.079> you<00:02:47.470> know<00:02:47.879> reasonable<00:02:48.879> thinking<00:02:49.239> I

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
course you know reasonable thinking I

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.860 
course you know reasonable thinking I
should<00:02:50.079> put<00:02:50.200> a<00:02:50.230> basking<00:02:50.560> area<00:02:50.680> in<00:02:50.859> here<00:02:51.010> nope

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
should put a basking area in here nope

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.170 
should put a basking area in here nope
didn't<00:02:52.870> do<00:02:52.930> that<00:02:53.049> and<00:02:53.579> on<00:02:54.579> the<00:02:54.790> morning<00:02:54.970> of<00:02:55.120> the

about a week after that I put the

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.509 
about a week after that I put the
nesting<00:03:04.690> area<00:03:04.959> in<00:03:05.019> there<00:03:05.260> that<00:03:05.680> was<00:03:05.859> more<00:03:06.220> pain

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
nesting area in there that was more pain

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:07.949 
nesting area in there that was more pain
in<00:03:06.549> the<00:03:06.730> ass<00:03:06.819> than<00:03:07.090> anything<00:03:07.269> but<00:03:07.660> what<00:03:07.840> can

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
in the ass than anything but what can

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.949 
in the ass than anything but what can
you<00:03:08.049> do<00:03:08.170> it's<00:03:08.769> in<00:03:08.980> there<00:03:09.129> now<00:03:09.250> and<00:03:09.540> as<00:03:10.540> I<00:03:10.720> said

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
you do it's in there now and as I said

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.569 
you do it's in there now and as I said
she's<00:03:11.200> still<00:03:11.500> small<00:03:11.799> she's<00:03:12.069> three<00:03:12.280> and<00:03:12.400> a<00:03:12.430> half

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
she's still small she's three and a half

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.910 
she's still small she's three and a half
inches<00:03:13.000> and<00:03:13.569> that's<00:03:14.019> that's<00:03:14.170> pretty<00:03:14.500> small<00:03:14.709> to

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
inches and that's that's pretty small to

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.949 
inches and that's that's pretty small to
shove<00:03:15.250> you<00:03:15.430> know<00:03:15.489> five<00:03:15.790> one-inch<00:03:16.269> eggs<00:03:16.540> into

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
shove you know five one-inch eggs into

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.120 
shove you know five one-inch eggs into
her<00:03:17.049> and<00:03:17.669> so<00:03:18.669> if<00:03:18.819> we<00:03:18.940> go<00:03:19.090> over<00:03:19.269> here<00:03:19.950> you'll<00:03:20.950> see

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
her and so if we go over here you'll see

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.280 
her and so if we go over here you'll see
it<00:03:21.220> cooler<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:22.690> I'll<00:03:22.930> forgive<00:03:23.139> the

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
it cooler and I'll forgive the

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.240 
it cooler and I'll forgive the
travel-time

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.640 

the<00:03:27.250> cooler<00:03:27.690> that<00:03:28.690> would<00:03:29.019> be<00:03:29.139> the<00:03:29.290> incubator

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
the cooler that would be the incubator

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.800 
the cooler that would be the incubator
now<00:03:29.799> wouldn't<00:03:30.010> it<00:03:31.290> so<00:03:32.290> since<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.400> 14th<00:03:33.819> I<00:03:34.090> have

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
now wouldn't it so since the 14th I have

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:42.979 
now wouldn't it so since the 14th I have
had<00:03:36.630> four<00:03:37.980> spotted<00:03:38.980> eggs<00:03:39.160> incubating<00:03:40.380> now<00:03:41.380> I

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
had four spotted eggs incubating now I

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.759 
had four spotted eggs incubating now I
am<00:03:43.989> guesstimating<00:03:44.919> that<00:03:45.519> they<00:03:45.730> should<00:03:46.000> hatch

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
am guesstimating that they should hatch

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:53.490 
am guesstimating that they should hatch
around<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:49.440> what<00:03:50.440> is<00:03:50.560> it<00:03:51.239> the<00:03:52.239> fifth<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:53.019> the

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
around the what is it the fifth to the

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.830 
around the what is it the fifth to the
14th<00:03:54.489> of<00:03:54.760> February<00:03:56.639> and<00:03:57.639> I<00:03:58.419> was<00:03:58.660> actually

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
14th of February and I was actually

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.729 
14th of February and I was actually
pretty<00:03:59.109> excited<00:03:59.560> about<00:03:59.620> that<00:03:59.769> because<00:04:01.739> they

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
pretty excited about that because they

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.839 
pretty excited about that because they
were<00:04:02.799> all<00:04:03.220> laid<00:04:03.459> in<00:04:03.579> the<00:04:03.669> water<00:04:04.410> so<00:04:05.760> you<00:04:06.760> know

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
were all laid in the water so you know

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.909 
were all laid in the water so you know
generally<00:04:07.359> speaking<00:04:07.780> eggs<00:04:08.440> laid<00:04:08.739> in<00:04:08.829> the

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
generally speaking eggs laid in the

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:11.220 
generally speaking eggs laid in the
water<00:04:09.069> that<00:04:09.400> good<00:04:09.940> but<00:04:10.239> all<00:04:10.419> four<00:04:10.780> banded

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
water that good but all four banded

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.830 
water that good but all four banded
within<00:04:11.470> the<00:04:11.560> first<00:04:11.769> day<00:04:11.980> I<00:04:12.220> have<00:04:13.180> candled<00:04:13.690> them

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
within the first day I have candled them

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.050 
within the first day I have candled them
and<00:04:14.230> there<00:04:14.769> are<00:04:14.980> blood<00:04:15.250> vessels<00:04:15.280> in<00:04:15.790> a<00:04:15.849> dark

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
and there are blood vessels in a dark

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.969 
and there are blood vessels in a dark
mass<00:04:16.269> growing<00:04:16.570> in<00:04:16.660> each<00:04:16.799> so<00:04:17.799> that's
