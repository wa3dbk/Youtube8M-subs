00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.230 
a beef towel and you see this I've got
from<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.690> supermarket<00:00:13.110> it's<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:14.160> they<00:00:14.790> just<00:00:15.000> give

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
from a supermarket it's a they just give

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.200 
from a supermarket it's a they just give
it<00:00:15.360> up<00:00:15.480> for<00:00:15.780> free<00:00:16.080> so<00:00:16.619> every<00:00:17.430> day<00:00:17.580> they<00:00:17.760> cut

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
it up for free so every day they cut

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.560 
it up for free so every day they cut
meat<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.350> they<00:00:19.770> destroy<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.369> fat<00:00:20.580> out<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:21.359> I

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
meat and they destroy the fat out so I

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.800 
meat and they destroy the fat out so I
thought<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.769> will<00:00:23.189> rather<00:00:23.760> be<00:00:24.060> collect<00:00:24.480> all<00:00:24.660> the

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
thought I will rather be collect all the

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.300 
thought I will rather be collect all the
fats<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.820> then<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:27.510> will<00:00:28.109> use<00:00:28.349> for<00:00:28.470> my<00:00:28.949> soap

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
here I got to tell her was I cut it in a

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.680 
here I got to tell her was I cut it in a
small<00:00:42.480> piece<00:00:43.110> if<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.950> see<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:45.090> small<00:00:45.420> piece

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
small piece if you see you a small piece

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.639 
small piece if you see you a small piece
I<00:00:47.059> use<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.360> lot<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.770> technique<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:51.199> take<00:00:52.199> out<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
I use a lot of technique to take out the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.500 
I use a lot of technique to take out the
tallow<00:00:52.980> from<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.670> fat<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.300> use<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> grinder<00:00:56.510> food

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
tallow from the fat I use a grinder food

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.459 
tallow from the fat I use a grinder food
grinder<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.469> even<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.100> meat<00:00:59.280> grinder<00:01:00.109> but<00:01:01.109> I

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
grinder and even the meat grinder but I

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.600 
grinder and even the meat grinder but I
don't<00:01:01.829> find<00:01:02.280> very<00:01:03.080> convenient<00:01:04.080> because<00:01:04.610> if

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
don't find very convenient because if

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
don't find very convenient because if
you<00:01:06.000> grind<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.540> up<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.869> meat<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.790> have<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:09.060> small

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
you grind it up the meat it have a small

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.620 
you grind it up the meat it have a small
pieces<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.799> when<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.250> boiled<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.060> then

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
pieces and when you boiled it and then

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.539 
pieces and when you boiled it and then
after<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.229> boiled<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.799> when<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.100> get<00:01:14.369> a

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
after you boiled it when you get a

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.570 
after you boiled it when you get a
strain<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.420> fat<00:01:16.290> out<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.530> it

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
strain the fat out of it

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.840 
strain the fat out of it
even<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.180> small<00:01:18.479> pieces<00:01:19.049> it's<00:01:19.590> still<00:01:20.070> in<00:01:20.460> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
even the small pieces it's still in the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.420 
even the small pieces it's still in the
with<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.960> fat<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:25.189> did<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.220> lot<00:01:26.400> of

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
with the fat so I did a lot of

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.280 
with the fat so I did a lot of
experiment<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:29.150> figured<00:01:30.150> out<00:01:30.299> how<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.810> do

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
experiment and I figured out how to do

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.340 
experiment and I figured out how to do
and<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.790> easiest<00:01:33.180> way<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.479> do<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.110> and

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
and this is the easiest way to do it and

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.890 
and this is the easiest way to do it and
I<00:01:34.740> cut<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.930> fat<00:01:36.930> in<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.530> small<00:01:37.939> piece<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.450> with

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
I cut the fat in a small piece and with

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.289 
I cut the fat in a small piece and with
water<00:01:40.200> I'm<00:01:40.619> going<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:40.979> boiled<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.579> for<00:01:43.250> maybe<00:01:44.299> 4

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
water I'm going to boiled it for maybe 4

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:55.850 
water I'm going to boiled it for maybe 4
hours<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.170> medium<00:01:48.740> heat<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:52.909> once<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:55.320> fat

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
hours in a medium heat and once the fat

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.550 
hours in a medium heat and once the fat
gets<00:01:57.200> tender<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.710> it's<00:01:58.979> well<00:01:59.610> cooked<00:02:00.119> and

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
gets tender and it's well cooked and

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.859 
gets tender and it's well cooked and
then<00:02:01.560> I'm<00:02:01.860> going<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.369> squeeze<00:02:03.090> out<00:02:03.450> all<00:02:03.750> the

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
then I'm going to squeeze out all the

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.050 
then I'm going to squeeze out all the
fat<00:02:04.860> from<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.180> beef<00:02:06.540> so<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:08.099> my<00:02:08.459> next<00:02:08.489> video

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
fat from the beef so in my next video

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.780 
fat from the beef so in my next video

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
I'm going to show you how to strain and

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.550 
I'm going to show you how to strain and
remove

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560
