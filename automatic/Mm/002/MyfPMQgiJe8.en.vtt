the road the higher the air pressure in
your<00:00:46.559> tire<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.219> less<00:00:47.940> rolling<00:00:48.239> resistance

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
your tire the less rolling resistance

the<00:01:01.410> more<00:01:01.620> rolling<00:01:01.980> resistance<00:01:02.129> but<00:01:02.910> it's

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
the more rolling resistance but it's

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.219 
the more rolling resistance but it's
going<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.270> make<00:01:03.420> your<00:01:03.570> ride<00:01:03.750> much<00:01:04.019> more

way a little bit thicker tire is

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.510 
way a little bit thicker tire is
actually<00:01:15.299> going<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.869> make<00:01:16.530> your<00:01:16.740> ride<00:01:17.009> much

actually going to make your ride much
more<00:01:17.880> comfortable<00:01:19.340> if<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.460> have<00:01:20.610> too<00:01:20.880> low<00:01:21.060> of

more comfortable if you have too low of
tire<00:01:21.420> pressure<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.229> get<00:01:22.380> on<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.650> road

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
tire pressure and you get on the road

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.679 
tire pressure and you get on the road
and<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.520> hit<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.700> big<00:01:23.909> bump<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.390> get<00:01:24.540> what's

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
and you hit a big bump you get what's

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.929 
and you hit a big bump you get what's
called<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.930> snake<00:01:25.200> bite<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.710> that's<00:01:26.580> where

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
called a snake bite and that's where

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.749 
called a snake bite and that's where
your<00:01:27.270> your<00:01:27.900> tire<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.470> smashed<00:01:29.189> against<00:01:29.610> your

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
your your tire is smashed against your

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.460 
your your tire is smashed against your
rim<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.180> your<00:01:30.270> rim<00:01:30.479> punctures<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.229> little

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
rim and your rim punctures to little

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.690 
rim and your rim punctures to little
holes<00:01:31.619> into<00:01:32.460> your<00:01:32.579> tube<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.150> thus<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.439> know

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
holes into your tube and thus you know

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.060 
holes into your tube and thus you know
stranding<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.970> side<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.360> road<00:01:37.070> if

stranding on the side of the road if

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.590 
stranding on the side of the road if
you're<00:01:38.220> not<00:01:38.340> checking<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.850> every<00:01:39.150> ride<00:01:39.360> you

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
you're not checking it every ride you

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.880 
you're not checking it every ride you
should<00:01:39.750> at<00:01:39.840> least<00:01:39.869> check<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.409> once<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.860> week

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
should at least check it once a week

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.310 
should at least check it once a week
just<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.400> make<00:01:41.610> sure<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.150> you've<00:01:42.689> got<00:01:42.720> as

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
just to make sure that you've got as

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.600 
just to make sure that you've got as
much<00:01:44.009> tire<00:01:44.399> pressure<00:01:44.729> there<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.810> can<00:01:46.610> before

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
much tire pressure there you can before

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.980 
much tire pressure there you can before
you<00:01:47.729> inflate<00:01:48.090> your<00:01:48.149> tires<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.720> should<00:01:48.869> look

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
you inflate your tires you should look

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.370 
you inflate your tires you should look
for<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.290> max<00:01:49.560> capacity<00:01:50.149> so<00:01:51.149> this<00:01:51.810> one<00:01:52.049> it's

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
for this max capacity so this one it's

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.639 
for this max capacity so this one it's
written<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.799> side<00:01:53.100> wall<00:01:53.369> doesn't<00:01:54.060> plate

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
written on the side wall doesn't plate

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.980 
written on the side wall doesn't plate
240<00:01:55.649> 265<00:01:56.340> pounds<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.390> if<00:01:57.600> you're<00:01:57.750> going<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.930> be

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
240 265 pounds so if you're going to be

leave a lot of mess or residue just roll

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.280 
leave a lot of mess or residue just roll
your<00:02:44.140> chain<00:02:44.410> backwards<00:02:45.069> and<00:02:45.660> just<00:02:46.660> do<00:02:46.810> a<00:02:46.840> slow

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
your chain backwards and just do a slow

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.009 
your chain backwards and just do a slow
drip<00:02:47.709> into<00:02:47.980> it<00:02:48.340> keep<00:02:49.060> an<00:02:49.209> eye<00:02:49.329> on<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.780> chain

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
drip into it keep an eye on the chain

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.360 
drip into it keep an eye on the chain
and<00:02:50.049> once<00:02:50.410> you<00:02:50.590> have<00:02:50.950> a<00:02:50.980> nice<00:02:51.160> even<00:02:51.670> coat<00:02:51.940> then

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
and once you have a nice even coat then

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.020 
and once you have a nice even coat then
you<00:02:54.370> can<00:02:54.549> stop<00:02:54.880> and<00:02:55.530> then<00:02:56.530> if<00:02:57.040> you<00:02:57.610> have<00:02:57.790> too

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
you can stop and then if you have too

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.400 
you can stop and then if you have too
much<00:02:58.239> on<00:02:58.510> there<00:02:58.660> or<00:02:58.810> your<00:02:58.930> chains<00:02:59.170> really

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
much on there or your chains really

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.910 
much on there or your chains really
dirty<00:02:59.799> it's<00:03:00.310> a<00:03:00.430> good<00:03:00.610> idea<00:03:00.940> to<00:03:01.540> actually<00:03:02.140> clean

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
dirty it's a good idea to actually clean

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.970 
dirty it's a good idea to actually clean
the<00:03:03.130> excess<00:03:03.549> off<00:03:03.880> and<00:03:04.680> then<00:03:05.680> you<00:03:05.860> should

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
the excess off and then you should

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.470 
the excess off and then you should
probably<00:03:06.130> check<00:03:06.370> that<00:03:06.610> about<00:03:06.849> once<00:03:07.090> a<00:03:07.269> week

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
probably check that about once a week

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.259 
probably check that about once a week
and<00:03:07.720> if<00:03:08.140> you<00:03:08.230> hear<00:03:08.410> any<00:03:08.590> like<00:03:09.430> dry<00:03:09.850> metal

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
and if you hear any like dry metal

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.509 
and if you hear any like dry metal
squeaking<00:03:10.630> then<00:03:11.049> that<00:03:11.859> just<00:03:12.040> means<00:03:12.280> that

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
squeaking then that just means that

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:23.640 
squeaking then that just means that
you're<00:03:12.819> wearing<00:03:13.239> metal<00:03:13.750> on<00:03:13.989> metal

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.709
