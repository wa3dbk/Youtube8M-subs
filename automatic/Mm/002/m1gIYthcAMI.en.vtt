00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.299
 it vertically 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:15.290
 fishing for zander 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:15.290
 verticals on zander 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.800
 blue works to make it an emoji 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.800
 I use a lot of kleenex to get in new ones 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.970
 around but they really fall to most 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.800
 this one 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:40.160
 this one goes more just beach even though one 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.160
 mess of a more try 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.540
 you use logical in one 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.920
 14 to 20 grams as light as possible 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.380
 finally but you think then you are finished 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.410
 how deep you are deep skin or how much the 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:59.120
 currents allow more currents to move on 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.120
 and could catch even deeper 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:09.950
 for a moment I watched this I keep it off this way 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:17.510
 and so I got him as he is 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.510
 I I'll do another 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.700
 that 's what a child does that is 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.729
 teach okay i also need one 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.770
 and also set angle with it so in such 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:36.360
 15 meters away from 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:39.330
 bottom hook and yes for you drock 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.510
 swimming fish especially for 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.510
 boss 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.510
 this check that are also always around 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.490
 big or very small sorry 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:54.720
 a small seating area at the bottom comes around one 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.540
 what bigger shit you actually when we're on 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.939
 this sorry 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.290
 or one with a bit of glitter 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:07.490
 of course 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:11.480
 color this can also be very good 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.400
 this one is still a dozen of pads and 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.700
 has a hollow 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.390
 hear thing under the hollow in his belly 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:26.840
 then you can put on an extra layer 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:31.010
 because you usually go an extra way 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:38.209
 village also an extra way they look then 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:42.640
 assemble our ok look through you approximately 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.640
 just end here like this 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:53.490
 here through like this 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.490
 the desk 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.670
 neatly pulled cents but you can 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.760
 of course always packed yes tonight 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.440
 that's why I want to be there too 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.380
 always one 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.880
 a single with a small region and that 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.310
 then comes hanging here at the bottom 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.550
 or on hol where to fill in the 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.890
 side here is in sermons and I have 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.580
 no example someone there 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.580
 national 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:28.090
 under direct has my last and on 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.100
 the soda will therefore be wasted with kate 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.430
 comes in such a way and then sits 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:36.940
 there is a toll to build in there is then 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.190
 and as much as $ 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.220
 this these lusters really on the bottom and me 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.800
 let you walk on a soil bursts 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.770
 have you you have a very 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:51.040
 better to be at school at 10 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.570
 centimeter 15 centimeter 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.570
 wait a few seconds and let yourself be 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.760
 means and the measure we often find 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.030
 place under time that you put it again 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.910
 what's up and you can play a match there 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:07.330
 by a little harder second up thick 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:10.390
 what slower in the winter in order 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.660
 then the fish on also wear so to do 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:18.790
 you do not get up but you do it long 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:23.680
 slow and somewhat quiet who said more 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:25.990
 up and we lowered to a poop 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.360
 lower it so that it is a bit of a 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.570
 dust cloud creates a fit there again 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.570
 on 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.160
 [Music] 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.720
 check you don't have to be a big shit either 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.320
 horn can also be someone small shetjes 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:49.750
 use in the little ones 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:52.690
 or cell with the to a tricity 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.490
 and my twitter stand or this and zuko 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.320
 korea stubborn 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:00.670
 heaven see through or jim through 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:03.670
 disease is transparent with a huge 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:05.080
 faster street makes you sick if there is already 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.890
 are actually in the turbulence 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:11.790
 water itself is good then I work well 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.790
 keep runners card 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:20.250
 even in winter when it is a little colder 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:24.630
 and then you actually want something because 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:26.970
 who is back because that just moves it 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.250
 less well 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:33.470
 so in the summer then it becomes material 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:41.780
 assignments and then it is flexible 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:41.780
 weighing more is the interesting form of fish 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:50.610
 so very simple at the bottom 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:54.150
 bob until he is on the one 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:56.270
 her a friend can just be 13 meters deep 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:01.740
 are even deeper 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:03.090
 and it should be at 18 grams maybe 20 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.160
 have grams 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.670
 I also see it as our water down 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.670
 is going to flow 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:13.020
 let that rickety is this actually just 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:14.670
 a little too light but it is quiet true 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.010
 god shallow 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:18.210
 and a facial desk in the summer 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.010
 shallow 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:23.460
 and then you find the fish or something 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:25.380
 shallow and then you have less meat 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:28.400
 needed and then the fish can go even better 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.400
 suck inside
