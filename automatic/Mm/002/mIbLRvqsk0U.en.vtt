00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.410
 the stereotype the truth is that I do not know 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.630
 adjust to reality we are not crazy 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.270
 or like there watching numbers and 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.460
 painting neurons of the crystals 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.170
 the quality in the mathematics degree the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.900
 truth is that it is good very good or 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.910
 excellent even because 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.830
 let's say the small number of students 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.829
 equal not so much less in the courses 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.059
 but if today he makes the 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.940
 closeness of the teachers if you have 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.170
 Some doubt if you have any problem 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.920
 anything is very easy to 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:47.550
 solve and on the other hand then we have 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.290
 very good very good teachers and I think 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.949
 that can help a lot when it comes to 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.739
 learn from a person who controls very 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.210
 well the very simple stuff basically 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.100
 I believe that right now we are among those who 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.629
 more reality we have in fact been there 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.010
 a study that is published now 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.290
 same that is the second race with 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.780
 less unemployment of Spain then in that 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.150
 meaning it gives you a bit of security 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.040
 civil of the orange for the future of 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.130
 you say then where to start and the 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.869
 things are very wrong now and you say I'm not going 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.340
 to place in life but it seems that the 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.150
 mathematicians like we have the field very 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.310
 open so we can have more options 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.560
 that a mathematician I think he does not have 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.380
 the mind focused on something in particular 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.299
 but they teach us to open our minds and 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.480
 then that you can focus on any 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.000
 another field 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.530
 and one of the examples now that more 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.310
 would highlight would be security in 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.080
 internet at the time of the keys of 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:47.900
 our personal data all these 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:50.920
 they are secretly encrypted through 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.920
