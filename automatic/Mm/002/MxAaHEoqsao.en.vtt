top and I'm going to push it in and then
I'm<00:02:16.769> going<00:02:16.889> to<00:02:16.919> use<00:02:17.069> a<00:02:17.099> very<00:02:17.430> thin

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
I'm going to use a very thin

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.750 
I'm going to use a very thin
at<00:02:18.299> knife<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.750> starting<00:02:19.440> in<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.560> middle<00:02:19.760> I'm

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
at knife and starting in the middle I'm

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.839 
at knife and starting in the middle I'm
going<00:02:21.209> to<00:02:21.269> cut<00:02:21.659> down<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.310> then<00:02:23.310> work<00:02:23.549> toward

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
going to cut down and then work toward

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.289 
going to cut down and then work toward
the<00:02:23.970> edge<00:02:24.830> so<00:02:25.830> I<00:02:25.860> just<00:02:26.159> I<00:02:26.430> kept<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:26.879> flat

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
the edge so I just I kept that flat

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.610 
the edge so I just I kept that flat
right<00:02:27.810> on<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.049> top<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.530> mold<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:30.620> from

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
right on the top of the mold and from

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.740 
right on the top of the mold and from
there<00:02:31.830> you<00:02:32.370> can<00:02:32.549> just<00:02:32.700> use<00:02:32.849> a<00:02:32.879> little<00:02:33.120> pin<00:02:33.510> or<00:02:33.720> a

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
there you can just use a little pin or a

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.869 
there you can just use a little pin or a
needle<00:02:33.810> tool<00:02:34.290> or<00:02:34.980> you<00:02:35.310> can<00:02:35.459> just<00:02:35.610> pop<00:02:35.849> that

needle tool or you can just pop that

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.500 
needle tool or you can just pop that
right<00:02:36.390> out<00:02:36.599> and<00:02:36.840> then<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.530> can<00:02:37.799> see<00:02:38.269> how<00:02:39.269> easy

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
right out and then you can see how easy

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.170
