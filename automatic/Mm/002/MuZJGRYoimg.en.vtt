00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
in a blue lake with foil so do is um the

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.099 
in a blue lake with foil so do is um the
grand<00:00:24.029> out<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:25.189> syrup<00:00:26.189> so<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:27.180> just<00:00:27.840> use<00:00:28.080> some

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
grand out of syrup so I just use some

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.310 
grand out of syrup so I just use some
apricot<00:00:28.859> preserves<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:30.660> just<00:00:30.840> acted<00:00:31.230> as

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
apricot preserves and that just acted as

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.360 
apricot preserves and that just acted as
my<00:00:31.700> maple<00:00:32.700> syrup<00:00:33.270> it's<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.750> lot<00:00:33.840> healthier<00:00:34.370> so

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
my maple syrup it's a lot healthier so

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.619 
my maple syrup it's a lot healthier so
