money<00:00:21.570> on<00:00:21.660> gym<00:00:22.140> memberships<00:00:22.680> but<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.279> feel<00:00:23.519> like

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
money on gym memberships but I feel like

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.250 
money on gym memberships but I feel like
it<00:00:23.880> didn't<00:00:24.210> do<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.600> thing

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
it didn't do a thing

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.929 
it didn't do a thing
basically<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.890> wasted<00:00:26.400> tons<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.730> money<00:00:26.849> on

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
basically I wasted tons of money on

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.460 
basically I wasted tons of money on
supplements<00:00:27.240> too<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.080> got<00:00:28.230> me<00:00:28.349> nowhere

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
supplements too and it got me nowhere

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.560 
supplements too and it got me nowhere
all<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.220> hard<00:00:29.460> work<00:00:29.519> for<00:00:29.820> nothing<00:00:29.849> I<00:00:30.330> mean

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
all this hard work for nothing I mean

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.209 
all this hard work for nothing I mean
although<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:30.900> managed<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.529> lose<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.800> little<00:00:32.099> bit

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
although I managed to lose a little bit

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.010 
although I managed to lose a little bit
of<00:00:32.309> weight<00:00:32.579> whatever<00:00:33.180> weight<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.420> lost<00:00:33.690> would

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
of weight whatever weight I lost would

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.200 
of weight whatever weight I lost would
come<00:00:34.200> back<00:00:34.380> like<00:00:34.710> right<00:00:35.040> away<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.969> was<00:00:36.120> just

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
come back like right away so it was just

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.700 
come back like right away so it was just
a<00:00:36.360> wasted<00:00:36.719> effort<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.350> figured<00:00:37.680> that

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
a wasted effort so I figured that

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.590 
a wasted effort so I figured that
there's<00:00:38.040> got<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.340> be<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.460> better<00:00:38.760> way<00:00:39.030> than<00:00:39.390> you

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
there's got to be a better way than you

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.209 
there's got to be a better way than you
know<00:00:39.690> spending<00:00:40.079> money<00:00:40.230> on<00:00:40.320> bad<00:00:40.620> food<00:00:40.890> and

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
know spending money on bad food and

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.950 
know spending money on bad food and
wasting<00:00:41.700> my<00:00:41.790> time<00:00:41.969> at<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.239> gym<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.570> started

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
wasting my time at the gym I started

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.180 
wasting my time at the gym I started
looking<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.410> internet<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.010> came

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
looking on the internet and I came

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.889 
looking on the internet and I came
across<00:00:44.430> at<00:00:44.730> least<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:45.180> dozen<00:00:45.420> weight<00:00:45.750> loss

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
across at least a dozen weight loss

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.020 
across at least a dozen weight loss
products<00:00:46.410> they<00:00:46.710> all<00:00:46.860> promised<00:00:47.309> miracles<00:00:47.820> and

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
products they all promised miracles and

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.670 
products they all promised miracles and
they<00:00:48.270> all<00:00:48.420> kind<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.020> made<00:00:49.200> me<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.350> little<00:00:49.469> bit

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
they all kind of made me a little bit

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.470 
they all kind of made me a little bit
skeptical<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.399> be<00:00:50.489> honest<00:00:50.789> there<00:00:51.270> was<00:00:51.360> only

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
skeptical to be honest there was only

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.910 
skeptical to be honest there was only
one<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.809> really<00:00:51.930> looked<00:00:52.199> promising<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.800> me

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
one that really looked promising to me

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.439 
one that really looked promising to me
called<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.370> cruise<00:00:53.640> control<00:00:54.059> diet<00:00:54.210> I

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
called the cruise control diet I

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.660 
called the cruise control diet I
immediately<00:00:54.660> checked<00:00:54.989> like<00:00:55.590> 20<00:00:56.010> reviews<00:00:56.399> and

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
immediately checked like 20 reviews and

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.549 
immediately checked like 20 reviews and
at<00:00:56.760> least<00:00:56.940> 18<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.539> them<00:00:57.660> were<00:00:57.780> positive<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.530> I

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
at least 18 of them were positive so I

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.439 
at least 18 of them were positive so I
figured<00:00:59.010> like<00:00:59.280> with<00:00:59.609> odds<00:00:59.850> like<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.120> it's

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
figured like with odds like that it's

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.420 
figured like with odds like that it's
probably<00:01:00.930> gonna<00:01:01.350> work<00:01:01.590> what<00:01:02.039> finally

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
probably gonna work what finally

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.619 
probably gonna work what finally
convinced<00:01:02.820> me<00:01:02.940> was<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.390> cruise<00:01:03.600> control

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
convinced me was that the cruise control

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.719 
convinced me was that the cruise control
diet<00:01:03.989> comes<00:01:04.409> with<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> 60-day<00:01:05.159> money-back

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
diet comes with a 60-day money-back

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.789 
diet comes with a 60-day money-back
guarantee<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.750> just<00:01:07.140> kind<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.380> figured<00:01:07.650> you

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
guarantee so I just kind of figured you

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.289 
guarantee so I just kind of figured you
know<00:01:07.890> like<00:01:08.100> either<00:01:08.520> I'll<00:01:08.790> love<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.090> or<00:01:09.210> I'll

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
know like either I'll love it or I'll

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.969 
know like either I'll love it or I'll
hate<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.510> if<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:09.930> hate<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.320> get<00:01:10.470> my<00:01:10.590> money<00:01:10.770> back

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
hate it if I hate it I get my money back

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.460 
hate it if I hate it I get my money back
so<00:01:11.310> win-win<00:01:11.939> right<00:01:12.360> might<00:01:12.570> as<00:01:12.689> well<00:01:12.810> try<00:01:13.080> so

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
so win-win right might as well try so

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.050
