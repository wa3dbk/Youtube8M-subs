00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello today we will talk about 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.710
 the phone 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:11.700
 meizu m1 laptop i got it as a gift 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:15.330
 for my husband's birthday 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.779
 Many thanks to him for saying that 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.020
 I am delighted with this phone now 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.810
 I want to tell you about his video 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.029
 There are such features that I do not 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.310
 Met in other phones and not 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.470
 the seller and not faced with all 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.480
 models that exist in the world will be 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.210
 better to say that in this video I 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.070
 I will talk about some points that I 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.129
 I think 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:44.730
 the virtues of this phone and why 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.579
 it is worth buying, so we will not start 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.010
 you show the box there all that 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.210
 attached to this phone on the internet 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.030
 including on youtube quite similar 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.050
 commercials where shops and arrange 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.430
 unpacking 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.600
 tell the main characteristics 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.420
 this phone i will just 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.409
 talks about those things that I 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.229
 It seems to be super cool 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.970
 still a small note on my phone 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:18.280
 maybe you can see maybe not pasted 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.890
 such a deshmanskaya film 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.140
 she's not even a little on this one 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.470
 I will replace her phone soon 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.509
 or maybe not soon so in general 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.440
 The first advantage of this phone 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:35.050
 this is his price if you compare all 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:38.380
 devices and fold parameters 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.420
 price-quality roughly speaking, this one will be 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.210
 the most winning option 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.200
 he went on sale just a few 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.020
 weeks ago 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.210
 Well, at the moment it's probably 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.670
 the last word of technology again, I will say 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.500
 what's next in this price range 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.409
 The point I want to mention is 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.100
 5 May it given phone size crane in 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:03.310
 inches very big very comfortable i am up 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.740
 this went with a small iPhone 3g 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.860
 I felt the beauty of a huge screen 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:13.090
 I can surf the Internet 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:16.239
 in all there I need applications and all 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.569
 you can see everything is convenient the next moment is this 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.319
 that this phone is very good 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.900
 battery 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:27.940
 She holds a charge well and now we 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.769
 we can look at the characteristics 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.570
 We look at the screen indicator like me 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.980
 explained that this is the surest 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.019
 figure from being able to understand 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.420
 as it's still cool battery 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:41.140
 in the phone and so we see that in work 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.120
 phone 2 hours 40 minutes and we still have 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.860
 52 percent charge left 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.660
 speaking from the point of view 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.299
 user then with active 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.790
 using the phone we are missing 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:54.220
 charge for 2 days 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.500
 the next characteristic which is also 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.769
 I really like this phone 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.890
 very light and given its size it 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:05.590
 it certainly makes me happy 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:09.099
 like so this is what the phone is on 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.590
 android rather it has a shell android 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:14.890
 so called fly me 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.660
 This phone does not have a two-step 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.959
 menu as usual android 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.330
 he has only one desktop 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.489
 myself installing such widgets and 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.790
 number of desktop pages can 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.489
 be 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.680
 probably endless that I still very 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.769
 like well such a girly thing this 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.660
 that the phone has personalization i 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.760
 I just set up the theme now 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.870
 This directory here are free 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.540
 Topics 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.000
 they are constantly updated this is mine 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.310
 personalization personalization page 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.680
 and here you can see where this topic is ticked 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.040
 Now I have applied and the rest I 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.769
 just downloaded the default here 1 theme 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.610
 I also like the fact that there is 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:04:00.010
 home button just like the iPhone here 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.920
 seriously from my iphone 3g i was 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.500
 it is very easy to transfer to this phone 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.079
 everything is available everything is clear not needed 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.780
 there bother a very important point about 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:13.450
 which I wanted to say is that 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.880
 This phone in the center is such 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.060
 here 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:22.120
 Well, you can see it and when I look through it 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:25.840
 what remains of it. You can 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.900
 hold and she moves you can her 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.430
 install anywhere on the screen 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:34.479
 it is convenient for you when it is convenient for me 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:36.190
 installed about here and so 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:39.250
 allows you to make this button 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:43.410
 first this button is back 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:45.630
 for example, when I enter some jungle 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.370
 let's go drawing 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.460
 let's go to some drawing yet open 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.490
 drawing and here you see 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.789
 no back button 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.700
 that is, I can't get out of this menu with 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:02.229
 using this button, I go out 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:05.200
 the previous menu pressed again and 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:08.500
 went back a step again and pressed 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.120
 completely application curtailed where 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.240
 are all running 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:17.830
 zhenya right here you can all of them 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:19.870
 look through to flip through 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.729
 between applications running 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.930
 it is not necessary to fold each time 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:29.650
 applications water here we drew and 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:31.840
 button home turned and then opened and 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.760
 again went somewhere so do not 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.130
 sure all you need is 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.979
 put your finger in and around the point 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.139
 start flipping I press the button 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:43.539
 home we go back home 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:46.150
 the page itself is on top 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:48.669
 usual springboard if you use 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:53.050
 phone with one hand is uncomfortable every 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:56.110
 reach up and down again 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.630
 to collapse it all really 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.690
 the phone understands you even when you 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:04.330
 just swipe in the middle of the screen 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:06.820
 finger down he opens this gesture 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.490
 device and closing in the same way then 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:11.169
 there is no need to go anywhere up to stretch 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.270
 turning off the screen is also not necessary 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:15.910
 stretch buttons which is at the top 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:18.190
 which extinguishes the screen so you can just 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.960
 hold the button home and the phone will understand 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.940
 need to turn off the screen 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.210
 one more function which is crazy to me 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.320
 like it very practical you can 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:30.310
 activate 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:31.720
 screen just swiping by not active 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.360
 Ukraine finger up 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.250
 I really like this feature case 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.139
 if you only need to look 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.820
 time you just double then go by 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:41.830
 the phone screen is very mobile 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.919
 I want to separate it separately 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:47.199
 emphasize it is very practical do not need 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:50.760
 there poke 10 times in one some kind of thing 

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:52.900
 he will understand you half a word 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.630
 through the fabric can understand 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:58.599
 I even conducted a test wore wool 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:00.520
 gloves and used the phone he 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:03.340
 certainly not a hundred percent responded to 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.410
 all my appeal to him but after 1 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.449
 he did not listen that is for example when I 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:10.389
 it's very cold I don't want to shoot 

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:14.800
 gloves then i can try to answer 

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:18.220
 on the bell without removing the gloves and the last 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:21.760
 in this phone two cameras 1 on 13 

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:24.580
 megapixels and front for 5 shots 

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:27.460
 make amazing here's an example snapshot 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:29.860
 made the main camera and here 

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:33.400
 frontal so if now before 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:36.580
 you have to choose the phone new 

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.560
 I advise you to pay attention to this 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.150
 apparatus 

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.340
 serious without him can not imagine 

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:44.500
 I like him very much in my life 

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.990
 I hope my feedback on this phone is me 

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:50.169
 how the user will be useful to you 

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:52.860
 I wish you all a pleasant shopping and stem 

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:52.860
 cell
