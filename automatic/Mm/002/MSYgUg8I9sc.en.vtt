00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.250 
series at first was just so
bad-ass<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.580> CGI<00:00:09.240> level<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:09.900> animation

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
bad-ass the CGI level of animation

bad-ass the CGI level of animation
reminded<00:00:10.830> me<00:00:10.920> of<00:00:10.950> arpeggio<00:00:11.610> blue<00:00:11.910> still<00:00:12.210> if

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
reminded me of arpeggio blue still if

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.089 
reminded me of arpeggio blue still if
anyone<00:00:12.840> remembers<00:00:13.049> that<00:00:13.349> from<00:00:13.559> full<00:00:13.740> anime

season<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.910> I<00:00:15.000> recommend<00:00:15.420> this<00:00:15.630> series

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
season and I recommend this series

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.450 
season and I recommend this series
because<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.170> CGI<00:00:16.529> reminds<00:00:16.949> me<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.340> it

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
because the CGI reminds me of it it

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.950

seems to have a little bit more life and

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.240 
seems to have a little bit more life and
the<00:00:19.020> characters<00:00:19.380> compared<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:19.920> anime

like the episode really had a good
audience<00:01:36.630> music<00:01:37.259> Phil<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.829> was<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.250> really<00:01:38.549> good

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
audience music Phil it was a really good

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.950 
audience music Phil it was a really good
atmosphere<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.299> type<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.479> series<00:01:39.810> but<00:01:39.930> I

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
atmosphere for this type of series but I

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.749 
atmosphere for this type of series but I
have<00:01:40.110> watched<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.409> lot<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.560> mechs<00:01:40.799> myself<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.729> I

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
have watched a lot of mechs myself so I

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.460 
have watched a lot of mechs myself so I
can't<00:01:42.030> really<00:01:42.150> say<00:01:42.360> this<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.750> best<00:01:43.020> but<00:01:43.259> in

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
can't really say this is the best but in

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.289 
can't really say this is the best but in
my<00:01:43.740> opinion<00:01:44.100> it's<00:01:44.220> really<00:01:44.610> good<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:45.030> do

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
my opinion it's really good I do

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.730
