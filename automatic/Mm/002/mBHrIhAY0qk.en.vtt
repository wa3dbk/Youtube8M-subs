00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.190
 him and to traded the game we tried 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.500
 control your not even half 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.820
 third field was not the goal 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.480
 tactical design so one failed 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.580
 to translate because the goal prevented 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.460
 and probably failed because 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.070
 Carlos had to be replaced 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.670
 tried to block the zone 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.560
 where cisco 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:37.660
 confident enough 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:41.860
 Magneto and the situation of the penalty talked about 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.720
 snatching the second wave did not count should 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.850
 on a thin colorist eliminated 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.410
 when go with penetrating transmissions that 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.810
 you get this viewer cisco strongly 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.020
 different for the better 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.690
 teams here we try well somewhere 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.359
 managed the coat of arms not really tried 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.550
 especially there lead a reverse 10 at least 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:03.309
 unmistakable legs coped 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.400
 problems with access to counterattack 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:09.210
 she was marked out because not in 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.229
 those conditions Carlos on which 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.610
 certain up to a million certain 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.450
 a big bet was made 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:19.810
 something he is not at ease probably with 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.490
 him talk and find out all the same such 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.220
 the main lesson from which is very much 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.860
 depends on 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.979
 loss a monstrous percentage of marriage is necessary 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.320
 find out again along with the guys 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.850
 talk for some reason happened but also on 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.670
 such a moment gives them a moment it is with me 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.050
 open but it sounds simple but 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.560
 catch this quick drawing 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.750
 displacement on the field of unanimity in 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.530
 moving cisco caused certain 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.300
 example but it is clear that in the end any 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.330
 match any mistake can be very expensive 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.610
 cost therefore very happy that we have these 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.080
 we do not make mistakes and we play with high quality 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.940
 and collected throughout the 90 minutes 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.660
 we hold in particular today absolutely 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.660
 well-deserved victory
