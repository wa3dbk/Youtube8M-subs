first so I'm going to hit command J on

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.789 
first so I'm going to hit command J on
my<00:00:10.200> Mac<00:00:10.410> which<00:00:10.679> i<00:00:10.769> think<00:00:10.889> is<00:00:11.040> ctrl<00:00:11.429> J<00:00:11.670> on<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.820> PC

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
the stage here away from the character

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.109 
the stage here away from the character
it<00:01:43.110> sort<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.470> focuses<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.070> stage<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.549> then<00:01:45.030> I

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
it sort of focuses the stage and then I

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.870 
it sort of focuses the stage and then I
do<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.570> command<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.380> or<00:01:46.619> control<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.310> which<00:01:47.729> is

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
transform tool and I'm going so now I

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.760 
transform tool and I'm going so now I
can<00:02:08.459> actually<00:02:08.869> transform<00:02:09.869> everything<00:02:10.410> but<00:02:10.590> I

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
can actually transform everything but I

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.820 
can actually transform everything but I
want<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.039> keep<00:02:11.160> everything<00:02:12.260> it's<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.410> same

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
want to keep everything it's the same

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.510 
want to keep everything it's the same
and

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
and

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.830 
and
spec<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.120> width<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.420> height<00:02:15.480> so<00:02:15.780> I'm

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
spec to the width and height so I'm

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.950 
spec to the width and height so I'm
going<00:02:15.960> to<00:02:16.020> hold<00:02:16.200> down<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:17.070> shift-key<00:02:17.520> and

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
going to hold down the shift-key and

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.840 
going to hold down the shift-key and
then<00:02:18.960> grab<00:02:19.320> a<00:02:19.560> corner<00:02:19.920> handle<00:02:20.100> and<00:02:20.460> the<00:02:20.640> shift

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
then grab a corner handle and the shift

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.160 
then grab a corner handle and the shift
key<00:02:21.000> will<00:02:21.210> constrain<00:02:21.810> proportions<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:24.660> it's

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
key will constrain proportions and it's

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.260 
key will constrain proportions and it's
as<00:02:25.350> simple<00:02:25.380> as<00:02:25.770> that<00:02:25.830> but<00:02:26.790> of<00:02:26.880> course<00:02:27.090> we're

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
as simple as that but of course we're

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.080 
as simple as that but of course we're
way<00:02:27.870> away<00:02:28.500> from<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:28.920> actual<00:02:29.160> stage<00:02:29.460> area<00:02:29.790> so

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
way away from the actual stage area so

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.490 
way away from the actual stage area so
let's<00:02:30.420> just<00:02:30.600> click<00:02:30.810> anywhere<00:02:31.110> in<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.260> middle

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
let's just click anywhere in the middle

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.400 
let's just click anywhere in the middle
of<00:02:31.620> it<00:02:31.710> move<00:02:32.700> her<00:02:32.850> up<00:02:33.000> here<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:34.080> obviously

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
of it move her up here and obviously

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.140 
of it move her up here and obviously
she's<00:02:34.830> still<00:02:35.070> a<00:02:35.100> little<00:02:35.280> bit<00:02:35.490> too<00:02:35.520> big<00:02:35.910> but

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
she's still a little bit too big but

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.330 
she's still a little bit too big but
that's<00:02:37.020> just<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.290> case<00:02:37.470> of<00:02:37.530> scaling<00:02:38.220> her<00:02:38.310> a

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
that's just a case of scaling her a

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.570 
that's just a case of scaling her a
little<00:02:38.490> bit<00:02:38.670> more<00:02:39.800> okay<00:02:40.800> so<00:02:40.860> now<00:02:41.190> let's<00:02:41.400> go<00:02:41.550> to

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
little bit more okay so now let's go to

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.480 
little bit more okay so now let's go to
view<00:02:41.970> magnification<00:02:42.930> let's<00:02:43.170> go<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.380> 100%<00:02:43.800> this

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
view magnification let's go to 100% this

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.730 
view magnification let's go to 100% this
is<00:02:44.640> what<00:02:44.790> she<00:02:44.970> looks<00:02:45.960> like<00:02:46.170> so<00:02:46.320> now<00:02:46.350> let's<00:02:46.620> make

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
is what she looks like so now let's make

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.740 
is what she looks like so now let's make
sure<00:02:46.890> we<00:02:47.040> turn<00:02:47.550> off<00:02:47.760> edit<00:02:48.210> multiple<00:02:48.690> frames

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
sure we turn off edit multiple frames

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.540 
sure we turn off edit multiple frames
and<00:02:50.000> everything<00:02:51.000> is<00:02:51.120> where<00:02:51.270> it<00:02:51.360> should<00:02:51.390> be
