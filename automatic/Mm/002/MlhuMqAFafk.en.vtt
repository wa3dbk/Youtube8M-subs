will pup you ask this question as well
as<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.829> SPD<00:00:59.309> clips<00:00:59.579> so<00:01:00.120> if<00:01:00.239> your<00:01:00.359> shoes<00:01:00.570> have<00:01:00.750> a

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
as the SPD clips so if your shoes have a

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.599 
as the SPD clips so if your shoes have a
special<00:01:01.230> hooks<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.590> hook<00:01:01.739> right<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:02.039> it'll

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
special hooks to hook right in it'll

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.270 
special hooks to hook right in it'll
work<00:01:02.789> for<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.290> this<00:01:04.290> bike<00:01:04.559> why<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.799> like<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.189> a

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
work for it this bike why I like is a

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.630 
work for it this bike why I like is a
couple<00:01:05.549> different<00:01:05.640> reasons<00:01:05.850> one<00:01:06.630> its<00:01:06.810> design

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
couple different reasons one its design

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.230 
couple different reasons one its design
so<00:01:08.640> we're<00:01:08.790> very<00:01:08.820> comfortable<00:01:09.710> seconds<00:01:10.710> quiet

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
so we're very comfortable seconds quiet

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.609 
so we're very comfortable seconds quiet
on<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.360> very<00:01:12.600> back<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.990> have<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.290> magnetic

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
on the very back you have the magnetic

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.499 
on the very back you have the magnetic
resistance<00:01:13.860> what<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.700> means<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.180> instead<00:01:15.299> of

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
resistance what that means is instead of

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.719 
resistance what that means is instead of
two<00:01:15.750> pieces<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.710> rubber<00:01:17.009> coming<00:01:17.430> against<00:01:17.610> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
two pieces of rubber coming against the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.880 
two pieces of rubber coming against the
flywheel<00:01:18.180> it's<00:01:18.780> actually<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.350> lever<00:01:19.650> here

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
flywheel it's actually this lever here

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.929 
flywheel it's actually this lever here
going<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.119> out<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.460> it<00:01:23.460> will<00:01:23.580> zoom<00:01:23.610> in<00:01:23.850> on

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
going in and out and it will zoom in on

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.300 
going in and out and it will zoom in on
the<00:01:24.030> back<00:01:24.180> you'll<00:01:24.720> see<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:25.020> Kaiser<00:01:25.310> system

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
the back you'll see the Kaiser system

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.450 
the back you'll see the Kaiser system
for<00:01:27.030> resistance<00:01:27.509> it's<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.080> magnet<00:01:28.470> going<00:01:29.250> in

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
for resistance it's the magnet going in

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.990 
for resistance it's the magnet going in
and<00:01:29.930> out

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
and out

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.550 
and out
there's<00:01:33.000> no<00:01:33.150> wife<00:01:33.360> or<00:01:33.390> computer<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.409> if<00:01:34.500> you

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
there's no wife or computer so if you

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.590 
there's no wife or computer so if you
come<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.009> screen<00:01:35.250> here<00:01:35.280> where<00:01:36.150> top<00:01:36.420> tell

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
come to the screen here where top tell

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.819 
come to the screen here where top tell
me<00:01:36.750> it's<00:01:37.439> gonna<00:01:37.680> start<00:01:37.860> right<00:01:38.009> up<00:01:38.250> but<00:01:39.210> rpms

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
me it's gonna start right up but rpms

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.460 
me it's gonna start right up but rpms
never<00:01:40.829> want<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.100> increase<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.520> resistance

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
never want to increase the resistance

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.819 
never want to increase the resistance
I'll<00:01:43.470> just<00:01:43.710> slowly<00:01:44.600> bring<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:45.930> way<00:01:46.170> and

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
I'll just slowly bring it this way and

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.289 
I'll just slowly bring it this way and
if<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.490> come<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.850> screen<00:01:48.119> you'll<00:01:48.240> see

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
if you come to the screen you'll see

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.800 
if you come to the screen you'll see
right<00:01:48.540> now<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.770> gear<00:01:50.009> 18<00:01:50.720> like<00:01:51.720> you

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
right now it's that gear 18 like you

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.560 
right now it's that gear 18 like you
bring<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.049> down<00:01:52.200> very<00:01:53.009> easily<00:01:54.860> down<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:56.070> one

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
bring it down very easily down to one

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.420 
bring it down very easily down to one
and<00:01:57.570> then<00:01:58.200> pedaling<00:01:58.619> pretty<00:01:58.829> fast<00:01:59.070> right<00:01:59.280> now

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
and then pedaling pretty fast right now

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.179 
and then pedaling pretty fast right now
as<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.729> can<00:01:59.880> see<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.600> don't<00:02:00.719> hear<00:02:01.110> anything

as you can see you don't hear anything
it's<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.729> quietest<00:02:03.270> speed<00:02:03.509> bike<00:02:03.689> on<00:02:03.869> the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
it's the quietest speed bike on the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.109 
it's the quietest speed bike on the
market<00:02:04.290> even<00:02:04.500> if<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.159> got<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.280> room<00:02:05.729> full<00:02:06.060> of
