00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.549
 we got an insight into 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.650
 pool in patricks in things 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.420
 You Must Look say that of the layman 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.160
 I'll tell you honestly at first 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.900
 look does not recognize at all now 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.590
 explain us even if we are a bit so 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.260
 looking ahead in the direction of the 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.820
 world cups how good are your chances 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.230
 really to get there very far because that 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.719
 Of course, the passionate ones want that 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.880
 new players know well we go 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.730
 already as favoriteitin I stage 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.610
 We think we are a 607 set before two 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.840
 In 2011 I was able to double with the 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.780
 partner thorsten roman the tournament 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.710
 so win in the philippines 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.960
 Of course I have dominick now 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.489
 lenzen other double partner we have 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.289
 in the constellation so not yet 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.890
 played that is of course one for us 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.620
 premiere 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.640
 which does not make things easier but 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.829
 on the other hand we are natural 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.480
 team colleagues here in Dachau 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.260
 that means one knows each other and is 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.049
 not quite unknown 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.970
 but logically the fact that 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.130
 we'll be playing in england 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.409
 Of course, two English teams do it 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.909
 The English bring home from house 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.350
 but I already like to pursue 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.960
 how should we imagine that then 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.090
 because over the tournament is then the 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.950
 rambazamba rammel junk in the bude 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.229
 or I would have thought so well there 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.110
 is quiet please quiet please how it is 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.640
 So who ever forms on TV 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.530
 has looked and above all things the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.280
 must know from king knows that the 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.150
 English fans are very fanatical and 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.390
 very loud 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.619
 it is also desirable and yes it does 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.880
 Just having fun with such a backdrop too 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.420
 so it's actually very much 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.590
 mess pancake theater is good there 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.060
 would mess me up if it was 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.009
 now before the bump or during the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.659
 shock would be there as well as in 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.079
 other sports tennis also absolute 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.090
 Quiet 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.920
 but between the bumps may 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.960
 calmly passed the rauslassen sau 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.060
 and just should have fun there 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.560
 It also sings like that and I know 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.980
 that from the daad that 's there we have 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.840
 organize a proper theater 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.280
 the bobbins round their football songs 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.780
 converted to the pictures player or 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.020
 also in files on the dartspieler 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.270
 and that 's it for us too first 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.590
 Thanks alot 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.500
 I liked you so much 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.180
 I swear I believe we 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.860
 have made advertising for the sport 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.630
 I will be one or the other 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.680
 take off in the evening you just have to 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.410
 really again afterwards show how 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.550
 The thing I build there and then 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.910
 I just hope he succeeds 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.410
 be at the World Cup and that possible 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.790
 many new fans for this sport 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.350
 to be won because that is what it is 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.670
 Now I believe industries can do one 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.750
 really cool story thank you 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.080

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.080
 problem
