you<00:02:13.640> see<00:02:13.850> we<00:02:14.120> borrow<00:02:14.540> money<00:02:14.840> from<00:02:15.140> them<00:02:15.560> and

you see we borrow money from them and

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.190 
you see we borrow money from them and
that<00:02:16.220> enables<00:02:16.700> them<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:16.940> officially<00:02:17.630> increase

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
that enables them to officially increase
