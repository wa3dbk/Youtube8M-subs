00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.010

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:08.840
 a row in the stands that was 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.009
 controlled that we are seeing the 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.599
 images the party populates against chivas 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.340
 There is the anger of a man started one 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.950
 real police 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.760
 and that his salvation rampage between 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.410
 policemen 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.070
 because the police before that to hit the 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.439
 in relation to a brutal portal 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.779
 then good for neither one nor the other 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.900
 yes, but it's clear where they start 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:37.480
 things and faces are also very 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.480
 claritas in the mind below 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.040
 mexico is staying there is the 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.110
 responsible or I do not know what the 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.210
 provided night but in the end police not 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.940
 can be that brutality not if you're not going to 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.129
 you grab the neck bring us 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:57.910
 grab hits no good goes apart 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:01:01.100
 first what the police officer said 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.100
 [Applause] 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.070
 policeman who is perfectly 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.780
 detectable I think that's fine 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.490
 as he grabs me by the neck and does not try 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.130
 of submitting as they then attack in 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.270
 chile the policeman and the police give 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.890
 police 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.140
 rafa are you watching 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.290
 I'm living it like not going to see my 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.290
 Christmas 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.010
 tree and that this rhythm those terrible 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.800
 as well as with they fight between ones and 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.350
 others and in some of them 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:38.640
 [Applause] 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:41.340
 just like we have always asked that 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.680
 locate and sanction people 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.750
 violent also this guy this 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.710
 police would have to be sanctioned and 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.210
 exhibited will exhibit your sanction you can not 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.369
 act of that type 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.759
 with this kind of situations because 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.430
 you also provoke something really serious in 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.280
 we are going to see the tribune 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.930
 pitched battle if nothing else happens 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.820
 because you already hit him that you can 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.160
 hurt you can injure it I think there's 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.630
 very hard not here the most sensible were 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.560
 some fans who were the ones 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.180
 they put peace 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.860
 those sanctioned were very law 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.959
 correctly they will calm the 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.970
 policemen and in day the soldiers that 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.620
 they were hitting too I do not think that 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.030
 this illustrates perfectly that it was something 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.310
 that the problem of violence is very 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.560
 complex does not just happen for people 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.440
 misfits 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.720
 that goes with the idea of generating conflict 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.580
 but also by police bodies in 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.590
 most of the cases without the 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.060
 preparation to handle this kind of 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.580
 situations 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.959
 these other images that we send them 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.400
 to the phrase 'I want football to be everything 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.099
 flag jorge vergara united clubs of 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.720
 jalisco to whoever wants the view 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.760
 images is the reality of what happened 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.780
 there in the jalisco but also this does not 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.780
 is going to close football
