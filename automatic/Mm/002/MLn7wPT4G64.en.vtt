guys<00:00:22.230> i've<00:00:22.410> reviewed<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.800> picture<00:00:23.039> projector

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
guys i've reviewed the picture projector

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.679 
guys i've reviewed the picture projector
before<00:00:23.730> in<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.880> past<00:00:24.090> there<00:00:24.330> was<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.480> little

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
before in the past there was a little

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.330 
before in the past there was a little
larger<00:00:24.990> than<00:00:25.199> this<00:00:25.289> one<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:25.980> was<00:00:26.070> kind<00:00:26.279> of

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
larger than this one and I was kind of

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.040 
larger than this one and I was kind of
let<00:00:26.550> down<00:00:26.789> by<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.449> brightness<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:27.990> the

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
let down by the the brightness and the

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.380 
let down by the the brightness and the
quality<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:29.490> overall<00:00:29.760> features<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.269> that

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
quality and overall features of that

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.640 
quality and overall features of that
projector<00:00:30.900> but<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.080> have<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.349> say<00:00:31.470> I've<00:00:31.560> been

really impressed with the show double X

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.270 
really impressed with the show double X
plus<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:34.079> features<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.410> can<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:35.010> can

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
output so let's start off we're at the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.660 
output so let's start off we're at the
back<00:00:37.170> guys<00:00:37.320> this<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.620> laser<00:00:37.950> pico<00:00:38.250> projector

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
back guys this is a laser pico projector

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.880 
back guys this is a laser pico projector
which<00:00:39.030> means<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.420> has<00:00:39.660> much<00:00:40.110> better<00:00:40.379> quality

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
which means it has much better quality

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.650 
which means it has much better quality
much<00:00:41.040> better<00:00:41.340> clarity<00:00:41.790> as<00:00:41.879> far<00:00:42.090> as<00:00:42.180> colors<00:00:42.510> and

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
much better clarity as far as colors and

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.020 
much better clarity as far as colors and
brightness<00:00:42.840> goes<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.559> features<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.730> outputs

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
brightness goes it features and outputs

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.940 
brightness goes it features and outputs
15<00:00:45.420> lumens<00:00:45.629> which<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.110> not<00:00:46.289> very<00:00:46.559> high<00:00:46.739> but

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
15 lumens which is not very high but

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.229 
15 lumens which is not very high but
considering<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.430> form<00:00:47.640> factor<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.059> size

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
four point three ounces very lightweight

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.549 
four point three ounces very lightweight
and<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.149> top<00:01:03.329> here<00:01:03.480> it's<00:01:03.600> all<00:01:03.780> plastic<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.439> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
and the top here it's all plastic so the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.109 
and the top here it's all plastic so the
bottom<00:01:05.100> part<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.309> like<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> rough<00:01:05.640> plastic<00:01:06.030> this

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
bottom part is like a rough plastic this

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.760 
bottom part is like a rough plastic this
is<00:01:06.210> like<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.390> shiny<00:01:06.630> nice<00:01:06.869> glass<00:01:07.140> plastic<00:01:07.650> right

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
is like a shiny nice glass plastic right

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.580 
is like a shiny nice glass plastic right
here<00:01:07.970> so<00:01:08.970> four<00:01:09.210> point<00:01:09.390> three<00:01:09.510> ounces<00:01:09.540> not<00:01:10.409> bad

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
here so four point three ounces not bad

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.320 
here so four point three ounces not bad
at<00:01:10.710> all<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:10.830> this<00:01:11.100> also<00:01:11.280> features<00:01:11.700> auto<00:01:11.909> focus

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
at all so this also features auto focus

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.789 
at all so this also features auto focus
because<00:01:12.630> if<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.930> laser<00:01:13.200> projector<00:01:13.680> so

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
because if it is a laser projector so

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.289 
because if it is a laser projector so
you<00:01:13.890> don't<00:01:14.070> have<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.250> focus<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:15.090> don't<00:01:15.210> have

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
you don't have to focus you don't have

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.460 
you don't have to focus you don't have
to<00:01:15.360> do<00:01:15.450> any<00:01:15.570> kind<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.750> manual<00:01:15.930> focusing<00:01:16.380> when

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
to do any kind of manual focusing when

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.080 
to do any kind of manual focusing when
you<00:01:16.560> predict<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:16.920> on<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.070> wall<00:01:17.220> it's<00:01:17.729> always

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
you predict this on the wall it's always

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.429 
you predict this on the wall it's always
going<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.270> be<00:01:18.330> sharp<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.930> clear<00:01:19.170> whenever

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
going to be sharp and clear whenever

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.080 
going to be sharp and clear whenever
you're<00:01:19.619> watching<00:01:19.710> your<00:01:19.979> videos<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:21.000> you

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
you're watching your videos and so you

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.760 
you're watching your videos and so you
can<00:01:21.270> either<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.689> will<00:01:21.810> project<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.200> video<00:01:22.500> up

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
can either it will project a video up

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.800 
can either it will project a video up
from<00:01:23.070> six<00:01:23.310> inches<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.729> over<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:24.240> hundred<00:01:24.330> inches

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
from six inches to over a hundred inches

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.690 
from six inches to over a hundred inches
in<00:01:25.140> size<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.740> course<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.100> when<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.490> get<00:01:26.580> to

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
in size of course it when you get to

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.980

by it a lot so I think that you guys
would<00:06:07.070> if<00:06:07.310> this<00:06:07.460> is<00:06:07.580> something<00:06:07.850> to<00:06:07.970> think<00:06:08.120> you

would be able to use on a regular basis

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.620 
would be able to use on a regular basis
for<00:06:10.729> just<00:06:10.940> watching<00:06:11.240> videos<00:06:11.449> with<00:06:11.570> your

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:11.630 
for just watching videos with your

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.330 
for just watching videos with your
friends<00:06:11.690> that<00:06:12.169> type<00:06:12.290> of<00:06:12.410> thing<00:06:12.530> I<00:06:12.740> think<00:06:13.040> it's

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
friends that type of thing I think it's

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.390 
friends that type of thing I think it's
an<00:06:13.430> awesome<00:06:13.520> device<00:06:13.910> it<00:06:14.060> retails<00:06:14.389> for<00:06:14.449> 319

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
an awesome device it retails for 319

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.700 
an awesome device it retails for 319
$320<00:06:16.400> pretty<00:06:16.610> much<00:06:16.760> and<00:06:17.080> I<00:06:18.080> think<00:06:18.380> for<00:06:18.530> the

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
$320 pretty much and I think for the

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.320 
$320 pretty much and I think for the
what<00:06:18.919> it<00:06:19.039> can<00:06:19.160> do<00:06:19.310> it's<00:06:19.520> totally<00:06:20.060> worth<00:06:20.210> the

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330 
what it can do it's totally worth the

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.300 
what it can do it's totally worth the
money<00:06:20.510> of<00:06:20.660> course<00:06:20.720> other<00:06:21.169> projectors<00:06:21.680> that

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
money of course other projectors that

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.490 
money of course other projectors that
are<00:06:22.460> much<00:06:22.610> brighter<00:06:22.850> much<00:06:23.840> better<00:06:24.080> quality

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:24.500 
are much brighter much better quality

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.740 
are much brighter much better quality
way<00:06:24.800> more<00:06:24.979> expensive<00:06:25.220> maybe<00:06:25.789> close<00:06:26.060> to<00:06:26.150> $1,000

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
way more expensive maybe close to $1,000

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.000 
way more expensive maybe close to $1,000
a<00:06:26.780> little<00:06:26.990> less<00:06:27.080> than<00:06:27.199> that<00:06:27.350> but<00:06:27.949> that

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.010 
a little less than that but that

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:29.260 
a little less than that but that
consumed<00:06:28.520> the<00:06:28.610> fact<00:06:28.789> that<00:06:28.820> this<00:06:28.940> is<00:06:29.090> very
