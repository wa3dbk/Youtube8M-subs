actually a cement that's good for 2,000
degrees<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:51.390> just<00:00:51.600> smeared<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.140> all

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
degrees and I just smeared this all

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.260 
degrees and I just smeared this all
around<00:00:52.469> on<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.460> side<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.910> also<00:00:54.090> on

places<00:00:58.859> where<00:00:59.250> smoking<00:00:59.520> leaked<00:01:00.030> through<00:01:01.520> this

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
places where smoking leaked through this

places where smoking leaked through this
slide<00:01:03.210> here<00:01:03.480> shows<00:01:03.539> how<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.170> just<00:01:04.680> poked<00:01:04.860> their

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
slide here shows how I just poked their

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.179 
slide here shows how I just poked their
on<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.460> inside<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.260> I<00:01:07.260> let<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.799> up<00:01:08.010> for

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
on the inside and I let this up for

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.520 
on the inside and I let this up for
about<00:01:08.340> three<00:01:08.729> days<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.360> does<00:01:09.570> get<00:01:09.780> really<00:01:09.960> hard

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
about three days it does get really hard

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.830 
about three days it does get really hard
at<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.920> point<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.490> it's<00:01:12.090> been<00:01:12.390> held<00:01:12.600> up

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
at that point and it's been held up

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.999 
at that point and it's been held up
pretty<00:01:12.990> good<00:01:14.180> this<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.720> lid<00:01:16.320> again<00:01:16.500> and

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
pretty good this is the lid again and

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.490 
pretty good this is the lid again and
this<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.640> dose<00:01:18.150> discharge<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.380> an

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
this is the dose discharge this is an

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.920 
this is the dose discharge this is an
onion<00:01:19.770> green<00:01:19.979> 90<00:01:20.759> degrees<00:01:21.090> pipe<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.720> have

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
onion green 90 degrees pipe that I have

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.080 
onion green 90 degrees pipe that I have
on<00:01:22.200> there<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.830> against<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.280> tick<00:01:23.610> tick

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
on there and against that tick tick

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.330 
on there and against that tick tick
welding<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.869> actually<00:01:25.110> used<00:01:25.500> three<00:01:26.070> sheet

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
welding this I actually used three sheet

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.760 
welding this I actually used three sheet
metal<00:01:26.670> screws<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.720> was<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.900> pretty<00:01:28.110> snug<00:01:28.409> fit

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
metal screws this was a pretty snug fit

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.609 
metal screws this was a pretty snug fit
so<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.400> try<00:01:29.909> had<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.509> fit<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:30.869> there<00:01:31.110> i<00:01:31.140> just<00:01:31.229> used

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
so I try had it fit in there i just used

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.960 
so I try had it fit in there i just used
the<00:01:31.740> three<00:01:31.920> screws<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.280> pretty<00:01:32.460> much<00:01:32.549> over<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
the three screws to pretty much over the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.270 
the three screws to pretty much over the
place<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.210> would<00:01:33.540> come<00:01:33.810> out<00:01:34.130> then<00:01:35.130> again

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
place that would come out then again

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.870 
place that would come out then again
using<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:35.990> motor<00:01:36.990> cement<00:01:37.560> just<00:01:38.549> sealed<00:01:38.759> up

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
using the motor cement just sealed up

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.460 
using the motor cement just sealed up
all<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.270> joints<00:01:39.479> around<00:01:39.720> both<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.229> these

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
all the joints around both of these

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.969 
all the joints around both of these
sections<00:01:40.770> here<00:01:41.220> just<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:41.909> there's<00:01:42.180> no<00:01:42.210> leak

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
sections here just so there's no leak

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.649 
sections here just so there's no leak
also<00:01:43.979> complete<00:01:44.310> pass<00:01:44.610> for<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.060> spoke<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.479> get

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
also complete pass for you spoke to get

also complete pass for you spoke to get
out<00:01:46.280> this<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.670> actual<00:01:48.500> rope<00:01:49.500> Gascon

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
out this is the actual rope Gascon

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.149 
out this is the actual rope Gascon
gasketing<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.390> i<00:01:51.420> picked<00:01:51.840> up<00:01:52.020> for<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.439> delay

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
gasketing that i picked up for the delay

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.249 
gasketing that i picked up for the delay
because<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.790> previous<00:01:54.540> video<00:01:54.840> if<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.110> had

because in previous video if you had

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.120 
because in previous video if you had
seen<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.799> has

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
seen it it has

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.179 
seen it it has
sleeping<00:01:56.759> between<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.390> drum<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.049> lid<00:01:58.320> so

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
sleeping between the drum and the lid so
