00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.430
 Hello, I am Pavel Ignatovich 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.830
 and today we will talk about how 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.990
 choose a potential partner but there 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.840
 boyfriend girlfriend depending on who 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.820
 you are certainly more interested in this whole topic 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.760
 cover in one very short clip 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.510
 difficult therefore I will tell only about the most 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.820
 key 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.480
 if you want to look for such thresholds 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.699
 their things are 3 and they are not connected in any way 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.380
 with the appearance of defects not with other 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.050
 some paid 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.130
 what are your head bound and so prepared 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.670
 thing number one you need to understand 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.510
 is this person able to negotiate 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.550
 that is, theoretically, in general, he 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.920
 tends to negotiate or is it the other way around 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.559
 tends to bend you or there 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.629
 sags here if a person seeks 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.020
 bend you bends it is not 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.070
 very good option and for sure 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.010
 man is not ready for partnership yet 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.539
 partners are always a contract and need but 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.149
 if not able to negotiate 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.549
 then at least want to negotiate and so 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.880
 first want to agree second 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.619
 you need to look like this person 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.530
 speaks of other people 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.119
 if other people can do good things for him 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.310
 to be there is not very good but in general 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.369
 all good boss good parents 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.970
 good friends great it's good 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.710
 this is your option if the person is about everyone 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.159
 speaks badly bureau chief 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.070
 subordinate diodes livestock colleagues all 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.390
 around it all don't understand what it is 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.570
 already alarm 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.060
 most likely you too will fall into it 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.659
 number most likely you sometime too 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.360
 will become 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.689
 by someone and here this listed 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.479
 so as soon as you notice this 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:52.470
 negativist run from him don't hit like 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:56.790
 possible as soon as possible now 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:59.460
 the third is difficult to call in one word 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.490
 so I will describe the situation imagine 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.219
 imagine that a man but like that women 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.069
 quarreled but sometimes it happens happened and 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.970
 then it means let's say a woman comes to 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:14.450
 him and says you know i would 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.740
 and a little bit wrong so here I am 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:21.770
 slightly got excited somehow not here 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.750
 see us will be fork 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.170
 and two options situation the first option 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.600
 the man says yes and I am by the way 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.030
 said that you were wrong here I immediately 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.540
 knew it was necessary to immediately agree and 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:40.100
 the second option when he says me too 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:43.850
 I got excited too, I lost my temper too 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.970
 somehow here forgive me here if a man 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.850
 conducted as in the first case is not an option 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.040
 for a relationship because he is to blame 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.530
 all but him is not a man I saw 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.810
 as in the second case, all is well this 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.780
 man is somehow ready but 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.180
 just in case knowing how sharply people 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.610
 react to the topic of men and women i 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.230
 I will say that this applies of course 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.390
 representative of any of our two 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.600
 wonderful sex and men and women to 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.790
 concerns to exactly the same degree 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.920
 equality of arms there is a cavity in general 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:21.769
 concerns so let's repeat 1 person 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.750
 to be a good partner must though 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:27.920
 would just want to negotiate 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.630
 second he must be given to other people 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.840
 good 3 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.269
 he must be able to meet 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.940
 be able to admit your mistakes if three 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.130
 these points and no options and the way 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.790
 if suddenly you didn't like the word 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.519
 should 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.110
 I want to say this is just a turn of the Russian 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.380
 put speech 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.239
 khorkova important if you so easier 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.880
 insert the words you need if you like 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.190
 do not insert any word if you like 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.130
 it will be easier this is all the same and so 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.440
 want to negotiate to respond others 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:04.130
 good to go after a quarrel 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.380
 third qualities are threshold for 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.959
 that the person became the printer though 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.360
 looking for partners for anything 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.400
 people everything else add to taste a 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.620
 it is mandatory but now 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.570
 Like like this is great 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.120
