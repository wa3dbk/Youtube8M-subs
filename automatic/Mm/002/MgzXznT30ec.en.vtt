this<00:00:01.500> is<00:00:01.620> a<00:00:01.650> review<00:00:01.890> on<00:00:02.070> the<00:00:02.159> inner<00:00:02.340> trap<00:00:02.639> by<00:00:02.820> in

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
this is a review on the inner trap by in

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.420 
this is a review on the inner trap by in
today's<00:00:03.330> it<00:00:03.899> is<00:00:04.049> part<00:00:04.290> of<00:00:04.319> nightlight<00:00:04.740> part

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
today's it is part of nightlight part

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.059 
today's it is part of nightlight part
bug<00:00:05.970> catcher<00:00:06.180> that's<00:00:07.140> not<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.379> combination<00:00:07.980> you

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
bug catcher that's not a combination you

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.160 
bug catcher that's not a combination you
usually<00:00:08.250> hear<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.580> very<00:00:08.910> often<00:00:09.300> but<00:00:09.540> in<00:00:09.990> the

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
usually hear a very often but in the

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.430 
usually hear a very often but in the
case<00:00:10.349> of<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.679> unit<00:00:10.920> trap<00:00:11.099> it<00:00:11.280> actually<00:00:11.670> is<00:00:11.790> a

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440 
case of the unit trap it actually is a

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.930 
case of the unit trap it actually is a
effective<00:00:13.440> description<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.610> product

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
effective description of the product

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.170 
effective description of the product
again<00:00:15.870> it's<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.320> nightlight<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.250> bug<00:00:18.000> catcher

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
again it's a nightlight and bug catcher

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.359 
again it's a nightlight and bug catcher
so<00:00:18.810> we're<00:00:18.900> going<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.050> go<00:00:19.199> into<00:00:19.380> how<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.160> works

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
so we're going to go into how it works

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.730 
so we're going to go into how it works
and<00:00:20.670> actually<00:00:21.660> show<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:21.960> if<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.350> does<00:00:22.529> work

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
and actually show you if it does work

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.950 
and actually show you if it does work
and<00:00:23.119> talk<00:00:24.119> about<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.390> product<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.750> see<00:00:24.900> if

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
and talk about the product and see if

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.310 
and talk about the product and see if
this<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.109> maybe<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.590> right<00:00:25.710> thing<00:00:25.920> for<00:00:26.070> you

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.319 

okay<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.130> how<00:00:29.400> does<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.699> inner<00:00:29.849> trap<00:00:30.089> actually

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:30.329 
okay so how does the inner trap actually

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.510 
okay so how does the inner trap actually
work<00:00:30.689> well<00:00:31.259> you<00:00:31.380> have<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.560> light<00:00:32.040> source<00:00:32.309> here

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
work well you have a light source here

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.910 
work well you have a light source here
and<00:00:32.669> light<00:00:33.360> source<00:00:33.989> has<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.199> special<00:00:34.620> coating

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
and light source has a special coating

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.660 
and light source has a special coating
on<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.250> help<00:00:35.460> create<00:00:35.910> co2<00:00:36.890> the<00:00:37.890> co2<00:00:38.190> pools

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
on it to help create co2 the co2 pools

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.590 
on it to help create co2 the co2 pools
underneath<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.769> unit<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.390> the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
underneath the the unit and that and the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.209 
underneath the the unit and that and the
light<00:00:42.809> will<00:00:43.050> help<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.320> track<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.769> mosquitoes

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
light will help the track the mosquitoes

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.049 
light will help the track the mosquitoes
to<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.550> once<00:00:45.120> they're<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.629> range<00:00:46.850> they<00:00:47.850> can

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
to it once they're in the range they can

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.380 
to it once they're in the range they can
counter<00:00:49.190> the<00:00:50.190> thing<00:00:50.430> actually<00:00:50.699> sucks<00:00:51.210> them

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
counter the thing actually sucks them

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.670 
counter the thing actually sucks them
down<00:00:52.250> into<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:54.120> catch<00:00:54.449> which<00:00:54.930> fits<00:00:55.199> my<00:00:55.409> scene

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
down into this catch which fits my scene

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.990 
down into this catch which fits my scene
and<00:00:56.180> then<00:00:57.180> they<00:00:57.300> get<00:00:57.479> and<00:00:57.960> they<00:00:58.019> cannot<00:00:59.000> escape

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
and then they get and they cannot escape

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.020 
and then they get and they cannot escape
now<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.930> may<00:01:01.049> seem<00:01:01.110> like<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.759> silly<00:01:02.759> contraption

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
now it may seem like a silly contraption

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.359 
now it may seem like a silly contraption
but<00:01:03.629> things<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> Mosquito<00:01:04.739> Magnet<00:01:04.769> work

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
but things like the Mosquito Magnet work

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.850 
but things like the Mosquito Magnet work
identical<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.210> this<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.990> have<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.140> co2<00:01:07.350> source

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
identical to this you have a co2 source

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.640 
identical to this you have a co2 source
and<00:01:08.070> then<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.280> track<00:01:08.520> them<00:01:08.759> and<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.750> are<00:01:09.990> able

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
and then to track them and you are able

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.219 
and then to track them and you are able
to<00:01:10.890> suck<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.369> mosquitoes<00:01:11.850> into<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.360> into<00:01:13.079> a

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
to suck the mosquitoes into a into a

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.289 
to suck the mosquitoes into a into a
catch<00:01:13.470> pan<00:01:13.650> now<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.430> can<00:01:14.670> fill<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.909> catch<00:01:15.060> pan

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
catch pan now you can fill the catch pan

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.050 
catch pan now you can fill the catch pan
with<00:01:15.509> some<00:01:15.540> steric<00:01:15.990> absent<00:01:16.409> or<00:01:16.590> some<00:01:16.799> wine<00:01:17.159> to

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
with some steric absent or some wine to

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.609 
with some steric absent or some wine to
a<00:01:18.090> help<00:01:19.490> enhance<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:20.700> effect<00:01:20.880> but<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:22.439> does

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
a help enhance this effect but it does

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.770 
a help enhance this effect but it does
work<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.250> we'll<00:01:23.430> see<00:01:23.579> that<00:01:23.759> by<00:01:24.060> showing<00:01:24.600> you

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
work and we'll see that by showing you

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.440 
work and we'll see that by showing you
mosquito

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
mosquito

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.030 
mosquito
okay<00:01:27.450> now<00:01:27.750> I'm<00:01:28.110> trying<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.530> determine<00:01:28.649> how

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
okay now I'm trying to determine how

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.609 
okay now I'm trying to determine how
effective<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:30.060> in<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> trap<00:01:30.509> actually<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:31.110> so

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
effective the in a trap actually is so

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.260 
effective the in a trap actually is so
here's<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.920> in<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.100> trap<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.550> next<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.120> have

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
here's the in the trap and next to have

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.700 
here's the in the trap and next to have
actually<00:01:33.570> placed<00:01:33.870> a<00:01:35.300> sensor<00:01:36.300> from<00:01:36.540> an<00:01:37.260> animal

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
actually placed a sensor from an animal

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.590 
actually placed a sensor from an animal
which<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.430> urban<00:01:38.760> weather<00:01:38.940> station<00:01:39.360> and

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
which is a the urban weather station and

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.510 
which is a the urban weather station and
it'll<00:01:40.050> give<00:01:40.170> us<00:01:40.229> an<00:01:40.380> indication<00:01:40.500> but<00:01:41.040> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
it'll give us an indication but the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.640 
it'll give us an indication but the
amount<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.790> co2<00:01:42.150> that's<00:01:42.450> put<00:01:42.659> out<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.530> will

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
amount of co2 that's put out and it will

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.030 
amount of co2 that's put out and it will
also<00:01:44.180> record<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.330> sound<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:46.470> right<00:01:46.650> here<00:01:46.860> you

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
also record the sound so right here you

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.899 
also record the sound so right here you
can<00:01:47.070> see<00:01:47.870> the<00:01:48.870> sound<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.620> this<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.670> when<00:01:50.880> I

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
can see the sound and this is when I

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.200 
can see the sound and this is when I
plugged<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.299> in<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:52.520> you'll<00:01:53.520> see<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.850> runs<00:01:54.030> at

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
plugged it in and you'll see it runs at

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.420 
plugged it in and you'll see it runs at
about<00:01:54.390> 57<00:01:54.960> decibels<00:01:55.440> and<00:01:55.590> sound<00:01:56.130> which<00:01:56.280> isn't

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
about 57 decibels and sound which isn't

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.000 
about 57 decibels and sound which isn't
really<00:01:56.580> that<00:01:56.790> loud<00:01:57.590> next<00:01:58.590> we'll<00:01:58.710> look<00:01:58.770> at<00:01:58.890> the

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
really that loud next we'll look at the

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:05.410 
really that loud next we'll look at the
co2<00:02:00.320> and<00:02:01.320> what<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.770> see<00:02:02.010> is<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.930> with<00:02:03.930> the

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
co2 and what I see is that with the

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.730 
co2 and what I see is that with the
urban<00:02:06.420> weather<00:02:06.659> station<00:02:06.960> right<00:02:07.290> next<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.710> it

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
urban weather station right next to it

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.300 
urban weather station right next to it
not<00:02:08.310> seeing<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.670> huge<00:02:09.590> amount<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.679> co2<00:02:10.860> being

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
not seeing a huge amount of co2 being

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.780 
not seeing a huge amount of co2 being
emitted<00:02:12.739> within<00:02:13.739> it<00:02:13.860> so<00:02:14.010> this<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.459> actually

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
emitted within it so this is actually

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.240 
emitted within it so this is actually
since<00:02:15.090> when<00:02:15.269> our<00:02:15.390> our<00:02:16.170> bathroom<00:02:16.799> you<00:02:16.980> can<00:02:17.129> see

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
since when our our bathroom you can see

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.670 
since when our our bathroom you can see
how<00:02:17.400> from<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.849> morning<00:02:18.150> our<00:02:18.299> co2<00:02:19.260> level<00:02:19.530> has

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
how from the morning our co2 level has

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.839 
how from the morning our co2 level has
dropped<00:02:19.830> continuously<00:02:20.430> throughout<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.760> day

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
dropped continuously throughout the day

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.429 
dropped continuously throughout the day
and<00:02:21.239> there's<00:02:22.080> just<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.590> little<00:02:22.799> slight<00:02:23.310> pickup

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:24.439 
and there's just a little slight pickup

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:30.730 
and there's just a little slight pickup
once<00:02:25.439> i<00:02:25.620> up<00:02:25.980> i<00:02:26.720> place<00:02:27.720> the

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.060 

in<00:02:31.070> the<00:02:31.640> trap<00:02:31.850> next<00:02:32.210> to<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.890> urban<00:02:33.890> weather

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
in the trap next to the urban weather

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.180 
in the trap next to the urban weather
station<00:02:34.460> so<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:36.050> co2<00:02:36.470> that<00:02:36.620> submitted<00:02:37.040> would

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
station so the co2 that submitted would

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.760 
station so the co2 that submitted would
be<00:02:37.340> kind<00:02:37.550> of<00:02:37.640> cloaked<00:02:37.910> underneath<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:39.470> actual

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
be kind of cloaked underneath the actual

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.860 
be kind of cloaked underneath the actual
light<00:02:39.980> itself<00:02:40.340> so<00:02:41.090> therefore<00:02:41.510> I'm<00:02:41.810> not

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
light itself so therefore I'm not

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.140 
light itself so therefore I'm not
picking<00:02:42.440> up<00:02:42.560> a<00:02:42.680> whole<00:02:42.800> lot<00:02:43.010> right<00:02:43.760> next<00:02:44.030> to<00:02:44.120> it

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
picking up a whole lot right next to it

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.090 
picking up a whole lot right next to it
with<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:45.020> urban<00:02:45.830> weather<00:02:45.980> station<00:02:47.740> okay<00:02:48.740> one

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
with the urban weather station okay one

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.250 
with the urban weather station okay one
night<00:02:49.310> of<00:02:49.460> youth<00:02:49.610> I<00:02:49.820> caught<00:02:50.120> exactly<00:02:50.660> one

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
night of youth I caught exactly one

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.740 
night of youth I caught exactly one
mosquito<00:02:51.640> now<00:02:52.640> that<00:02:52.820> may<00:02:52.970> not<00:02:53.150> sound<00:02:53.450> very

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
mosquito now that may not sound very

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.110 
mosquito now that may not sound very
impressive<00:02:53.900> but<00:02:54.560> I<00:02:54.830> call<00:02:55.430> them<00:02:55.520> mosquito<00:02:55.640> in

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
impressive but I call them mosquito in

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.650 
impressive but I call them mosquito in
January<00:02:56.600> which<00:02:56.990> means<00:02:57.440> pretty<00:02:58.040> impressive<00:02:58.660> so

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
January which means pretty impressive so

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.110 
January which means pretty impressive so
the<00:03:00.230> theory<00:03:00.470> behind<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:01.040> in<00:03:01.490> the<00:03:01.910> trap

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
the theory behind the in the trap

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.900 
the theory behind the in the trap
actually<00:03:02.330> is<00:03:02.660> effective<00:03:03.350> you<00:03:03.500> know

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
actually is effective you know

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.060 
actually is effective you know
mosquitoes<00:03:04.910> are<00:03:05.150> attracted<00:03:05.180> to<00:03:05.890> UV<00:03:06.890> light

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
mosquitoes are attracted to UV light

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.900 
mosquitoes are attracted to UV light
they<00:03:07.790> are<00:03:08.260> attracted<00:03:09.260> to<00:03:09.380> co2<00:03:09.920> so<00:03:10.790> by

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
they are attracted to co2 so by

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.150 
they are attracted to co2 so by
combining<00:03:11.210> the<00:03:11.510> two<00:03:11.660> with<00:03:11.870> a<00:03:11.900> fan<00:03:12.200> that<00:03:12.860> sucks

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
combining the two with a fan that sucks

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.120 
combining the two with a fan that sucks
down<00:03:13.370> you<00:03:13.790> can<00:03:14.000> in<00:03:14.330> fact<00:03:14.570> catch<00:03:15.250> mosquitoes<00:03:16.420> SC

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
down you can in fact catch mosquitoes SC

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.950 
down you can in fact catch mosquitoes SC
okay<00:03:19.130> so<00:03:19.430> here<00:03:19.730> we<00:03:19.850> have<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.210> in<00:03:20.390> a<00:03:20.420> trap<00:03:20.720> at

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:20.960 
okay so here we have the in a trap at

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.920 
okay so here we have the in a trap at
the<00:03:21.200> dark<00:03:21.860> you<00:03:22.580> can<00:03:22.700> see<00:03:22.820> the<00:03:22.970> this<00:03:23.360> is<00:03:23.570> the

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
the dark you can see the this is the

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.690 
the dark you can see the this is the
blue<00:03:24.110> version<00:03:24.320> so<00:03:24.800> you<00:03:24.860> have<00:03:24.980> a<00:03:25.040> nice<00:03:25.370> blue

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
blue version so you have a nice blue

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.400 
blue version so you have a nice blue
light<00:03:25.940> coming<00:03:26.180> out<00:03:26.330> of<00:03:26.390> it<00:03:26.600> son

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
light coming out of it son

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.410 
light coming out of it son
it<00:03:27.530> looks<00:03:28.100> harsher<00:03:28.640> in<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:28.850> video<00:03:29.060> than<00:03:29.270> what

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
it looks harsher in the video than what

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.240 
it looks harsher in the video than what
actually<00:03:29.600> is<00:03:29.960> it<00:03:30.170> is<00:03:30.470> a<00:03:30.590> kind<00:03:30.830> of<00:03:30.860> a<00:03:30.950> gentle

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
actually is it is a kind of a gentle

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.640 
actually is it is a kind of a gentle
light<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:31.730> it<00:03:32.540> will<00:03:32.720> not<00:03:32.930> completely<00:03:33.350> light

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
light and it will not completely light

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.310 
light and it will not completely light
up<00:03:33.770> a<00:03:33.890> room<00:03:34.070> however<00:03:34.700> if<00:03:35.120> you're<00:03:35.330> sensitive<00:03:36.050> to

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
up a room however if you're sensitive to

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.410 
up a room however if you're sensitive to
light<00:03:36.740> you<00:03:37.160> know<00:03:37.280> and<00:03:37.520> a<00:03:37.700> better<00:03:37.880> image<00:03:38.150> it

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
light you know and a better image it

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.020 
light you know and a better image it
might<00:03:38.620> cause<00:03:39.620> the<00:03:39.770> problem<00:03:40.100> now<00:03:40.490> you<00:03:40.520> do<00:03:40.880> need

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
might cause the problem now you do need

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.120 
might cause the problem now you do need
light<00:03:41.330> to<00:03:41.360> operate<00:03:42.110> in<00:03:42.320> order<00:03:42.470> for<00:03:42.740> to<00:03:42.860> attract

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
light to operate in order for to attract

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.220 
light to operate in order for to attract
the<00:03:43.280> mosquitoes<00:03:43.760> because<00:03:44.480> again<00:03:44.780> it<00:03:44.900> works

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
the mosquitoes because again it works

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.410 
the mosquitoes because again it works
two<00:03:45.530> ways<00:03:45.560> by<00:03:45.920> using<00:03:46.610> the<00:03:46.820> lights<00:03:46.940> emit<00:03:47.240> carbon

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
two ways by using the lights emit carbon

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.360 
two ways by using the lights emit carbon
dioxide<00:03:48.020> hand<00:03:48.350> and<00:03:48.860> the<00:03:48.950> sceetos<00:03:49.250> are

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
dioxide hand and the sceetos are

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.830 
dioxide hand and the sceetos are
actually<00:03:49.640> drawn<00:03:49.850> into<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.270> light<00:03:50.420> somewhat

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
actually drawn into the light somewhat

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.510 
actually drawn into the light somewhat
as<00:03:50.960> well

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
as well

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.430 
as well
now<00:03:52.520> I<00:03:52.550> mentioned<00:03:52.970> it<00:03:53.060> earlier<00:03:53.600> but<00:03:53.870> the<00:03:54.320> inner

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
now I mentioned it earlier but the inner

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.740 
now I mentioned it earlier but the inner
traps<00:03:54.680> not<00:03:54.860> the<00:03:55.010> only<00:03:55.430> device<00:03:56.360> that<00:03:56.570> uses

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
traps not the only device that uses

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.560 
traps not the only device that uses
carbon<00:03:57.170> dioxide<00:03:57.650> to<00:03:57.830> detect<00:03:58.190> sceetos<00:03:59.060> this<00:03:59.420> is

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
carbon dioxide to detect sceetos this is

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.650 
carbon dioxide to detect sceetos this is
Mosquito<00:04:00.020> Magnet<00:04:00.050> which<00:04:00.980> is<00:04:01.220> an<00:04:02.210> outdoor<00:04:02.540> unit

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
Mosquito Magnet which is an outdoor unit

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.930 
Mosquito Magnet which is an outdoor unit
and<00:04:03.080> how<00:04:03.530> it<00:04:03.680> works<00:04:03.890> is<00:04:04.100> you<00:04:04.130> actually<00:04:04.490> connect

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
and how it works is you actually connect

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.570 
and how it works is you actually connect
it<00:04:05.060> to<00:04:05.210> a<00:04:05.920> propane<00:04:06.920> tank<00:04:07.100> which<00:04:07.310> is<00:04:07.460> your

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
it to a propane tank which is your

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.780 
it to a propane tank which is your
source<00:04:07.820> of<00:04:07.940> co2<00:04:08.350> instead<00:04:09.350> of<00:04:09.440> a<00:04:09.500> light<00:04:09.740> and<00:04:10.010> you

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
source of co2 instead of a light and you

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.840 
source of co2 instead of a light and you
plug<00:04:11.060> it<00:04:11.210> in<00:04:11.330> and<00:04:11.600> it<00:04:11.690> has<00:04:11.810> a<00:04:11.840> fan<00:04:12.580> that<00:04:13.580> will

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
plug it in and it has a fan that will

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.780 
plug it in and it has a fan that will
vacuum<00:04:14.480> up<00:04:14.780> the<00:04:14.870> mosquitoes<00:04:15.350> you<00:04:15.560> also<00:04:16.130> put<00:04:16.460> a

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
vacuum up the mosquitoes you also put a

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.940 
vacuum up the mosquitoes you also put a
tracking<00:04:17.359> in<00:04:17.660> here<00:04:17.900> so<00:04:18.350> you<00:04:18.440> get<00:04:18.530> a<00:04:18.590> plume<00:04:18.920> of

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
tracking in here so you get a plume of

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.300 
tracking in here so you get a plume of
co2<00:04:19.930> with<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.049> attracting<00:04:21.560> and<00:04:21.770> as

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
co2 with the attracting and as

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.920 
co2 with the attracting and as
mosquitoes<00:04:22.790> come<00:04:22.910> close<00:04:23.150> I<00:04:23.360> get<00:04:23.480> sucked<00:04:23.720> up

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
mosquitoes come close I get sucked up

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.090 
mosquitoes come close I get sucked up
and<00:04:24.970> eventually<00:04:25.970> find<00:04:26.210> their<00:04:26.330> way<00:04:26.510> into<00:04:27.100> this

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
and eventually find their way into this

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.120 
and eventually find their way into this
net<00:04:28.400> here<00:04:28.820> and<00:04:29.000> that's<00:04:29.810> how<00:04:30.020> concealed<00:04:30.740> magnet

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
net here and that's how concealed magnet

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.440 
net here and that's how concealed magnet
works<00:04:31.310> so<00:04:31.850> it's<00:04:31.970> a<00:04:32.000> pretty<00:04:32.150> similar

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
works so it's a pretty similar

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.720 
works so it's a pretty similar
technology<00:04:33.020> to<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.290> inner<00:04:33.470> trap<00:04:33.770> however

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
technology to the inner trap however

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.340 
technology to the inner trap however
this<00:04:34.910> is<00:04:35.090> actually<00:04:35.210> a<00:04:35.420> pretty<00:04:35.630> expensive<00:04:35.960> unit

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
this is actually a pretty expensive unit

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.110 
this is actually a pretty expensive unit
to<00:04:36.440> run<00:04:36.590> now<00:04:37.190> where<00:04:37.400> you<00:04:37.610> run<00:04:37.730> in<00:04:37.820> the<00:04:37.910> fan

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
to run now where you run in the fan

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.180 
to run now where you run in the fan
full-time<00:04:38.690> you're<00:04:39.350> also<00:04:39.530> changing<00:04:39.890> out

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
full-time you're also changing out

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.670 
full-time you're also changing out
propane<00:04:40.640> tanks<00:04:41.000> every<00:04:41.240> two<00:04:41.419> weeks<00:04:41.690> so<00:04:41.960> there

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
propane tanks every two weeks so there

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.559 
propane tanks every two weeks so there
is<00:04:42.800> a<00:04:42.830> fair

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:43.569 
is a fair

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:46.159 
is a fair

the roots reviews on Mosquito Magnet are
are<00:04:50.770> kind<00:04:51.009> of<00:04:51.069> mixed<00:04:51.249> I've<00:04:52.149> had<00:04:52.389> some<00:04:52.569> success

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:52.869 
are kind of mixed I've had some success

00:04:52.869 --> 00:04:55.829 
are kind of mixed I've had some success
with<00:04:52.899> it<00:04:53.169> but<00:04:53.439> it<00:04:54.129> is<00:04:54.309> an<00:04:54.490> outdoor<00:04:54.759> unit<00:04:54.819> and<00:04:55.300> it

00:04:55.829 --> 00:04:55.839 
with it but it is an outdoor unit and it

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:57.809 
with it but it is an outdoor unit and it
kind<00:04:56.080> of<00:04:56.169> follows<00:04:56.289> the<00:04:56.770> rule<00:04:57.189> of<00:04:57.309> real<00:04:57.490> estate

00:04:57.809 --> 00:04:57.819 
kind of follows the rule of real estate

00:04:57.819 --> 00:04:59.369 
kind of follows the rule of real estate
it's<00:04:58.449> all<00:04:58.569> about<00:04:58.749> placement<00:04:58.990> placement

00:04:59.369 --> 00:04:59.379 
it's all about placement placement

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:02.070 
it's all about placement placement
placement<00:05:00.129> so<00:05:00.819> it<00:05:01.240> does<00:05:01.389> work<00:05:01.419> for<00:05:01.839> a<00:05:01.869> lot<00:05:02.050> of

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
placement so it does work for a lot of

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.689 
placement so it does work for a lot of
people<00:05:02.409> but<00:05:02.979> other<00:05:03.129> people<00:05:03.399> have<00:05:03.459> been<00:05:03.669> a

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:03.699 
people but other people have been a

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:05.279 
people but other people have been a
little<00:05:03.879> bit<00:05:03.969> more<00:05:03.999> disappointed<00:05:04.779> now<00:05:05.229> the

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
little bit more disappointed now the

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:06.929 
little bit more disappointed now the
unit<00:05:05.589> trap<00:05:05.800> of<00:05:06.009> course<00:05:06.039> is<00:05:06.429> much<00:05:06.699> much<00:05:06.879> smaller

00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:06.939 
unit trap of course is much much smaller

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:09.629 
unit trap of course is much much smaller
it's<00:05:07.809> putting<00:05:08.020> out<00:05:08.110> a<00:05:08.139> much<00:05:08.379> less<00:05:08.649> amount<00:05:09.039> of

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
it's putting out a much less amount of

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.199 
it's putting out a much less amount of
co2<00:05:09.879> so<00:05:10.809> it's<00:05:11.229> strictly<00:05:11.529> for<00:05:12.219> indoors<00:05:12.550> but

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:13.209 
co2 so it's strictly for indoors but

00:05:13.209 --> 00:05:15.929 
co2 so it's strictly for indoors but
keep<00:05:13.659> in<00:05:13.779> mind<00:05:13.959> too<00:05:14.139> placement<00:05:14.800> just<00:05:15.789> like

00:05:15.929 --> 00:05:15.939 
keep in mind too placement just like

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:18.329 
keep in mind too placement just like

last words about the in a trap buy in a
day<00:05:25.050> first<00:05:26.050> of<00:05:26.169> all<00:05:26.289> we<00:05:26.529> saw<00:05:26.919> that<00:05:27.069> works<00:05:27.369> we

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729 
day first of all we saw that works we

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:28.859 
day first of all we saw that works we
saw<00:05:27.909> that<00:05:28.029> there<00:05:28.180> other<00:05:28.300> products<00:05:28.719> out<00:05:28.809> there

00:05:28.859 --> 00:05:28.869 
saw that there other products out there

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:31.399 
saw that there other products out there
that<00:05:28.990> are<00:05:29.169> similar<00:05:29.349> and<00:05:29.740> how<00:05:30.219> it<00:05:30.369> works<00:05:30.580> now

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:31.409 
that are similar and how it works now

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:33.209 
that are similar and how it works now
one<00:05:32.409> of<00:05:32.499> the<00:05:32.559> things<00:05:32.740> you<00:05:32.830> need<00:05:32.949> to<00:05:33.039> remember

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:33.219 
one of the things you need to remember

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:35.850 
one of the things you need to remember
is<00:05:33.520> that<00:05:34.059> you<00:05:34.599> know<00:05:34.689> mosquitoes<00:05:35.529> are

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
is that you know mosquitoes are

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.939 
is that you know mosquitoes are
attracted<00:05:36.339> to<00:05:36.879> light<00:05:36.909> but<00:05:37.449> only<00:05:37.599> so-so<00:05:38.080> that's

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:38.949 
attracted to light but only so-so that's

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:40.980 
attracted to light but only so-so that's
why<00:05:39.129> they<00:05:39.279> don't<00:05:39.399> bug<00:05:40.029> zappers<00:05:40.569> don't<00:05:40.749> kill

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
why they don't bug zappers don't kill

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.249 
why they don't bug zappers don't kill
mosquitoes<00:05:41.819> it<00:05:42.819> does<00:05:43.029> have<00:05:43.330> a<00:05:43.360> source<00:05:43.959> of<00:05:44.080> co2

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:44.259 
mosquitoes it does have a source of co2

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:46.589 
mosquitoes it does have a source of co2
but<00:05:44.679> as<00:05:44.769> we<00:05:44.889> saw<00:05:45.069> the<00:05:45.729> amount<00:05:45.879> of<00:05:45.969> co2<00:05:46.209> coming

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:46.599 
but as we saw the amount of co2 coming

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:49.889 
but as we saw the amount of co2 coming
out<00:05:46.749> of<00:05:46.899> this<00:05:47.019> is<00:05:47.430> pretty<00:05:48.430> minor<00:05:48.879> so<00:05:49.629> if<00:05:49.749> you

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:49.899 
out of this is pretty minor so if you

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:51.839 
out of this is pretty minor so if you
were<00:05:49.990> in<00:05:50.080> the<00:05:50.169> same<00:05:50.349> room<00:05:50.409> as<00:05:50.949> the<00:05:51.459> in<00:05:51.550> the<00:05:51.610> trap

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:51.849 
were in the same room as the in the trap

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:54.509 
were in the same room as the in the trap
and<00:05:52.389> I<00:05:52.719> like<00:05:52.959> the<00:05:53.080> hood<00:05:53.259> mosquito<00:05:53.949> still<00:05:54.369> may

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:54.519 
and I like the hood mosquito still may

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:56.939 
and I like the hood mosquito still may
prefer<00:05:54.879> you<00:05:55.089> over<00:05:55.539> the<00:05:55.659> in<00:05:55.749> a<00:05:55.779> trap<00:05:56.050> however

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:56.949 
prefer you over the in a trap however

00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:59.879 
prefer you over the in a trap however
and<00:05:57.189> in<00:05:57.939> a<00:05:58.059> closed<00:05:58.360> room<00:05:58.749> it<00:05:59.409> will<00:05:59.589> probably

00:05:59.879 --> 00:05:59.889 
and in a closed room it will probably

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:01.529 
and in a closed room it will probably
draw<00:06:00.159> them<00:06:00.279> sceetos<00:06:00.610> in<00:06:00.729> and<00:06:00.939> catch<00:06:01.059> them<00:06:01.269> we

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:01.539 
draw them sceetos in and catch them we

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:03.779 
draw them sceetos in and catch them we
saw<00:06:01.719> one<00:06:02.019> that<00:06:02.199> was<00:06:02.349> caught<00:06:02.559> again<00:06:03.339> it<00:06:03.639> was

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:03.789 
saw one that was caught again it was

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:05.489 
saw one that was caught again it was
only<00:06:03.999> one<00:06:04.209> but<00:06:04.419> it<00:06:04.539> was<00:06:04.719> you<00:06:04.990> know<00:06:05.079> a<00:06:05.259> couple

00:06:05.489 --> 00:06:05.499 
only one but it was you know a couple

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:07.949 
only one but it was you know a couple
days<00:06:05.589> of<00:06:05.800> operation<00:06:06.279> in<00:06:06.459> January<00:06:06.699> so<00:06:07.240> we're

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:07.959 
days of operation in January so we're

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:12.329 
days of operation in January so we're
not<00:06:08.139> in<00:06:08.349> prime<00:06:09.009> mosquito<00:06:09.550> times<00:06:11.129> there<00:06:12.129> are

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:12.339 
not in prime mosquito times there are

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:14.159 
not in prime mosquito times there are
again<00:06:12.819> you<00:06:12.999> know<00:06:13.089> so<00:06:13.360> there<00:06:13.479> are<00:06:13.539> limitations

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:14.169 
again you know so there are limitations

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:16.920 
again you know so there are limitations
to<00:06:14.259> how<00:06:14.769> effective<00:06:15.129> the<00:06:15.519> project<00:06:15.879> can<00:06:15.969> be<00:06:16.119> but

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
to how effective the project can be but

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.449 
to how effective the project can be but
if<00:06:17.139> you're<00:06:17.289> looking<00:06:17.499> for<00:06:17.649> something<00:06:17.829> to<00:06:18.129> take

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:18.459 
if you're looking for something to take

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:21.379 
if you're looking for something to take
out<00:06:19.089> the<00:06:19.329> occasional<00:06:20.229> mosquito<00:06:20.649> in<00:06:20.769> the<00:06:20.860> room

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:21.389 
out the occasional mosquito in the room

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:23.429 
out the occasional mosquito in the room
especially<00:06:22.389> when<00:06:22.539> you're<00:06:22.659> gone<00:06:22.839> to<00:06:23.139> kind<00:06:23.349> of

00:06:23.429 --> 00:06:23.439 
especially when you're gone to kind of

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:25.949 
especially when you're gone to kind of
just<00:06:23.680> if<00:06:24.399> you<00:06:24.519> will<00:06:24.669> just<00:06:24.879> vacuum<00:06:25.300> em<00:06:25.389> up<00:06:25.569> the

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:25.959 
just if you will just vacuum em up the

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:27.659 
just if you will just vacuum em up the
in<00:06:26.050> the<00:06:26.110> traps<00:06:26.349> probably<00:06:26.769> a<00:06:26.979> pretty<00:06:27.339> decent

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:27.669 
in the traps probably a pretty decent

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:30.329 
in the traps probably a pretty decent
option<00:06:28.029> it<00:06:28.479> also<00:06:28.539> looks<00:06:29.169> a<00:06:29.349> nice<00:06:29.680> it's<00:06:30.039> an

00:06:30.329 --> 00:06:30.339 
option it also looks a nice it's an

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:32.369 
option it also looks a nice it's an
attractive<00:06:30.729> nightlight<00:06:31.240> and<00:06:31.719> again<00:06:32.079> it<00:06:32.229> does

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:32.379 
attractive nightlight and again it does

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:34.889 
attractive nightlight and again it does
have<00:06:32.589> technology<00:06:33.550> that's<00:06:34.149> been<00:06:34.300> proven<00:06:34.479> to

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:34.899 
have technology that's been proven to

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:36.569 
have technology that's been proven to
catch<00:06:35.050> mosquitoes<00:06:35.529> so<00:06:36.129> I'm<00:06:36.219> going<00:06:36.339> to<00:06:36.399> give<00:06:36.490> it

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:36.579 
catch mosquitoes so I'm going to give it

00:06:36.579 --> 00:06:38.790 
catch mosquitoes so I'm going to give it
four<00:06:36.789> and<00:06:36.819> a<00:06:36.909> half<00:06:36.939> stars<00:06:37.300> I<00:06:37.599> wish<00:06:38.439> it<00:06:38.619> was<00:06:38.769> a

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
four and a half stars I wish it was a

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.079 
four and a half stars I wish it was a
little<00:06:39.009> bit<00:06:39.129> more<00:06:39.249> powerful<00:06:39.519> than<00:06:39.789> what<00:06:39.909> it<00:06:40.059> is

00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:40.089 
little bit more powerful than what it is

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:43.199 
little bit more powerful than what it is
but<00:06:41.039> there<00:06:42.039> are<00:06:42.069> definitely<00:06:42.550> trade-offs<00:06:43.029> if

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:43.209 
but there are definitely trade-offs if

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:45.299 
but there are definitely trade-offs if
you<00:06:43.300> try<00:06:43.479> to<00:06:43.539> get<00:06:43.689> into<00:06:43.930> more<00:06:44.439> more<00:06:45.039> power

00:06:45.299 --> 00:06:45.309 
you try to get into more more power

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:47.670 
you try to get into more more power
you're<00:06:46.149> going<00:06:46.300> to<00:06:46.360> have<00:06:46.539> you're<00:06:47.499> going<00:06:47.619> to

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 
you're going to have you're going to

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.619 
you're going to have you're going to
have<00:06:47.740> higher<00:06:48.550> power<00:06:48.819> consumption<00:06:49.240> you're

00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:49.629 
have higher power consumption you're

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:52.350 
have higher power consumption you're
going<00:06:49.779> to<00:06:49.869> have<00:06:50.019> a<00:06:50.349> louder<00:06:50.889> fan<00:06:51.309> and<00:06:51.639> really

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360 
going to have a louder fan and really

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.029 
going to have a louder fan and really
how<00:06:52.569> much<00:06:52.689> co2<00:06:52.959> do<00:06:53.379> you<00:06:53.469> really<00:06:53.649> want<00:06:53.860> it<00:06:53.949> to

00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:54.039 
how much co2 do you really want it to

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:56.030 
how much co2 do you really want it to
put<00:06:54.189> out<00:06:54.339> inside

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:56.040 
put out inside

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.790 
put out inside
it's<00:06:56.340> strictly<00:06:57.240> an<00:06:57.510> inside<00:06:57.810> unit<00:06:58.170> you<00:06:58.530> saw<00:06:58.740> the

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 
it's strictly an inside unit you saw the

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.290 
it's strictly an inside unit you saw the
Mosquito<00:06:59.220> Magnet<00:06:59.250> which<00:06:59.700> is<00:06:59.820> the<00:06:59.970> outside

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300 
Mosquito Magnet which is the outside

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.330 
Mosquito Magnet which is the outside
unit<00:07:00.480> so<00:07:00.840> this<00:07:01.320> is<00:07:01.440> only<00:07:01.560> inside<00:07:02.010> so<00:07:02.250> you

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.340 
unit so this is only inside so you

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.970 
unit so this is only inside so you
really<00:07:02.700> don't<00:07:02.910> want<00:07:03.060> to<00:07:03.240> have<00:07:03.480> huge<00:07:04.260> levels<00:07:04.860> of

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:04.980 
really don't want to have huge levels of

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.150 
really don't want to have huge levels of
co2<00:07:05.250> being<00:07:06.120> created<00:07:06.570> in<00:07:06.630> your<00:07:06.720> room<00:07:06.930> but<00:07:07.740> it<00:07:08.010> is

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 
co2 being created in your room but it is

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.370 
co2 being created in your room but it is
pretty<00:07:08.310> effective<00:07:08.460> and<00:07:08.970> and<00:07:09.720> attractive<00:07:10.200> and

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:10.380 
pretty effective and and attractive and

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:13.340 
pretty effective and and attractive and
I'll<00:07:10.470> give<00:07:10.650> the<00:07:10.740> four<00:07:10.920> net<00:07:11.070> stars
