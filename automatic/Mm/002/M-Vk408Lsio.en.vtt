00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.990
 good afternoon friends on this occasion 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.779
 we are in a tutorial to do 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.880
 cleaning or hygiene accessories for 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.929
 the house of the neighborhoods are accessories 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.630
 for the barbies 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.370
 this time we use a toothpick and 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.220
 some feather boa feathers 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.499
 or we bought them and made a duster 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.140
 we cut the toothpick to the extent of the 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:23.939
 barby the feathers we cut them so that 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.919
 they look like a number we gave the touch 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.569
 final with these wires with which you 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.029
 tie in the bread and in this case it is 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:32.099
 golden color we did two first for 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.600
 that the barbie shakes the dust 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.850
 when we have a brush 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.949
 old teeth and we do not know what to do 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.960
 we cut the head we put a 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:43.019
 rectangular activity of rubber eva 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.600
 foami of the same color as the head of the 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:48.449
 toothbrush and resembles a brush 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.789
 to carve the floors in this case 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.280
 we did two the following thing that 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.649
 we did was with our fibers with the 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.530
 which we wash the dishes cut a 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.300
 small rectangle to the size of the barby 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.760
 so that their fibers are their sponges 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.310
 we also discovered that sometimes 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.710
 people have beauty objects 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.050
 like a brush they break and discard them 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.540
 what we did was cut a 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.880
 stick the brochita we use it for 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.280
 resembling a broom we cut it on 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.500
 size of the barrel in the end we gave him the 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.020
 touch with the golden wire so that 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.570
 resembling a broom while we 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.659
 a mop is needed this is a 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.310
 decorative utility object of a lump 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.860
 but you can do it with 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.920
 stamen with some frayed fabric 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.770
 joke is that I like the mop to 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.899
 that the barbie can mop the floor what 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.759
 next we used was a boat of 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.039
 trash if we are going to clean and pick up the 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.970
 trash we need one where to introduce 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.039
 The trash 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.679
 this is a container of sweet very 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.050
 popular we wash it we cut the part of 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:56.390
 up that is the lid and we look for a 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.820
 image that resembles the trash can here 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.490
 there are two people picking up and pulling the 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.500
 trash and we put to protect them and 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.289
 our daughter plays with water a bit of 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.700
 Transparent paper contact the following 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.459
 what we did is be 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.319
 of large toilet paper for when 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.030
 something spills in our kitchen 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.190
 chin is used and we can put it 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.590
 in the dining room we fold the napkins 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.230
 we rolled them up and put paper 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.209
 transparent contact can not equal 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.450
 Missing rolls of toilet paper 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.900
 these are in smaller size so that 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.910
 resemble a toilet paper so 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.490
 proportional to that of the barbie 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.070
 The next thing we used was the most 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.680
 famous yogurt containers for children 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.320
 we cut the top part of him 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.780
 we made two holes with the part that 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.580
 tie the bread in the wrapper 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.440
 plastic we made the handle 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:53.120
 we have two buckets in an easy way 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.770
 also our towels that we no longer 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.710
 serve, do not have holes 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.560
 weathered by use cut strips 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:03.470
 rectangular, they look like a rag and 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.590
 the texture and fiber of what is the 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:10.700
 towel help the barby to clean 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.860
 also our cotton shirts that 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.260
 no longer serve us we use rectangles 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.470
 and we cut cloths so that the barbie 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.140
 can clean it is important to remind them 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.750

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.870
