little<00:02:18.020> bit<00:02:18.170> I<00:02:18.440> don't<00:02:18.890> know<00:02:18.950> why<00:02:19.160> that<00:02:19.900> this

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
little bit I don't know why that this

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.190 
little bit I don't know why that this
camera<00:02:21.410> will<00:02:21.440> not<00:02:21.830> focus<00:02:22.390> at<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.480> moment<00:02:23.660> but

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.040 
anyway it's messed up the serrations so
we're<00:02:27.320> going<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:27.530> do<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.650> paper<00:02:27.980> cut<00:02:28.370> test
