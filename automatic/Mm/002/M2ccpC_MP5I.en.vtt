Watford<00:02:43.650> background<00:02:44.010> well<00:02:44.280> very<00:02:44.489> much<00:02:44.640> so<00:02:44.760> I

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
Watford background well very much so I

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.880

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
think that this is the the World Cup now

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.280 
think that this is the the World Cup now
the<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.370> world<00:02:47.579> stage<00:02:47.910> that<00:02:48.269> John<00:02:49.079> should

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
the the world stage that John should

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.280 
the the world stage that John should
just<00:02:49.500> be<00:02:49.650> about<00:02:49.739> ready<00:02:50.160> for<00:02:50.459> I<00:02:50.760> mean<00:02:51.329> if<00:02:52.110> we

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
his skill but the strength of the man as

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.550 
his skill but the strength of the man as
well<00:02:56.549> here<00:02:57.299> we<00:02:57.480> know<00:02:57.630> all<00:02:57.810> about<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.170> freakish

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
well here we know all about the freakish

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.470 
well here we know all about the freakish
ability<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:59.220> get<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.519> up<00:02:59.640> early<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.030> drop<00:03:00.299> it

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
ability to get it up early and drop it

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.710 
ability to get it up early and drop it
in<00:03:01.700> very<00:03:02.700> good<00:03:02.910> frequent<00:03:03.299> but<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.450> strength

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
in very good frequent but the strength

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.289 
in very good frequent but the strength
here<00:03:03.989> I<00:03:04.019> think<00:03:04.319> he'll<00:03:05.220> knock<00:03:05.519> off<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.970> the

here I think he'll knock off the the
full-back<00:03:07.049> there's<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.290> lot<00:03:07.470> stronger<00:03:07.920> boy

everything that he's got I think that

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:56.319 
everything that he's got I think that
that<00:03:52.200> that<00:03:52.560> possibly<00:03:53.370> is<00:03:53.579> his<00:03:53.760> best<00:03:54.030> position

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329
