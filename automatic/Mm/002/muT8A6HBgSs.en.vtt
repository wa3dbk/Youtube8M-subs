00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:13.100
 let's make a baker's coca 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:18.110
 The ingredients are 10 grams of 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:21.210
 fresh yeast and in sections of sugar 25 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:26.060
 grams of olive oil 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:30.570
 50 grams of water and 50 grams of milk 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:33.510
 200 grams of force flour one 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.800
 little pinch of salt and for coverage 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.100
 end again olive oil sugar 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.340
 and anise liqueur 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.390
 as you see all the ingredients I have 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.930
 given grams 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.890
 keep it in mind when it comes to 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.500
 prepare the dessert is grams 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.410
 in the container where we have the 200 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.730
 grams of force flour we add the 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.730
 10 grams of sugar 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.409
 the 10 grams of olive oil 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:17.120
 but 25 olive oil 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:20.000
 50 milk 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.080
 at 50 of water in which we have 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.080
 dissolved fresh yeast 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.670
 and a pinch of salt 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.470
 now let's beat these very well 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.570
 ingredients to make a house 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.100
 and for this we are going to use in this case 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.900
 the rods although we could also 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.900
 do with the hand 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:58.280
 we have been about five minutes kneading 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:01.940
 the mass and you see 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.880
 what is good to work and here elastic 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.620
 it does not stick then now we do it like that 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.030
 a little ball 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.030
 and we are going to leave it 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.980
 to a plate and we're going to cover it with 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:20.040
 film paper leaving it 30 minutes until 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.110
 that double the volume and then 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.650
 we will continue so now we are going to 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.650
 put yes 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:33.140
 we put it like that 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.930
 touching him on foot so that he is not 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.420
 crust but it's always because it has 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.460
 that raise the mass that hour 30 minutes of 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.410
 repose 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.540
 after the fermentation time 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.420
 you see how I doubled the volume 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.780
 mass so now we are going to remove the 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.780
 film 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.980
 and in a vegetal paper we are going to 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.980
 to overturn 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.439
 and now let's stretch it with your hands 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:23.099
 the shape of this cake is irregular 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.099
 that is, it does not have to be round or 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.070
 now little by little we are going to help you 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:50.350
 we already have the mass stretched there 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:53.440
 to leave him like that with his fingers 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:56.380
 irregularly and now we are going to 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.430
 take a generous bullshit of oil 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.430
 olive above 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:11.220
 and sprinkle well of sugar 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.760
 by the plaintiff 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:24.990
 we have to let it rest again 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:28.380
 this mass 15 or 20 minutes 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.550
 and later baking we have but 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.240
 now for the moment we have to go back to 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.240
 let it rest 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:39.549
 he has already spent about 15 minutes of rest 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:42.219
 you see how it has risen again it has returned 

00:04:39.549 --> 00:04:45.669
 to ferment now let's preheat the 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:48.909
 180 degree oven we will introduce in the 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:51.429
 second height below our mouth and 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:56.109
 we will have it in the oven about 15 minutes 

00:04:51.429 --> 00:04:59.670
 but 5 minutes before finishing 

00:04:56.109 --> 00:05:02.790
 bake we will add the anise 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:05.860
 so now preheat the oven and a 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.990
 once preheated we will introduce you 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.889
 10 minutes have passed in the oven 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:17.409
 you see what it looks like and now we're going to 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:20.610
 we are going to stick a little with anise 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:20.610
 with sight 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.560
 Bah 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.600
 Now we return to put it in the oven other 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.420
 5 minutes approximately until it 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.880
 finish this is the final result of 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.340
 our baker coca now 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.850
 just wait for it to cool down to 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.110
 to be able to taste it is super simple 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.900
 you see that he has no 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:49.290
 complication 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.860
 and good to see if you tell me that the 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.860
 you have done
