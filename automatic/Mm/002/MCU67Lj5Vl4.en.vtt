00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
suppose but it's just one of them things

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.870 
suppose but it's just one of them things
where<00:01:42.440> you<00:01:42.500> go<00:01:42.590> through<00:01:42.800> these<00:01:42.890> questions<00:01:43.400> get

where you go through these questions get

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.340 
where you go through these questions get
money<00:01:44.090> in<00:01:44.210> order<00:01:44.390> get<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.750> most<00:01:44.900> money<00:01:44.990> wins

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
money in order get the most money wins

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.289 
money in order get the most money wins
however<00:01:45.979> the<00:01:46.280> lot<00:01:46.400> of<00:01:46.490> different<00:01:46.820> boards<00:01:47.150> to

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
however the lot of different boards to

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.270 
however the lot of different boards to
be<00:01:47.420> there<00:01:47.600> there's<00:01:48.170> a<00:01:48.229> a<00:01:48.530> wheel<00:01:48.799> which<00:01:49.010> you<00:01:49.130> can

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
be there there's a a wheel which you can

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.770 
be there there's a a wheel which you can
do<00:01:49.400> which<00:01:49.640> I'll<00:01:49.820> just<00:01:50.000> try<00:01:50.450> and<00:01:50.479> show<00:01:50.690> you<00:01:50.750> now

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
do which I'll just try and show you now

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.330 
do which I'll just try and show you now
so<00:01:53.780> here<00:01:53.930> we<00:01:53.960> go<00:01:54.049> land<00:01:54.350> this<00:01:54.590> is<00:01:54.740> getting<00:01:55.159> up<00:01:55.220> to

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
so here we go land this is getting up to

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.770 
so here we go land this is getting up to
spin<00:01:55.520> in<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:55.700> world<00:01:55.880> basically<00:01:56.510> you<00:01:56.630> can

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
spin in the world basically you can

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.149 
spin in the world basically you can
choose<00:01:56.960> to<00:01:56.990> do<00:01:57.200> it<00:01:57.320> if<00:01:57.409> you<00:01:57.470> want<00:01:57.500> it<00:01:57.799> or<00:01:58.010> not

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
choose to do it if you want it or not

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.390 
choose to do it if you want it or not
but<00:01:58.820> you<00:01:59.390> may<00:01:59.510> be<00:01:59.540> wondering<00:01:59.960> why<00:02:00.320> like<00:02:00.770> to<00:02:00.950> try

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
but you may be wondering why like to try

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.980 
but you may be wondering why like to try
like<00:02:01.760> a<00:02:01.790> hard<00:02:02.090> choice<00:02:02.299> well<00:02:02.630> basically

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
like a hard choice well basically

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.660 
like a hard choice well basically
because<00:02:03.320> sometimes<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:04.040> wheel<00:02:04.159> can<00:02:04.400> help<00:02:04.549> you

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
because sometimes the wheel can help you

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.660 
because sometimes the wheel can help you
out<00:02:04.700> so<00:02:05.360> I

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
out so I

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.399 
out so I

more<00:02:43.410> for<00:02:43.890> complete<00:02:44.130> torching<00:02:44.580> or<00:02:44.700> after

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
more for complete torching or after

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.460 
more for complete torching or after
shine<00:02:45.090> it<00:02:45.209> over<00:02:45.299> very<00:02:45.510> quickly<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:46.110> try<00:02:46.350> and

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
shine it over very quickly to try and

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.590 
shine it over very quickly to try and
find<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.860> answers<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:48.090> I<00:02:48.120> have<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.360> put<00:02:48.510> you

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
find the answers so I have to put you

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.630 
find the answers so I have to put you
Mike<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:48.989> then<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.620> final<00:02:49.650> mode<00:02:50.190> is<00:02:50.430> just

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
Mike and then the final mode is just

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.280 
Mike and then the final mode is just
basically<00:02:51.000> where<00:02:51.450> it's<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.810> first<00:02:52.049> tip

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
basically where it's the first tip

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.050 
basically where it's the first tip
whoever<00:02:52.650> gets<00:02:52.709> five<00:02:53.069> questions<00:02:53.519> right<00:02:53.730> out<00:02:54.000> of

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
whoever gets five questions right out of

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.570 
whoever gets five questions right out of
the<00:02:54.299> 2m<00:02:54.690> well<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.709> two<00:02:55.860> champions<00:02:56.310> it's<00:02:56.489> the

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
the 2m well the two champions it's the

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.979 
the 2m well the two champions it's the
first<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.880> get<00:02:56.970> five<00:02:57.180> questions<00:02:57.600> right<00:02:57.750> wing's

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
first to get five questions right wing's

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.539 
first to get five questions right wing's
so<00:02:58.590> that's<00:02:58.769> pretty<00:02:59.010> much<00:02:59.130> everything<00:02:59.519> there

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
so that's pretty much everything there

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.580 
so that's pretty much everything there
is<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.819> see<00:02:59.850> unfortunately<00:03:00.239> it's<00:03:00.870> very<00:03:01.140> basic

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
is to see unfortunately it's very basic

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.930 
is to see unfortunately it's very basic
game<00:03:01.739> but<00:03:01.890> at<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.040> same<00:03:02.160> time<00:03:02.340> it's<00:03:02.519> quite<00:03:02.700> fun

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
game but at the same time it's quite fun

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.130 
game but at the same time it's quite fun
and<00:03:03.269> I<00:03:03.390> really<00:03:03.420> should<00:03:03.750> be<00:03:03.840> paying<00:03:03.989> attention

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
and I really should be paying attention

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.259
