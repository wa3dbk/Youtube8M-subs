00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.009 
conditioning unit it's sitting up there
there<00:02:18.470> you've<00:02:18.620> got<00:02:18.650> your<00:02:19.269> diesel<00:02:21.340> strainer

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
there you've got your diesel strainer

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:28.979 
there you've got your diesel strainer
water<00:02:24.019> intake<00:02:24.410> strainer<00:02:24.820> and<00:02:27.340> there's<00:02:28.340> the

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
water intake strainer and there's the

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.539 
water intake strainer and there's the
just<00:02:29.989> four-cylinder<00:02:30.650> diesel<00:02:30.799> engine<00:02:31.370> that's

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
just four-cylinder diesel engine that's

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.789 
just four-cylinder diesel engine that's
all<00:02:31.730> it<00:02:31.910> runs<00:02:32.120> that<00:02:32.330> these<00:02:32.570> are<00:02:32.930> displacement

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
all it runs that these are displacement

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:39.039 
all it runs that these are displacement
but<00:02:34.010> so<00:02:34.810> they're<00:02:35.810> very<00:02:36.340> fuel-efficient<00:02:38.049> when

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
but so they're very fuel-efficient when

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.220 
but so they're very fuel-efficient when
I<00:02:39.079> was<00:02:39.320> chartering<00:02:39.860> my<00:02:40.100> boats<00:02:40.370> ran<00:02:41.079> half<00:02:42.079> a
