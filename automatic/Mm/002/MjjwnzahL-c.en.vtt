targeted is you were
shooting<00:02:11.720> it<00:02:11.870> isn't<00:02:12.620> going<00:02:12.740> to<00:02:12.800> have<00:02:13.040> their

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
shooting it isn't going to have their

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.000 
shooting it isn't going to have their
shields<00:02:13.760> back<00:02:13.910> if<00:02:14.180> they<00:02:14.540> have<00:02:14.810> shields<00:02:15.290> simply

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
shields back if they have shields simply

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.979 
shields back if they have shields simply
because<00:02:16.160> they've<00:02:16.700> been<00:02:16.730> taking<00:02:17.300> dot<00:02:17.540> damage

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
because they've been taking dot damage

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.479 
because they've been taking dot damage
the<00:02:18.140> whole<00:02:18.319> time<00:02:18.620> that<00:02:18.830> you<00:02:19.010> were<00:02:19.130> recovering

the whole time that you were recovering

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.940 
the whole time that you were recovering
and<00:02:19.940> they're<00:02:20.630> still<00:02:20.930> probably<00:02:21.290> going<00:02:21.739> to<00:02:21.830> be

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
and they're still probably going to be

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.920 
and they're still probably going to be
taking<00:02:22.400> that<00:02:22.520> dot<00:02:22.819> damage<00:02:23.239> when<00:02:23.390> you<00:02:23.510> come<00:02:23.750> out

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
taking that dot damage when you come out

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.800 
taking that dot damage when you come out
to<00:02:24.080> fire<00:02:24.319> upon<00:02:24.560> them<00:02:24.920> again<00:02:25.280> so<00:02:25.700> in<00:02:25.910> PvE<00:02:26.360> this

to fire upon them again so in PvE this
is<00:02:26.959> really<00:02:27.319> going<00:02:27.530> to<00:02:27.620> be<00:02:27.770> useful<00:02:27.980> for<00:02:28.190> taking

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
is really going to be useful for taking
