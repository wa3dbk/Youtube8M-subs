00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:07.750
 good the cocca team that has two 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.340
 realities or until now had because the 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.590
 liberators cup a steamroller and 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.990
 it was costing defeat and draw in the 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.770
 local tournament and today it cost a lot 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.930
 even though I started winning 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.510
 early at 4 minutes already 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.660
 I found with this much of frames 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.850
 coins 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:31.890
 very cute seven play touches of 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:33.930
 racing very early to accommodate in the 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.750
 champion's house 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.960
 there is another crivelli attempt that was 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.390
 sure in that 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.230
 caught here could not and luck when 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.140
 a scorer is sweet because he defines badly 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.329
 but ends up being equal boudou the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.220
 people are crazy as it is advanced 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.780
 That's what the monkey from Navarra told us 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.489
 the Navarrese monkey is ahead 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.960
 montoya used to say that the worst thing that 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.640
 can happen to an archer is that the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.150
 front define badly because you do not know 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.070
 where will the ball come from boy 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.810
 it was getting ahead there are two cameras 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.690
 soccer for all the second chamber of 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.790
 sample was behind gentlemen and 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.610
 there we saw that template had its 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.080
 opportunities always won over 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.520
 had the chances racing could increase in 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.020
 the first time the difference was 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.369
 two goals seemed like they were matches 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.170
 closed but we will find another 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.960
 reality in the second time put the 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.960
 best thing on court put almost everything 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.759
 the best militated could not play them have them 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.880
 penalty that they did not charge to temporary and 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.200
 but huge pain with and with 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.119
 capital letters serve in that I do not understand 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.409
 unusual what is the criterion for not 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.619
 charge is wait or is there 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.509
 Saul Laverni was on that move he was 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.499
 Far away I'm unlucky with laverni 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.499
 I will never direct it well 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:00.119
 discounted temperley with grass goal 

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:00.119
 already the party 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:07.420
 in the last chapter but he did the 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.700
 necessary is valued very badly in front 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.020
 temperley was fought dignity of a 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.239
 team that is making its first 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.140
 weapons in the first division but that left 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.850
 the life 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.980
 in the second time because not even 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.050
 it seems they have it dominated every night 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.660
 without fatigue but maybe we did not know 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.340
 read how they came out for that quickly 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.540
 now what we wanted to say when the 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.819
 same way as the first time that what 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.230
 we did pretty good but well no 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.819
 it came out more in the second and well I think that 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.800
 that there grabbed a boost after 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.720
 all one and then with the question 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.400
 also de lolo I think it's a milestone 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.110
 very difficult 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.680
 in December he wants you he is getting 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.239
 a little pressure 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.060
 this will continue to demonstrate first has 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.060
 shown the heart 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:57.220
 hooked a criminal polemic for me if 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.000
 the fourth referee is there he can 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.000
 He said asking say
