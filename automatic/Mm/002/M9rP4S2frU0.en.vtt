00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 and it's everybody's dreams nico 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.650
 good today for a new video 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.299
 is today 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.429
 today before starting this 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.960
 video I wanted to show you I wanted 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.120
 tell you something so here I have 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.429
 put a playlist of entries for the 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.560
 moment of touques and 16 so I was leaving 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.240
 not my videos but I try them 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.609
 videos of ign so that's it's a 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.619
 chain that puts a lot of games finally kim 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.210
 is even everything that is 16 and elbow in 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.939
 mass or go on my chain will have 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.390
 marked touques and 16 in hygiene trance 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.640
 So here in case you missed to 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.600
 intro of the entries and especially that I 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.100
 am young but a lot of emptiness in this 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.300
 moment so it's a little difficult to 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.590
 go back to see something 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.850
 so here I invite you to go on my 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.640
 fall I had not seen you entries 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.260
 of touques and 16 for the moment and that's it 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.239
 I will also say that everyone 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.460
 I was able to do it I did not want to 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.440
 do after all that's what 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.940
 I saw all and 16 I do not have any more 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.430
 want to finally do I do not know what 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.039
 make video your matches it will be 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.239
 and that's really too long anyway 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.250
 me it was just to tell you this is 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.750

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.309

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.360

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.740
 intro before the intro so there we go 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.290
 find today look at this 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.430
 image jones inna is the first picture 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.560
 from the first what do I say to 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.310
 first images of john sinaoui justin 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.740
 with his cap 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.690
 the title is full of new stuff and 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.780
 frankly it looks too good 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.789
 go to sin cara mk list of course 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.220
 that they have confirmed the entry and on my 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.930
 chain and on the chain ign bluntly 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.780
 they are both done well then 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.009
 we'll go to games week and what about 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.840
 kane he is so well done his 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.759
 last his last to his last 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.560
 appearances was like that and he's 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.289
 too well done as in real life 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.409
 we spent jones he once again and 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.580
 the face sends the face as especially 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.740
 someone finally dares especially that a 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.869
 clown is a little better but hey there 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.330
 we see that johnson was a little bit 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.000
 improving a little a small pan 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.959
 he misses the broken nose and the game of 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.299
 political game show 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.910
 that's where confirmed he too good he has the 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.400
 hair in shaved mode finally voila but he 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.690
 is he looks so good 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.150
 chocolate behind one finds of course 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.950
 nsync calysto haras frankly who 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.530
 looks hard to the lions of the group 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.570
 so we're talking about anyway 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.560
 new of the new doug screen and 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.109
 that's what really looks 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.390
 great right now not so 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:35.250
 Frankly I am voting for the 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.780
 super slam access it when he advertises 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.829
 have remained tighter beginnings in 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.930
 the entries because if he puts us 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:42.959
 full of entries already advanced marc slime 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.930
 down we are going to be spoiled so frankly 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.940
 very pleased for the moment of this game in 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.790
 any case characters after we can 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.130
 not know about gameplay and games 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.600
 functions that yielded bug or not at all 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.760
 case I hope this video will have pleased you 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.549
 thank you for watching if there are others 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.680
 infos screenshots or gameplay I 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.030
 you would do that on video for what he 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.709
 these are the entries as I told you 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.660
 before it will be in on my channel you 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.160
 will see scored everything that is 16 in trance 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.660
 hygiene or so you go on the 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.519
 chain of hygiene but it's going to be hard 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.400
 to find them for the manga that three 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:18.230
 entries kallistos and rollins and 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.150
 finb so I think it's a 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.740
 caravan well and coming back soon be 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.720
 but since there is calisto that comes from 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.970
 to leave is frankly the one I have 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.410

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.760
