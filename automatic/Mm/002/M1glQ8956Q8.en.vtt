00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.709

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.649
 find well this is a tutor of 

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:08.690
 request a pigment them amiguita 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.530
 I teach you teach each one is new 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:15.530
 clinical I bought is ari 6 system 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:17.450
 and well let's start well and well 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.680
 full yes but look what is going to happen 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.120
 after 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.250
 this is one with nothing more of it 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.590
 acrylic that I show you and right now I'm going to 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.810
 make a mixture with clear and color 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.490
 natural are different brands it does not matter 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.890
 the thing that are a little known 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.290
 so that the acrylic is a little good and 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.480
 the yellowish here I'm going to take two or 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.910
 three teaspoons of the clear and in the other 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.860
 I'll take two to three too 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.200
 of the natural color I'm going to grab a 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.210
 pigment and I happen to have 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.640
 this same color can be done with 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.120
 shadow or pigment but it has to be 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.460
 well diluted for not this one so that it does not 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.350
 see small groups of pigment color in 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.880
 this case look what chance this is 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.150
 the same color of that acrylic that I 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.950
 I have 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.720
 and acrylic is a mba that has the 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.300
 very nice container and all good gen yes 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.550
 but look what will happen to 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.750
 then now I tell you from 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.780
 right now if I had thrown a 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.090
 little white acrylic that mix 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.210
 in natural color would have left igualita 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.070
 to the east acrylic that I bought for that 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.910
 I thought it was going to be something else but 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.380
 unfortunately I realized that the 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.620
 acrylics when one does it well 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.310
 Charged with the pigment, it is the same 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.650
 to mixtures that one buys color or 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.690
 with pigment in this case this pigment 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.820
 it has a little pearl color and has 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.369
 glitter as I show you here in this 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.630
 palette and there's a green color too 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.520
 and well I wanted to do with the pigment 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.950
 but now they will see next 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.979
 the results beat well and they will see 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.320
 the results that one can do 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.420
 your mix this little friend I ask myself 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.430
 I had taught that palette that I taught them 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.050
 and had not done in that same video 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.840
 because I did not want to be very long but 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.399
 now 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.829
 this request is from her and here 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.520
 I show with an acrylic that I bought and 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:09.610
 doing this goes out and automatically 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.910
 well well just the colors do not 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.040
 it removes nothing to other acrylics effect that 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.019
 have to use good product girls 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.319
 because if it does not go yellow, 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.450
 nail 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.719
 how will the colors be known as they are used 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.280
 lower part of the nail skirt and if the 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:27.709
 they want to put in their true nail 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.659
 then they have to have a basis for 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.139
 that you do not experience color to your 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:35.900
 true nail as you see because here is with 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:37.370
 the natural color of natural color with a 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.409
 little white would have been good 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.560
 similar to that acrylic but I wanted it 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:44.419
 do so so you can see the difference 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.519
 I hope you like this video and how do you 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:50.020
 I say if you are going to combine pigments to 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:52.150
 well loaded and do it with good product 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.550
 so that you do not suffer detachment and that 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.380
 they look prettier look is totally 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.360
 just the colors until the glitter 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.940
 which can be seen in this video 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.400
 good friends but up here haberte 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.380
 taken from doubts to everyone who wants 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.660
