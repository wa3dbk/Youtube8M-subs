length<00:03:14.329> and<00:03:14.569> speed<00:03:14.840> as<00:03:15.440> you<00:03:15.620> can<00:03:15.739> see<00:03:15.950> here

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
length and speed as you can see here

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.170 
length and speed as you can see here
down<00:03:16.250> below<00:03:16.870> so<00:03:17.870> we<00:03:17.900> can<00:03:18.049> see<00:03:18.500> which<00:03:19.130> app<00:03:19.459> gets

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
down below so we can see which app gets

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.580 
down below so we can see which app gets
you<00:03:20.359> a<00:03:20.389> notification<00:03:20.630> without<00:03:21.230> even<00:03:21.530> having

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
you a notification without even having

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.990 
you a notification without even having
to<00:03:21.739> turn<00:03:21.980> on<00:03:22.130> the<00:03:22.220> screen<00:03:22.459> this<00:03:22.639> is<00:03:22.730> a<00:03:22.790> pretty

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
to turn on the screen this is a pretty

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.729 
to turn on the screen this is a pretty
handy<00:03:23.480> and<00:03:23.569> useful<00:03:23.870> feature<00:03:24.079> really<00:03:24.470> wouldn't

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
handy and useful feature really wouldn't

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.440 
handy and useful feature really wouldn't
want<00:03:24.799> to<00:03:24.919> miss<00:03:25.040> out<00:03:25.250> and<00:03:25.430> I'm<00:03:25.519> always<00:03:25.760> using<00:03:25.910> it

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
want to miss out and I'm always using it

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.539 
want to miss out and I'm always using it
since<00:03:26.629> I<00:03:26.810> have<00:03:26.959> it<00:03:27.079> absolutely<00:03:27.829> perfect<00:03:28.489> for

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
since I have it absolutely perfect for

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.280 
since I have it absolutely perfect for
this<00:03:28.819> enough<00:03:29.209> with<00:03:29.419> the<00:03:29.569> features<00:03:29.900> let's<00:03:30.079> talk

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
this enough with the features let's talk

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.050 
this enough with the features let's talk
about<00:03:30.410> performance<00:03:31.040> and<00:03:31.160> battery<00:03:31.250> life<00:03:31.609> it's

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
about performance and battery life it's

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.300 
about performance and battery life it's
a<00:03:32.239> nexus<00:03:32.569> 5<00:03:32.810> so<00:03:33.109> as<00:03:33.349> you<00:03:33.709> can<00:03:33.859> expect

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
a nexus 5 so as you can expect

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.330 
a nexus 5 so as you can expect
performance<00:03:34.940> it's<00:03:35.329> pretty<00:03:35.720> much<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.440> same<00:03:37.129> as

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
performance it's pretty much the same as

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.400 
performance it's pretty much the same as
on<00:03:37.459> every<00:03:37.730> other<00:03:37.849> run<00:03:38.150> by<00:03:38.269> now<00:03:38.480> it<00:03:38.720> is<00:03:38.959> using<00:03:39.349> a

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
on every other run by now it is using a

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.099 
on every other run by now it is using a
stock<00:03:39.680> run<00:03:39.919> also<00:03:40.069> its<00:03:40.220> back<00:03:40.549> pretty<00:03:40.790> much

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
stock run also its back pretty much

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.050 
stock run also its back pretty much
slightly<00:03:42.109> enhanced<00:03:42.230> stock<00:03:42.859> performance<00:03:43.220> the

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
slightly enhanced stock performance the

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.300 
slightly enhanced stock performance the
same<00:03:44.660> goes<00:03:44.870> for<00:03:45.109> the<00:03:45.139> battery<00:03:45.349> life<00:03:45.650> you<00:03:46.099> get

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
same goes for the battery life you get

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.830 
same goes for the battery life you get
about<00:03:46.519> a<00:03:46.579> dead<00:03:46.849> battery<00:03:47.060> life<00:03:47.269> essence<00:03:47.629> talk

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
about a dead battery life essence talk

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.900 
about a dead battery life essence talk
slightly<00:03:48.319> more<00:03:48.560> because<00:03:48.919> of<00:03:48.949> the<00:03:49.310> internal

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
slightly more because of the internal

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.809 
slightly more because of the internal
optimizations<00:03:50.510> of<00:03:50.629> the<00:03:50.750> room<00:03:50.930> so<00:03:51.470> if<00:03:51.859> you<00:03:52.430> are

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
optimizations of the room so if you are

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.520 
optimizations of the room so if you are
used<00:03:53.180> to<00:03:53.269> any<00:03:53.449> stock<00:03:53.720> rom<00:03:53.930> or<00:03:54.019> maybe<00:03:54.230> any<00:03:54.470> other

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
used to any stock rom or maybe any other

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.250 
used to any stock rom or maybe any other
customer<00:03:54.889> expect<00:03:55.669> about<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:55.970> same<00:03:56.209> but<00:03:56.840> be

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
customer expect about the same but be

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.500 
customer expect about the same but be
aware<00:03:57.349> using<00:03:58.340> custom<00:03:58.760> kernel<00:03:59.060> you<00:03:59.150> definitely

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
aware using custom kernel you definitely

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.030 
aware using custom kernel you definitely
can<00:03:59.660> get<00:03:59.810> more<00:04:00.019> out<00:04:00.169> of<00:04:00.199> it<00:04:00.379> slightly<00:04:00.769> more

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
can get more out of it slightly more

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.680 
can get more out of it slightly more
power<00:04:01.250> and<00:04:01.519> also<00:04:01.879> slightly<00:04:02.120> more<00:04:02.419> battery

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
power and also slightly more battery

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.319 
power and also slightly more battery
life<00:04:02.750> so<00:04:03.560> in<00:04:03.739> the<00:04:03.859> end<00:04:03.980> you<00:04:04.519> can<00:04:04.760> use<00:04:04.970> this<00:04:05.150> I

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
life so in the end you can use this I

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.240 
life so in the end you can use this I
used<00:04:05.540> it<00:04:05.780> with<00:04:05.900> the<00:04:06.049> custom<00:04:06.379> kernel<00:04:06.680> for<00:04:06.829> over

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
used it with the custom kernel for over

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.460 
used it with the custom kernel for over
almost<00:04:07.609> a<00:04:07.940> month<00:04:08.120> and<00:04:08.389> I<00:04:08.629> had<00:04:08.750> no<00:04:08.930> problem<00:04:09.349> it

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
almost a month and I had no problem it

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.680 
almost a month and I had no problem it
was<00:04:09.590> way<00:04:09.889> that<00:04:10.340> fast<00:04:10.669> enough<00:04:10.940> for<00:04:11.120> me<00:04:11.269> the

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
was way that fast enough for me the

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.509 
was way that fast enough for me the
better<00:04:11.870> life<00:04:12.169> was<00:04:12.349> weighed<00:04:12.769> and<00:04:12.980> good<00:04:13.280> enough

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
better life was weighed and good enough

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.220 
better life was weighed and good enough
for<00:04:13.669> me<00:04:13.790> so<00:04:14.120> I<00:04:14.150> didn't<00:04:14.480> really<00:04:14.540> even<00:04:14.780> see<00:04:15.019> any

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
for me so I didn't really even see any

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.670 
for me so I didn't really even see any
need<00:04:15.440> but<00:04:15.859> if<00:04:15.980> you<00:04:16.070> want<00:04:16.280> to

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
need but if you want to

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.680 
need but if you want to
go<00:04:16.979> for<00:04:17.190> custom<00:04:17.549> come<00:04:17.699> and<00:04:17.940> have<00:04:18.090> even<00:04:18.299> more

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
go for custom come and have even more

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.659 
go for custom come and have even more
fun<00:04:18.750> with<00:04:19.289> the<00:04:19.500> wrong<00:04:19.680> contrary<00:04:20.310> to<00:04:20.370> most

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
fun with the wrong contrary to most

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.760 
fun with the wrong contrary to most
other<00:04:20.910> rooms<00:04:21.239> I<00:04:21.479> used<00:04:21.720> this<00:04:21.930> one<00:04:22.139> for<00:04:22.350> almost<00:04:22.590> a

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
other rooms I used this one for almost a

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.980 
other rooms I used this one for almost a
month<00:04:22.919> usually<00:04:23.280> I<00:04:23.520> tend<00:04:24.270> to<00:04:24.389> review<00:04:24.690> a<00:04:24.720> run

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
month usually I tend to review a run

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.560 
month usually I tend to review a run
maybe<00:04:25.440> one<00:04:25.770> or<00:04:25.979> two<00:04:26.009> weeks<00:04:26.460> before<00:04:26.789> I<00:04:27.030> tend<00:04:27.449> to

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
maybe one or two weeks before I tend to

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.090 
maybe one or two weeks before I tend to
make<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:27.840> review<00:04:28.139> this<00:04:28.620> time<00:04:28.830> it<00:04:28.949> was

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
make the review this time it was

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.650 
make the review this time it was
different<00:04:29.130> i<00:04:29.639> had<00:04:29.789> a<00:04:29.820> lot<00:04:30.030> of<00:04:30.060> things<00:04:30.270> to<00:04:30.479> do

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
different i had a lot of things to do

different i had a lot of things to do
and<00:04:30.780> i<00:04:31.169> didn't<00:04:31.410> really<00:04:31.500> get<00:04:31.650> a<00:04:31.710> time<00:04:32.009> but<00:04:32.460> i

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
and i didn't really get a time but i

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.969 
and i didn't really get a time but i
also<00:04:32.850> had<00:04:33.090> no<00:04:33.300> real<00:04:33.509> rush<00:04:34.080> to<00:04:34.590> get<00:04:34.710> on<00:04:34.860> any

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
also had no real rush to get on any

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:36.920 
also had no real rush to get on any
other<00:04:35.160> room<00:04:35.460> because<00:04:35.940> this<00:04:36.210> one<00:04:36.419> was<00:04:36.570> my<00:04:36.750> made

a<00:04:36.960> drive<00:04:37.229> for<00:04:37.410> almost<00:04:37.590> a<00:04:37.740> month<00:04:37.889> it<00:04:38.160> did<00:04:38.699> a

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
a drive for almost a month it did a

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:40.909 
a drive for almost a month it did a
great<00:04:39.210> job<00:04:39.240> stability<00:04:39.630> was<00:04:40.080> fine<00:04:40.410> there's

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
great job stability was fine there's

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.800 
great job stability was fine there's
maybe<00:04:41.220> some<00:04:41.580> small<00:04:41.880> box<00:04:42.120> like<00:04:42.300> if<00:04:42.449> you<00:04:42.539> can<00:04:42.660> see

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
maybe some small box like if you can see

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.020 
maybe some small box like if you can see
quite<00:04:42.960> hours<00:04:43.380> and<00:04:43.620> you<00:04:43.710> long<00:04:44.310> press<00:04:44.340> you

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:53.699 
trouble with the stability and it also

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:55.610 
trouble with the stability and it also
gets<00:05:54.060> pretty<00:05:54.389> frequent<00:05:54.840> updates<00:05:54.960> so<00:05:55.349> this<00:05:55.530> is

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
gets pretty frequent updates so this is

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.379 
gets pretty frequent updates so this is
not<00:05:55.740> the<00:05:55.860> issue<00:05:55.979> the<00:05:56.520> team<00:05:56.729> is<00:05:56.880> quite<00:05:57.150> enough

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:57.389 
not the issue the team is quite enough

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:59.089 
not the issue the team is quite enough
big<00:05:57.599> I<00:05:57.630> think<00:05:58.020> they<00:05:58.139> make<00:05:58.349> it<00:05:58.470> even<00:05:58.620> for<00:05:58.919> other

00:05:59.089 --> 00:05:59.099 
big I think they make it even for other

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:02.270 
big I think they make it even for other
devices<00:05:59.780> so<00:06:00.780> if<00:06:01.050> you're<00:06:01.530> definitely<00:06:01.830> looking

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
devices so if you're definitely looking

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.270 
devices so if you're definitely looking

who likes to stay minimal and doesn't

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.520

want have that much features then this
may<00:06:32.770> be<00:06:32.830> probably<00:06:33.280> not<00:06:33.580> the<00:06:33.730> right<00:06:33.760> one<00:06:34.150> for

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180 
may be probably not the right one for

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.480 
may be probably not the right one for
you<00:06:34.390> because<00:06:34.720> it<00:06:34.960> has<00:06:35.290> a<00:06:35.320> ton<00:06:35.710> of<00:06:35.740> features<00:06:36.070> as

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:38.500 
you can see here there is so much to

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.680 
you can see here there is so much to
explore<00:06:38.530> here<00:06:39.310> there<00:06:39.760> are<00:06:39.910> so<00:06:40.150> many<00:06:40.210> options

explore here there are so many options

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.500 
explore here there are so many options
and<00:06:41.140> they<00:06:41.560> are<00:06:41.650> not<00:06:41.800> always<00:06:42.430> easy<00:06:43.120> to<00:06:43.240> find

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:43.510

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.330 
and they are not always easy to find
because<00:06:43.750> sometimes<00:06:44.410> have<00:06:44.620> trouble<00:06:44.830> if<00:06:45.100> I<00:06:45.250> am

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:45.340
