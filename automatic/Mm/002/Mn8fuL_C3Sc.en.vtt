00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.660
 I got 22 minutes 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:45.230
 hello today we are going to make a pencil holder and 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.950
 we are going to use this can to make a 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.600
 pencil holders but we will do it with 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.760
 recycled materials so let's 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.650
 use for example a palm tree that we 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.930
 like in a magazine and have color and 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:04.309
 let's use that palm to 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.470
 basically do the craft in this 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:13.210
 Yesterday I selected my page 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:13.210
 this afternoon and I'm going to make a cut 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:23.409
 unhappy or the pencil to mark where I'm going 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.409
 to make my court and then all peace 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.520
 again so get 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:38.500
 the rhythm of this desire 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.500
 and here we have the box 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.420
 day 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.180
 I use the color that defense 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:04.130
 Now these pages are very long like that 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.820
 that I am going to use more or less 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.850
 d 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.759
 this 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.640
 and this is the no size of the can 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.390
 mine and I'm going to put a little bit of 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.390
 glue 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:24.710
 I will help with the pencil 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.710
 with the hayloft 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.370
 in a way to say how you are 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.370
 because as you see 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.940
 i 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.530
 very well 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.530
 mantega 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.689
 Y 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:57.060
 and once a power gambit 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:03:02.180
 done only I have to take it out 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:05.829
 and that's all I have on my way 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.829
 I made for the tube 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.780
 it's a good thing to do with one they do not have 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:16.010
 nothing to do when you are looking at the 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.760
 novel or watching a TV show 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.760
 then he can not do 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.220
 here I have the white one that we're going to 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.410
 use 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.230
 you can use the same glue 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.390
 white to do this project but I 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.270
 I would like to use my rubber gun 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:38.820
 because it's faster so I 'm going to 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.820
 put the rubber 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.569
 it prints 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.569
 ah 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.690
 to 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.360
 ah 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.360
 ah 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.260
 ah 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.590
 we already have our decorated pencil holder 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.950
 with three fingers 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.560
 the whole magazine but I want to talk a 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:42.320
 little bit more rustic so I'm going to 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:45.190
 use rope 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.190
 as you see here 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:53.120
 to cover a little the bending waves 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.120
 I have had 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.960
 do not 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.060
 how can you see web 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.520
 and this is the finished project 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.490
 Y
