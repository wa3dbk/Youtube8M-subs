00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
what we've ever done we've always had

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.090 
what we've ever done we've always had
good<00:02:15.540> chemistry<00:02:15.810> together<00:02:16.170> with<00:02:16.680> like<00:02:16.890> and

and I think that if we got like a cha

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.200 
and I think that if we got like a cha
cha<00:02:22.230> or<00:02:22.260> something<00:02:22.710> together<00:02:22.830> jive<00:02:23.760> something

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
cha or something together jive something

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.550 
cha or something together jive something
fund<00:02:24.420> or<00:02:24.540> some<00:02:24.690> ballroom<00:02:24.900> piece<00:02:25.320> together

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
fund or some ballroom piece together

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.500 
fund or some ballroom piece together
that<00:02:25.980> would<00:02:26.040> be<00:02:26.130> amazing<00:02:26.370> it<00:02:27.150> would<00:02:27.240> be<00:02:27.330> a<00:02:27.360> good

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
that would be amazing it would be a good

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.210 
that would be amazing it would be a good
time<00:02:27.690> other<00:02:28.230> than<00:02:28.440> that<00:02:28.530> of<00:02:28.710> course<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:29.070> mean

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
time other than that of course I mean

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.680 
time other than that of course I mean
her<00:02:29.850> and<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.060> dancing<00:02:30.360> together<00:02:30.510> a

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
her and I dancing together a

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.480 
her and I dancing together a
contemporary<00:02:31.170> number<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.650> would<00:02:31.710> be<00:02:31.830> ideal

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
contemporary number that would be ideal

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.300 
contemporary number that would be ideal
yeah<00:02:33.330> but<00:02:33.690> that<00:02:34.500> might<00:02:34.680> be<00:02:34.710> too<00:02:34.800> much<00:02:35.070> to<00:02:35.250> ask

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
yeah but that might be too much to ask

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.830 
yeah but that might be too much to ask
for<00:02:35.670> that's<00:02:35.910> gonna<00:02:36.060> be<00:02:36.210> too<00:02:36.360> much<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.630> think<00:02:36.660> the

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
for that's gonna be too much I think the

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.150 
for that's gonna be too much I think the
only<00:02:36.960> way<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.200> could<00:02:37.260> ever<00:02:37.410> possibly<00:02:37.590> happen

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
only way that could ever possibly happen

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.370 
only way that could ever possibly happen
