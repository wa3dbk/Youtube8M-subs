00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
along we don't have internet

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.800 
along we don't have internet
so<00:01:57.460> it's<00:01:57.580> kind<00:01:57.760> of<00:01:57.790> acting<00:01:58.150> up<00:01:58.270> this<00:01:58.450> is<00:01:58.600> still

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810
