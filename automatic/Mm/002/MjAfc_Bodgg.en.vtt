 the eco line tracking series from fischer 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.099
 ideal for longer tours on normal 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.470
 roads and light terrain that as

 Over a range of up to 80 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.039
 kilometers 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.949
 State-of-the- art lithium ion manganese technology 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.949
 allows maximum battery performance and 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.230
 lifetime a special battery 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.570
 balancing program allows one 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.660
 significantly extended lifespan from to 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:44.520
 At 64,000 kilometers for our batteries 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.860
 made in germany the batteries can be

 a led display 4 in 1 informed 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.920
 any time about the state of charge, the 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.280
 Energy support can be in three 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.409
 The eco line will be chosen 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.200
 Tracking offers an answer or

 push help she also allows without 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.270
 pedal movement a motor assist 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.369
 up to four kilometers and 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.759
 makes it easier to approach or 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:22.250
 pushing the bikes beyond that 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.250
 It controls the LED permanent lighting 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.290
 Intelligent sensor bottom bracket technology 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.610
 ensures a contactless measurement 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.100
 the pedal movement 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.530
 It also reduces the needed 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.259
 Cabling and protects the measurement technology 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.140
 before wear and for the driver 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.179
 it means a gentler start 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.670
 by shortened reaction time of the 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.939
 control 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.590
 further highlights are the new ones

 exclusive fishing frame with 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.960
 improved driving behavior 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:58.830
 optimized geometry and more stability 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.929
 without flapping the bike even better 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.229
