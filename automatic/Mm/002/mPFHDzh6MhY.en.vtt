00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.790
 I'm back for the second infinity 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.940
 again with the camera on mine 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.680
 face like me in the video at the food 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.910
 era things already explained pond 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.500
 On the way empty batteries city on i see 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.800
 you always have to get closer to micro 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.660
 so now is better in the acute and 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.239
 have just the whole topic things the 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.859
 you probably or yesterday 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.210
 before yesterday seen arrives 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:40.719
 because I'm doing the video I'll be the one 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.429
 where is my finger up there bang 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.920
 via info card you can still watch the video 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:47.499
 I'll have a look at other nice ones 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.420
 things made clear and that's what I come for 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:51.940
 Now you just want to have a short time 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:58.690
 give a hint what it is about and 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:01:00.429
 Just show this card around 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.139
 let's go now everyone knows what it 's all about 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:03.819
 that's why revolves in screen now and 

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:05.470
 Show me what I'm so great 

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:07.390
 everything also part of this deal 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.460
 mainly got spoken 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:17.350
 So people have a very clean turn 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:19.000
 and film again so press and 2014 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.790
 worldcup person and now you pull the 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.880
 city that would pile up in such a way 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:30.670
 I guess 200 is maybe there 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:33.430
 more cards 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 so 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.830
 do not know any good 200,000 plus 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.480
 and base can 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.860
 I'll turn that into a complex of topics 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:44.950
 do and the complete sentences of course 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.260
 understanding and here on the art meadow 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.180
 show you something on the artificial turf 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.680
 I love it between all this base 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.380
 I found the original cards 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.600
 It is said that only those are but they are 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.180
 also in sentence here so full ico in three 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:03.740
 different variants then 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:06.860
 we have found these whole places in 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.090
 the year that was with foot so the 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.090
 whole host cities so 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.390
 venues sao paulo approximately 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:19.600
 four times salvador rio de janeiro recife 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:22.270
 porto alegre natal manaus fortaleza 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.620
 curitiba 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.660
 We still have brasilia belo 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.450
 horizons without end 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.630
 these are just the places of which they were 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.150
 Of course it was in there too 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.100
 plus and the goalkeepers these guardians 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.160
 To make it even more of a season 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:44.360
 everything in between are all in set 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:49.030
 the hair ben ali okaz rui patricio 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:52.790

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.989
 new also twice ecology so hard and 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.920
 so on these are all guardians 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.340
 guardians but not on the galaxy 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.130
 but just guardians of the ball 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.049
 then there were tons of world cup stars and 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.940
 I emphasize again I have a base can 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.260
 actually , it was just about buying base 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.690
 gave and what you already have yesterday 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.310
 seen what's going on at the world cup 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.209
 stars are all world cup stars 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:22.360

 june so these are all world cup stars 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.330
 about 150 maybe pretty cool 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.480
 that you do not expect it that way 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:48.320
 at least I have been with too many then 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:51.240
 Something the strikers are here too 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.420
 huge offer quite often 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:59.520

 fantasy podolski bands in june and so on 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.260
 continue to fly over and briefly 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.300
 so that you can show what I offered for it 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.900
 it made you then the wörlitzer 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.870
 So we have matchup for example 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.830
 Luka Modric vs. Xabi Iniesta vs. 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:20.040
 ribery clinic against ramos robben against 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.330
 lame ronaldo versus messi twice 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.590
 really cool 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:29.220
 those are the matchups then yes 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.350
 these team cards 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.680
 Look at the pile too 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.750
 everything properly sorted the 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.050
 Germans are also quite Iran 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:44.070
 important that they are there then then 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.600
 there are those that are this refractor one 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.460
 Looks like that's not the one 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.890
 as I have already shown but 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:53.910
 this rainbow reflector we have 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:56.040
 All out, everything looks refractor then 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.960
 first follows that is the header 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:05.490
 Huge here for example with falcao 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:07.850
 tim cahill balotelli in the cone klose 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:13.430
 Of course, it should not be missing 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:15.930
 then what have we never cup captains 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.060
 that's the whole stack cup tilting here 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.920
 So all the captains of 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:26.730
