00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
going to make a 1958 the pattern is the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.530 
going to make a 1958 the pattern is the
bubble<00:01:23.400> pattern<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.240> like<00:01:24.390> the

bubble pattern and just like the
original<00:01:24.900> bubble<00:01:25.170> pattern<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.830> made<00:01:26.009> off

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
original bubble pattern this is made off

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.280 
original bubble pattern this is made off
an<00:01:26.369> original<00:01:26.759> piece<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.810> matches<00:01:28.020> exactly

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
an original piece so it matches exactly

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.980 
an original piece so it matches exactly

clear red they'll allow them to

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.610 
clear red they'll allow them to
illuminate<00:02:59.909> very<00:03:00.209> clear<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.780> put<00:03:01.470> out<00:03:01.590> a

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
daring good light that's a good

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.259 
daring good light that's a good

1959

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
1959

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.259 
1959
I<00:03:06.599> have<00:03:07.670> remanufactured<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.819> original

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
I have remanufactured the original

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.210 
I have remanufactured the original
pattern<00:03:09.510> for<00:03:09.870> that<00:03:09.900> here's<00:03:10.230> one<00:03:10.470> in<00:03:10.620> clear<00:03:10.950> as

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
pattern for that here's one in clear as

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.430 
pattern for that here's one in clear as
they<00:03:11.489> come<00:03:11.730> you'll<00:03:12.480> need<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.810> paint<00:03:13.079> them<00:03:13.260> up

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
they come you'll need to paint them up

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.430 
they come you'll need to paint them up
to<00:03:14.190> match<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.579> full<00:03:14.760> size<00:03:15.000> again<00:03:15.930> using<00:03:16.319> the

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
to match the full size again using the

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.770 
to match the full size again using the
clear<00:03:16.709> red<00:03:16.950> this<00:03:17.940> one's<00:03:18.120> partially<00:03:18.599> painted

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
clear red this one's partially painted

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.990 
clear red this one's partially painted
so<00:03:19.079> I'll<00:03:19.199> need<00:03:19.349> to<00:03:19.500> do<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.769> backdrop<00:03:20.250> black<00:03:20.730> in

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
so I'll need to do the backdrop black in

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.140 
so I'll need to do the backdrop black in
these<00:03:21.319> but<00:03:22.319> those<00:03:22.470> are<00:03:22.650> cut<00:03:22.859> out<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.340> bolted

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
these but those are cut out and bolted

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.920 
these but those are cut out and bolted
into<00:03:24.299> place<00:03:24.569> just<00:03:24.840> like<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.650> originals<00:03:26.129> were

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
into place just like the originals were

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.180 
into place just like the originals were
okay<00:03:27.930> and<00:03:28.560> here<00:03:29.099> is<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.370> 1960<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.959> 1960<00:03:31.859> has

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
okay and here is the 1960 the 1960 has

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.759 
okay and here is the 1960 the 1960 has
the<00:03:32.519> checkered<00:03:33.480> pattern<00:03:33.750> just<00:03:34.199> the<00:03:34.349> same<00:03:34.560> as

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
the checkered pattern just the same as

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.610 
the checkered pattern just the same as
the<00:03:34.949> grille<00:03:35.220> does<00:03:35.810> you<00:03:36.810> take<00:03:37.049> and<00:03:37.260> cut<00:03:37.470> out

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
the grille does you take and cut out

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.500 
the grille does you take and cut out
