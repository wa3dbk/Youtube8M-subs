00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.849 
then rotate the metal wheel and that
doesn't<00:02:26.980> do<00:02:27.129> anything<00:02:27.579> alright<00:02:28.359> so<00:02:28.859> those

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:29.859 
doesn't do anything alright so those

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:31.770 
doesn't do anything alright so those
instructions<00:02:30.459> are<00:02:30.579> wrong<00:02:30.790> all<00:02:31.450> right<00:02:31.599> so

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
instructions are wrong all right so

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.339 
instructions are wrong all right so
anyway<00:02:32.159> this<00:02:33.159> mode<00:02:33.430> is<00:02:33.730> just<00:02:33.900> regular<00:02:34.900> attack

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
anyway this mode is just regular attack

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.770 
anyway this mode is just regular attack
mode<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:37.480> could<00:02:37.599> put<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.959> bottom<00:02:38.439> in

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
mode and you could put the bottom in

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.910 
mode and you could put the bottom in
just<00:02:40.780> like<00:02:40.900> that<00:02:41.079> and<00:02:41.319> it'll<00:02:41.590> just<00:02:41.769> be<00:02:41.829> like

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
just like that and it'll just be like

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.460 
just like that and it'll just be like
this<00:02:42.450> you<00:02:43.450> could<00:02:43.599> also<00:02:44.609> pull<00:02:45.609> these<00:02:45.819> out<00:02:46.470> so

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
this you could also pull these out so

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.750 
this you could also pull these out so
that<00:02:47.650> it<00:02:47.829> becomes<00:02:48.189> a<00:02:48.430> sharp<00:02:48.849> tip<00:02:49.299> and<00:02:50.760> you

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
that it becomes a sharp tip and you

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.729 
that it becomes a sharp tip and you
could<00:02:51.909> pull<00:02:52.030> it<00:02:52.060> out<00:02:52.239> again<00:02:52.359> to<00:02:52.870> put<00:02:53.470> it<00:02:53.560> more

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
could pull it out again to put it more

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.039 
could pull it out again to put it more
in<00:02:54.069> an<00:02:54.310> attack<00:02:54.639> mode<00:02:54.939> tip<00:02:55.689> or<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:55.989> hole<00:02:56.349> flat<00:02:56.650> tip

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
in an attack mode tip or a hole flat tip

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.740 
in an attack mode tip or a hole flat tip
so<00:02:59.049> this<00:02:59.260> is<00:02:59.379> just<00:02:59.560> regular<00:02:59.739> attack<00:03:00.400> mode<00:03:00.750> now

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
so this is just regular attack mode now

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.050 
so this is just regular attack mode now
there<00:03:02.290> it<00:03:02.469> is<00:03:02.650> war<00:03:02.859> mode<00:03:03.129> which<00:03:03.370> is<00:03:03.549> ultimate

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
there it is war mode which is ultimate

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.089 
there it is war mode which is ultimate
balance<00:03:04.480> mode<00:03:04.659> and<00:03:05.230> you<00:03:05.290> pretty<00:03:05.500> much<00:03:05.590> flip

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
balance mode and you pretty much flip

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.309 
balance mode and you pretty much flip
this<00:03:06.310> upside<00:03:06.579> down<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:07.239> put<00:03:07.569> this<00:03:07.719> in<00:03:07.930> so<00:03:08.169> that

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
this upside down and put this in so that

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.420 
this upside down and put this in so that
it's<00:03:08.680> free<00:03:09.040> spinning<00:03:09.400> on<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:10.780> inside<00:03:11.430> and

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
it's free spinning on the inside and

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.780 
it's free spinning on the inside and
when<00:03:12.700> you<00:03:12.849> put<00:03:13.090> your<00:03:13.599> bottom<00:03:14.230> in<00:03:14.489> it'll<00:03:15.489> change

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
when you put your bottom in it'll change

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.629 
when you put your bottom in it'll change
the<00:03:15.970> tips<00:03:17.010> from<00:03:18.010> like<00:03:18.280> flat<00:03:20.310> let's<00:03:21.310> see<00:03:21.489> if<00:03:21.549> I

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
the tips from like flat let's see if I

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:27.089 
the tips from like flat let's see if I
could<00:03:21.790> do<00:03:21.909> this<00:03:25.530> so<00:03:26.530> it<00:03:26.650> will<00:03:26.739> change<00:03:26.919> from

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
could do this so it will change from

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:33.199 
could do this so it will change from
flat<00:03:27.459> two<00:03:29.459> to<00:03:30.459> like<00:03:30.669> kind<00:03:31.359> of<00:03:31.419> a<00:03:31.720> sharp<00:03:32.019> and

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
flat two to like kind of a sharp and

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:39.569 
flat two to like kind of a sharp and
then<00:03:34.209> to<00:03:34.419> a<00:03:34.449> sharp<00:03:34.989> tip<00:03:36.090> right<00:03:37.090> there<00:03:38.189> so<00:03:39.189> it

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
then to a sharp tip right there so it

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.360 
then to a sharp tip right there so it
changes<00:03:40.060> modes<00:03:40.509> that<00:03:41.379> changes<00:03:41.769> the<00:03:41.889> tip<00:03:42.129> as

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
changes modes that changes the tip as

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.749 
changes modes that changes the tip as
its<00:03:43.299> battling<00:03:43.840> with<00:03:44.799> another<00:03:45.040> beyblade<00:03:45.489> so

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:45.759 
its battling with another beyblade so

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:47.580 
its battling with another beyblade so
when<00:03:45.939> it<00:03:46.060> when<00:03:46.419> the<00:03:46.569> metal<00:03:46.989> wheel<00:03:47.169> gets<00:03:47.379> hit

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
when it when the metal wheel gets hit

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.800 
when it when the metal wheel gets hit
it'll<00:03:47.769> turn<00:03:47.979> and<00:03:48.340> change<00:03:48.639> the<00:03:48.879> tip<00:03:49.060> to<00:03:49.299> a

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
it'll turn and change the tip to a

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.539 
it'll turn and change the tip to a
different<00:03:50.680> one<00:03:50.799> so<00:03:53.009> let's<00:03:54.009> just<00:03:54.220> put<00:03:54.400> this

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
different one so let's just put this

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:55.949 
different one so let's just put this
babe<00:03:54.759> way<00:03:54.909> together<00:03:55.090> I'm<00:03:55.479> just<00:03:55.629> going<00:03:55.750> to<00:03:55.780> put

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
babe way together I'm just going to put

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.909 
babe way together I'm just going to put
it<00:03:56.049> in<00:03:56.169> regular<00:03:56.699> attack<00:03:57.699> mode<00:03:58.090> I<00:03:58.530> think<00:03:59.530> it

00:03:59.909 --> 00:03:59.919 
it in regular attack mode I think it

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:18.430 
it in regular attack mode I think it
performs<00:04:00.459> better<00:04:00.669> in<00:04:02.310> regular<00:04:03.310> check<00:04:03.579> mode

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.050

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
defensive side I'm going to switch the

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:26.969 
defensive side I'm going to switch the
modes<00:05:15.570> to<00:05:15.990> a<00:05:16.380> flat<00:05:17.900> there's<00:05:18.900> more<00:05:19.140> taxes

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:30.459 

now<00:05:27.979> it's<00:05:28.189> in<00:05:28.339> ultimate<00:05:28.819> balance<00:05:28.999> mode<00:05:29.330> and<00:05:29.779> I

00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:30.469 
now it's in ultimate balance mode and I

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:32.469 
now it's in ultimate balance mode and I
