00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.470
 ustg yesterday again about the new call 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.269
 of duty transporter one today it works 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.919
 something about that existed in the multiplayer 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:19.329
 and that with a bit so things 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:21.130
 considering how the whole thing looks like 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:23.140
 then i could have it a few 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.970
 considerations to the perks and to 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.529
 Being connected to the exotics like the whole 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.449
 So in the year is a pretty 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.619
 interesting video finished in 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.599
 background you see you were sharing 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.250
 follow in the plate old friend knows 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.390
 by now probably many karimi 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.370
 So the hype is pretty much later 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.110
 pretty quickly extinguished, I say 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.070
 that I probably remember that now 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.570
 not for the playstation 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.450
 So that's what I came out of 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.380
 pretty stupid then definitely 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.030
 I only think one game or gameplay 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.140
 but I was two of a channel so far 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.210
 actually pretty good in times before 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.590
 Sorry then I had a 45 hkd against 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.610
 player so I was well in the evil 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.120
 I do not know why I'm so good at that 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.340
 was in it 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.630
 but somehow my game is not like that 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.890
 Honestly, I honestly said 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.239
 do not have a little prestige first 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.520
 made it because it is now 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.050
 become boring it is to here 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.340
 no actions will follow then it is 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.079
 simply an act of gameplay because of me 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.520
 thought that I say now and times 

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:08.560
 in perhaps the share of 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.210
 gameplay gameplay in the next call of 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.950
 Duty even similar so that's watching 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.409
 every case together and fits today 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.270
 for this reason, therefore, in times of gameplay 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.859
 in the background so then come now too 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.509
 fit again when surfer and it became 

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:21.999
 announced that existed in the 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.259
 singleplayer have five skills and 

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:24.159
 Firstly, it can become invisible 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:24.969
 We've already done that in the 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.499
 seen trailer 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:27.700
 Second, you can be pretty with them 

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:28.600
 we have already jumped high 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.249
 seen in the trailer 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.780
 and third, you can climb with them 

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:32.679
 So they can be so on certain 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.600
 walls 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:38.020
 and fourth , you can go that way 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.249
 so dodge quasi and five 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.030
 you can also do something in the air 

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:42.490
 hover 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.679
 so really interesting 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.090
 abilities and nothing at all 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:49.240
 are never something like that call of duty 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.009
 and yes in the singleplayer we all have 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.659
 said he thinks that's okay 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.069
 they do not care if you like them 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.779
 things that can exist with that 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:57.279
 but today I have a couple of times 

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:59.979
 Considered as the whole im 

00:01:57.279 --> 00:02:01.270
 multiplayer could look like it because I have it 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.920
 is pretty sure that actually 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.420
 it exists also be in multiplayer 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.249
 because they are everywhere until now 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.090
 So every soldier had that on 

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:09.229
 and that's why it's very likely 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.879
 that they will also be in multiplayer 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.260
 and of course that would be on the one hand 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:14.150
 side quite a problem because if 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.379
 someone such an exoskeleton in multiplayer 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.730
 then the gameplay is complete 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.590
 different and it may be that that 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.209
 top bed is or that is fact if the 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.140
 people jumping all over and around 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.819
 make themselves visible 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.409
 so it can really call that pretty much 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.340
 of duty feeling go and get away 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:27.230
 pretty much sink 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.670
 But so I have a few considerations 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.709
 set up like the whole look 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.410
 could and indeed that are as I said 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.670
 five exoskeleton skills and me 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.680
 could somehow imagine that it 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.840
 a sort of art works are more or less like 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.310
 So that gives you one of these 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.440
 can choose five skills 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.360
 and that makes it there and then on his 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.030
 ex skeleton on it and I think that would be 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.500
 then not so obert because because 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.430
 Making something invisible sounds like a lot 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.470
 worse than it actually is 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.670
 at least in parts fully there you could 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.629
 indeed become invisible and 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.700
 In the end, that was not 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.230
 So strong is so normal 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.579
 player, the people are also invisible 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.739
 can always recognize very well what yes 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.239
 not completely invisible and in the 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.530
 you have to stop jumping that high 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.849
 it is not as high as in the trailer so 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.109
 jumping four meters high is on everyone 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.480
 pretty annoying but maybe 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.220
 that they can jump 15 times as high 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.489
 these now jump or climb that 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.049
 everything so if the quasi if you 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.310
 now just one thing has as much as 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.410
 example only make invisible 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.609
 the other stuff does not have then 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.049
 I even imagine it 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.329
 is balanced and that he even in the 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:25.730
 would fit into multiplayer so that 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.780
 is actually so annoying and so would 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.459
 That's why you can definitely 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.709
 imagine that these skills perks 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.120
 for the exoskeleton and then have 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.440
 I still thought that was all 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.940
 play as far in the future as you can 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.290
 I could think of such an exoskeleton 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.790
 Also imagine that the normal packs 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.950
 the dexterity and 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.209
 extreme conditions and so that the 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.889
 almost like a chip like that 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.930
 exoskeletons would do that then 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:47.150
 also fit better because otherwise is 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.590
 yes strange that one then the peoples 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.000
 all at once so good to load and there 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.500
 It may be that it is such an upgrade 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 that's pretty good for the exoskeleton 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.010
 can move quickly that that is 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.879
 so it can get away pretty quickly 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.260
 I could actually 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.480
 imagine that the conventional 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.879
 so far that had the percussive 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.230
 typed into the exoskeleton, so to speak 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:05.239
 or so I think so would 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.790
 se in the sense to make that would then 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.900
 a bit more realism if 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.790
 it's time to talk about realism here 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.530
 but that could be better 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.720
 I think it fits in perfectly if you have the 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.530
 peugeot gets an upgrade and yes 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.000
 That's why I could be very good 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.979
 imagine that it's access first 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.840
 networks where you can then one of 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.769
 these five things perhaps chooses 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.479
 is really only 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.330
 normal thing so that's almost the case 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.560
 normal perks are and then you can 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.360
 it even be that stuff 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.889
 not be used so often because of it 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.659
 is also so invisible and so on 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.099
 because you always have to consider yet 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:35.120
 because you make yourself invisible and so on 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:36.530
 that's a lot of work 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.879
 and then maybe distracts you better 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.530
 I even imagine that many 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:41.419
 People do not want to use that 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.400
 he writes every now and ask what you 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.020
 you think that's true if such 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.340
 things quasi a bit throttled 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.870
 So in the multiplayer rows would come 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.919
 Of course not as blatant as the im 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.840
 singleplayer looked 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:52.430
 So if the people is always four meters 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.599
 jump around and climb everywhere 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.800
 that we are definitely pretty stupid 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:56.419
 because then the complete call of duty 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.460
 feeling went away and then everything 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.020
 would be pretty annoying though 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.340
 when it's sort of in a restricted form and 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.960
 that you can say that as an economist 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.060
 exoskeleton selects if that is one 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.349
 multiplayer comes in , as I said 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.819
 Write me that will be the comments 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:09.229
 and thus it is already over 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:10.400
 yes I hope you liked it 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:11.930
 really liked 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.800
 look upwards and that 's it 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.800
 Today, there are three people
