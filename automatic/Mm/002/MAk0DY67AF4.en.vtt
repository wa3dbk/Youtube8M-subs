find a good solution according to the
weather<00:01:40.270> because<00:01:40.630> I<00:01:40.660> like<00:01:41.110> the<00:01:41.380> forecast<00:01:41.830> has

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
weather because I like the forecast has

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.280 
weather because I like the forecast has
been<00:01:42.640> really<00:01:42.970> bad<00:01:43.120> so<00:01:43.420> and<00:01:43.600> it's<00:01:44.140> been

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
been really bad so and it's been

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.050 
been really bad so and it's been
actually<00:01:44.440> accurate<00:01:45.100> for<00:01:45.340> once<00:01:45.520> so<00:01:45.760> it's<00:01:45.880> been

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
actually accurate for once so it's been

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.080 
actually accurate for once so it's been
raining<00:01:46.780> and<00:01:46.990> foggy<00:01:47.350> and<00:01:48.010> still<00:01:48.490> snowing<00:01:49.000> the

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
the beginning of the year it's usually

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.860 
the beginning of the year it's usually
hard<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.550> film<00:02:02.909> anywhere<00:02:03.210> in<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.390> world<00:02:03.630> like

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
hard to film anywhere in the world like

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.219 
hard to film anywhere in the world like
there's<00:02:04.170> no<00:02:04.370> usually<00:02:05.370> not<00:02:05.659> good<00:02:06.659> enough<00:02:06.930> snow

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
there's no usually not good enough snow

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.080 
there's no usually not good enough snow
like<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.650> snow<00:02:07.830> doesn't<00:02:08.069> stick<00:02:08.459> on<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.789> high

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
like the snow doesn't stick on the high

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.029 
like the snow doesn't stick on the high
alpine<00:02:09.270> lines<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.050> we<00:02:10.200> can't<00:02:10.410> really<00:02:10.709> go<00:02:10.890> and

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
alpine lines so we can't really go and

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:20.490 
alpine lines so we can't really go and
make<00:02:11.910> some<00:02:11.940> D<00:02:12.420> lines

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500
