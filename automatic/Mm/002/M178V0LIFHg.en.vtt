00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:22.110
 and the mambo the mambo has become a 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.960
 symbol of the orchestra 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.030
 there you feel a little dance is not seen 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.210
 what the orchestra does choreography but 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:33.410
 yes it feels a bit the party in what 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.410
 the concert becomes 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:46.890
 I believe that there is one 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:50.460
 clichÃ© with classical music already with the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.680
 classic term and that keeps the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.860
 young and says good is a music of 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.260
 my grandparents of my parents until one says 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.340
 that music for the dead in music 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:06.360
 really sad and I would say not 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.410
 so classical music in a world 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:14.220
 wonderful in which there are 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:17.610
 unique experiences unique experiences 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.680
 and obviously to be able to enjoy 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.800
 classical music remember that in the 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.050
 classical music was music 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:30.780
 let's say popular from the past 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.770
 then part of that 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.920
 to the music that we have arrived 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.980
 it has been good has been a development a 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.070
 development of that 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:45.750
 and that has endless sensations of 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.750
 energy of colors
