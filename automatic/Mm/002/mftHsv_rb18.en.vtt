00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.959
 water everyone knows professor our 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.720
 and welcome to the chain of myths 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.770
 sono games for a new tutorial 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.570
 I noticed that last time my 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.880
 tutorial on the secret staircase and he has 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.009
 had a lot of success that's why 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.949
 I decided to pursue it and make 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.869
 is she secret number 2 so 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:33.280
 here I am immediately going to the 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.360
 demonstration a take so there the 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.790
 children had not done the stairs on 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.230
 this structure there so as you the 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.360
 doubt is this cache somewhere except that 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.580
 you see there is no button for 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.239
 open it a little or no plate of 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:51.729
 pressure that said that said there is a 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:53.170
 chest and here is the skalli that opens and 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:54.010
 there we can make a cellar or anything 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.890
 what 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.119
 so here I used the chests 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.100
 trapped to do it I go all of 

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:02.739
 then show you how we do and 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.140
 to close the club for your message 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.409
 to forgive, that's as simple as 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.650
 it remains to see the circuits how 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:14.440
 do how to do that and so 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.690
 just for info I did that especially 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.630
 because I was actually on a server 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.830
 pvp in factions and as people 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.660
 did not have access to the chests but 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.880
 had access to the lever on this server I 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.500
 prefer to put it in a safe and 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.250
 so nobody could open it apart 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:33.690
 it's as simple as that 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.400
 it is also enough on some servers of 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.290
 d &amp; d loket gives you a sign on the 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.659
 safe and there is that that person who 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.130
 can open it's also so convenient 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:46.870
 we go right to the explanation 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:49.090
 go right now and we're back 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.320
 for the explanation of the system so the 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.840
 last time we had done the little 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.310
 secret stairway with the system that 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.350
 bossi and 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.810
 this time it will have to connect it to 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.600
 our chest which is a treasure trap a 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.530
 I recall this is very important therefore 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:09.410
 a treasure chest it feeds a box of 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.530
 each side and a box below the 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.019
 blog on which it is laid so until 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:19.340
 it's simple then we'll do a 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:22.610
 system that is identical to that of 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.080
 replace a lever with a button being 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.269
 given that the chest there it will be used 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.280
 like a button that we press and for 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.500
 to switch on for example a light 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.350
 and have come back to reach it 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.239
 it's as simple as that so for 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.830
 feed the block that is below 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:41.840
 very simple we put a redstone by 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.370
 against one thing that to know is that 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.709
 it feeds only one block so suddenly 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.430
 we will have to put to repeater next 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:52.310
 to actually continue the current 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.349
 we're going to put two more blocks here a 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.390
 any blog below I put it from 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.040
 colors just to show you what 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.670
 will happen eventually and we will 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.230
 put on each side a piston like that 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.940
 the blue block actually it's going to move 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.500
 from left to right what will we 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.030
 allow to pass the current 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:16.959
 what current is going to make simply pass 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.959
 a normal current that will pass 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:24.410
 little bug you go and who will go 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:27.490
 by in a respite late and will be peeters 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.140
 will be connected to our system 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.390
 now remains to activate the pistons 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.030
 depending on the chest it's very simple 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.340
 of the discount on each side a 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.459
 torch 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.010
 a torch so here we can 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:46.420
 watch our stairs open and 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.230
 when we activate the trunk our 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.739
 stairs closes 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.530
 little extra explanation on 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.420
 block here allows the current to pass 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.870
 in the peter reee so what if we 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.510
 activates the club 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.879
 the piston plus the block on the other side 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.890
 and the current was no longer going so 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.500
 it's very simple instead of the safe 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.040
 we can also put a button 1 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.590
 it's not a problem 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.170
 so like that our stairs again a 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.600
 little more secret than it is you 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.060
 already here after good I admit that the 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.489
 system but still so big and one 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.550
 can not really reduce the thing anymore 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.320
 but hey I hope you have 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.300
 enjoyed this tutorial if you have any 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.340
 questions do not hesitate to comment and 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.210
 I promise you to continue 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:36.220
 more tutorial here go on this I you 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.990
 wish a good week a good 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.419
 return for those who have their return 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.310
 and then I tell you very soon to
