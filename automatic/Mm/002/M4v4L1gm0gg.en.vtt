00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.210
 The ball was declared by a dot clipper by 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.930
 I would like to introduce you to the Star Alliance 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:18.230
 Black vinegar layer and pink can be pp coin 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:21.950

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:25.490

 It is this star alliance this time 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:39.010
 Valences is very popular and it has a very large back end reaction 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:45.070
 I think that it is characteristic to come out 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:48.620
 The feeling of rolling on the front is also relatively smooth, as it lays down and directs the beauty of the character of Saki 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:54.860
 Is a ball of recommended the ne general of customers is to 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.820
 It's pretty sharp, but that back end is going to go wild 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.600
 That's a form 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.629
 It is strong also greatly Order from 4000 No. whether No. 2000 to firmly back 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.220
