00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
bike that we feature on overdrive he

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.330 
bike that we feature on overdrive he
spends<00:00:12.660> most<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:13.049> his<00:00:13.139> time<00:00:13.320> racing<00:00:13.830> bikes<00:00:14.070> and

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.799 
spends most of his time racing bikes and
popping<00:00:14.639> wheelies<00:00:14.969> but<00:00:15.120> last<00:00:15.330> week<00:00:15.630> was

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
popping wheelies but last week was

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.240 
popping wheelies but last week was
different<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.440> that's<00:00:16.619> because<00:00:16.890> petrol

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
different and that's because petrol

up<00:01:12.190> with<00:01:12.250> less<00:01:12.640> this<00:01:13.480> difference<00:01:13.960> gets<00:01:14.260> even

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
up with less this difference gets even

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.320 
up with less this difference gets even
more<00:01:14.680> apparent<00:01:15.070> when<00:01:15.610> you<00:01:15.700> spill<00:01:16.000> large
