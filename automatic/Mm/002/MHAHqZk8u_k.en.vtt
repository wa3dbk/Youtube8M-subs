difference between tornadoes and water

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.359 
difference between tornadoes and water
spouts<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.229> while<00:01:43.439> tornadoes<00:01:43.920> grow<00:01:44.130> from

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
spouts is that while tornadoes grow from

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.609 
spouts is that while tornadoes grow from

the cloud down water spouts grow from

the cloud down water spouts grow from
the<00:01:46.740> water<00:01:47.009> up<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:48.000> tornadoes<00:01:48.479> are<00:01:48.689> obviously

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
the water up so tornadoes are obviously

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.289 
the water up so tornadoes are obviously
different<00:01:49.770> from<00:01:49.890> water<00:01:50.130> spouts<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:50.970> tweak

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
different from water spouts so a tweak

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.530 
different from water spouts so a tweak
to<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.479> definition<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.320> needed<00:01:53.329> now<00:01:54.329> let's

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
to the definition is needed now let's

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.240 
to the definition is needed now let's
assume<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:55.079> tornado<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.710> rotating

grow from the cloud down sometimes so
that<00:02:23.879> in<00:02:24.239> theory<00:02:24.720> would<00:02:25.170> be<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.349> tornado<00:02:25.830> but<00:02:26.640> if

I<00:02:31.530> can<00:02:31.680> come<00:02:31.920> up<00:02:32.220> with<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:33.090> wind<00:02:33.690> speed<00:02:34.019> is

I can come up with is the wind speed is

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.110 
I can come up with is the wind speed is
not<00:02:34.440> strong<00:02:34.830> enough<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:35.130> be<00:02:35.340> classified<00:02:35.910> as<00:02:36.090> a

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
not strong enough to be classified as a

tornado and land spouts are generally
weaker<00:02:38.819> than<00:02:38.940> tornadoes<00:02:39.209> but<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.260> key<00:02:40.470> term

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
weaker than tornadoes but the key term

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.979 
weaker than tornadoes but the key term
is<00:02:40.830> generally<00:02:41.489> because<00:02:42.269> sometimes<00:02:42.720> land

is generally because sometimes land

is generally because sometimes land

spouts are strong enough to be tornadoes
the<00:02:45.840> only<00:02:46.080> real<00:02:46.290> difference<00:02:46.530> then<00:02:47.010> is<00:02:47.040> the

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
the only real difference then is the

the only real difference then is the

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
name given to the vortex so you might as

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.589 
name given to the vortex so you might as
well<00:02:49.860> call<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.430> tornado<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.150> leave<00:02:51.269> land

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
well call it a tornado and leave land

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.970 
well call it a tornado and leave land
spouts<00:02:51.900> water<00:02:52.349> spouts<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:52.950> dust<00:02:53.310> devils<00:02:53.730> be
