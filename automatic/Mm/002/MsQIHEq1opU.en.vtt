00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:11.730
 Who does not like a pipoquinha one day? 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:13.650
 cold a cold afternoon so do not 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.439
 It's a good weekend when you sit down. 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.210
 at home there on the blanket there dona angela 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.960
 Do not talk like that, do not make popcorn. 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.750
 It's factual, but it's fatal, right? 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.539
 everybody likes a pipoquinha has 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.490
 People who like popcorn are sweet people. 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.859
 who likes the ravine that gets salty 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.000
 which is my case 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:39.720
 and I'm kind of mixed up, shall we say? 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.760
 so to move and stove to make some meals 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.180
 then they say when the screen is dark 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.839
 You cook something, but the fact is that I 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.440
 I'm much better as a speaker than I am. 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:51.440
 cooker 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.619
 That's why I talk a lot more than 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:03.510
 cooking food than properly 

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:06.420
 doing but I never imagined that 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.049
 one day the popcorn would come to me. 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.049
 make you smile 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.160
 and that's exactly what happened 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:23.040
 popcorn and even popcorn and corn withered 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.470
 sub developed already noticed is a leasing 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.640
 little girl 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:31.290
 if I were an ignorant farmer and if 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.290
 in the midst of my big fears 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.470
 appeared those ears nani 500 ha 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.990
 and would be very angry and would 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.329
 get rid of them 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.860
 I do not know how it happened but 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.860
 The fact is that there was someone who had the 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.830
 idea of threshing the grain and put 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.590
 in a pan on the lining waiting for 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.340
 so that the grains softened and could 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.340
 be eaten 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:06.390
 but this experience with water failure 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:08.390
 then someone tried the fat and it is not 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.929
 what happened what no one ever did 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.929
 could have imagined 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.920
 suddenly the grains began to 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:21.660
 burst from the pan with a 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:25.440
 huge noise but the extraordinary was 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.350
 what happened to them the hard grains 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.810
 breaking teeth turned into flowers 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:36.030
 white and soft that even the children 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:40.860
 could be common but the transformation 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:43.590
 happens by the power of fire level of 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.120
 popcorn that does not pass through the fire continues 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.120
 to be corn popcorn forever 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.260
 I believe that this happens with a lot of 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.109
 people 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:59.640
 the great transformations happen 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:03:01.950
 when we went through fire and does not pass 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.340
 by the fire it stays the same way 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.240
 whole life are people of the same 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:14.690
 species and harshness 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:16.250
 only that these people do not realize in 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.830
 christian symbolism 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.590
 The miracle of popcorn is 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.540
 represented by death and resurrection 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.540
 Of Jesus 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.530
 resurrection is the bursting of corn from 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:33.620
 popcorn it is necessary to stop being a 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.500
 Way to be from another in mine 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:42.140
 general will everyone knows what is pure 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:45.050
 the session that the pillar talking about the az 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.220
 here with the paranaenses the Paulistas and 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.530
 gauchos 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:52.400
 we find that they ignore that 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:56.570
 be it images is the popcorn that 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:04:00.220
 refuses to burst but I think the power 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:03.710
 Folic lethal pillar is much larger 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:08.200
 in relation to those people who, for 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:11.090
 Fire, refuse, refuse, love. 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.520
 they think there can be no such thing as 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.970
 more wonderful than the way of 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.970
 vaccine 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:33.880
 ignore that Jesus said who preserves the 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:37.150
 your life will lose it presumption of these 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.699
 people and their fear are the hard shell of 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:47.680
 corn that does not study and their style is 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:51.000
 Sad to stay a lifetime, will not go 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:55.509
 to become white and soft flower 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.370
 They will not give anyone joy. 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:05:01.070
 Popcorn burst into 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.020
 in the bottom of the pan are the pillars that 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:07.840
 they're no good at all 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.840
 Your destination is crap. 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.330
 that the fire of the holy spirit of God 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:19.550
 may be burning our houses and 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.550
 making them more malleable to the south 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:31.060
 The word that stays with you this morning. 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:34.030
 the minimum brother is to let god have changed 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.270
 shape by the living word hour by power 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.270
 God's 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:45.880
 you do not become a pillar but corn 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:49.750
 popcorn that bursts that open a 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:52.240
 white flower to receive all the grace of the 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.350
 love or blessing that you come to 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.410
 you 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:59.639
 so get out of the sameness and make a difference 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.639
 in your agency
