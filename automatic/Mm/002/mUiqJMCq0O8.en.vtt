and<00:03:59.700> this<00:03:59.940> stuff<00:04:00.150> will<00:04:00.360> compress<00:04:00.780> a<00:04:01.170> little

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
and this stuff will compress a little

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
and this stuff will compress a little
bit<00:04:01.739> as<00:04:01.920> it<00:04:02.099> cooks

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
you know it'll kind of find its own

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.580 
you know it'll kind of find its own
level<00:04:06.270> and<00:04:08.120> then<00:04:09.120> we<00:04:09.360> may<00:04:09.900> leave<00:04:10.200> a<00:04:10.230> little<00:04:10.500> bit

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
level and then we may leave a little bit

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.790 
level and then we may leave a little bit
of<00:04:10.650> cheese<00:04:10.830> leftover<00:04:11.569> for<00:04:12.569> when<00:04:13.560> we're<00:04:13.680> done
