00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
environment as you said this car is less

environment as you said this car is less
emissions<00:02:25.550> at<00:02:25.700> a<00:02:25.790> previous<00:02:25.970> car<00:02:26.360> better<00:02:26.900> gas

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
emissions at a previous car better gas

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.420 
emissions at a previous car better gas
mileage<00:02:27.709> more<00:02:28.340> horsepower<00:02:28.989> so<00:02:29.989> as<00:02:30.170> long<00:02:30.350> as

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
mileage more horsepower so as long as
