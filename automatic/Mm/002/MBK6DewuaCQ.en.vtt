00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.240
 hello everyone knows that the 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.449
 boiler room and I hope you go 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.270
 well 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:10.050
 we meet for a video on 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.679
 delachaux clan so in this video I 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.139
 will give you five tips tips 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.270
 to better play to progress more 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.460
 quickly 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.990
 and to better understand him so the 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.550
 first the first advice that I 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.289
 could you give it 's not to 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.789
 improve your city hall as long as 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.789
 you do not have everything thoroughly in the 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.969
 of yesteryear you can not do anything anymore 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.500
 improved because otherwise it's useless 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.880
 at all to improve the city hall not 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.750
 that it could serve you report to 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.690
 you add 50 wall add you 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.219
 two arcs x you have galley to have 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.160
 so words for info I just put 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.730
 my two bows x it's at least game by 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.480
 a word that I have my level 9 hotel and 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.090
 also because when you attack already 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.590
 you are going to come across some people who 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.379
 already sell when you go to do yourself 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.550
 attack it will be stronger than you 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.670
 or people they have the same hotel from 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.890
 city ​​that you and when you go 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.570
 attack if you are 9 hdv and you 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.229
 come across a 9 hdv that has 3 million 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.030
 in its reserves 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.479
 it is the power to sting him for example 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.430
 that 150 minutes was 3000 my salary 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.750
 and if you are city hall it takes 8 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.009
 and that you tease you attacking a 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.720
 level 9 town hall 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.900
 you will be able to over 3 million 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.290
 you'll be able to sting him 300 miles 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.460
 and that's why I need it 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.720
 follow my follow my advice but 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.920
 frankly I regret it I'm the 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.520
 know so I read you for them here 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.220
 why whew 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.869
 if the same stupidity so my second 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.430
 advice is to improve the 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.899
 mines and the extractors how do you 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.750
 can see they are all levels 11 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:50.610
 mines so no need for me 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:54.850
 says that it's still after my 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:02:00.310
 extractor they are remembered they are 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:02.110
 three levels 11 and 3 levels say 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.670
 yeah that's right 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:09.530
 love black elixir drill its level 3 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.390
 and level too many baskets to improve 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.260
 more because after that becomes too expensive 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.090
 3 million for a mine people one for 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.270
 they did that it was still seen 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.560
 is still proud so that's it 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.690
 it was my second advice my 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.290
 third advice is never 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.190
 to have two workers free so me 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.310
 I had to do it because 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.530
 I save moment there all that I 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.520
 want to improve it will last it cost that 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.940
 expensive so there for now I 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:41.240
 can not by but bombay all but that 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.570
 I'm interested in boxing that in so hard 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.590
 two hours and in two hours played 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.160
 in two hours I'll have enough for 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:54.560
 improve a wizard around sorcerer by 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:58.070
 example so that's because like that 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.350
 your money is worth the village it increases 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:04.970
 more quickly progresses more 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:07.910
 quickly and to the water if you made 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.860
 so that was my third advice my 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.050
 Fourth advice is to improve 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.920
 wizard's tricks as fast as possible 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.660
 at most I have three level 3 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.980
 levels too and level setting while 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:24.489
 like that yeah that's it so it's eating 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.570
 to you it's bad but I did not do 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.250
 sorry there is a laptop that rings that 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:33.010
 my father he wants to pick up 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.010
 I hope it's a must close the door 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.380
 frankly I'm sorry so because 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.930
 this the best for me is the 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.630
 best defense we can have 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.300
 because he attacks the yen trooper and 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.010
 the ground troops and that makes 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.430
 area damage to turn damage 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.800
 tons it means that if at 8 pm and who 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.260
 are glued he wants to make a shot he sees 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.560
 all explode so it's not 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.420
 wrong 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:09.610
 you can see that these 16 to eat 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.120
 level 4 level levels so that makes 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.280
 still 20 20 damage per second 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.930
 and it's not 22 lightning damage that 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.450
 launch these 20 megas per second because 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.910
 that the time they throw them that is 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:25.720
 that recharge are illuminating that's it 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:28.060
 is at least a second ago is said 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.920
 sorry it must be important because 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.920
 it's a cell phone that's ringing now 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.030
 so what I was saying 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.570
 yeah so here is maybe there is a 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.130
 second and a half between the time he 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.520
 reloaded the time that finally pulls 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:54.820
 between two shots what so that's thirty 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.560
 it's thirty damage 32 guys from 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:01.780
 it's not bad because you can have a 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:04.470
 mortar these nine have a level 6 is by 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.470
 example this 

00:05:07.179 --> 00:05:14.929
 files and it's also the fruit pulls 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:16.610
 a lot per second so that's it 

00:05:14.929 --> 00:05:20.709
 it was my fourth piece of advice 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.709
 fifth tip I do not know what you are 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:27.319
 it is to improve your castle of clans 

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:29.269
 minimum lifted leucate like that you 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:32.749
 may you have asked for 

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:34.069
 dragons from the core countries to the people you 

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:39.529
 have in your friends that you have 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:41.089
 in your clan so here is a small 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:44.749
 time a little 6th because I come 

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:46.759
 to have an idea that I did not tell you 

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:50.089
 that I had not noticed on my sheet so 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:53.599
 these two improve your reserves to 

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:55.849
 maximum because for example if you 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:58.399
 are you if you come across if you have if 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:01.699
 you need 3 million to throw no 

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:01.939
 less improved is that I could 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:03.979
 say 

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:05.929
 in short if you 3 million for 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:07.279
 improve something and you're at 

00:06:05.929 --> 00:06:09.289
 two million 900 thousand you are you 

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:11.509
 went to get a guy who has a hundred thousand 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:14.149
 normal but then you came across a 

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:15.439
 450000 guy you prick him 

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:16.610
 stuff the 450 miles but you do not have 

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:18.369
 not be able to store them because you 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.869
 have too low reserves 

00:06:18.369 --> 00:06:22.399
 so that's the end of this video 

00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:24.769
 I hope she will have pleased you 

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:26.439
 will have helped do not hesitate to put a gm
