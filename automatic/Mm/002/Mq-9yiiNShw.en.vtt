there<00:01:10.310> so<00:01:11.310> I'm<00:01:11.640> just<00:01:11.790> hopefully<00:01:12.240> be<00:01:12.570> able<00:01:12.720> to

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
there so I'm just hopefully be able to

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.020 
there so I'm just hopefully be able to
just<00:01:12.960> use<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.920> push<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.310> into<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.670> grout

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
just use this to push it into the grout

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.719 
just use this to push it into the grout
lines<00:01:15.920> and<00:01:16.920> you're<00:01:17.040> gonna<00:01:17.130> get<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.340> lot<00:01:17.549> that's

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
lines and you're gonna get a lot that's

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.310 
lines and you're gonna get a lot that's
gonna<00:01:17.820> fall<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.420> that's<00:01:18.540> fine<00:01:19.369> but<00:01:20.369> really<00:01:21.320> if

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
gonna fall and that's fine but really if

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.200 
gonna fall and that's fine but really if
your<00:01:22.530> regrouting<00:01:22.950> an<00:01:23.189> entire<00:01:23.490> bath<00:01:23.820> tub<00:01:24.119> I

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
your regrouting an entire bath tub I

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.850 
your regrouting an entire bath tub I
definitely<00:01:24.750> recommend<00:01:24.990> buying<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.619> tools

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
definitely recommend buying the tools

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.550 
definitely recommend buying the tools
but<00:01:26.189> for<00:01:26.340> me<00:01:26.460> it's<00:01:27.180> just<00:01:27.330> these<00:01:27.600> two<00:01:27.840> spots<00:01:28.170> on

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
but for me it's just these two spots on

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.300 
but for me it's just these two spots on
one<00:01:28.710> side<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.130> window<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.640> really<00:01:30.090> got<00:01:31.310> kind

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
one side the window that really got kind

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.090 
one side the window that really got kind
of<00:01:32.400> loose<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.880> tile<00:01:33.420> shifted<00:01:34.049> probably<00:01:34.920> when

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
of loose the tile shifted probably when

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.120 
of loose the tile shifted probably when
the<00:01:35.250> weather<00:01:35.579> change<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.270> got<00:01:36.390> colder<00:01:37.130> and

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
the weather change and got colder and

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.670 
the weather change and got colder and
it's<00:01:38.520> like<00:01:38.729> spending<00:01:39.119> 15<00:01:39.570> 20<00:01:39.930> bucks<00:01:40.140> just<00:01:40.320> on

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
it's like spending 15 20 bucks just on

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.530 
it's like spending 15 20 bucks just on
something<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.460> was<00:01:41.549> gonna<00:01:41.640> use<00:01:41.909> just<00:01:41.939> for<00:01:42.270> this

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
something I was gonna use just for this
