 we come to the third part of mine 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:18.330
 medicus in the last part 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:23.230
 made tangible and filled the sand 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:26.460
 this part cheap that scheduled in 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.810
 march has already started filling 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.970
 before that the rest of the technology 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.610
 let install the pressed 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:37.710
 Technique that means that Beck mother without 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:41.590
 I have delivered a hot one yet 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:45.730
 Participants of aqua medic stocked and 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:48.820
 The associated control unit this victory 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.410
 and Roland would swing and look 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.170
 with install before I except that 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:58.329
 a film then I have one more 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:04.360
 Extra flow little feel for FIDOR 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:06.340
 this year is a nano flow I will 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:14.470
 then install it too 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:18.930
 So have fun so as I said here 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:23.260
 I installed coriano after you 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:27.180
 in addition down here is the 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:33.670
 heaters among the fields sponge quasi 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:35.950
 so and this unit has its own 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:41.980
 I 've never had any feelers here 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:46.900
 then the whole system will be installed 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:49.030
 taxed on this opponent here as 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.560
 two sockets of the chamber then quasi 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.640
 also connect a cooler 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.180
 I can still another 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.510
 demonstrate 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:02.530
 well so now i will fill in water 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:09.030
 if it's inside, I'll get in touch 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:14.190
 again bite then to the water is in it 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.190
 is of course still cloudy without end 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.799
 I already have the lamp on it 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.659
 made the actually settled at 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:26.719
 fill with water 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:32.640
 we press the button on time 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:34.609
 decide this works this 9 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.340
 and 3 5 thousand for this an aqua medic 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:41.430
 stop his asthma full of power 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:49.230
 I had to look like myself 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:51.950
 delivers well I press time on it so 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.950
 something happens 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.720
 it runs 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.730
 Something's going on 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.599
 the flow pumps are running 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.390
 the cleaner also runs 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:40.440
 well that's clear to me oh and then 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:43.230
 I do not the final report should 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.380
 I'm back we come to 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.459
 end of these for this video series me 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.640
 still have a little bit of water left 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.739
 filled because of the depreciation not 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.680
 has worked properly now has that 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.180
 piece clarified that I did not know 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.680
 it was like that, of course, still 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.380
 a little bit over it but that is first 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.230
 a clearer therefore very fine whole 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:08.100
 fine bubbles I have to 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.720
 first drive, as we said still 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:14.810
 times to this regulator system of the 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:17.519
 heater has illuminated display here 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.880
 so that then water temperature 21 come 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:25.620
 if your cross looks up there 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.950
 you can then the temperature was nice 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.960
 you want to hire 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:36.000
 So I do that now just for 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:39.030
 then have a browser at 25 degrees 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.950
 here are nice snowflake is quasi 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:45.690
 the tolerance one starts there so 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:52.039
 Employees set this time on one 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:57.870
 a 21.9 degrees is my water 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:05:04.950
 I'll fix that myself again 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:07.669
 goodbye, so he works now too 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.669
 already nice 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:18.899
 now works well then thank you 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:18.899
 for that look
