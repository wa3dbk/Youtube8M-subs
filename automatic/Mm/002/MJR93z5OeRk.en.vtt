00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.760
 a building in itself 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.000
 generated and do not say something 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.739
 cheat that need a lot of wool 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.430
 to make it so it's like a block 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.920
 spark you 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.860
 open the chest and here we see 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.079
 several new items that us 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:01.770
 need here is designed for two 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:04.909
 players so make a face closer to 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.220
 you could see better and get on the roof 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.260
 let's set the flag right here 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.630
 which will show us what we are from 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.420
 green teams though about authorship also 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.729
 visible and see what we have here for 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.890
 blocks first is first aid kit second 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.810
 it is a block of armor and in the third it is a bro 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.479
 I take it and in the third it is a block 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.820
 weapon 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.340
 let's talk first about the first aid kit because 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.740
 then half go to block a 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.720
 keeps well good so we click right 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.530
 the mouse buttons on the first aid kit nothing to us 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.700
 it comes it is such an inscription that 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.680
 we don't know what the team means to 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.200
 start we need to get dressed make smooth 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.610
 transition we press the right mouse button and 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.480
 we put on the green team and only 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.460
 after that we can be treated on 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.800
 right click here in this first aid kit 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.620
 as you can see, it will immediately disappear just as 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.180
 and here the screen of this loading also disappears 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.670
 but you will slowly accumulate 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.440
 can get a new set of armor 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.750
 as a set of weapons let's just 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.390
 right click and us right away 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.470
 a whole big set like that will squeeze 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:17.150
 weapons and which I now tell you that 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:19.160
 here there is in the first place so let's also 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.340
 us by the way I forgot we need now 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.660
 install another block that was given 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.460
 to us in the first chest 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.560
 and this is such a block and click 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.690
 pad the mouse and we get patron then 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.170
 there are such balls with paint if you 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.670
 played soccer or just know and 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.160
 now to shoot we have to press 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.640
 left mouse button well, so spectacular will 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.500
 to look like 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.120
 that is, you see we have such a sight 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.640
 immediately appear we press right 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.320
 click and shoot and by the way 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.570
 when we shoot as you see here 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.940
 such particles remain it is very cool and 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:53.450
 paint marks but by the way soon 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.610
 will also disappear from shotguns shoot 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.140
 a little more can also be aimed 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.740
 in general you can aim at everyone here 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.740
 here and he immediately shoots a fraction 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.540
 something like a sniper translated and here he is 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.510
 Inserted too single but damage it 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.910
 more than a gun also have 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.450
 sniper rifle from her shoot 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.489
 uncomfortable because it is slightly italicized 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.230
 I need to aim it somehow 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:23.060
 flew right but she doesn't care 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.900
 the cashier and there is a grenade launcher we are to 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.060
 further flew to the elephant but 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.400
 our grenade is enough for us to press the left 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.920
 mouse buttons aim higher and how 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.599
 see she flew to the enemy base 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.849
 there was such a small explosion 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.439
 which does not destroy the landscape but you 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.810
 You can throw it by hand but it is so 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:43.950
 far not fly here, she will be here 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:50.790
 closer then its maximum so here 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:53.159
 balls we also have here si4 and here 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.519
 so here's a little thing let's go to you about her 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:58.500
 I will tell so we leave by the way push 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.959
 the plates work here are such woolen 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.459
 they work only for the team that is 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.349
 if you are from an enemy team then you 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.510
 so have to break the wool because 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:10.730
 otherwise you will not leave we will leave as 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:15.420
 ordinary person here and let's go on about 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:19.470
 for example here artificially created 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:21.320
 bot for him boom and try here 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.180
 experiment all four 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.090
 even try on the base break in like 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.820
 see we can't enter because here 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:33.870
 such a thing that the wife of the plates to work 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.599
 only on team members so let's 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:40.760
 his face did not come on to 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:43.590
 and does not collide and put here si4 here 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.599
 Prakash mice here on lay a stretcher 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.520
 now it won't blow up no we can of course 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:49.110
 click on her bed was right 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.510
 mouse click but still it doesn't 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.220
 explode so we need to take here 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.870
 such an activator will press the right 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.490
 mouse button is activated dice 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.919
 left click it 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.080
 activated and if we are not and aimed 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.240
 of course now go away 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.970
 we press the right mouse button in spite 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:09.590
 we don't need it all now 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.590
 attach here 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:19.120
 strange she writes that we are not dressed 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:24.080
 let's get armor with him without armor 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:25.860
 so now a separate file 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:31.150
 blow up 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:34.480
 strange so okay in general she's the idea 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.710
 explodes and she by the way so pretty 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.500
 still effectively explodes 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:41.080
 but for some reason now it is not my 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:44.710
 It works although it worked for a long time, let's 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.510
 experiment again material 1 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.180
 get out of here let's go out of this 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:51.280
 polygon 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:55.270
 from here we go away put everything 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:57.070
 four and activate and here it exploded 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.480
 we don’t know why but we don’t 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:01.870
 exploded can base there because 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:04.200
 black black here and now we can again 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:09.790
 put we activate the left mouse button 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:12.040
 go away and so here she is 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:15.570
 exploded but without sound such a grandmother 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.810
 By the way, there are these 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:20.890
 bombs 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:24.610
 For example, if I had put Turov 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:26.260
 your player si4 here and when would you come to her 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.980
 come up you would have exploded along the course of 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.290
 other team 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:33.280
 then you can so quietly approach her 

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:38.400
 let's say let's take it out of the fog now 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:43.350
 you item 1 is with us let's be 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:44.590
 even though we take a new armor and and we take 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:48.060
 si4 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:51.180
 and here we have such a paint that is 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:54.580
 we put this dream 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:57.160
 we dress armor in blue we are so imperceptible 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:07:01.150
 switched to someone else's team take eat 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:04.240
 blue and we also need power because 47 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:06.430
 countries and there is a boat that is usually necessary 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.470
 here and leave here and 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.330
 come to her click the mouse she 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:13.419
 repainted it repainted and on us 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:15.910
 does not explode at all even if the member is a stranger 

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:18.070
 teams will try to blow it up but in 

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:20.080
 principle on this all thanks for all
