switched the flip to give s voice the
priority<00:02:10.470> now<00:02:10.590> but<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:11.280> seems<00:02:11.520> silly<00:02:11.790> since

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
priority now but that seems silly since

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.700 
priority now but that seems silly since
it's<00:02:12.540> just<00:02:12.629> not<00:02:12.930> as<00:02:13.080> good

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
it's just not as good

it's just not as good
well<00:02:14.100> actually<00:02:14.250> that<00:02:14.460> might<00:02:14.670> make<00:02:14.880> perfect

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
well actually that might make perfect

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.360
