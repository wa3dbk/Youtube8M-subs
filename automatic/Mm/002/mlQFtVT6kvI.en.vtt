by 2 and a half I just welded a bunch of
them<00:01:54.689> together<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.320> wound<00:01:55.590> up<00:01:55.770> with<00:01:55.950> this

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
them together and wound up with this

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.389 
them together and wound up with this
braced<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.439> on<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.649> bottom<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.189> little

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
braced it on the bottom it is a little

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.719 
braced it on the bottom it is a little
floppy<00:01:59.670> but<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.090> does<00:02:00.240> work<00:02:00.450> well<00:02:01.610> held<00:02:02.610> the

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
floppy but it does work well held the

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.429 
floppy but it does work well held the
battery<00:02:03.060> up<00:02:03.180> with<00:02:03.329> again<00:02:03.600> some<00:02:03.780> more<00:02:03.810> parts<00:02:04.290> of

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
battery up with again some more parts of

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.270 
battery up with again some more parts of
a<00:02:04.590> bookcase<00:02:05.340> or<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.759> display<00:02:06.060> rack<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.890> engine

a bookcase or a display rack the engine

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.580 
a bookcase or a display rack the engine
I<00:02:08.459> really<00:02:08.849> like<00:02:09.000> this<00:02:09.149> engine<00:02:09.509> it's<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.750> vortex

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
I really like this engine it's a vortex

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.220 
I really like this engine it's a vortex
13<00:02:11.250> horsepower<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:12.300> looks<00:02:12.569> like<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.780> Honda

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
13 horsepower it looks like a Honda

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.880 
13 horsepower it looks like a Honda
sounds<00:02:13.739> like

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
sounds like

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.030 
sounds like
Honda<00:02:14.310> but<00:02:14.910> it's<00:02:15.090> definitely<00:02:15.540> not<00:02:15.660> a<00:02:15.720> Honda

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
Honda but it's definitely not a Honda

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.650 
Honda but it's definitely not a Honda

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
but it does work extremely well I got it

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.920 
but it does work extremely well I got it
off<00:02:18.750> eBay<00:02:19.110> for<00:02:19.170> maybe<00:02:19.830> $300<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:21.600> seller<00:02:21.840> I

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.140 
a little bit of a expanded aluminum on
hinges<00:02:59.070> so<00:02:59.190> you<00:02:59.250> can<00:02:59.370> get<00:02:59.489> up<00:02:59.610> and<00:02:59.760> service<00:03:00.060> the

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150

hinges so you can get up and service the
wheels<00:03:00.330> if<00:03:00.510> you<00:03:00.570> need<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:01.050> it<00:03:01.230> hasn't

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
wheels if you need to it it hasn't

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.740 
wheels if you need to it it hasn't
really<00:03:01.800> been<00:03:02.040> necessary<00:03:02.550> to<00:03:02.610> do<00:03:02.790> so<00:03:03.030> I'd

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
really been necessary to do so I'd

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.940 
really been necessary to do so I'd
recommend<00:03:04.170> if<00:03:04.260> you're<00:03:04.350> going<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:04.530> build<00:03:04.739> this

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
recommend if you're going to build this

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.740 
recommend if you're going to build this

make one side fixed in one side on a

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.910 
make one side fixed in one side on a

guard is a tandem axle trailer wheel

guard is a tandem axle trailer wheel
guard<00:03:16.430> just<00:03:17.430> extended<00:03:17.970> it<00:03:18.030> in<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.180> middle<00:03:18.360> a

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
guard just extended it in the middle a

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.539 
guard just extended it in the middle a
little<00:03:18.540> bit<00:03:18.780> it<00:03:18.870> works<00:03:19.049> fairly<00:03:19.200> well<00:03:19.549> but

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
little bit it works fairly well but

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.100 
little bit it works fairly well but
overall<00:03:20.910> if<00:03:21.150> this<00:03:21.299> thing<00:03:21.480> works<00:03:21.660> really<00:03:21.840> well

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
overall if this thing works really well

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.229 
overall if this thing works really well
the<00:03:22.440> biggest<00:03:22.829> drawback<00:03:23.700> is<00:03:23.910> it's<00:03:24.060> a<00:03:24.120> little

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
the biggest drawback is it's a little

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.330 
the biggest drawback is it's a little
tall<00:03:24.540> you<00:03:25.230> can<00:03:25.380> build<00:03:25.560> it<00:03:25.680> shorter<00:03:25.980> than<00:03:26.010> six

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
tall you can build it shorter than six

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.550 
tall you can build it shorter than six
and<00:03:26.489> a<00:03:26.519> half<00:03:26.549> feet<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:27.239> I'm<00:03:28.019> not<00:03:28.230> sure<00:03:28.350> what<00:03:28.530> I

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
and a half feet and I'm not sure what I

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.440 
and a half feet and I'm not sure what I
was<00:03:28.739> thinking<00:03:29.070> there<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.880> other<00:03:29.970> part<00:03:30.269> that<00:03:30.390> I

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
was thinking there the other part that I

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.130 
was thinking there the other part that I
really<00:03:30.630> kind<00:03:30.780> of<00:03:30.840> struggle<00:03:31.200> with<00:03:31.350> is<00:03:31.530> on<00:03:31.680> the

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
really kind of struggle with is on the

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.920 
really kind of struggle with is on the
on<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.290> log<00:03:34.470> bed<00:03:35.239> to<00:03:36.239> hold<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.510> logs<00:03:36.690> in<00:03:36.900> place

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
on the log bed to hold the logs in place

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.050 
on the log bed to hold the logs in place
it<00:03:37.500> just<00:03:37.920> I<00:03:38.100> could<00:03:38.280> do<00:03:38.400> some<00:03:38.640> different<00:03:38.940> things

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
it just I could do some different things

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.060 
it just I could do some different things
on<00:03:39.299> here<00:03:39.329> but<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:40.140> does<00:03:40.320> work<00:03:40.560> it's<00:03:40.799> a<00:03:40.860> little

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
on here but it does work it's a little

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.430 
on here but it does work it's a little
slow<00:03:41.370> but<00:03:42.120> instead<00:03:42.660> of<00:03:42.780> buying<00:03:43.200> your<00:03:43.380> own

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
slow but instead of buying your own

sawmill<00:03:43.980> I<00:03:44.100> built<00:03:44.310> this<00:03:44.430> one<00:03:44.489> for<00:03:44.850> right

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
sawmill I built this one for right

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.370 
sawmill I built this one for right
around<00:03:45.299> $1,000<00:03:46.170> hope<00:03:46.920> it<00:03:47.070> helps<00:03:47.280> you
