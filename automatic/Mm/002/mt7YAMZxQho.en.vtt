writing<00:00:20.699> intensive<00:00:21.560> this<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.220> video<00:00:24.029> course

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
writing intensive this is a video course

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.410 
writing intensive this is a video course
of<00:00:24.810> me<00:00:25.529> teaching<00:00:26.279> children<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.029> three

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
of me teaching children and three

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.450 
of me teaching children and three
different<00:00:27.779> grade<00:00:28.109> levels<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.680> level<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.160> would

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
different grade levels the level a would

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.609 
different grade levels the level a would
be<00:00:29.609> your<00:00:29.820> approximately<00:00:30.750> say<00:00:30.990> three<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.380> five

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
be your approximately say three to five

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.370 
be your approximately say three to five
reading<00:00:32.250> level<00:00:32.489> level<00:00:33.120> B<00:00:33.300> six<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.960> eight<00:00:34.140> and

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
reading level level B six to eight and

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.819 
reading level level B six to eight and
level<00:00:35.010> C<00:00:35.219> would<00:00:35.430> be<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.760> high<00:00:36.059> school<00:00:36.300> level

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
level C would be a high school level

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.940 
level C would be a high school level
there<00:00:37.829> are<00:00:37.860> four<00:00:38.550> long<00:00:39.059> video<00:00:39.629> classes<00:00:40.379> on<00:00:40.620> the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
there are four long video classes on the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:48.529 
there are four long video classes on the
DVDs<00:00:41.370> as<00:00:41.640> well<00:00:42.420> as<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:43.969> book<00:00:44.969> with<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.899> lot<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:47.539> in

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
DVDs as well as a book with a lot of in

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.690 
DVDs as well as a book with a lot of in
between<00:00:48.840> lessons<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.890> way<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.160> works<00:00:50.399> is

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
between lessons so the way this works is

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.439 
between lessons so the way this works is
we<00:00:50.910> introduce<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.899> first<00:00:52.079> basic<00:00:52.530> model<00:00:53.449> and

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
we introduce the first basic model and

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.080 
we introduce the first basic model and
then<00:00:54.780> do<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.860> on<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.129> video<00:00:56.340> just<00:00:56.670> like<00:00:56.850> that

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
then do it on the video just like that

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.790 
then do it on the video just like that
and<00:00:57.329> it's<00:00:57.480> recorded<00:00:57.960> live<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.620> children

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
and it's recorded live so the children

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.189 
and it's recorded live so the children
are<00:00:59.039> very<00:00:59.520> engaged<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.660> video

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
are very engaged in the video

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.009 
are very engaged in the video
in<00:01:01.320> fact<00:01:01.469> I've<00:01:01.680> even<00:01:01.980> had<00:01:02.100> parents<00:01:02.520> say<00:01:02.670> oh<00:01:03.239> my

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
in fact I've even had parents say oh my

children watch the video do that

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.440 
children watch the video do that
assignment<00:01:19.380> just<00:01:19.740> like<00:01:19.950> on<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.640> video<00:01:20.729> lesson

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
assignment just like on the video lesson

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.870 
assignment just like on the video lesson
and<00:01:21.600> then<00:01:21.960> there's<00:01:22.170> several<00:01:22.409> more

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
and then there's several more

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.359 
and then there's several more
assignments<00:01:23.880> just<00:01:24.630> like<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.470> for<00:01:25.920> practice

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
assignments just like that for practice

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.230 
assignments just like that for practice
with<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:27.060> same<00:01:27.270> process<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.320> same<00:01:28.500> checklist

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
with the same process the same checklist

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.789 
with the same process the same checklist
then<00:01:30.240> they<00:01:30.360> would<00:01:30.540> watch<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.110> next<00:01:31.409> one<00:01:31.590> and

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
then they would watch the next one and

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.520 
then they would watch the next one and
that's<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.790> new<00:01:33.030> model<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.600> new<00:01:33.750> process<00:01:34.259> an

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
that's a new model a new process an

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.200 
that's a new model a new process an
expanded<00:01:35.159> checklist<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.759> then<00:01:36.000> there's

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
expanded checklist and then there's

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.210 
expanded checklist and then there's
several<00:01:36.450> more<00:01:36.689> just<00:01:37.229> like<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.829> for

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
several more just like that for

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.069 
several more just like that for
reinforcement<00:01:38.880> watch<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.659> third<00:01:39.869> one

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
reinforcement watch the third one

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.020 
reinforcement watch the third one
several<00:01:40.740> more<00:01:40.860> just<00:01:41.100> like<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.490> watch<00:01:41.759> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
several more just like that watch the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.670 
several more just like that watch the
fourth<00:01:42.270> one<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.960> it's<00:01:43.140> really<00:01:43.649> a

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
fourth one so that it's really a

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.130 
fourth one so that it's really a
modeling<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.549> practice<00:01:45.030> something<00:01:45.659> that

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140
