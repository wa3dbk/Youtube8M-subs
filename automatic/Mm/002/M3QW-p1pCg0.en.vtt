"Hi my name's Cole Galloway, I'm a professor
in physical therapy at the University of Delaware.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.450
And you're in the Pediatric Mobility Lab and
Design Studio.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.000
I was born in Mississippi.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.949
I went to my undergraduate at University of
Southern Mississippi.

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:39.559
What I do during the day is design technology
and training to advance the mobility of kids

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.620
with special needs.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.809
These are kids that have cerebral palsy, maybe
Down's syndrome, maybe general developmental

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:51.050
delay.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.829
Mobility problems are way more than just movement
because a kid's mobility is a human right.

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:58.989
We all have the right to move independently.

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.539
It's the independent mobility that really
is the focus.

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.520
When you don't have the ability to determine
when and where you move, somebody else will

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.680
determine that for you, and that's a dangerous
thing to do when you're trying to foster independence

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.790
in a child.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.100
So what we study in the lab and design for
can be sort of categorized into three separate

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:36.970
types: real world harness systems, ride on
cars, and functional fashions.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:45.290
The first time I can remember being interested
in science probably was in eighth grade in

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.780
science class where I was really intrigued
by the fanciness of science.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.460
That scientists were, had big brains, they
were respected, they, you know, they had cool

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.290
outfits; they may have had cool things.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.740
I knew I loved movement, I love sports, I
love dance, I love music.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.600
So that got me interested in physical therapy.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.210
Physical therapy got me working with people
that had movement problems.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.999
And that was a natural, sort of next step
was, I need to go back for more training to

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:19.180
be able to design technology to help people
move.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.769
I really like movement.

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:27.269
So if I want a child to become independently
mobile, I have to attack the child, their

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:34.520
brain, their bones, their family, society,
community, public policy, politicians, the

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.660
industry, funding.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.150
If I really want to change a system I've got
to change every component that weaves into

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.200
the system.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.200
That's, that needs collaborators.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.029
I have to have the planet working with me.

00:02:47.029 --> 00:02:54.220
Oh I love, in my free time as hobbies, I love
to move and be mobile with my three sons.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.980
I love running, I love hiking, and biking.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.739
I have a very movement oriented free time
where I'm always with kids, having fun with

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:05.859
kids.

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:07.190
So movement and mobility.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.689
With three, with three sons you get both sides
of independence, and I get to see that in

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:14.689
action.

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:14.900
So, I'm very lucky."
