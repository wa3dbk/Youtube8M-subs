00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 Hi, people study, it's gift. Today I came to talk. 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.420
 for you a little like having hair 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.059
 colored without ruining your hair even 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:15.360
 It's been a long time since I've painted the 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.480
 hair wanted to change is to choose a color 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.470
 more vibrant cooler as well 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.140
 colorful 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.240
 only I was very scared even more 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.480
 because my hair is black and I have to 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.029
 discolor it and to break it is already a 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.090
 little dry so I was very afraid 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.340
 to radicalize my hair and who 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.820
 company saw that recently I am 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.610
 with blue hair and I came to tell 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.370
 you and show what I did and talk about 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.829
 a super easy way that does not spoil the 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.300
 hair of you have colored hair 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.570
 I had a very big taboo too 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.910
 about megahair and hair extension 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.489
 only I discovered that there are methods 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.239
 yes they do not spoil your hair and that you 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.399
 you can use it in a fun way, it's not 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.690
 just to lengthen my hair I thought 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.470
 my career not only for those who wanted 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.900
 have longer hair and had no 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.909
 I was too lazy to grow up, right? 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.530
 but there are a lot of people who actually use 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.900
 not to really spoil itself 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.810
 hair with waists and etc. 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.970
 and I think it 's really cool and you can 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.530
 have hair color you want if you 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.990
 I just want to put some blond hair 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.580
 or if you want to perform as I have 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.549
 colorful hair 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.439
 It's very easy and very cool, I'll go. 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.229
 to show you the whole process that 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.860
 happened of my hair change and it is 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.220
 That's my hair translating so people. 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.950
 Ottoman 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.470
 It's very cool. It has new colors on the hair. 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:49.020
 and I always intend that I want to change 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:51.320
 and put a different hair say and 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:02:00.370
 looks 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:02:04.240
 the priest was in my hair look 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:08.030
 very cool people I'm sending 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:11.959
 We'll teach you tomorrow. 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:15.020
 Just how do you do with everything? 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:18.040
 Anything you want for Victor, too. 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:21.530
 I'm beautiful mother 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.430
 the mega process it is very simple 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.459
 people 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.040
 the hairdresser separates our hair in 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.830
 some strategic points where they will 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.230
 get the screens to look very natural and 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.540
 blended with our real hair 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.510
 the fabrics they are made as of 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.780
 our heads and they are drawn with 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.150
 our own hair so do not spoil the 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:49.190
 hair because we take the Mexico only 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:52.580
 and the on-screen type makes a braided and 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:58.250
 there the real hair covers and stays 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:03:01.190
 hidden the screen is it does not hurt it is not 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.100
 very difficult and time-consuming process and 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.070
 very practical for anyone who wants to put it 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:11.920
 I put four of them in the head 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:14.420
 and that's it folks the result was this one 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.880
 I really liked it very much. 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.579
 innovative and very cool is no need to have 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.160
 no special care in washing and 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.709
 The painting of the color will leave because it is 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.940
 normal to put more than the average 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.120
 you do not have to be especially careful 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.940
 is a hair like be the same and 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.010
 He looks incredible in the head. I love it. 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.549
 really the result for whoever you want 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:40.130
 put colored hair or only 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.750
 increase your hair even I love I go 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.480
 leave the contact of the hall that I did 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.310
 down here because it really is that 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.950
 I hope you liked the video 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.239
 It's talking about what you think of me. 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.890
 new hair 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:56.890
 and this is it kisses until the next video
