okay ah oh well anyway okay let's focus
a<00:02:54.390> little<00:02:54.480> bit<00:02:54.600> where<00:02:54.840> we<00:02:54.930> are<00:02:55.050> I<00:02:57.080> might<00:02:58.080> help

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
a little bit where we are I might help

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.900 
a little bit where we are I might help
come<00:02:58.830> on<00:02:58.950> Oh<00:02:59.100> think<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.209> oh<00:03:00.450> there<00:03:00.630> we<00:03:00.720> go<00:03:00.750> okay

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.460 

so<00:03:05.910> let's<00:03:06.090> focus<00:03:06.269> these<00:03:06.569> giants<00:03:07.019> in<00:03:07.140> one<00:03:07.260> area

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
so let's focus these giants in one area

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.729 
so let's focus these giants in one area
so<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:09.030> healers<00:03:09.330> are<00:03:09.630> protecting<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:10.410> giants

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
so the healers are protecting the giants

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.410 
so the healers are protecting the giants
of<00:03:10.860> course<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.819> Giants<00:03:12.090> hope<00:03:12.269> they'll

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
of course and the Giants hope they'll

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.740 
of course and the Giants hope they'll
split<00:03:12.720> up<00:03:12.989> too<00:03:13.170> much<00:03:14.120> one's<00:03:15.120> going<00:03:15.360> left<00:03:15.540> one's

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
split up too much one's going left one's

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.220 
split up too much one's going left one's
going<00:03:15.959> right<00:03:17.150> so<00:03:18.150> whilst<00:03:18.390> that's<00:03:18.720> happening<00:03:19.170> i

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
going right so whilst that's happening i

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.259 
going right so whilst that's happening i
wonder<00:03:19.440> if<00:03:19.530> i<00:03:19.590> can<00:03:19.650> take<00:03:19.980> anything<00:03:20.250> else<00:03:20.970> where

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
interesting basis if we can get through

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.890 
interesting basis if we can get through
there

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:08.270

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
you know these knobs down the bases they

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.120 
you know these knobs down the bases they
quite<00:04:23.630> you<00:04:24.630> know<00:04:24.660> you<00:04:24.810> really<00:04:25.050> you<00:04:25.919> don't
