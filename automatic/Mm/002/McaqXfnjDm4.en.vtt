00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
glimpse at a Yeti in Far Cry 4 he passed

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.389

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
out at the end there so I assume that

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.190 
out at the end there so I assume that
you<00:01:47.670> were<00:01:47.759> saved<00:01:48.030> by<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.359> Yeti<00:01:48.810> although<00:01:49.170> I

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
you were saved by the Yeti although I

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.419 
you were saved by the Yeti although I
don't<00:01:49.319> know<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.859> for<00:01:50.039> sure

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
don't know that for sure

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:51.529 
don't know that for sure
the<00:01:50.549> first<00:01:50.789> thing<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.240> think<00:01:51.270> about

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
the first thing that you think about

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.690 
the first thing that you think about
when<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.899> think<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.350> Himalayas<00:01:52.920> are<00:01:52.950> Yeti

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
when you think of the Himalayas are Yeti

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.130

so it's amazing and it did actually put

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.569 
so it's amazing and it did actually put
them<00:01:55.469> in<00:01:55.590> this<00:01:55.740> game<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.399> the

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:01.940 
for far cry 4 and you can see there the
Yeti<00:02:00.929> definitely<00:02:01.409> looks<00:02:01.590> like<00:02:01.679> an

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
Yeti definitely looks like an

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.559 
Yeti definitely looks like an
intelligent<00:02:02.520> being<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.299> I'm<00:02:03.390> wondering

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
intelligent being so I'm wondering

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:04.910 
intelligent being so I'm wondering
whether<00:02:03.899> you're<00:02:04.049> going<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.200> be<00:02:04.319> hunting<00:02:04.530> this

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
whether you're going to be hunting this

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.990 
whether you're going to be hunting this
thing<00:02:05.159> or<00:02:05.369> you're<00:02:05.459> actually<00:02:05.759> going<00:02:05.849> to<00:02:05.909> be

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
thing or you're actually going to be

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.919 
thing or you're actually going to be
working<00:02:06.479> with<00:02:06.599> it

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
working with it

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:08.600 
working with it
personally<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.590> think<00:02:07.679> actually<00:02:08.129> working<00:02:08.340> with

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
personally I think actually working with

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.830 
personally I think actually working with
it<00:02:08.759> would<00:02:08.819> be<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:08.970> lot<00:02:09.179> more<00:02:09.390> fun<00:02:09.690> but
