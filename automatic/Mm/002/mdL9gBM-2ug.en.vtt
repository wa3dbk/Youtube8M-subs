00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.780
 hello I'm happy image fashion consultant 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.230
 and this time we're going to talk about 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.090
 how to walk in high heels with us 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.740
 if you've never tried to walk in heels myself 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.349
 I recommend you do not start with a few 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.900
 very high as the best children begins 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.910
 for a medium-heeled one like these that 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.610
 they are more or less than eight centimeters 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.040
 you will feel more comfortable some already very short 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.020
 like this you will not serve anything not 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.540
 you will see my stylized or elegant 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.210
 now the most comfortable and what more you 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.610
 I recommend you have a wide heel and 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.040
 platform will help you to maintain 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.320
 balance and not get tired so much as well 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.690
 will be the most comfortable in the world what 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.090
 next is the posture normally 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.520
 we tend to try to imagine that you 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.010
 is giving a trickle tighten the abdomen 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.230
 and the gluteus and with this you will get to see 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.539
 much more elegant now I'm going to 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.330
 teach a basic exercise imagine a 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.800
 line on the ground walk on it with 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.720
 one foot in front of the other with this 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.590
 will avoid the duck effect that 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.600
 see horrible 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.640
 you do not walk with heels as if you were 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.329
 without them that is to say putting all the weight 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.329
 on the feet 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.710
 It also avoids putting knees and 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.260
 Very stiff ankles look like the robot 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.900
 You can also hurt your back and 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.910
 the cervicals finally the beautiful one is 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.650

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.630

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.520

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.170
