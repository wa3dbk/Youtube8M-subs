we're<00:00:11.900> going<00:00:12.080> to<00:00:12.139> start<00:00:12.320> to<00:00:12.440> look<00:00:12.830> at<00:00:13.010> the

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:13.370 
we're going to start to look at the

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.670 
we're going to start to look at the
anatomy<00:00:14.030> of<00:00:14.059> the<00:00:14.240> shoulder<00:00:14.809> so<00:00:15.320> when<00:00:15.530> we're

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
anatomy of the shoulder so when we're

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.920 
anatomy of the shoulder so when we're
talking<00:00:15.950> about<00:00:16.340> the<00:00:16.760> shoulder<00:00:17.240> as<00:00:17.420> an<00:00:17.630> entire

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
talking about the shoulder as an entire

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.080 
talking about the shoulder as an entire
complex<00:00:18.529> we're<00:00:18.800> really<00:00:19.099> looking<00:00:19.369> at<00:00:19.730> four

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
complex we're really looking at four

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.120 
complex we're really looking at four
different<00:00:20.210> things<00:00:20.720> we're<00:00:21.439> looking<00:00:21.560> at<00:00:21.890> the

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
different things we're looking at the

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.010 
different things we're looking at the
scapula<00:00:22.550> thoracic<00:00:23.180> joint<00:00:23.449> so<00:00:23.780> how<00:00:23.960> the

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:24.020 
scapula thoracic joint so how the

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.529 
scapula thoracic joint so how the
shoulder<00:00:24.590> blade<00:00:24.890> relates<00:00:25.820> to<00:00:26.180> the<00:00:26.330> thoracic

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
shoulder blade relates to the thoracic

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.890 
shoulder blade relates to the thoracic
spine<00:00:26.990> we<00:00:27.920> are<00:00:28.100> looking<00:00:28.580> at<00:00:28.820> the<00:00:29.630> glenohumeral

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
spine we are looking at the glenohumeral

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.640 
spine we are looking at the glenohumeral
joint<00:00:30.529> which<00:00:31.279> is<00:00:31.490> how<00:00:31.760> the<00:00:32.390> humerus<00:00:33.290> and<00:00:33.590> the

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
joint which is how the humerus and the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.210 
joint which is how the humerus and the
humeral<00:00:34.400> head<00:00:34.760> of<00:00:35.059> the<00:00:35.989> shoulder<00:00:36.559> interacts

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
humeral head of the shoulder interacts

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.690 
humeral head of the shoulder interacts
with<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:38.000> scapula<00:00:38.540> we<00:00:39.350> are<00:00:39.470> looking<00:00:39.829> at<00:00:40.070> the

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
with the scapula we are looking at the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.590 
with the scapula we are looking at the
AC<00:00:40.970> joint<00:00:41.360> as<00:00:41.960> well<00:00:42.050> as<00:00:42.980> the<00:00:43.579> SC<00:00:44.059> joint<00:00:44.360> which

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
AC joint as well as the SC joint which

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.350 
AC joint as well as the SC joint which
is<00:00:44.630> here<00:00:45.050> up<00:00:45.230> front<00:00:45.440> so<00:00:46.430> what<00:00:46.670> we<00:00:46.820> really<00:00:47.180> need

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
is here up front so what we really need

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.810 
is here up front so what we really need
to<00:00:47.540> do<00:00:47.750> is<00:00:48.050> look<00:00:48.500> at<00:00:48.680> all<00:00:48.890> four<00:00:49.460> of<00:00:49.489> these

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
to do is look at all four of these

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.700 
to do is look at all four of these
joints<00:00:50.210> when<00:00:50.630> we're<00:00:50.809> talking<00:00:51.020> simply<00:00:51.559> about

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
joints when we're talking simply about

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.190 
joints when we're talking simply about
the<00:00:52.370> shoulder<00:00:52.879> go<00:00:53.480> ahead<00:00:53.660> and<00:00:53.809> stand<00:00:54.020> up<00:00:54.170> for

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
the shoulder go ahead and stand up for

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.610 
the shoulder go ahead and stand up for
me<00:00:54.440> Lindsey<00:00:54.829> as<00:00:55.360> we<00:00:56.360> are<00:00:56.570> looking<00:00:57.050> at<00:00:57.290> the

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
me Lindsey as we are looking at the

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.160 
me Lindsey as we are looking at the
shoulder<00:00:58.100> this<00:00:58.280> is<00:00:58.489> the<00:00:58.640> most<00:00:58.820> dynamic<00:00:59.170> joint

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
shoulder this is the most dynamic joint

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.930 
shoulder this is the most dynamic joint
we<00:01:00.350> have<00:01:00.530> in<00:01:00.680> the<00:01:00.770> body<00:01:00.950> which<00:01:01.250> is<00:01:01.399> why<00:01:01.550> it's<00:01:01.789> so

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
we have in the body which is why it's so

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.090 
we have in the body which is why it's so
exciting<00:01:02.030> for<00:01:02.600> me<00:01:02.750> and<00:01:02.989> one<00:01:03.379> of<00:01:03.410> my<00:01:03.559> favorite

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
exciting for me and one of my favorite

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.090 
exciting for me and one of my favorite
areas<00:01:04.580> in<00:01:04.879> the<00:01:05.000> body<00:01:05.210> to<00:01:05.539> treat<00:01:05.750> so<00:01:06.380> this<00:01:06.649> area

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
areas in the body to treat so this area

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.800 
areas in the body to treat so this area
from<00:01:08.060> where<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:08.860> clavicle<00:01:09.860> and<00:01:10.270> the<00:01:11.270> spine<00:01:11.660> of

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
from where the clavicle and the spine of

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.540 
from where the clavicle and the spine of
the<00:01:11.869> scapula<00:01:12.259> and<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:12.649> acromion<00:01:12.979> meet

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
the scapula and the acromion meet

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.249 
the scapula and the acromion meet
between<00:01:14.330> this<00:01:14.959> area<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:15.709> AC<00:01:15.890> joint<00:01:16.220> and<00:01:17.259> the

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
between this area the AC joint and the

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.490 
between this area the AC joint and the
humeral<00:01:19.220> head<00:01:19.490> of<00:01:19.759> the<00:01:20.450> shoulder<00:01:20.899> we<00:01:21.229> have<00:01:21.470> a

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
humeral head of the shoulder we have a

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.440 
humeral head of the shoulder we have a
small<00:01:21.920> space<00:01:22.369> and<00:01:22.640> that's<00:01:22.910> called<00:01:23.209> the

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
small space and that's called the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.260 
small space and that's called the
subacromial<00:01:23.869> space<00:01:24.459> the<00:01:25.459> subacromial<00:01:25.819> space

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
subacromial space the subacromial space

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.919 
subacromial space the subacromial space
is<00:01:26.899> so<00:01:27.349> small<00:01:27.550> it's<00:01:28.550> really<00:01:28.700> really<00:01:29.450> tiny<00:01:29.750> and

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:29.929 
is so small it's really really tiny and

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:32.109 
is so small it's really really tiny and
when<00:01:30.259> you<00:01:30.380> get<00:01:30.619> to<00:01:30.800> see<00:01:31.039> that<00:01:31.280> live<00:01:31.580> in<00:01:32.000> a

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
when you get to see that live in a

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:33.089 
when you get to see that live in a
cadaver

00:01:33.089 --> 00:01:33.099 
cadaver

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:36.699 
cadaver
it's<00:01:34.099> amazing<00:01:34.729> how<00:01:34.880> tiny<00:01:35.179> that<00:01:35.330> space<00:01:35.780> is<00:01:36.080> so

00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:36.709 
it's amazing how tiny that space is so

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:40.029 
it's amazing how tiny that space is so
anything<00:01:37.580> we<00:01:37.910> have<00:01:38.300> there<00:01:38.720> whether<00:01:39.050> it<00:01:39.380> is<00:01:39.679> an

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
anything we have there whether it is an

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:44.830 
anything we have there whether it is an
inflamed<00:01:40.729> tendon<00:01:41.390> or<00:01:41.630> a<00:01:42.200> bone<00:01:43.039> spur<00:01:43.550> or<00:01:43.910> simply

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
inflamed tendon or a bone spur or simply

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.620 
inflamed tendon or a bone spur or simply
even<00:01:45.229> just<00:01:45.470> poor<00:01:45.770> posture<00:01:46.069> it<00:01:46.729> doesn't<00:01:47.300> take

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
even just poor posture it doesn't take

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.770 
even just poor posture it doesn't take
much<00:01:47.959> to<00:01:48.619> decrease<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:49.459> space<00:01:49.819> we<00:01:50.090> have<00:01:50.420> in

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
much to decrease the space we have in

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.889 
much to decrease the space we have in
that<00:01:51.319> area<00:01:51.670> when<00:01:52.670> that<00:01:52.819> space<00:01:53.179> gets<00:01:53.479> decreased

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
that area when that space gets decreased

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.050 
that area when that space gets decreased
we<00:01:54.649> end<00:01:54.890> up<00:01:55.130> with<00:01:55.369> some<00:01:55.580> shoulder<00:01:55.819> impingement

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
we end up with some shoulder impingement

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.419 
we end up with some shoulder impingement
and<00:01:56.630> that<00:01:56.899> can<00:01:57.110> be<00:01:57.229> a<00:01:57.259> problem<00:01:57.500> for<00:01:57.920> a<00:01:57.979> lot<00:01:58.220> of

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
and that can be a problem for a lot of

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.250 
and that can be a problem for a lot of
overhead<00:01:58.759> assets

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
overhead assets

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:16.220 
overhead assets
you

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.290 

you
