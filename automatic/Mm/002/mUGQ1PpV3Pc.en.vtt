00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
the cargo distribution lock and will

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.160 
the cargo distribution lock and will
help<00:00:08.940> you<00:00:09.300> control<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:10.019> cargo<00:00:10.980> manager<00:00:12.170> as

you<00:00:13.380> might<00:00:13.590> know<00:00:13.799> already<00:00:14.190> if<00:00:14.400> you<00:00:14.519> connect

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
you might know already if you connect

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.939 
you might know already if you connect
something<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.480> cargo<00:00:15.719> manager<00:00:16.320> pipe<00:00:16.680> or<00:00:16.920> a

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
something to the cargo manager pipe or a

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.750 
something to the cargo manager pipe or a
tube<00:00:17.060> it<00:00:18.060> won't<00:00:18.449> really<00:00:18.779> grab<00:00:19.640> items<00:00:20.640> from

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
tube it won't really grab items from

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.490 
tube it won't really grab items from
certain<00:00:21.210> area<00:00:21.600> so<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:21.840> can't<00:00:22.109> really<00:00:22.320> control

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
certain area so you can't really control

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.670 
certain area so you can't really control
it<00:00:22.740> gets<00:00:23.460> or<00:00:23.699> puts<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.390> items<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.080> then<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.650> a

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
it gets or puts the items and then is a

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.349 
it gets or puts the items and then is a
limitation<00:00:26.779> then<00:00:27.779> now<00:00:28.349> we<00:00:29.340> can<00:00:29.519> put<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.029> cargo

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
limitation then now we can put the cargo

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.080 
limitation then now we can put the cargo
distribution<00:00:31.199> block<00:00:31.380> on<00:00:31.560> top<00:00:31.830> like<00:00:32.730> that

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
distribution block on top like that

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.120 
distribution block on top like that
unless<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:34.110> might<00:00:34.260> have<00:00:34.440> noticed<00:00:34.860> though

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
unless you might have noticed though

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.540 
unless you might have noticed though
these<00:00:36.030> are<00:00:36.270> not<00:00:36.300> connecting<00:00:37.070> so<00:00:38.070> right<00:00:38.250> let's

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
these are not connecting so right let's

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.459 
these are not connecting so right let's
right-click<00:00:38.820> right<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:39.780> now<00:00:39.899> we<00:00:39.960> have<00:00:40.260> the

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
right-click right so now we have the

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.020 
right-click right so now we have the
interface<00:00:40.800> here<00:00:40.980> we<00:00:41.190> have<00:00:41.340> different<00:00:41.579> sites

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
interface here we have different sites

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.900 
interface here we have different sites
orange<00:00:42.570> yellow<00:00:42.840> green<00:00:43.170> blue<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.280> red<00:00:44.610> and

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
orange yellow green blue and red and

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.940 
orange yellow green blue and red and
let's<00:00:45.300> decide<00:00:45.660> we<00:00:45.899> actually<00:00:46.289> have<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.469> block

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
let's decide we actually have a block

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.260 
let's decide we actually have a block
like<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:49.070> then<00:00:50.070> we<00:00:50.250> have<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.700> lot<00:00:51.120> of

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
like so and then we have a lot of

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.360 
like so and then we have a lot of
different<00:00:51.629> settings

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
different settings

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.840 
different settings
okay<00:00:53.629> let's<00:00:54.629> analyze<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.320> setup<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:56.309> here<00:00:56.730> we

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
okay let's analyze the setup so here we

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.549 
okay let's analyze the setup so here we
have<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.000> chest<00:00:57.390> with<00:00:57.690> Transposer

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
have a chest with Transposer

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.369 
have a chest with Transposer
and<00:00:58.890> some<00:00:59.609> tubes<00:00:59.969> go<00:01:00.329> into<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.750> block<00:01:01.050> I

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
and some tubes go into this block I

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.740 
and some tubes go into this block I
would<00:01:01.890> say<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.609> our<00:01:02.789> input<00:01:03.000> maybe<00:01:03.449> we

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
would say this is our input maybe we

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.420 
would say this is our input maybe we
have<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.930> base<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.199> they're<00:01:04.589> sending<00:01:04.949> items<00:01:05.309> to

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
have a base of they're sending items to

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.550 
have a base of they're sending items to
the<00:01:05.519> cargo<00:01:05.729> manager<00:01:06.299> right<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.990> we<00:01:07.110> have<00:01:07.290> a

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
the cargo manager right and we have a

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.429 
the cargo manager right and we have a
few<00:01:08.189> different<00:01:08.520> settings<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.720> sending

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
few different settings that is sending

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.609 
few different settings that is sending
things<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.670> cart<00:01:11.939> rails<00:01:12.869> fuel<00:01:13.350> and

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
things to the cart rails fuel and

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.380 
things to the cart rails fuel and
torches<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.280> we<00:01:14.580> have<00:01:14.729> another<00:01:14.970> setting

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
torches and we have another setting

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.890 
torches and we have another setting
actually<00:01:15.960> giving<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:17.420> cargo<00:01:18.420> all<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.320 
actually giving the the cargo all the
storage<00:01:19.200> back<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.100> cargo<00:01:20.340> manager<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.299> I

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
storage back to the cargo manager so I

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.830 
storage back to the cargo manager so I
will<00:01:21.570> want<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.790> send<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.939> from<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.180> well<00:01:24.689> it's

the cargo man just sending things to the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.350 
the cargo man just sending things to the
cart<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:41.090> so<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.119> Drive<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.659> there<00:01:43.310> and

cart that is so I Drive that there and

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.749 
cart that is so I Drive that there and
now<00:01:45.360> it's<00:01:45.509> connecting<00:01:46.340> pretty<00:01:47.340> cool<00:01:47.520> alright

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
now it's connecting pretty cool alright

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.010 
now it's connecting pretty cool alright
and<00:01:48.030> then<00:01:48.990> drop<00:01:49.259> some<00:01:49.439> rails<00:01:49.619> in<00:01:49.829> here<00:01:50.100> and

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
and then drop some rails in here and

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.340 
and then drop some rails in here and
they<00:01:52.020> will<00:01:52.409> actually<00:01:53.159> go<00:01:53.780> go<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:55.110> these

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
they will actually go go in these

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.709 
they will actually go go in these
storages<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.399> course<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.909> can't<00:01:57.119> really<00:01:57.329> see

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
storages of course you can't really see

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.330 
storages of course you can't really see
a<00:01:57.750> difference<00:01:57.960> right<00:01:58.380> now<00:01:58.649> because<00:01:59.070> it's

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
a difference right now because it's

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.990 
a difference right now because it's
going<00:01:59.549> all<00:01:59.759> right

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
going all right

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.889 
going all right
there<00:02:00.360> but<00:02:00.840> let's<00:02:01.140> do<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:02.270> so<00:02:03.270> what<00:02:03.450> did<00:02:03.659> just

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
there but let's do that so what did just

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.410 
there but let's do that so what did just
happen<00:02:03.990> well<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.770> told<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.610> we<00:02:05.880> wanted<00:02:06.299> to

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
happen well I told it that we wanted to

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.040 
happen well I told it that we wanted to
send<00:02:06.659> rails<00:02:07.380> from<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.640> cart<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.599> cargo

send rails from the cart to the cargo

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.520 
send rails from the cart to the cargo
manager<00:02:10.619> instead<00:02:11.510> that<00:02:12.510> doesn't<00:02:13.200> apply<00:02:13.410> to

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
manager instead that doesn't apply to

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.360 
manager instead that doesn't apply to
this

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
this

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.280 
this
this<00:02:14.580> is<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.879> only<00:02:15.060> sending<00:02:15.569> things<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.930> the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
this is the only sending things to the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.729 
this is the only sending things to the
card<00:02:16.530> of<00:02:17.459> course<00:02:18.269> we<00:02:18.540> could<00:02:18.810> could<00:02:19.440> manipulate

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
card of course we could could manipulate

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.839 
card of course we could could manipulate
it<00:02:20.190> by<00:02:20.370> adding<00:02:20.730> like<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.660> top<00:02:21.870> left<00:02:22.200> as<00:02:22.349> well

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
it by adding like the top left as well

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.210 
it by adding like the top left as well
that<00:02:23.849> wouldn't<00:02:24.150> really<00:02:24.300> make<00:02:24.569> sense<00:02:25.040> but<00:02:26.040> now

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
that wouldn't really make sense but now

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.750 
that wouldn't really make sense but now
it's<00:02:26.400> adding<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.790> here<00:02:27.000> again<00:02:28.040> even<00:02:29.040> no<00:02:29.580> matter

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
it's adding it here again even no matter

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.289 
it's adding it here again even no matter
in<00:02:30.180> which<00:02:30.330> direction<00:02:30.390> I<00:02:30.930> have<00:02:31.049> that<00:02:32.030> right

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
in which direction I have that right

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.589 
in which direction I have that right
maybe<00:02:33.840> we<00:02:34.049> want<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.319> send<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:34.910> these<00:02:35.910> cold

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
maybe we want to send that these cold

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.619 
maybe we want to send that these cold
stone<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.019> dirt<00:02:37.230> out<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:38.400> let's<00:02:38.670> just<00:02:39.000> tell<00:02:39.450> it

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
stone and dirt out so let's just tell it

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.660 
stone and dirt out so let's just tell it
this<00:02:39.840> is<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.110> yellow<00:02:40.290> side<00:02:40.560> of<00:02:40.709> it<00:02:40.799> there<00:02:41.010> so

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
this is the yellow side of it there so

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.589 
this is the yellow side of it there so
let's<00:02:41.849> just<00:02:41.940> say<00:02:42.269> yellow<00:02:43.049> side<00:02:43.379> you<00:02:43.920> should

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
let's just say yellow side you should

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.180 
let's just say yellow side you should
well<00:02:45.599> take<00:02:46.200> everything<00:02:46.650> that<00:02:46.709> it<00:02:46.920> sent<00:02:47.130> from

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
well take everything that it sent from

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.190 
well take everything that it sent from
the<00:02:47.489> card<00:02:47.730> that's<00:02:48.599> your<00:02:48.750> dad

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
the card that's your dad

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.949 
the card that's your dad
and<00:02:50.099> all<00:02:50.430> of<00:02:50.459> a<00:02:50.579> sudden<00:02:50.640> we<00:02:51.180> have<00:02:51.360> cobblestone

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
and all of a sudden we have cobblestone

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.690 
and all of a sudden we have cobblestone
going<00:02:52.290> through<00:02:52.500> here<00:02:52.739> if<00:02:53.280> you<00:02:53.430> don't<00:02:53.610> believe

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
going through here if you don't believe

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.550 
going through here if you don't believe
me<00:02:53.849> I<00:02:54.090> can<00:02:54.209> remove<00:02:54.599> it<00:02:54.690> right<00:02:54.900> click<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.260> remove

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
me I can remove it right click to remove

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.610 
me I can remove it right click to remove
and<00:02:55.819> now<00:02:56.819> it's<00:02:57.000> not<00:02:57.120> moving<00:02:57.480> anymore<00:02:57.690> we<00:02:58.470> can

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
and now it's not moving anymore we can

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.920 
and now it's not moving anymore we can
do<00:02:58.709> similar<00:02:58.950> things<00:02:59.129> by<00:02:59.849> by<00:03:00.269> connecting<00:03:00.810> this

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
do similar things by by connecting this

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.300 
do similar things by by connecting this
red<00:03:01.200> side<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:03.470> basically<00:03:04.470> just<00:03:04.860> set<00:03:05.160> up

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
red side and basically just set up

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.750 
red side and basically just set up
whatever<00:03:06.000> we<00:03:06.299> would<00:03:06.450> like<00:03:06.690> maybe<00:03:07.620> however<00:03:08.400> you

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
whatever we would like maybe however you

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.640 
whatever we would like maybe however you
don't<00:03:08.940> want<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.569> cargo<00:03:09.930> manager<00:03:10.290> here<00:03:10.500> and

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
don't want the cargo manager here and

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.610 
don't want the cargo manager here and
then<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:11.180> block<00:03:12.180> on<00:03:12.420> pop<00:03:12.720> maybe<00:03:13.230> you<00:03:13.379> want<00:03:13.530> to

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
then a block on pop maybe you want to

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.440 
then a block on pop maybe you want to
hide<00:03:13.860> it<00:03:14.129> well<00:03:14.670> one<00:03:15.569> could<00:03:16.019> put<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:16.980> cargo

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
hide it well one could put the cargo

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.270 
hide it well one could put the cargo
distribution<00:03:18.450> block<00:03:18.660> beneath<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.950> cargo

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
distribution block beneath the cargo

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.840 
distribution block beneath the cargo
manager<00:03:20.730> something<00:03:21.150> like<00:03:21.269> this<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:22.639> yes<00:03:23.639> you

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
manager something like this and yes you

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.970 
manager something like this and yes you
can<00:03:23.970> also<00:03:24.209> do<00:03:24.540> this<00:03:24.750> setup<00:03:25.049> if<00:03:25.319> you<00:03:25.620> would<00:03:25.769> like

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
can also do this setup if you would like

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.520 
can also do this setup if you would like
right<00:03:26.670> click<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.209> now<00:03:27.450> you<00:03:27.510> have<00:03:27.840> two<00:03:28.139> sets<00:03:28.410> of

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
right click and now you have two sets of

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.059 
right click and now you have two sets of
options<00:03:29.040> so<00:03:29.849> maybe<00:03:30.510> we<00:03:30.660> want<00:03:30.900> this<00:03:31.410> setting<00:03:31.889> in

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
options so maybe we want this setting in

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.259 
options so maybe we want this setting in
to<00:03:32.459> go<00:03:32.700> to<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.569> bottom<00:03:33.870> one<00:03:34.170> as<00:03:34.410> well<00:03:35.069> as<00:03:35.370> the

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
to go to the bottom one as well as the

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.280 
to go to the bottom one as well as the
let's<00:03:37.200> say<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:38.040> bottom<00:03:38.700> left<00:03:38.970> corner<00:03:39.090> off<00:03:39.720> the

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
let's say the bottom left corner off the

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.800 
let's say the bottom left corner off the
top<00:03:40.470> one<00:03:44.450> like<00:03:45.450> so

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
top one like so

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.440 
top one like so
and<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.709> reason<00:03:47.099> it's<00:03:47.430> not<00:03:47.669> going<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.239> top

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
and the reason it's not going to the top

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.839 
and the reason it's not going to the top
one<00:03:48.660> is<00:03:48.900> because<00:03:49.349> it's<00:03:49.760> prioritizing<00:03:50.760> the

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
one is because it's prioritizing the

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.670 
one is because it's prioritizing the
bottom<00:03:51.090> one<00:03:51.209> so<00:03:51.389> let's<00:03:51.720> disable<00:03:52.079> that<00:03:52.440> and

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
bottom one so let's disable that and

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.170 
bottom one so let's disable that and
that<00:03:53.069> and<00:03:53.340> all<00:03:53.489> of<00:03:53.669> a<00:03:53.700> sudden<00:03:53.730> it<00:03:54.120> goes<00:03:54.359> there

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
that and all of a sudden it goes there

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.030 
that and all of a sudden it goes there
but<00:03:57.180> otherwise<00:03:57.389> if<00:03:57.750> this<00:03:58.139> would<00:03:58.530> have<00:03:58.739> been

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
but otherwise if this would have been

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.759 
but otherwise if this would have been
filled<00:03:59.669> completely<00:04:00.660> then<00:04:00.930> we<00:04:01.139> go<00:04:01.380> into<00:04:01.620> this

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
filled completely then we go into this

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.300 
filled completely then we go into this
one<00:04:01.980> so<00:04:02.639> usually<00:04:03.299> I<00:04:03.599> would<00:04:04.019> guess<00:04:04.889> you<00:04:05.190> only

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
one so usually I would guess you only

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.520 
one so usually I would guess you only
use<00:04:05.669> one<00:04:05.700> cargo<00:04:06.239> manager<00:04:06.599> per<00:04:06.750> cargo

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
use one cargo manager per cargo

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.990 
use one cargo manager per cargo
distribution<00:04:08.040> block<00:04:08.190> but<00:04:08.430> if<00:04:08.519> you<00:04:08.669> want<00:04:08.849> to

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
distribution block but if you want to

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.690 
distribution block but if you want to
you<00:04:09.180> can<00:04:09.329> set<00:04:09.510> it<00:04:09.599> up<00:04:09.660> like<00:04:09.900> so<00:04:10.280> so<00:04:11.280> this<00:04:11.459> will

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
you can set it up like so so this will

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.420 
you can set it up like so so this will
help<00:04:12.060> you<00:04:12.329> send<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:13.079> receive<00:04:13.680> items<00:04:13.980> from<00:04:14.280> the

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
help you send and receive items from the

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.569 
help you send and receive items from the
cargo<00:04:14.669> manager<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.660> way<00:04:15.870> you<00:04:15.930> would<00:04:16.260> like<00:04:16.440> it

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
cargo manager the way you would like it

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.090 
cargo manager the way you would like it
