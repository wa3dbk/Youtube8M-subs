this<00:00:15.690> one<00:00:15.840> right<00:00:15.930> here<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.470> blade<00:00:16.740> that<00:00:16.980> I

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
this one right here is that blade that I

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.040 
this one right here is that blade that I
forged<00:00:18.270> out<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.750> railroad<00:00:19.200> spike<00:00:20.960> what<00:00:21.960> I've

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
forged out of a railroad spike what I've

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.980 
forged out of a railroad spike what I've
learned<00:00:22.260> about<00:00:22.520> this<00:00:23.520> particular<00:00:24.480> metal

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
learned about this particular metal

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.110 
learned about this particular metal
right<00:00:25.200> here<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:26.250> does<00:00:26.640> not<00:00:26.820> have<00:00:27.090> a

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:27.120 
right here is it does not have a

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.390 
right here is it does not have a
particularly<00:00:27.570> high<00:00:27.750> carbon<00:00:28.289> content<00:00:28.440> perhaps

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
particularly high carbon content perhaps

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.999 
particularly high carbon content perhaps
point<00:00:30.270> three<00:00:30.660> maybe<00:00:31.530> a<00:00:31.650> little<00:00:31.830> higher

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
point three maybe a little higher

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.189 
point three maybe a little higher
depending<00:00:32.969> on<00:00:33.210> which<00:00:33.360> source<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.899> you

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:34.199 
depending on which source you you

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:37.190 
depending on which source you you
believe<00:00:34.500> but<00:00:35.000> this<00:00:36.000> does<00:00:36.239> not<00:00:36.270> have<00:00:36.660> nearly<00:00:37.020> as

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
believe but this does not have nearly as

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.710 
believe but this does not have nearly as
high<00:00:37.350> carbon<00:00:37.980> content<00:00:38.130> as<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.730> which<00:00:39.480> means

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
high carbon content as this which means

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.069 
high carbon content as this which means
this<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.500> going<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.950> take<00:00:41.360> going<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.480> require<00:00:42.810> a

this is going to take going to require a

this is going to take going to require a

this in very cold water again this is an
experiment<00:00:58.680> we're<00:00:58.860> going<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.070> see<00:00:59.160> how<00:00:59.280> it

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
experiment we're going to see how it

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.220 
experiment we're going to see how it
works<00:00:59.520> out<00:00:59.790> one<00:01:00.570> thing<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.870> wanted<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.140> point

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
works out one thing I wanted to point

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.590 
works out one thing I wanted to point
out<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.040> oil<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.610> I'm<00:01:02.730> using<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.390> at

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
out is that the oil that I'm using is at

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.050 
out is that the oil that I'm using is at
ambient<00:01:03.989> temperature<00:01:04.589> which<00:01:04.769> for<00:01:05.549> november

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
ambient temperature which for november

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.389 
ambient temperature which for november
in<00:01:06.329> kentucky<00:01:07.020> right<00:01:07.319> now<00:01:07.560> it's<00:01:07.740> about<00:01:07.770> 45

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
in kentucky right now it's about 45

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:10.849 
in kentucky right now it's about 45
degrees<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:09.539> oil<00:01:09.749> is<00:01:09.929> too<00:01:10.139> cold<00:01:10.350> for<00:01:10.619> me<00:01:10.740> to

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:10.859 
degrees that oil is too cold for me to

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:14.660 
degrees that oil is too cold for me to
get<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.149> slow<00:01:12.149> enough<00:01:12.359> quench<00:01:12.719> with<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.319> 01

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
get a slow enough quench with the 01

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.190 
get a slow enough quench with the 01
so<00:01:15.240> what<00:01:15.360> you're<00:01:15.479> about<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.659> see<00:01:15.900> me<00:01:16.020> do<00:01:16.170> is

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
so what you're about to see me do is

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.289 
so what you're about to see me do is
I've<00:01:16.470> got<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> piece<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.890> scrap<00:01:17.310> metal<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:18.119> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
I've got a piece of scrap metal in the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.359 
I've got a piece of scrap metal in the
forks<00:01:18.689> it's<00:01:18.900> gotten<00:01:19.170> hot<00:01:19.380> I'm<00:01:19.920> going<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.189> put

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
forks it's gotten hot I'm going to put

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.210 
forks it's gotten hot I'm going to put
it<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.659> oil<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.259> heat<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:23.009> oil

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
it in the in the oil and heat that oil

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.749 
it in the in the oil and heat that oil
up<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:24.210> don't<00:01:25.049> know<00:01:25.140> about<00:01:25.259> 120<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.100> 150

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
up to I don't know about 120 to 150

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.789 
up to I don't know about 120 to 150
degrees<00:01:27.020> just<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.110> make<00:01:28.229> sure<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.649> the<00:01:28.770> oil

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
degrees just to make sure that the oil

00:01:28.799 --> 00:03:21.260 
degrees just to make sure that the oil
is<00:01:29.159> not<00:01:29.220> too<00:01:29.700> cold<00:01:30.920> but<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.159> about<00:01:32.280> right

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.060 

okay<00:03:22.270> now<00:03:22.450> this<00:03:22.600> goes<00:03:22.780> into<00:03:22.990> an<00:03:23.230> oven<00:03:23.350> at<00:03:23.530> 375

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
okay now this goes into an oven at 375

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:31.620 
okay now this goes into an oven at 375
for<00:03:25.800> 371<00:03:26.800> our<00:03:27.600> temporary<00:03:28.600> cycles<00:03:30.570> now<00:03:31.570> the

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
for 371 our temporary cycles now the

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.650 
for 371 our temporary cycles now the
last<00:03:31.900> one<00:03:32.140> to<00:03:32.170> go<00:03:32.380> is<00:03:32.590> this<00:03:32.850> way<00:03:33.850> that<00:03:34.150> I<00:03:34.180> forged

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
last one to go is this way that I forged

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.020 
last one to go is this way that I forged
out<00:03:34.840> of<00:03:34.870> a<00:03:35.020> railroad<00:03:35.380> spike<00:03:35.520> this<00:03:36.520> one<00:03:36.580> I'm

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
out of a railroad spike this one I'm

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:44.180 
out of a railroad spike this one I'm
going<00:03:37.180> to<00:03:37.240> quench<00:03:37.540> in<00:03:37.810> water<00:03:38.970> right<00:03:39.970> there<00:03:42.420> so

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
going to quench in water right there so

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.440 
going to quench in water right there so
we'll<00:03:45.190> do<00:03:45.340> that<00:03:45.370> here<00:03:45.670> in<00:03:45.730> a<00:03:45.760> second<00:03:46.060> Sin<00:03:46.210> City

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
we'll do that here in a second Sin City

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.250 
we'll do that here in a second Sin City
one<00:03:47.050> thing<00:03:47.260> I<00:03:47.320> wanted<00:03:47.530> to<00:03:47.590> point<00:03:47.680> out<00:03:49.230> when<00:03:50.230> I

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
one thing I wanted to point out when I

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.980 
one thing I wanted to point out when I
put<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.680> blade<00:03:50.890> in<00:03:51.160> the<00:03:51.220> water<00:03:51.990> it's

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
put the blade in the water it's

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:54.630 
put the blade in the water it's
immediately<00:03:53.410> going<00:03:53.590> to<00:03:53.650> form<00:03:53.860> steam<00:03:54.280> right

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
immediately going to form steam right

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.750 
immediately going to form steam right
around<00:03:54.880> on<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:56.050> surface<00:03:56.230> of<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.620> blade<00:03:56.830> that

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
around on the surface of the blade that

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.600 
around on the surface of the blade that
can<00:03:58.090> cause<00:03:58.330> uneven<00:03:59.080> cooling<00:03:59.800> if<00:04:00.430> there's

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
can cause uneven cooling if there's

moving quickly in the water in order to

00:04:10.330 --> 00:05:12.590 
moving quickly in the water in order to
ensure<00:04:10.780> as<00:04:11.470> even<00:04:12.010> a<00:04:12.100> cooling<00:04:12.430> as<00:04:12.550> I<00:04:12.670> can

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600
