00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.410
 hello my friend flavio simonetti here 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:09.410
 and this book is about mike tyson 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:19.140
 I read his book 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.910
 undeniable truth weeks then have 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.850
 I sit down and have this 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.140
 fat world they looked at me and me 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.980
 my comparison is more 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.779
 this is the book by mike tyson and that 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.940
 is the book of arnold schwarzenegger 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.480
 and now I can go here for one 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.180
 height went 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.750
 that looks a lot higher and natural 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.180
 also much thicker and the whole has 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.940
 also a reason for mike 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.239
 Tyson really has something really bad 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.950
 gone through really crass story man 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.270
 reads it through and thinks ok 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.010
 I blame my life 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.280
 standard I used to be smaller then 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.219
 Boy I have a few boxee box 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.140
 comply with him and now 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.299
 to reflect the whole without the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.430
 Media without what said outside 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.070
 Just what he gets out of his 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.260
 visually sees that I think so 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.790
 interesting and as you finished the book 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.409
 I was really surprised I read 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.470
 I've seen Mike Tyson differently 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.470
 before 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.590
 before that was so dominant this page 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.500
 asshole and he has in the course of 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.200
 book to a person 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.939
 developed where you can tell he also has 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.829
 said things where I said I would 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.680
 I would have not been associated with purely 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.350
 To be honest, that's too intimate 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.970
 Something does not matter to anyone but he has 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.350
 I publish the whole thing 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.110
 just wanted to be with the past 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.479
 wanted to show how it is 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.110
 be his life with all heights and 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.500
 deep 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.899
 and when you watch his heights 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.090
 boxing champion women without end party 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.829
 without end 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.950
 money without end cars without end 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.380
 he has time for his bankruptcy 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.140
 had time just by the way 60 of his 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.750
 Sold cars and I need them 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.030
 mike tyson is talking about that 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.460
 lime opel or vw he only drives the cream 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.470
 de la creme of the cars and also the 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.470
 whole stories with his with his 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.090
 women with his everything 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.690
 He had treated the way people did 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.610
 So you sometimes think blatantly 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.610
 really crass so the type of in the 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.590
 zoo broke that was so empty inside and that 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.200
 for a very simple reason because he 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.900
 had a pretty hard past 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.070
 his mother was more or less 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.380
 prostitute 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.410
 his father was also a considerable has 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.239
 never shown himself and he has me like that 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.910
 do not believe 100 percent yet 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.950
 processed and you can see that in the 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.430
 run the book i felt like it 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.459
 also some documentation on youtube 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.239
 looked and noticed that mike 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.520
 tyson is pretty outwardly pretty 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.350
 but strong is you can feel also that he 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.840
 He is not looking somewhere 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.980
 arrived he took drugs without end 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.280
 I believe what is about his body 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.080
 the whistle has only completely created 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.650
 few people around at all 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.430
 to survive 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.590
 and at the end somehow something remains 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.920
 Pity for the person left over when you leave 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.510
 the book has been read you notice that way 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.850
 He also carries this deep burden with him 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.090
 his child also lost his child 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.400
 a few years ago and you can feel it 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.850
 and sees that person is not that 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.470
 is what she has given to the outside 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.739
 and I personally recommend the book 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.360
 actually only from 20 upwards it has 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.739
 a very simple reason if I 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.180
 back to my youth back then 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.640
 remember with 16 18 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.100
 i have a whole mafia movies drugs 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.780
 film looked at everything then I could 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.670
 Not so good with this situation 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.470
 deal as I can now because of 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.269
 For the simple reason he writes of 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.000
 his incredible wealth we lived 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:01.820
 has like a king again like that 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.730
 most blatant guy on earth and you think 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.470
 oh oh cool but over the years 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.230
 now if i have been like this for the past ten years 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.180
 then reflect mine too 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.100
 I changed character from another 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.110
 perspective and that's why I say 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.230
 personally, I rather recommend people 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:21.300
 20 how should I say 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.550
 not quite so cool on the whole 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.930
 up and around the whole a bit 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.060
 the distance can see because if 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.910
 You see what you have experienced and what he has 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.150
 live says in the core as its says it was 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.190
 it was all useless because it shit 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.610
 he never made twelve women denise 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.880
 was 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.650
 the more outward he was the cabbage the more 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.710
 empty was hanging inside and me 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:46.230
 find something you understand only when you 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.810
 something over 20 is in things with 16 17 18 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.790
 there you are in the invention phase 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.380
 of course also with 20 and also with 25 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.420
 but you have such a little bit of one 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.640
 bit his experience and made 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.500
 That's why I personally say I would 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.590
 recommend the book from 20 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.360
 definitely called vans markt 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.640
 I wrote something that is really good 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.930
 not imagine but it is up 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:11.880
 every case is very exciting it is 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:14.070
 interesting it is definitely right 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.600
 dazzling because I have many books 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:20.160
 mails mandela mike tyson a bud spencer 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.970
 sylvester stallone read that's all 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.770
 for the cat 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.510
 That means everything is for the cat 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.830
 actually so good night stories 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.910
 if you compare that to the story 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.400
 by Mike Tyson 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.620
 So I would recommend to anyone who likes 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.690
 The biographies were also the times so the up 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.370
 and downs of one for one right 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.140
 wants to see a stark personality 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.740
 I thought it was very much 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:42.840
 interesting and see you in the 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.640
 again next year if you have one 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.530
 More book review will write 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.000
 just look under which book you 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.670
 like might earn 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.980
