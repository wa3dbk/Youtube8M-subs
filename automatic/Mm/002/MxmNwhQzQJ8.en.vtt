00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.670
 Green I noticed is not 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.230
 I always scare in America I think so 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.120
 rather something like carnival adult 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.730
 That's why I have a comic look today 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.500
 pop up make up for you and I was ahead 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.390
 three years on a halloween party 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.779
 Here you can see that still left I am 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.000
 junkie 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.739
 I was the ugliest business thing 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.800
 and everyone else was always there 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:30.960
 so sexy booty and watch and because of that 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.210
 Today this tutorial as eva one with 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.520
 Make a make up and ampoule the whole thing 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.040
 First of all, we'll start from the next 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.090
 continue with one and there you have yours 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.610
 eyebrows to marl 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.200
 the more precise and fine here works all the more 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.200
 better they do the result on 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.850
 I take all the contours that we have 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.310
 Wrinkles on the face have noses 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.500
 fold contours and so on and me 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.420
 would like to say ford once you are 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.370
 your hair should then demanding her 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.720
 before you make the make up like me 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.430
 I did mine now 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.690
 You should open hair like you see 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.550
 make every case before 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:21.930
 so and now you draw the whole 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:23.369
 Contours once, by the way, only at 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.380
 I bought Douglas I can not 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.090
 recommend because he also stamped again 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.250
 I would just recommend you here 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.509
 to use a waterproof eyeliner 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.280
 because the brook through the whole evening 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.840
 absolutely no thought about it 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.840
 which is smeared or not 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.819
 we come to the eyes you need 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.859
 any case a good pace with that 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:46.840
 whole even the whole evening stops here 

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:48.789
 I just use a jumbo penzel 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.590
 received from nothing easy 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.689
 You can take some eyeshadow 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.520
 Go ye after further 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:56.409
 I use a white kohl with it 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.539
 eye looks even bigger than it 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:02.670
 is already and that should be 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.670
 conjure up this doll effect later 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.880
 all the products I have used 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.110
 By the way, you can find it in the infobox 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.940
 Here I have a green eyeshadow 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.830
 taken from prima and that is relative 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.360
 do so then it continues with the 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.540
 Eye and you are doing so to speak 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:23.380
 a frame around eyes so that norma 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.850
 somehow this 3d effect gets there 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.410
 Let's continue on the lower eyes 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.350
 burns where he most none 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.060
 you also have to paint one 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:35.160
 draw with it is this effect 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.160
 gives as if a pretty big one 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.980
 Then we stick our fade eyelashes 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.689
 the bigger the better and the whole 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.909
 Let's do it down with it too 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:56.909
 group eyes effect gets 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.930
 not a 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.359
 the decollete wears his can 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.760
 deliberately misrepresent I know what 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:18.219
 I should say and cry the key 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.109
 and furthermore, once the contour of the 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:21.489
 body about who does not do that 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.980
 Of course , that can be left out 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.950
 now come to the lips there must be 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.720
 just make two plates in advance 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.220
 we have to know that later 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.200
 fill in because if he does not do that 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.129
 after that, everything will look calm afterwards 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.129
 and that were more avoiding 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:43.879
 I took the whole picture out of it 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.159
 now these are the ones we left out 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:49.730
 have in white channel times with the after 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:51.379
 kanal and of course kajal says and if 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.019
 we did that and we did it again 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:57.909
 our eyeliner and pull one once 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.909
 complete culture around the mouth 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.920
 O 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.680
 This step is also optional in blue 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.720
 white kajal and paint you all this 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.039
 dots on the face so that's it 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.770
 looks like you are from one 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.720
 sprung from the magazine 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.070
 it takes a bit long, ie 20 30 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.229
 minutes you should already for it 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.970
 plan and the more precisely he does that 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:37.949
 the better it looks afterwards 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.449
 Now we have to open hair again 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:42.210
 and style and then we actually see 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:46.440
 already done so the whole looks like what 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.759
 I think it looks relatively real and 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.020
 if you liked the video then 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:51.360
 Of course, I would go over one 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.370
 happy thumb and of course I have 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.110
 also a little nailart for you 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.340
 prepared 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.750
 I have that myself somewhere 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.039
 Monday and just had to do it for you 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.740
 show because I just think that it 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.699
 super good with this tutorial and fits 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.830
 if you want to know how 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:08.360
 works then just click there 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.360
 such completely dear
