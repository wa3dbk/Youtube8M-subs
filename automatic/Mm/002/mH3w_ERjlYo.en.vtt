trying<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.480> make<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.719> angles<00:00:55.079> around<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
trying to make the angles around the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.830 
trying to make the angles around the
same<00:00:55.949> spot<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:57.000> bodies<00:00:57.329> are<00:00:57.480> even

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
same spot so that the bodies are even

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:07.100 
same spot so that the bodies are even
when<00:00:58.079> they're<00:00:58.230> glued<00:00:58.500> together<00:01:05.330> now<00:01:06.330> on<00:01:06.659> the
