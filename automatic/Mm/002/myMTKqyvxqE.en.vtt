I'd like to thank everyone who saw the
first<00:00:59.980> episode<00:01:00.210> we<00:01:01.210> got<00:01:01.390> a<00:01:01.420> great<00:01:01.870> response

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080 
first episode we got a great response

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.200 
first episode we got a great response
from<00:01:02.410> it<00:01:02.650> seems<00:01:03.460> like<00:01:03.640> there's<00:01:03.820> a<00:01:03.910> lot<00:01:03.940> of

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
from it seems like there's a lot of

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.850 
from it seems like there's a lot of
people<00:01:04.510> out<00:01:04.690> there<00:01:04.900> think<00:01:05.140> it<00:01:05.290> was<00:01:05.379> just<00:01:05.620> as

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
people out there think it was just as

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.730 
people out there think it was just as
funny<00:01:06.070> as<00:01:06.190> we<00:01:06.370> did<00:01:06.550> and<00:01:06.930> also<00:01:07.930> quite<00:01:08.290> a<00:01:08.320> few<00:01:08.590> who

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
funny as we did and also quite a few who

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.740 
funny as we did and also quite a few who
wonder<00:01:09.070> how<00:01:09.190> we<00:01:09.250> did<00:01:09.610> it<00:01:09.640> so<00:01:10.060> that's<00:01:10.360> what<00:01:10.660> I'm

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
wonder how we did it so that's what I'm

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.690 
wonder how we did it so that's what I'm
going<00:01:10.900> to<00:01:10.990> try<00:01:11.110> and<00:01:11.290> show<00:01:11.350> you<00:01:11.530> today<00:01:11.860> let's

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
going to try and show you today let's

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.000 
going to try and show you today let's
just<00:01:12.790> jump<00:01:13.240> right<00:01:13.360> into<00:01:13.600> a<00:01:13.720> jelly<00:01:13.960> we're<00:01:14.770> going

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
just jump right into a jelly we're going

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.040 
just jump right into a jelly we're going
to<00:01:15.130> somehow<00:01:15.430> replace<00:01:16.000> parts<00:01:16.390> of<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:16.660> RC

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
to somehow replace parts of the RC

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.140 
to somehow replace parts of the RC
controller<00:01:17.260> with<00:01:17.800> the<00:01:17.890> computer<00:01:18.400> so<00:01:18.760> we'll

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
controller with the computer so we'll

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.730 
controller with the computer so we'll
start<00:01:19.450> by<00:01:19.600> examining<00:01:19.660> how<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.260> controller

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
start by examining how the controller

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:29.490 
start by examining how the controller
works<00:01:27.210> there's<00:01:28.210> a<00:01:28.300> white<00:01:28.540> connector<00:01:29.290> here

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
works there's a white connector here

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.600 
works there's a white connector here
going<00:01:30.070> to<00:01:30.250> the<00:01:30.450> antenna<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:32.500> this<00:01:33.130> board<00:01:33.400> must

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
going to the antenna so this board must

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.840 
going to the antenna so this board must
be<00:01:33.820> a<00:01:34.030> radio<00:01:35.070> aunty<00:01:36.070> the<00:01:36.460> only<00:01:36.820> other

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
be a radio aunty the only other

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.170 
be a radio aunty the only other
connection<00:01:37.479> this<00:01:37.600> board<00:01:37.930> has<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.940> main

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
connection this board has to the main

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.320 
connection this board has to the main
board<00:01:40.450> is<00:01:41.080> these<00:01:41.410> three<00:01:41.920> wires<00:01:42.190> in<00:01:42.550> and<00:01:42.759> you

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
board is these three wires in and you

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.940 
board is these three wires in and you
can<00:01:43.450> see<00:01:43.630> I<00:01:43.660> already<00:01:43.840> took<00:01:44.380> one<00:01:44.440> of<00:01:44.710> them<00:01:44.830> off

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
can see I already took one of them off

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.800 
can see I already took one of them off
because<00:01:45.130> this<00:01:45.460> thing<00:01:45.759> is<00:01:45.790> already<00:01:46.300> hacked<00:01:46.540> so

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
because this thing is already hacked so

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.410 
because this thing is already hacked so
you<00:01:46.869> can<00:01:47.050> see<00:01:47.200> here<00:01:47.380> where<00:01:47.560> I<00:01:47.970> where<00:01:48.970> I<00:01:49.000> did<00:01:49.300> the

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
you can see here where I where I did the

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.170 
you can see here where I where I did the
hack<00:01:49.570> it<00:01:49.810> says<00:01:50.380> a<00:01:50.410> battery<00:01:50.890> RF<00:01:51.369> and<00:01:51.550> ground<00:01:51.820> so

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
hack it says a battery RF and ground so

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.360 
hack it says a battery RF and ground so
this<00:01:53.080> is<00:01:53.200> probably<00:01:53.410> where<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:53.770> power<00:01:54.009> for<00:01:54.280> the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
this is probably where the power for the

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.130 
this is probably where the power for the
radio<00:01:54.670> comes<00:01:54.909> in<00:01:55.090> and<00:01:55.330> this<00:01:55.630> is<00:01:55.750> probably<00:01:55.930> the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
radio comes in and this is probably the

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.830 
radio comes in and this is probably the
signal<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:57.220> RC<00:01:57.580> controller<00:01:57.820> has<00:01:58.300> two<00:01:58.570> main

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
signal the RC controller has two main

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.830 
signal the RC controller has two main
components<00:01:59.050> a<00:01:59.760> radio<00:02:00.760> and<00:02:01.030> a<00:02:01.450> signal

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
components a radio and a signal

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.090 
components a radio and a signal
generator<00:02:03.690> so<00:02:04.690> all<00:02:05.050> we<00:02:05.170> have<00:02:05.200> to<00:02:05.320> do<00:02:05.560> is<00:02:05.770> bypass

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
generator so all we have to do is bypass

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.570 
generator so all we have to do is bypass
this<00:02:06.580> whole<00:02:06.820> main<00:02:07.090> board<00:02:07.360> here<00:02:07.600> and<00:02:08.160> type<00:02:09.160> in<00:02:09.369> a

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
this whole main board here and type in a

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.880 
this whole main board here and type in a
signal<00:02:10.149> from<00:02:10.299> our<00:02:10.450> computer<00:02:10.810> you<00:02:11.440> see<00:02:11.590> I<00:02:11.620> left

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
signal from our computer you see I left

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.890 
signal from our computer you see I left
two<00:02:12.130> of<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.340> wires<00:02:12.549> on<00:02:12.820> because<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.269> radio

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
two of the wires on because the radio

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.590 
two of the wires on because the radio
still<00:02:14.110> needs<00:02:14.380> power<00:02:14.769> and<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:16.150> we<00:02:16.269> still<00:02:16.420> need

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
still needs power and so we still need

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.440 
still needs power and so we still need
to<00:02:16.720> plug<00:02:16.930> battery<00:02:17.260> into<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.590> thing<00:02:18.209> but<00:02:19.209> on

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
to plug battery into the thing but on

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.970 
to plug battery into the thing but on
two<00:02:20.049> of<00:02:20.080> them<00:02:20.350> I<00:02:20.940> had<00:02:21.940> made<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.590> small<00:02:23.590> court

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
two of them I had made a small court

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.000 
two of them I had made a small court
here<00:02:24.190> with<00:02:25.030> a<00:02:25.060> little<00:02:26.049> connection<00:02:26.410> on<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:26.830> and

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
here with a little connection on it and

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.580 
here with a little connection on it and
that's<00:02:27.790> what<00:02:27.850> I'm<00:02:28.030> going<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.239> try<00:02:28.390> to<00:02:28.590> to

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
that's what I'm going to try to to

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.430 
that's what I'm going to try to to
connect<00:02:30.400> to<00:02:30.489> my<00:02:30.610> computer<00:02:30.930> but<00:02:31.930> first<00:02:32.200> of<00:02:32.350> all

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
connect to my computer but first of all

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.340 
connect to my computer but first of all
we<00:02:33.220> need<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:33.400> examine<00:02:33.690> what<00:02:34.690> kind<00:02:34.900> of<00:02:34.959> signal

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
we need to examine what kind of signal

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.840 
we need to examine what kind of signal
is<00:02:35.440> coming<00:02:35.590> in<00:02:35.860> here<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:36.160> see<00:02:36.430> if<00:02:36.459> we<00:02:36.670> can

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
is coming in here and see if we can

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.440 
is coming in here and see if we can
regenerate<00:02:37.390> that<00:02:37.750> on<00:02:37.959> a<00:02:38.019> computer<00:02:38.560> I<00:02:39.450> really

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
regenerate that on a computer I really

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.360 
regenerate that on a computer I really
need<00:02:40.480> one<00:02:40.810> of<00:02:40.840> those<00:02:41.019> oscilloscope<00:02:41.709> that<00:02:42.280> be

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
need one of those oscilloscope that be

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.370 
need one of those oscilloscope that be
used<00:02:42.610> in<00:02:42.790> physics<00:02:43.269> class<00:02:43.330> in<00:02:43.810> school<00:02:43.930> remember

those<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:45.670> put<00:02:46.000> in<00:02:46.120> some<00:02:46.360> kind<00:02:46.540> of<00:02:46.600> electrical

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
those you put in some kind of electrical

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.490 
those you put in some kind of electrical
signal<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.709> it<00:02:47.830> was<00:02:48.190> drawing<00:02:48.580> and<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:49.870> waveform

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
signal and it was drawing and a waveform

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.170 
signal and it was drawing and a waveform
on<00:02:50.739> a<00:02:50.799> green<00:02:51.310> old<00:02:51.640> screen<00:02:52.530> yeah<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:53.940> so<00:02:54.940> I<00:02:54.970> was

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
on a green old screen yeah and so I was

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.820 
on a green old screen yeah and so I was
googling<00:02:55.420> around<00:02:55.780> to<00:02:56.019> see<00:02:56.200> if<00:02:56.350> I<00:02:56.500> could<00:02:56.560> buy

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
googling around to see if I could buy

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.680 
googling around to see if I could buy
one<00:02:57.040> of<00:02:57.100> those<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.400> borrow<00:02:57.820> one<00:02:58.120> of<00:02:58.150> those<00:02:58.419> or

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
one of those a borrow one of those or

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.180 
one of those a borrow one of those or
something<00:02:58.989> like<00:02:59.079> that<00:02:59.169> and<00:02:59.320> i<00:02:59.500> found<00:02:59.769> out<00:02:59.950> that

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
something like that and i found out that

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.860 
something like that and i found out that
i<00:03:00.609> actually<00:03:00.880> had<00:03:01.329> one<00:03:01.359> in<00:03:02.040> my<00:03:03.040> computer

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
i actually had one in my computer

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.589 
i actually had one in my computer
because<00:03:05.150> almost<00:03:06.150> every<00:03:06.450> computer<00:03:06.780> has<00:03:06.930> and

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
because almost every computer has and

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.170 
because almost every computer has and
sound<00:03:09.599> input<00:03:09.930> right<00:03:10.440> you<00:03:11.159> can<00:03:11.340> put<00:03:11.849> in<00:03:12.000> a

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
sound input right you can put in a

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.559 
sound input right you can put in a
microphone<00:03:12.900> or<00:03:13.519> another<00:03:14.519> audio<00:03:14.940> device<00:03:15.239> and

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
microphone or another audio device and

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.180 
microphone or another audio device and
you<00:03:15.870> can<00:03:15.900> record<00:03:16.409> the<00:03:16.620> sound<00:03:16.860> on<00:03:17.069> your

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
you can record the sound on your

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.649 
you can record the sound on your
computer<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:18.890> I<00:03:19.890> bet<00:03:20.640> you<00:03:20.819> all<00:03:20.909> know<00:03:21.180> that<00:03:21.450> if

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:21.659 
computer and I bet you all know that if

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:23.300 
computer and I bet you all know that if
you<00:03:21.720> record<00:03:22.140> sound<00:03:22.470> on<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.650> computer<00:03:23.069> you<00:03:23.099> can

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
you record sound on the computer you can

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.089 
you record sound on the computer you can
make<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:23.940> computer<00:03:24.360> display<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.530> sound<00:03:25.829> wave

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
make the computer display the sound wave

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.550 
make the computer display the sound wave
on<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.549> screen<00:03:26.819> that's<00:03:27.599> exactly<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:28.319> same

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
on the screen that's exactly the same

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.470 
on the screen that's exactly the same
thing<00:03:28.799> as<00:03:28.950> an<00:03:29.069> oscilloscope<00:03:29.370> except<00:03:30.239> that<00:03:30.329> it

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
thing as an oscilloscope except that it

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.160 
thing as an oscilloscope except that it
has<00:03:30.599> an<00:03:30.780> audio<00:03:31.230> input<00:03:31.549> but<00:03:32.549> wait<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:32.760> minute

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
has an audio input but wait a minute

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.750 
has an audio input but wait a minute
this<00:03:34.170> is<00:03:34.319> not<00:03:34.500> an<00:03:34.650> audio<00:03:35.099> input<00:03:35.310> this<00:03:35.610> is

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
this is not an audio input this is

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.990 
this is not an audio input this is
electrical<00:03:36.510> so<00:03:37.349> if<00:03:38.280> I<00:03:38.459> just<00:03:38.700> connect<00:03:39.500> my<00:03:41.000> RC

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
electrical so if I just connect my RC

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.509 
electrical so if I just connect my RC
controller<00:03:42.209> to<00:03:42.720> my<00:03:42.750> computer<00:03:43.260> do<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:44.280> actually

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
controller to my computer do I actually

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.039 
controller to my computer do I actually
have<00:03:44.940> an<00:03:45.269> oscilloscope<00:03:46.170> I<00:03:47.540> google<00:03:48.540> around<00:03:48.810> and

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
have an oscilloscope I google around and

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.410 
have an oscilloscope I google around and
found<00:03:49.319> the<00:03:49.590> perfect<00:03:49.769> software<00:03:50.220> for<00:03:50.370> this<00:03:50.489> this

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
found the perfect software for this this

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.660 
found the perfect software for this this
is<00:03:51.569> my<00:03:51.720> netbook<00:03:51.930> running<00:03:52.500> ubuntu<00:03:53.040> linux<00:03:53.250> and

is my netbook running ubuntu linux and

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.360 
is my netbook running ubuntu linux and
for<00:03:54.480> linux<00:03:54.750> there's<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.140> software<00:03:55.530> called<00:03:55.739> XO

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
for linux there's the software called XO

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.910 
for linux there's the software called XO
scope<00:03:56.700> and<00:03:56.989> ipad<00:03:57.989> this<00:03:58.140> also<00:03:58.319> software<00:03:58.739> for

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
scope and ipad this also software for

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.770 
scope and ipad this also software for
the<00:03:58.950> mac<00:03:59.040> and<00:03:59.400> for<00:03:59.609> windows<00:04:00.239> as<00:04:00.390> well<00:04:00.420> but<00:04:00.720> this

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
the mac and for windows as well but this

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.319 
the mac and for windows as well but this
is<00:04:01.019> what<00:04:01.140> i<00:04:01.170> use<00:04:01.280> it's<00:04:02.280> a<00:04:02.430> pretty<00:04:02.790> neat<00:04:03.030> let<00:04:03.269> me

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
is what i use it's a pretty neat let me

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.750 
is what i use it's a pretty neat let me
show<00:04:03.510> you<00:04:03.569> and<00:04:04.220> you<00:04:05.220> launch<00:04:05.459> the<00:04:05.640> application

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
show you and you launch the application

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.930 
show you and you launch the application
and<00:04:06.359> immediately<00:04:07.170> starts<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:08.280> monitoring

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
and immediately starts and monitoring

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.920 
and immediately starts and monitoring
your<00:04:09.180> audio<00:04:09.540> input<00:04:10.040> so<00:04:11.040> if<00:04:11.519> i<00:04:11.760> whistle<00:04:12.389> into<00:04:12.810> my

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
your audio input so if i whistle into my

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.690 
your audio input so if i whistle into my
computer<00:04:13.109> for<00:04:13.470> example<00:04:13.889> it<00:04:13.980> would<00:04:14.069> show<00:04:14.400> the

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
computer for example it would show the

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:21.229 
computer for example it would show the
nice<00:04:14.849> wave<00:04:15.239> of<00:04:15.630> my<00:04:16.109> beautiful<00:04:16.530> whistle<00:04:20.239> you

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
nice wave of my beautiful whistle you

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:27.460 
nice wave of my beautiful whistle you
see<00:04:21.389> that<00:04:21.599> just<00:04:22.440> like<00:04:22.620> an<00:04:22.740> oscilloscope<00:04:23.010> i

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.890 

connect<00:04:28.470> it<00:04:28.620> to<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:28.889> board<00:04:29.510> one<00:04:30.510> to<00:04:30.780> the

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
connect it to the board one to the

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.020 
connect it to the board one to the
ground<00:04:33.289> and<00:04:34.289> one<00:04:34.770> to<00:04:35.010> the<00:04:35.039> green<00:04:35.400> wire<00:04:35.669> that<00:04:35.970> i

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
ground and one to the green wire that i

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.210 
ground and one to the green wire that i
already<00:04:36.510> took<00:04:36.750> off<00:04:36.990> when<00:04:37.199> i<00:04:37.229> did<00:04:37.470> the<00:04:37.560> hack<00:04:37.770> the

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
already took off when i did the hack the

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.279 
already took off when i did the hack the
green<00:04:38.400> wire<00:04:38.580> comes<00:04:38.970> from<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.330> signal

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289 
green wire comes from the signal

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:43.159 
green wire comes from the signal
generator<00:04:40.740> main<00:04:41.010> board<00:04:41.340> and<00:04:41.990> that's<00:04:42.990> where

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
generator main board and that's where

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.510 
generator main board and that's where
the<00:04:43.260> signal<00:04:43.590> comes<00:04:43.740> from<00:04:46.160> ok<00:04:47.160> so<00:04:47.220> it's

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
the signal comes from ok so it's

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.920 
the signal comes from ok so it's
connected<00:04:48.000> on<00:04:48.150> the<00:04:48.270> screen<00:04:48.539> that's<00:04:48.750> still

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
connected on the screen that's still

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.800 
connected on the screen that's still
just<00:04:48.960> a<00:04:49.289> bunch<00:04:49.500> of<00:04:49.590> noise<00:04:50.419> there's<00:04:51.419> no<00:04:51.599> power

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
just a bunch of noise there's no power

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.839 
just a bunch of noise there's no power
on<00:04:51.960> the<00:04:52.169> controller<00:04:52.530> yet<00:04:52.710> so<00:04:53.070> if<00:04:53.340> i<00:04:53.460> plug<00:04:53.669> in

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849 
on the controller yet so if i plug in

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:56.990 
on the controller yet so if i plug in
the<00:04:53.970> power<00:04:54.180> i<00:04:54.539> hope<00:04:55.500> to<00:04:55.740> see<00:04:55.770> some<00:04:55.979> kind<00:04:56.880> of

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
the power i hope to see some kind of

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.320 
the power i hope to see some kind of
signal<00:04:57.389> on<00:04:57.539> the<00:04:57.630> screen<00:04:59.000> absolutely<00:05:00.000> straight

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
signal on the screen absolutely straight

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.189 
signal on the screen absolutely straight
away<00:05:00.599> you<00:05:00.930> see<00:05:01.190> some<00:05:02.190> kind<00:05:02.430> of<00:05:02.630> clear<00:05:03.630> signal

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
away you see some kind of clear signal

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.670 
away you see some kind of clear signal
on<00:05:04.349> the<00:05:04.470> screen<00:05:05.750> isn't<00:05:06.750> that<00:05:06.930> just<00:05:07.110> amazing<00:05:07.560> i

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
on the screen isn't that just amazing i

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.120 
on the screen isn't that just amazing i
love<00:05:07.740> it<00:05:08.240> so<00:05:09.240> i<00:05:09.570> want<00:05:10.560> to<00:05:10.620> reproduce<00:05:10.830> that

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
love it so i want to reproduce that

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.740 
love it so i want to reproduce that
signal<00:05:11.490> on<00:05:11.610> a<00:05:11.639> computer<00:05:12.180> and<00:05:12.210> for<00:05:12.450> that<00:05:12.539> i'm

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
signal on a computer and for that i'm

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.300 
signal on a computer and for that i'm
using<00:05:12.780> this<00:05:13.169> amazing<00:05:13.650> piece<00:05:13.800> of<00:05:13.860> hardware

upload it to the chip here and it will

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:29.959 
upload it to the chip here and it will
execute<00:05:27.180> your<00:05:27.449> code<00:05:28.460> it's<00:05:29.460> also<00:05:29.639> equipped

00:05:35.869 --> 00:05:35.879 
inputs and outputs so so I want to do a

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:38.320 
inputs and outputs so so I want to do a
piece<00:05:36.030> of<00:05:36.090> code<00:05:36.479> that<00:05:36.780> just<00:05:36.930> generates<00:05:37.439> the

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
piece of code that just generates the

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.510 
piece of code that just generates the
minimum<00:05:39.330> signal<00:05:39.840> coming<00:05:40.319> from<00:05:40.439> there<00:05:40.830> the

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
minimum signal coming from there the

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.550 
minimum signal coming from there the
signal<00:05:41.939> generator<00:05:42.449> board<00:05:42.810> of<00:05:42.990> the<00:05:43.139> RC

signal generator board of the RC

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.379 
signal generator board of the RC
controller<00:05:43.740> will<00:05:44.400> be<00:05:44.550> replaced<00:05:45.000> by<00:05:45.150> an

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:45.389 
controller will be replaced by an

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:47.779 
controller will be replaced by an
Arduino<00:05:45.990> board<00:05:46.319> running<00:05:46.830> our<00:05:46.979> own<00:05:47.009> custom

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:47.789 
Arduino board running our own custom

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:51.559 
Arduino board running our own custom
code<00:05:49.219> the<00:05:50.219> Arduino<00:05:50.639> code<00:05:50.729> that<00:05:51.120> I<00:05:51.180> wrote<00:05:51.210> is

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:51.569 
code the Arduino code that I wrote is

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:54.529 
code the Arduino code that I wrote is
already<00:05:51.990> on<00:05:52.169> the<00:05:52.379> chip<00:05:52.650> and<00:05:52.940> if<00:05:53.940> i<00:05:54.150> connect<00:05:54.479> it

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
already on the chip and if i connect it

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:56.689 
already on the chip and if i connect it
to<00:05:54.690> the<00:05:54.750> computer<00:05:54.810> it<00:05:55.259> will<00:05:55.379> start<00:05:55.710> executing

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:56.699 
to the computer it will start executing

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:05.450 
to the computer it will start executing
the<00:05:56.819> code<00:05:57.360> so<00:05:58.050> let's<00:05:58.259> try<00:05:58.530> that<00:06:04.219> connect<00:06:05.219> it<00:06:05.340> to

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
the code so let's try that connect it to

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.040 
the code so let's try that connect it to
the<00:06:05.580> two<00:06:05.789> pins<00:06:06.090> that<00:06:06.240> I<00:06:06.360> programmed<00:06:06.870> it<00:06:06.990> to

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
the two pins that I programmed it to

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.290 
the two pins that I programmed it to
output<00:06:07.590> signal<00:06:08.159> on<00:06:09.050> boom<00:06:10.050> and<00:06:10.289> there<00:06:10.590> you<00:06:10.680> see

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
output signal on boom and there you see

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.790 
output signal on boom and there you see
something<00:06:12.300> that<00:06:12.690> looks<00:06:12.750> quite<00:06:13.469> familiar

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
something that looks quite familiar

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.719 
something that looks quite familiar
quite<00:06:14.279> similar<00:06:14.669> to<00:06:14.699> what<00:06:15.270> the<00:06:15.449> original

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:16.729 
quite similar to what the original

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:20.089 
quite similar to what the original
controller<00:06:17.729> was<00:06:18.000> producing<00:06:18.740> so<00:06:19.740> that's<00:06:19.919> our

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:20.099 
controller was producing so that's our

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:22.999 
controller was producing so that's our
code<00:06:20.310> it<00:06:20.849> looks<00:06:21.060> like<00:06:21.240> it<00:06:21.360> works<00:06:21.569> so<00:06:22.469> using<00:06:22.740> an

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:23.009 
code it looks like it works so using an

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:25.010 
code it looks like it works so using an
Arduino<00:06:23.279> board<00:06:23.759> we've<00:06:24.180> built<00:06:24.449> the<00:06:24.569> connection

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
Arduino board we've built the connection

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:30.080 
Arduino board we've built the connection
between<00:06:25.050> an<00:06:25.560> RC<00:06:25.949> car<00:06:26.219> and<00:06:26.550> a<00:06:26.940> computer<00:06:29.090> okay

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 
between an RC car and a computer okay

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.670 
between an RC car and a computer okay
we've<00:06:30.270> identified<00:06:30.449> the<00:06:30.900> first<00:06:31.319> potential

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 
we've identified the first potential

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.219 
we've identified the first potential
showstopper<00:06:32.580> and<00:06:32.759> analyzed<00:06:33.419> it<00:06:33.690> and<00:06:33.839> it<00:06:34.050> looks

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229 
showstopper and analyzed it and it looks

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:35.899 
showstopper and analyzed it and it looks
like<00:06:34.319> it's<00:06:34.770> not<00:06:34.979> going<00:06:35.219> to<00:06:35.580> be<00:06:35.669> a<00:06:35.699> show

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:35.909 
like it's not going to be a show

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:38.839 
like it's not going to be a show
stubbard<00:06:36.330> we<00:06:36.599> can<00:06:37.099> generate<00:06:38.099> the<00:06:38.310> signal<00:06:38.759> we
