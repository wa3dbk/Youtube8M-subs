00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:42.719 
the chain and here's my hand compared to
it<00:00:39.100> so<00:00:39.609> yeah<00:00:40.600> so<00:00:41.199> we<00:00:41.440> are<00:00:41.589> going<00:00:41.800> to<00:00:42.039> taking<00:00:42.550> on

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
our box and this is going to be really

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:51.270 
our box and this is going to be really

too<00:00:51.549> little<00:00:51.579> flaps<00:00:52.120> here<00:00:52.719> closing<00:00:53.289> in<00:00:53.440> to<00:00:53.649> make

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:53.859 
too little flaps here closing in to make

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:57.059 
too little flaps here closing in to make
the<00:00:54.190> bak<00:00:54.399> yeah<00:00:55.239> if<00:00:55.389> you<00:00:55.510> see<00:00:55.719> that<00:00:55.929> then<00:00:56.799> you're

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:57.069 
the bak yeah if you see that then you're

the bak yeah if you see that then you're
going<00:00:57.280> to<00:00:57.399> take<00:00:57.670> this<00:00:57.999> and<00:00:58.329> just<00:00:59.579> rip<00:01:00.579> it<00:01:00.760> like

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
going to take this and just rip it like

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.950 
going to take this and just rip it like
that<00:01:01.839> so<00:01:02.589> that<00:01:02.739> opens<00:01:03.420> what<00:01:04.420> you<00:01:04.570> don't<00:01:04.809> need

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
that so that opens what you don't need

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.470 
that so that opens what you don't need
to<00:01:05.260> do<00:01:05.379> the<00:01:05.500> other<00:01:05.650> one<00:01:05.940> so<00:01:06.940> once<00:01:07.150> you've<00:01:07.300> got

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480 
to do the other one so once you've got

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.060 
to do the other one so once you've got
it<00:01:07.600> open<00:01:07.750> like<00:01:08.050> that<00:01:08.160> you<00:01:09.160> can<00:01:09.370> stick<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:11.500> um

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070

the<00:01:13.000> end<00:01:13.180> of<00:01:13.390> one<00:01:13.720> chain<00:01:14.820> right<00:01:15.820> there<00:01:15.880> and

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
the end of one chain right there and

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.200 
the end of one chain right there and
then<00:01:16.690> close<00:01:17.260> the<00:01:17.530> flap<00:01:17.800> on<00:01:18.100> it<00:01:18.280> then<00:01:18.970> you<00:01:19.090> can

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
then close the flap on it then you can

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:28.520

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.230 

not<00:01:36.619> the<00:01:36.829> chain<00:01:37.189> in<00:01:37.430> there<00:01:37.640> and<00:01:37.939> I<00:01:37.969> might<00:01:38.119> take

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
not the chain in there and I might take

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.270 
not the chain in there and I might take
a<00:01:38.299> couple<00:01:38.420> tries<00:01:38.899> at<00:01:39.170> first<00:01:39.439> but<00:01:39.890> I<00:01:39.950> mean

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
a couple tries at first but I mean

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.370 
a couple tries at first but I mean
you'll<00:01:40.429> get<00:01:40.609> it<00:01:40.759> it's<00:01:40.909> really<00:01:41.149> easy<00:01:41.299> so<00:01:42.259> now

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
you'll get it it's really easy so now

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.810 
you'll get it it's really easy so now
that<00:01:42.409> you've<00:01:42.649> got<00:01:42.829> that<00:01:43.070> we're<00:01:43.310> going<00:01:43.460> to<00:01:43.549> put

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
that you've got that we're going to put

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.569 
that you've got that we're going to put
the<00:01:44.390> other<00:01:44.630> end<00:01:44.960> of<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:45.350> chain<00:01:45.380> on<00:01:45.860> to<00:01:46.310> the

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
the other end of the chain on to the

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.429 
the other end of the chain on to the
other<00:01:46.729> side<00:01:47.000> just<00:01:47.240> do<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.479> same<00:01:47.689> process<00:01:48.170> I

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
other side just do the same process I

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.399 
other side just do the same process I
just<00:01:49.250> thought<00:01:49.340> of<00:01:49.490> a<00:01:49.610> tip<00:01:50.090> like<00:01:50.539> while<00:01:51.259> i<00:01:51.289> was

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
just thought of a tip like while i was

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.319 
just thought of a tip like while i was
doing<00:01:51.590> this<00:01:51.829> if<00:01:52.159> you<00:01:52.520> see<00:01:52.670> that<00:01:52.789> little<00:01:53.000> gap

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
doing this if you see that little gap

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:55.929 
doing this if you see that little gap
right<00:01:53.569> there<00:01:53.630> it's<00:01:54.590> actually<00:01:54.770> easier<00:01:55.429> and<00:01:55.759> it

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
right there it's actually easier and it

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.219 
right there it's actually easier and it
stays<00:01:56.569> longer<00:01:56.899> if<00:01:57.289> you<00:01:57.619> fish<00:01:58.429> the<00:01:59.229> chain

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
stays longer if you fish the chain

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.100 
stays longer if you fish the chain
through<00:02:00.679> the<00:02:00.799> gap<00:02:00.979> and<00:02:01.250> then<00:02:01.719> you<00:02:02.719> tape<00:02:02.929> it

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
through the gap and then you tape it

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.580 
through the gap and then you tape it
because<00:02:04.069> it<00:02:04.280> stays<00:02:04.610> longer<00:02:04.850> so<00:02:05.630> now<00:02:05.750> if<00:02:05.899> you're

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
because it stays longer so now if you're

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.470 
because it stays longer so now if you're
done<00:02:06.619> you<00:02:07.159> should<00:02:07.189> have<00:02:07.640> this<00:02:10.209> hand<00:02:11.209> food

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
done you should have this hand food

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.020 
done you should have this hand food
chain<00:02:11.840> and<00:02:12.530> it's<00:02:12.769> basically<00:02:13.220> your<00:02:13.430> purse<00:02:13.730> I

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
chain and it's basically your purse I

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.920 
chain and it's basically your purse I
mean<00:02:14.349> you<00:02:15.349> can<00:02:15.530> open<00:02:16.010> it<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:16.510> close<00:02:17.510> it<00:02:17.569> and

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
mean you can open it and close it and

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.630 
mean you can open it and close it and
everything<00:02:18.380> you<00:02:18.530> can<00:02:18.650> carry<00:02:18.890> stuff<00:02:19.310> in<00:02:19.459> there

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
everything you can carry stuff in there

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.750 
everything you can carry stuff in there
actually<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:20.870> can<00:02:21.049> just<00:02:21.519> give<00:02:22.519> it<00:02:22.670> to

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760
