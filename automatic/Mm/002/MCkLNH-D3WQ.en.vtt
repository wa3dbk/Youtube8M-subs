we get the picture of the right side I
don't<00:02:03.570> think<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:03.869> but<00:02:04.680> right<00:02:04.890> side<00:02:05.579> should

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
don't think so but right side should

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.809 
don't think so but right side should
have<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.770> power<00:02:07.770> on<00:02:08.009> button<00:02:08.039> here<00:02:08.580> which

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
have the power on button here which

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.330 
have the power on button here which
looks<00:02:09.300> quite<00:02:09.989> nice<00:02:10.140> now<00:02:10.560> of<00:02:10.709> course<00:02:10.770> this<00:02:11.190> is

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
looks quite nice now of course this is

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.920 
looks quite nice now of course this is
only<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.610> back<00:02:11.879> very<00:02:12.150> into<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.390> program<00:02:12.629> is<00:02:12.900> the

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
only the back very into a program is the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.960 
only the back very into a program is the
other<00:02:13.200> variants

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
other variants

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.720 
other variants
and<00:02:14.930> that<00:02:15.140> could<00:02:15.260> be<00:02:15.290> very<00:02:15.740> interesting<00:02:15.770> I'm

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
and that could be very interesting I'm

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.340 
and that could be very interesting I'm
still<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:17.030> little<00:02:17.060> bit<00:02:17.300> skeptical<00:02:17.870> because<00:02:18.080> it

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
still a little bit skeptical because it

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.980 
still a little bit skeptical because it
doesn't<00:02:18.620> look<00:02:18.710> that<00:02:18.770> good<00:02:19.160> here<00:02:19.780> so<00:02:20.780> i<00:02:20.810> really

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
doesn't look that good here so i really

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.740 
doesn't look that good here so i really
do<00:02:21.200> hope<00:02:21.230> that<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.770> real<00:02:22.490> model<00:02:23.300> is<00:02:23.480> going<00:02:23.690> to

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
do hope that the real model is going to

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.430 
do hope that the real model is going to
look<00:02:24.110> even<00:02:24.350> more<00:02:24.620> fresh<00:02:25.010> and<00:02:25.280> clean<00:02:26.140> so<00:02:27.140> when
