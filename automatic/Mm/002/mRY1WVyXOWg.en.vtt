system collects to look at where we

system collects to look at where we

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
might have bottlenecks where processes

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.660 
might have bottlenecks where processes
don't<00:01:58.270> really<00:01:58.630> match<00:01:58.840> our<00:01:59.340> our<00:02:00.340> students

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
don't really match our our students

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.660 
don't really match our our students
needs<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:02.110> where<00:02:02.710> we<00:02:02.890> can<00:02:03.040> make<00:02:03.220> some<00:02:03.550> real

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
needs and where we can make some real

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.090 
needs and where we can make some real
efficiencies<00:02:04.240> for<00:02:04.840> both<00:02:05.080> of<00:02:05.200> us<00:02:05.350> and<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:06.070> make

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
efficiencies for both of us and to make

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.529 
efficiencies for both of us and to make
their<00:02:06.340> lives<00:02:06.490> easier<00:02:06.640> for<00:02:06.940> our<00:02:07.030> students<00:02:07.450> as

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
their lives easier for our students as

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.630 
their lives easier for our students as
well<00:02:07.570> so<00:02:08.020> that's<00:02:08.170> been<00:02:08.380> a<00:02:08.410> massive<00:02:08.830> game<00:02:09.459> that

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
well so that's been a massive game that
