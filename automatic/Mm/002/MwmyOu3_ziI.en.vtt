00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.109
 Hello dear spectators this time something 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.950
 extraordinary desire is great 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.849
 no matter 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.530
 I've just turned itself 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.049
 I should just put it together 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.049
 show how the war machine the vital 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.770
 unit and the sponge work it 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.359
 should play on very easily and one 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.539
 any mode any web 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.170
 that's why utah and 20 25 and free for 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.170
 all a lot of fun 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.730
 yes I have the mode selected because I 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.520
 thought me if the opponents 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.260
 it is falling busy 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.829
 me a little bit easier, the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.670
 crowded to capture 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.670
 that was a bit shitty now 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.830
 he wanted to arrive there 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.410
 so 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.210
 I will do so I will try now 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.180
 only at the end of series full to 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.870
 get and then just shows one 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.220
 after another 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.840
 I just have one more 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.610
 proberunde because at two of 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.090
 which had to give away as well first 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:46.850
 that works and that in the vital 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:49.760
 unit and the swarm but come to that 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.030
 We hope to see you again soon 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.030
 no shit 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.649
 but that actually looks pretty good 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.649
 just 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.140
 yes that looks pretty good 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:22.010
 wonderful so then happy now first 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.170
 take a look at the swan now 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.630
 map 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.950
 So you can see over here in the sky 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:32.990
 these hunter killer are flying around 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:36.380
 old and a few of them just pop 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:39.530
 down here all over the floor and down 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.730
 the whole spiritual kills me completely 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.770
 defenseless on the floor run around to 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.880
 have to 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.800
 I do my one always sees swam here 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:51.940
 I'll finish with the hunter 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.940
 killer annoying there is one more 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.769
 now no one came down to me 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.190
 then I just show the 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.830
 war machine that is in need 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.020
 just be 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:13.300
 He has a total of twelve shots 6 each 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:17.300
 magazine reloads relatively quickly 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:19.510
 So for the ratio has 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:27.580
 very good what you should stop 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:27.580
 About to follow shortly 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.360
 Oops 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:39.350
 you just have to make the plan that 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.610
 the grenades have a certain distance 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.670
 have to fly before they explode 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.460
 because before that , I can show you again 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.590
 power with the last shot in the magazine 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:51.350
 They just go away well and 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:54.370
 then explode somewhere so lay now 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:58.490
 I'm going to be very professional 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:02.660
 and that is the vital unit that is 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:04.310
 just a protected thing is flying 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:09.940
 automatically and i can just funny 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.940
 I have rockets snb here 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.209
 this thing intervene here by 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.920
 I just think a little bit more 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.110
 better now wish is concerned 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.900
 is off the I just see 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.770
 are a little better opponent 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:33.710
 I already have the war machines 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:37.010
 Just ball over my time again 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.650
 own opinion to the conclusion series 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.230
 the schwabe is in perfect order 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.220
 Stop at all if the opponents 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.980
 but blind guardians have got it in that 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:51.140
 yes, that does not matter to many 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:54.620
 Completion series like that and the vital ones 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:56.450
 unit is in itself cool is just again 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.180
 pretty exhausted that was already in 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:05.360
 black ops 1 with this attack 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:09.560
 helicopter like that and what's the name of the thing 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.960
 now here i like the war machine 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.160
 not personally because I somehow 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:18.440
 I do not know how a bit annoying 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:19.910
 and especially if you have the thing in the world 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.160
 hand and suddenly comes one like that 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.210
 then forget a melee 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.440
 Can you hope for him? 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.930
 directly hit with the grenade and 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.170
 otherwise it was then 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.170
 to you 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.380
 units ready for use 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.960
 once there 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.810
 a little clay pigeon shooting 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.810
 that, just now 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.960
 The missiles need you right now 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.530
 have charged because the stop very 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.530
 powerful 

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:13.460
 ok on we go in the paths says now 

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:14.509
 no big challenge here kills 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.050
 I only really did that 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:19.189
 because I show the killstreaks 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:24.009
 why not find the idea for everyone 

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:25.999
 Of course, no case is so cool 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:31.099
 great challenge but it does 

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:32.749
 I have to admit that it's fun and clear 

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:34.909
 if somebody somehow graduated 

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:37.069
 so wants to see series if someone still 

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:39.889
 Just want to see another one 

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:42.340
 As I said, please write to the 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:44.360
 e-mail address and not in the comments 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:50.509
 I have already explained several times 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:51.770
 why and then that can be applied to everyone 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:55.689
 set up case then I like to do 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.689
 even more videos with conclusion series 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:09.600
 Now we all have a vest too 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:22.169
 Do you have the best so who has the honor 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:23.669
 of the last graduation you can almost 

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:25.880
 the grenade live in action again 

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:25.880
 experience 

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:36.580
 Well, if so stupid to close it ok 

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:41.500
 the one death would not have to be 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:42.130
 but my god 75 1 is me 

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.320
 justifiable 

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:46.330
 yes as I said thank you for the cool 

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.870
 suggestion and thanks for watching 

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.870
