00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
appears to be for possibly the jungle

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.640 
appears to be for possibly the jungle
biome<00:00:12.090> or<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.420> normal<00:00:12.719> Plains<00:00:13.019> biome<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.500> say

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
tree on the left hand side and I also

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.220 
tree on the left hand side and I also
say<00:00:17.940> planes<00:00:18.210> because<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.720> grass<00:00:18.930> color

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230

now<00:00:19.859> let's<00:00:20.310> move<00:00:20.520> over<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.850> tree<00:00:21.210> as<00:00:21.420> you<00:00:21.840> can

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
now let's move over to tree as you can

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.269 
now let's move over to tree as you can
see<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.260> appears<00:00:22.560> as<00:00:22.680> though<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.949> tree

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
see it appears as though the tree

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.250 
see it appears as though the tree
extends<00:00:23.789> further<00:00:24.090> into<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.570> underground<00:00:24.960> and

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
extends further into the underground and

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.660 
extends further into the underground and
it<00:00:25.350> carries<00:00:25.650> along<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:26.039> background<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.550> the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
it carries along the background of the

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.580 
it carries along the background of the
tree<00:00:26.849> with<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:27.779> possibly<00:00:28.230> maybe<00:00:28.439> a

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
tree with it so this possibly maybe a

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.080 
tree with it so this possibly maybe a
new<00:00:28.769> dungeon<00:00:29.130> entrance<00:00:29.490> or<00:00:29.670> just<00:00:29.939> leading

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
new dungeon entrance or just leading

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.999 
new dungeon entrance or just leading
down<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.660> root<00:00:30.840> system<00:00:31.289> now<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.679> tree

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
down to the root system now the tree

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.380 
down to the root system now the tree
along<00:00:32.340> with<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.579> leaves<00:00:32.759> on<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.059> left<00:00:33.239> hand

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
along with the leaves on the left hand

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.120 
along with the leaves on the left hand
side<00:00:33.510> also<00:00:33.840> appears<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.320> have<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.530> new<00:00:34.710> texture

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.340 
side also appears to have a new texture
to<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.399> which<00:00:35.670> may<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.120> say<00:00:36.540> looks<00:00:37.020> pretty

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
to it which may I say looks pretty

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.619
