00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.769
 First of all, you will see the highlight of the starting Makita 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:14.190
 I want to 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:14.190
 I put out a runner, but here Matsumoto strikes to the slaughter 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.810
 And the great town Ruu against the long 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.810
 It is English was thereafter 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:29.420
 Originally it I'll cut in continuing this kind of a 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:32.620
 It is a development, but here is a scene that strikes to the tripartite ban 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.620
 It's also missing well 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.920
 Liner to the left for Kobayashi 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.700
 Kataoka got stuck 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.420
 This time perfect pitching 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.780
 It is a scene to lose points on the 4th floor 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.710
 Ibata was too much Tokyu at the 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.250
 My lupine or something to say whether or not c c 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.120
 but 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.840
 Ummm 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.840
 But I had to say that too Kanpaku I think that should be the reflection 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.660
 To say how and been shot in the in type to the 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.660
 I lost as a teacher 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:19.580
 Well then, I 'm a batter , but today I'm back in the game with Goya Nakamura, who has one bat. 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.420
 That is the bat I'd was 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.420
 It was a shoot ball 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.220
 It is only this 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.180
 Well hit 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.140
 If it comes to that up 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.400
 Please be alright 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.400
 I still like the city 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:41.710
 Anxiety is a relieved one-at-a-bat for fans who are relieved I'm worried about what it will be tomorrow 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.250
 Only such 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.390
 This is a piano hobby, but it was such a great decision when I placed the runner 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.390
 It was good high 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.500
 It is play 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.500
 Behind it was Noauto first base third base of the scene 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:03.880
 Sato I went from the west entrance of you You're worth my head that went up to Chu mound Kedomo first baseman 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.880
 Mishima 's pinch 4 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:12.430
 It is not a veteran pitcher Mitaka runner will come back while the second throw is off 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:17.519
 Hey, I was throwing of rice 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:20.000
 Asamura is second grade for hitting which we also beat this 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.000
 Sasushi 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.940
 It's not you lost struck the two points 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.940
 I think I Chau postscript from what is out 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.900
 The scene now Asamura is this scene was fielded out before 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:45.600
 Did not the impossible for the small 5 of the ball that crowded Te 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.850
 I think that I would understand if you dig now and also join the samurai 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.090
 Even if I dig, I'm still saving properly 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:56.780
 If such a challenge is also going to be done from now on, is it an open battle? 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.780
 It became a point highlight of this game like yes yes
