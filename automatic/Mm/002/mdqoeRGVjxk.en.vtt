00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:16.020

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:28.800
 packed packed so here it means y 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:31.699
 we should be a flashlight flashlight now we 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.699
 try to find him 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:38.210
 sealed so he is a 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.690
 small-small small-small 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:46.670
 monkey fan art is generally small and so 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:52.640
 our flashlight costs about five dollars 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:56.550
 here is ultrafire cree q5 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.440
 Now we will try to turn it on as 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.320
 he works does not work like here 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:07.020
 Zoom even have so here it should 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.750
 increase here here now we 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.580
 try to test do a test 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.270
 drive pine i'll take the battery and 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.820
 included 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.720
 so now we have taken mean 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.630
 battery 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.470
 and try to turn it on now 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.860
 earn does not earn manufacturer 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.829
 here promise three capitals luminous flux 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.600
 Here we try so it means a battery 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:38.520
 one finger 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:43.700
 aa and try to turn off the light 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.700
 so burning give strangely 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:56.229
 so two modes in an unusual light and 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:02:00.400
 pulsing so here so he shines 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:03.759
 us this is the widest possible circle 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:07.720
 But if you need something close 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:10.090
 shine like that in general for the global move 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.700
 of the world come out very tight ie he 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.709
 waterproof so on spray probably 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.959
 bathe it certainly is not worth it I think thats 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:23.020
 Shutdown Well, here is a flashlight 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:28.000
 he has an orange button 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:32.800
 turn on off this is a hike 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.280
 somewhere you can for and hook like this 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:41.320
 here you can see there is an LED so weak 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.790
 see in general, then see so it 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.810
 LED brand 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.260
 again this ultrafire model is pure 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.410
 Chinese brand seems to be saying good 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.049
 lanterns 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.940
 let's see how it will work 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.850
 it will work really how much 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.060
 will cover the only thing that says that 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:04.150
 seems to be like the LEDs themselves they are short-lived 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.910
 1 loop memory card here now put 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.500
 new all right so but end here 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.110
 still not two modes 3 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.590
 I also tested it in 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.989
 the dark 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:18.070
 that means he is turning off 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:21.610
 plus two more lighting modes it is 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.920
 a sling that is pulsing and bright light 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.760
 and weak light a little bit weaker 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.829
 Well, in general, this is all try 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.340
 take off on the street how will it work 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:36.549
 how far did they beat him and then 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.420
 and now we shall take off the hour 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:47.460
 I will say and take off, I will show everything so far 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:54.650
 We shoot as our flashlight burns on the street 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:59.580
 so here you can see yes this winter is now 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:04.650
 this one so it burns without zoom 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:07.700
 now we are trying to zoom unfortunately 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.700
 can not see far on say so 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:19.980
 maximum as far as you can see meters on 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:24.770
 a hundred and fifty somewhere beats here so planted 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:26.310
 not visible but 150 meters great beats 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:33.390
 kickbacks go 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:34.800
 go with us here so here it means 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.930
 so here it shines it was a mode 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:45.440
 just less this bright here 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:45.440
 half brightness and pulsating 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:02.550
 Well, in general, that's how it shines great 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.570
 I liked the device so good 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.330
