00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.930
 hello cora 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.450
 today if you read it with notes 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.390
 I 'll show you some of it 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.500
 works with these notes 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:24.529
 what do you see on this card 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:29.369
 right is just a round ball first 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:34.230
 and what do you still see okay how many 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:38.970
 lines so you see you look five 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:43.769
 lines 1 2 3 4 5 and what is in between 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:48.870
 The lines between space exactly and how 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:52.109
 many think you see between four 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.969
 between 1234 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:55.800
 now you can definitely say in 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.350
 which between robben is now sitting 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.899
 these balls 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.429
 so if you count from below 123 im 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.210
 third between you could also from 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:06.110
 see above 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.900
 from above , the second space between 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:14.700
 Now you look like card 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:21.320
 For example, this is where this is 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:23.970
 note on the fourth line exactly 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.100
 if you now the two notes of 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.640
 Anguish where is the difference 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:35.040
 then differed what kind 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:39.660
 for example , one could still for 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:45.840
 meanwhile, can support this 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:48.600
 above as well as now 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.060
 Next, I would say should nevertheless times 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.480
 you can find these edgy card stacks 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.190
 all gap notes and sorted 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.970

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.970
 come from poor states 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:18.010

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.430
