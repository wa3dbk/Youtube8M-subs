00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.000
Oh hear me ye good people, 
come and lend me your ear.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.200
The snow falls somewhere. Great! Yo-hoo! 
We're at the end of a year.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.000
Let us have some happiness, 
friendship and joy.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.300
Our friend, lonely documentarist, 
is here again, oh boy!

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.390
We have our ways, the giggle of us
dimwits must be had.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.890
The sauce and the dance took him. 
It was awful, it was bad.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.440
A spastic hairless werewolf, 
bottled curse, the freak is changed.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.900
And on his rampage through my room 
everything got rearranged.

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.199
We laughed our arses off, 
the furniture was off dancing too.

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.429
TV got tucked into my bed. 
The bed was in the loo.

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:01.000
So we shared some happiness, 
friendship and joy.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.200
Dying for a beer, oh videoman? 
Take a beer or die, oh boy!

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.840
You know that it's the thought that counts,
and countless thoughts will grow.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.210
Was it something about christmas? 
Can't remember. I don't know.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.320
I say senseless things, so what! 
Find a wall to write them on!

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.800
Check it, don't get it? The cleaners get mad!
Voila! A meaning was born.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.130
We finns know our midwinter. 
Now this place feels a bit weird.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.500
No, I'm not homesick. What's that? 
A dead bat. Hang it from my beard!

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.990
We bring here our happiness, 
friendship and joy.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.950
Room service says "No beer, police yes"! 
It's the cavalry, ahoy!

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The law in here doesn't need 
our happiness or joy.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.660
Destruction by some rockers 
the order won't enjoy.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.780
So we wobbled down the fire escape, 
our visions in strange hues.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.240
The christmas colours in our eyes! 
We must avoid the blues.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.030
We couldn't make it far the southern 
sun hot on our backs.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.000
No sinister uniformes here. 
Find more booze, then we relax.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.000
Again we have happiness, 
friendship and joy.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.200
Here's to lonely documentarist, 
wake up and drink! Oh boy!

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.300
We must keep this a secret 
from our girlfriends and the wives.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.810
They already think we're idiots, 
date's closing on borrowed lives.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.210
Am I dumb or what! Uh-oh! 
Did I give it all away?

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.490
Our girls will skin us alive... Well... 
A round for the boys! I'll pay!

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.000
There's a glint in your eye, my love, 
at home far north, I know.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.780
We made you crack up in secret. 
Admit it? "Never, no!"

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.500
We all shared the happiness, 
friendship and joy.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.510
We all shared the happiness, friendship and
joy.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.400
Of our lonely documentarist, 
in a christmas song, oh boy!

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.150
I ask you spirits of christmas. 
Grant us all, and grant us well!

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.470
The trees upright with the balls of red 
and the will to raise hell!

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.819
And you all can share the happiness, 
friendship and joy.

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.000
With our lonely documentaris, 
and a christmas song, oh boy!

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.200
A lonely documentarist, 
and a christmas song, oh boy!

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.200
Not so lonely documentarist, 
a christmas song, oh boy!
