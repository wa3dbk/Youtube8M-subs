00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
can actually go into production so the

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.310

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
quirky cloak case is one of these ideas

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.839 
quirky cloak case is one of these ideas
that<00:00:28.740> actually<00:00:29.010> came<00:00:29.130> up<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.369> few<00:00:29.400> months<00:00:29.609> ago

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
that actually came up a few months ago

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.659 
that actually came up a few months ago
and<00:00:30.179> as<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.510> understand<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.219> it<00:00:32.219> took<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.399> while

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
and as I understand it it took a while

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.520 
and as I understand it it took a while
for<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.239> actually<00:00:33.570> come<00:00:33.989> out<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.140> think<00:00:34.290> they

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
for it to actually come out I think they

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.350 
for it to actually come out I think they
had<00:00:34.620> actually<00:00:34.920> intended<00:00:35.399> for<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.940> product

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
had actually intended for the product

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.569 
had actually intended for the product
for<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.719> case<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:36.930> come<00:00:37.200> out<00:00:37.320> in<00:00:38.219> eight

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
for the case to come out in eight

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.479 
for the case to come out in eight

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
green and it costs 5499 in terms of

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.609 
green and it costs 5499 in terms of
material<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:05.400> rubber<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.380> plastic<00:01:07.380> case

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
material it is a rubber and plastic case

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.130 
material it is a rubber and plastic case
so<00:01:08.040> if<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.909> look<00:01:09.030> at<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.240> front<00:01:09.450> cover<00:01:09.600> here

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
so if you look at the front cover here

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.490 
so if you look at the front cover here
it<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:11.299> fairly<00:01:12.299> thick<00:01:12.659> front<00:01:13.049> cover<00:01:13.260> that

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
it is fairly thick front cover that

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.920 
it is fairly thick front cover that
doesn't<00:01:13.799> really<00:01:13.979> bend<00:01:14.280> it's<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.930> plastic

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
doesn't really bend it's a plastic

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.710 
doesn't really bend it's a plastic
insert<00:01:16.350> covered<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.400> rubber<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.000> don't<00:01:18.659> if

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
insert covered in rubber and don't if

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.179 
insert covered in rubber and don't if
you<00:01:18.810> can<00:01:18.930> see<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.170> texture<00:01:19.500> on<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.799> case<00:01:20.009> but

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
you can see the texture on this case but

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.039 
you can see the texture on this case but
has<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.310> really<00:01:20.520> interesting<00:01:20.729> texture<00:01:21.299> or

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
has a really interesting texture or

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.440 
has a really interesting texture or
pattern<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:22.979> kind<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.280> diminishes<00:01:24.240> to

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
pattern on it that kind of diminishes to

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.300 
pattern on it that kind of diminishes to
nothing<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.020> then<00:01:25.170> you've<00:01:25.470> had<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.860> quirky

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
nothing and then you've had the quirky

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.490 
nothing and then you've had the quirky
logo<00:01:26.640> done<00:01:26.850> fairly<00:01:27.780> discreetly<00:01:28.320> at<00:01:28.409> the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
logo done fairly discreetly at the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.530 
logo done fairly discreetly at the
bottom<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:28.890> don't<00:01:29.220> like<00:01:29.310> garish<00:01:29.579> logos<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.210> this

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
bottom I don't like garish logos so this

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.810 
bottom I don't like garish logos so this
one<00:01:30.720> kind<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:30.960> suits<00:01:31.140> me<00:01:31.290> just<00:01:31.320> fine<00:01:31.640> in<00:01:32.640> case

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
one kind of suits me just fine in case

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.100 
one kind of suits me just fine in case
that's<00:01:32.939> something<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.479> consider<00:01:33.840> as

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
that's something that you consider as

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.859 
that's something that you consider as
well<00:01:34.460> looking<00:01:35.460> at<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.700> back<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.390> case<00:01:36.600> no

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
well looking at the back of the case no

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.140 
well looking at the back of the case no
pattern<00:01:37.290> here<00:01:37.680> it's<00:01:37.829> just<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.159> plain<00:01:38.520> black

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
pattern here it's just a plain black

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.460 
pattern here it's just a plain black
rubber<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.810> rubber<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.340> pretty<00:01:41.340> tacky<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.720> by

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
rubber the rubber is pretty tacky and by

rubber the rubber is pretty tacky and by
that<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.649> mean<00:01:43.829> sticky<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.640> picks<00:01:44.850> up

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
that I mean sticky and that it picks up

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.740 
that I mean sticky and that it picks up
lint<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.600> dust<00:01:46.110> fairly<00:01:46.590> easily<00:01:47.210> on<00:01:48.210> the

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
flat surface you can just fold the cover

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.990 
flat surface you can just fold the cover
back<00:03:51.229> pop<00:03:52.229> out<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.739> smaller<00:03:53.190> the<00:03:53.549> two<00:03:53.729> stands

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
back pop out the smaller the two stands

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.589 
back pop out the smaller the two stands
here<00:03:54.479> and<00:03:54.919> it'll<00:03:55.919> hold<00:03:56.159> your<00:03:56.310> iPad<00:03:56.579> up<00:03:56.729> add<00:03:57.569> a

here and it'll hold your iPad up add a
pretty<00:03:57.870> good<00:03:58.019> angle<00:03:58.319> I<00:03:58.879> have<00:03:59.879> found<00:04:00.090> I<00:04:00.449> tried

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
pretty good angle I have found I tried

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.240 
pretty good angle I have found I tried
this<00:04:00.870> for<00:04:01.109> a<00:04:01.500> few<00:04:01.680> minutes<00:04:01.829> I'm<00:04:02.040> wearing

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
this for a few minutes I'm wearing

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.830 
this for a few minutes I'm wearing
shorts<00:04:02.699> because<00:04:02.879> it's<00:04:03.120> hot<00:04:03.599> and<00:04:04.400> this<00:04:05.540> edge<00:04:06.540> of

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
shorts because it's hot and this edge of

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.509 
shorts because it's hot and this edge of
this<00:04:06.930> little<00:04:07.229> stand<00:04:07.440> is<00:04:07.590> a<00:04:07.620> little<00:04:07.799> sharp<00:04:08.069> so

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
this little stand is a little sharp so

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.280 
this little stand is a little sharp so
it's<00:04:08.699> not<00:04:08.760> exactly<00:04:09.150> comfortable<00:04:09.720> on<00:04:10.019> a<00:04:10.049> lap

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
it's not exactly comfortable on a lap

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.659 
it's not exactly comfortable on a lap
but<00:04:10.500> probably<00:04:10.799> not<00:04:10.919> an<00:04:11.040> issue<00:04:11.129> if<00:04:11.400> you<00:04:11.519> wear

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:11.669 
but probably not an issue if you wear

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:15.559 
but probably not an issue if you wear
pants<00:04:12.620> at<00:04:13.620> all<00:04:13.829> so<00:04:14.099> something<00:04:15.090> to<00:04:15.329> keep<00:04:15.449> in

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
pants at all so something to keep in

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.069 
pants at all so something to keep in
mind<00:04:15.629> there<00:04:16.019> if<00:04:16.889> you<00:04:17.370> use<00:04:17.579> your<00:04:17.760> iPad<00:04:18.150> stay<00:04:18.989> in

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
mind there if you use your iPad stay in

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.860 
mind there if you use your iPad stay in
the<00:04:19.169> kitchen<00:04:19.289> as<00:04:20.280> a<00:04:20.340> cookbook<00:04:20.639> you<00:04:21.329> can<00:04:21.690> use

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
the kitchen as a cookbook you can use

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:22.190 
the kitchen as a cookbook you can use
this

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
this

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.360 
this
and<00:04:22.640> to<00:04:23.640> pop<00:04:23.820> it<00:04:24.000> pop<00:04:24.150> it<00:04:24.210> up<00:04:24.390> in<00:04:25.100> landscape<00:04:26.100> or

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
and to pop it pop it up in landscape or

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.310 
and to pop it pop it up in landscape or
Treat<00:04:26.520> orientation<00:04:27.030> rather<00:04:27.210> that<00:04:28.110> stays

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
Treat orientation rather that stays

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.170 
Treat orientation rather that stays
pretty<00:04:28.530> well<00:04:28.770> so<00:04:29.520> that's<00:04:29.760> a<00:04:29.850> nice<00:04:30.000> feature

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
pretty well so that's a nice feature

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.040 
pretty well so that's a nice feature
there<00:04:30.390> as<00:04:30.840> well<00:04:31.280> and<00:04:32.280> then<00:04:32.720> my<00:04:33.720> favorite

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
there as well and then my favorite

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.010 
there as well and then my favorite
orientation<00:04:34.620> if<00:04:34.800> I<00:04:34.890> want<00:04:35.070> to<00:04:35.130> watch<00:04:35.190> a<00:04:35.340> movie

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
orientation if I want to watch a movie

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.670 
orientation if I want to watch a movie
you<00:04:37.020> can<00:04:37.260> just<00:04:37.590> flip<00:04:37.980> open<00:04:38.190> the<00:04:38.520> cover<00:04:38.760> and<00:04:39.680> it

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
you can just flip open the cover and it

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.790 
you can just flip open the cover and it
stays<00:04:40.950> put<00:04:41.310> just<00:04:42.180> like<00:04:42.360> that<00:04:42.510> to<00:04:42.930> leave<00:04:43.650> the

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
stays put just like that to leave the

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.790 
stays put just like that to leave the
iPad<00:04:44.130> and<00:04:44.430> landscape<00:04:45.000> orientation<00:04:45.650> given<00:04:46.650> the

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
iPad and landscape orientation given the

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.070 
iPad and landscape orientation given the
stickiness<00:04:47.310> of<00:04:47.550> the<00:04:47.730> rubber<00:04:47.940> it<00:04:48.240> stays<00:04:48.870> put

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
stickiness of the rubber it stays put

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.600 
stickiness of the rubber it stays put
very<00:04:49.350> well<00:04:49.560> I've<00:04:49.710> tried<00:04:49.920> a<00:04:49.950> wooden<00:04:50.400> desk

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
very well I've tried a wooden desk

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.670 
very well I've tried a wooden desk
granite<00:04:51.240> countertop<00:04:51.660> and<00:04:51.810> it's<00:04:52.350> not<00:04:52.560> going

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
granite countertop and it's not going

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.220 
granite countertop and it's not going
anywhere<00:04:52.800> so<00:04:53.370> that<00:04:54.030> part<00:04:54.270> is<00:04:54.450> very<00:04:54.660> nice<00:04:54.840> on

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
anywhere so that part is very nice on

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.890 
anywhere so that part is very nice on
the<00:04:55.440> hinge<00:04:56.090> even<00:04:57.090> that's<00:04:57.240> very<00:04:57.360> substantial

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
the hinge even that's very substantial

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.930 
the hinge even that's very substantial
it<00:04:57.960> doesn't<00:04:58.320> if<00:04:58.860> I<00:04:59.010> remember<00:04:59.400> correctly<00:04:59.430> and<00:04:59.910> I

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
it doesn't if I remember correctly and I

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.430 
it doesn't if I remember correctly and I
could<00:05:00.150> be<00:05:00.270> wrong<00:05:00.450> so<00:05:00.720> don't<00:05:00.750> hold<00:05:01.020> me<00:05:01.200> to<00:05:01.230> this

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
could be wrong so don't hold me to this

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.530 
could be wrong so don't hold me to this
but<00:05:01.500> I<00:05:02.100> thought<00:05:02.370> that<00:05:02.430> some<00:05:03.090> of<00:05:03.180> the<00:05:03.240> initial

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
but I thought that some of the initial

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.180 
but I thought that some of the initial
designs<00:05:03.840> for<00:05:04.050> this<00:05:04.140> case<00:05:04.380> had<00:05:04.680> some<00:05:04.920> sort<00:05:05.130> of

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
designs for this case had some sort of

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.400 
designs for this case had some sort of
ratcheting<00:05:05.700> mechanism<00:05:05.880> in<00:05:06.450> the<00:05:06.510> hinge<00:05:07.200> so

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
ratcheting mechanism in the hinge so

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.750 
ratcheting mechanism in the hinge so
that<00:05:07.560> it<00:05:07.680> would<00:05:07.830> kind<00:05:08.070> of<00:05:08.130> lock<00:05:08.370> into<00:05:08.610> place

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
that it would kind of lock into place

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.910 
that it would kind of lock into place
when<00:05:09.180> you<00:05:09.360> when<00:05:09.930> you<00:05:09.960> open<00:05:10.290> it<00:05:10.320> up<00:05:10.440> but<00:05:10.650> it

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
when you when you open it up but it

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.320 
when you when you open it up but it
doesn't<00:05:11.600> but<00:05:12.600> the<00:05:12.720> action<00:05:13.020> is<00:05:13.110> fairly<00:05:13.320> smooth

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
doesn't but the action is fairly smooth

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.980 
doesn't but the action is fairly smooth
very<00:05:15.330> easy<00:05:15.540> to<00:05:15.810> open<00:05:15.960> and<00:05:16.200> close<00:05:16.290> the<00:05:16.650> case<00:05:16.860> and

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
very easy to open and close the case and

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.200 
very easy to open and close the case and
feels<00:05:18.990> very<00:05:19.230> sturdy<00:05:19.520> overall<00:05:20.520> it's<00:05:20.820> it's<00:05:21.090> all

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
feels very sturdy overall it's it's all

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.210 
feels very sturdy overall it's it's all
plastic<00:05:21.480> here<00:05:21.990> if<00:05:22.350> you<00:05:22.470> can<00:05:22.590> tell<00:05:22.800> here<00:05:23.100> it's

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
plastic here if you can tell here it's

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.350 
plastic here if you can tell here it's
that<00:05:23.400> rubber<00:05:23.760> coated<00:05:24.180> and<00:05:24.710> then<00:05:25.710> the<00:05:25.770> plastic

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
that rubber coated and then the plastic
