the<00:00:18.689> cover<00:00:18.900> glass<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.320> important<00:00:19.829> because<00:00:20.039> it

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
the cover glass is important because it

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.669 
the cover glass is important because it
is<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.179> interface<00:00:21.539> which<00:00:22.019> is<00:00:22.169> facing<00:00:22.650> the

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:22.679 
is the interface which is facing the

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:25.009 
is the interface which is facing the
world<00:00:23.009> and<00:00:23.429> so<00:00:23.789> for<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.060> simple<00:00:24.449> display

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
world and so for a simple display

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.509 
world and so for a simple display
something<00:00:25.560> which<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:26.009> just<00:00:26.189> showing

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
something which is just showing

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.300 
something which is just showing
information<00:00:26.869> it's<00:00:27.869> important<00:00:28.649> to<00:00:28.800> have<00:00:28.829> some

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
information it's important to have some

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.219 
information it's important to have some
way<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.759> users<00:00:30.149> don't<00:00:30.390> damage<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.989> if<00:00:31.109> you're

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:31.229 
way that users don't damage it if you're

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:32.780 
way that users don't damage it if you're
in<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.409> retail<00:00:31.829> setting<00:00:32.099> where<00:00:32.399> people<00:00:32.670> are

walking around banging into it on a
frequent<00:00:34.740> basis<00:00:35.100> it's<00:00:35.520> going<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.730> be<00:00:35.910> much

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.060 
frequent basis it's going to be much

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.390 
frequent basis it's going to be much
more<00:00:36.120> important<00:00:36.810> further<00:00:37.470> if<00:00:37.710> you're<00:00:37.980> making

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.400 
more important further if you're making

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.310 
more important further if you're making
a<00:00:38.490> touch<00:00:38.730> display<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:39.720> is<00:00:39.900> something<00:00:40.050> where

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
a touch display this is something where

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.350 
a touch display this is something where
you<00:00:40.410> want<00:00:40.740> your<00:00:41.130> people<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.490> walk<00:00:41.820> up<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.210> an

the display to make sits that it won't
scratch<00:00:56.220> easily<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:57.390> make<00:00:57.540> it<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:57.720> that<00:00:57.780> it

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
scratch easily to make it so that it

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.780 
scratch easily to make it so that it
won't<00:00:58.020> damage<00:00:58.380> easily<00:00:59.010> that's<00:00:59.430> where<00:00:59.700> you

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
won't damage easily that's where you

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:00.979 
won't damage easily that's where you
need<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.940> product<00:01:00.360> like<00:01:00.480> corning<00:01:00.870> gorilla

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
need a product like corning gorilla

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.840 
need a product like corning gorilla
glass<00:01:01.290> that<00:01:01.680> can<00:01:01.829> provide<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.280> level<00:01:02.579> of

the display industry right now are
people<00:01:12.869> working<00:01:13.829> to<00:01:14.219> find<00:01:14.579> out<00:01:14.819> how<00:01:15.090> can<00:01:15.149> they

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
people working to find out how can they

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.690 
people working to find out how can they
take<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.990> advantages<00:01:16.829> and<00:01:16.859> capabilities

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700

that<00:01:17.909> have<00:01:17.999> been<00:01:18.179> built<00:01:18.420> into<00:01:18.869> small<00:01:19.259> devices

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:19.829 
that have been built into small devices

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:23.629 
that have been built into small devices
like<00:01:20.280> smartphones<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.799> tablets<00:01:22.799> how<00:01:23.460> can

00:01:23.629 --> 00:01:23.639 
like smartphones and tablets how can

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:25.010 
like smartphones and tablets how can
they<00:01:23.729> take<00:01:23.939> those<00:01:24.179> things<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.569> integrate

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
they take those things and integrate

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.679 
they take those things and integrate
them<00:01:25.200> into<00:01:25.460> televisions<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.639> monitors<00:01:26.729> that

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
them into televisions and monitors that

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.899 
them into televisions and monitors that
are<00:01:27.749> inside<00:01:28.109> conference<00:01:28.740> room<00:01:29.039> schools<00:01:29.579> that

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
are inside conference room schools that

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.819 
are inside conference room schools that
type<00:01:30.179> of<00:01:30.209> thing<00:01:30.539> and<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.289> large<00:01:31.499> cover

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
type of thing and so the large cover

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.709 
type of thing and so the large cover
glass<00:01:32.009> business<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.670> about<00:01:32.939> trying<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.450> help

solutions that are out there today you
can<00:01:48.750> go<00:01:48.900> by<00:01:49.110> basically<00:01:49.619> safety<00:01:50.220> glass<00:01:50.550> and<00:01:50.820> put

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
can go by basically safety glass and put

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.730 
can go by basically safety glass and put
that<00:01:51.600> on<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.869> front<00:01:52.080> of<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.260> display<00:01:52.409> it's

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
that on the front of the display it's

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.219 
that on the front of the display it's
very<00:01:52.950> thick<00:01:53.310> it's<00:01:53.850> very<00:01:54.090> heavy<00:01:54.510> and<00:01:54.750> it

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
very thick it's very heavy and it

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.230 
very thick it's very heavy and it
distorts<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.890> image<00:01:56.010> so<00:01:56.550> that<00:01:56.700> what<00:01:56.910> you<00:01:57.060> look

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
distorts the image so that what you look

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.690 
distorts the image so that what you look
at<00:01:57.450> on<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.750> monitor<00:01:58.170> on<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.500> screen<00:01:58.920> doesn't
