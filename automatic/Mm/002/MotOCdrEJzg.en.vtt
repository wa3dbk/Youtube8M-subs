00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.490 
so this is I guess gonna be the first
video<00:00:56.899> so<00:00:59.120> anyway<00:01:00.120> what<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.870> can<00:01:01.109> do<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.469> just

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
video so anyway what I can do is just

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:11.120 
video so anyway what I can do is just
show<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:08.840> I<00:01:09.840> was<00:01:10.290> thinking<00:01:10.560> about<00:01:10.650> removing

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270
