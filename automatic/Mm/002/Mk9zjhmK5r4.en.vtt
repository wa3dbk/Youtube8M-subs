hello YouTube it's Detroit Borg and I'm

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.540 
hello YouTube it's Detroit Borg and I'm
back<00:00:07.690> with<00:00:07.900> another<00:00:07.960> test<00:00:08.530> of<00:00:08.710> 3G<00:00:09.160> network

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:09.550 
back with another test of 3G network

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.330 
back with another test of 3G network
speeds<00:00:09.910> this<00:00:10.240> time<00:00:10.450> I'm<00:00:10.660> gonna<00:00:10.809> test<00:00:11.080> a<00:00:11.340> 3G

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:12.340 
speeds this time I'm gonna test a 3G

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.750 
speeds this time I'm gonna test a 3G
iPad<00:00:13.000> next<00:00:13.270> to<00:00:13.540> a<00:00:13.570> Wi-Fi<00:00:14.350> iPad<00:00:14.860> where<00:00:15.610> the

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:15.760 
iPad next to a Wi-Fi iPad where the

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.270 
iPad next to a Wi-Fi iPad where the
Wi-Fi<00:00:16.150> iPad<00:00:16.660> is<00:00:16.870> connected<00:00:17.260> to<00:00:17.289> a<00:00:17.440> 3G<00:00:17.890> network

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:18.280 
Wi-Fi iPad is connected to a 3G network

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.630 
Wi-Fi iPad is connected to a 3G network
via<00:00:18.850> an<00:00:19.180> iPhone<00:00:19.720> 3GS<00:00:20.440> now<00:00:20.980> I'm<00:00:21.100> able<00:00:21.220> to<00:00:21.460> do

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
via an iPhone 3GS now I'm able to do

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.440 
via an iPhone 3GS now I'm able to do
this<00:00:21.820> because<00:00:22.210> of<00:00:22.420> a<00:00:22.780> app<00:00:23.080> called<00:00:23.500> my<00:00:23.770> Y<00:00:24.450> which

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:25.450 
this because of a app called my Y which

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.910 
this because of a app called my Y which
is<00:00:25.630> available<00:00:25.840> through<00:00:26.170> the<00:00:26.260> Sidious<00:00:26.650> store

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920 
is available through the Sidious store

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.370 
is available through the Sidious store
and<00:00:27.270> as<00:00:28.270> you<00:00:28.360> can<00:00:28.480> see<00:00:28.600> I<00:00:28.630> have<00:00:28.900> it<00:00:28.930> running

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
and as you can see I have it running

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.140 
and as you can see I have it running
right<00:00:29.410> now<00:00:29.770> and<00:00:30.100> the<00:00:30.550> network<00:00:30.850> that<00:00:31.030> the

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
right now and the network that the

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.450 
right now and the network that the
iPhone<00:00:31.450> is<00:00:31.600> using<00:00:31.900> is<00:00:32.110> 3G<00:00:32.439> you<00:00:32.980> can<00:00:33.100> see<00:00:33.250> it<00:00:33.340> up

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
iPhone is using is 3G you can see it up

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.669 
iPhone is using is 3G you can see it up
here<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.920> right<00:00:36.070> now<00:00:36.219> I'm<00:00:36.309> tethered<00:00:36.550> to<00:00:36.820> it

00:00:37.669 --> 00:00:37.679 
here so right now I'm tethered to it

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:40.799 
here so right now I'm tethered to it
basically<00:00:38.679> the<00:00:38.890> app<00:00:39.370> creates<00:00:39.850> a<00:00:39.969> Wi-Fi<00:00:40.570> a

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
basically the app creates a Wi-Fi a

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.470 
basically the app creates a Wi-Fi a
local<00:00:41.199> Wi-Fi<00:00:41.410> network<00:00:41.649> out<00:00:42.339> of<00:00:42.370> your<00:00:42.879> 3G

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
local Wi-Fi network out of your 3G

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.319 
local Wi-Fi network out of your 3G
network<00:00:44.050> on<00:00:44.289> the<00:00:44.800> iPhone<00:00:45.219> so<00:00:45.879> I've<00:00:46.030> connected

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
network on the iPhone so I've connected

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.279 
network on the iPhone so I've connected
this<00:00:46.929> iPad<00:00:47.409> to<00:00:48.010> Wi-Fi<00:00:48.999> running<00:00:49.480> on<00:00:49.659> the<00:00:49.960> iPhone

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 
this iPad to Wi-Fi running on the iPhone

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:52.559 
this iPad to Wi-Fi running on the iPhone
and<00:00:50.859> this<00:00:51.460> of<00:00:51.670> course<00:00:51.699> is<00:00:52.059> connected<00:00:52.539> to

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:52.569 
and this of course is connected to

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:55.860 
and this of course is connected to
directly<00:00:53.319> to<00:00:53.499> 3G<00:00:53.920> let's<00:00:54.550> go<00:00:54.670> ahead<00:00:54.760> and<00:00:55.120> test

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
directly to 3G let's go ahead and test

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.540 
directly to 3G let's go ahead and test
it<00:00:56.140> using<00:00:56.260> the<00:00:56.530> speed<00:00:56.769> test<00:00:57.010> app<00:00:57.219> which<00:00:57.370> I've

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
it using the speed test app which I've

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.790 
it using the speed test app which I've
done<00:00:58.030> in<00:00:58.239> my<00:00:58.329> previous<00:00:58.719> videos<00:00:59.050> okay<00:00:59.589> let's

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
done in my previous videos okay let's

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.880 
done in my previous videos okay let's
start<00:00:59.979> the<00:01:00.129> test<00:01:03.900> my<00:01:04.900> first<00:01:05.140> test<00:01:05.350> I<00:01:05.470> see<00:01:05.680> that

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
start the test my first test I see that

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.090 
start the test my first test I see that
the<00:01:06.360> Wi-Fi<00:01:07.360> tethered<00:01:07.870> to<00:01:08.049> the<00:01:08.170> iPhone<00:01:08.619> is<00:01:08.860> much

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
the Wi-Fi tethered to the iPhone is much

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.139 
the Wi-Fi tethered to the iPhone is much
faster<00:01:09.340> at<00:01:09.759> 28<00:01:10.210> at<00:01:11.049> 28<00:01:11.500> 11<00:01:12.040> down<00:01:12.340> average<00:01:12.909> and

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
faster at 28 at 28 11 down average and

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:17.670 
faster at 28 at 28 11 down average and
up<00:01:13.509> of<00:01:13.780> 261<00:01:14.409> while<00:01:15.040> the<00:01:15.280> 3G<00:01:16.000> iPad<00:01:16.390> is<00:01:16.570> at<00:01:16.719> 20<00:01:17.049> 73

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
up of 261 while the 3G iPad is at 20 73

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.969 
up of 261 while the 3G iPad is at 20 73
down<00:01:17.890> and<00:01:18.159> 103<00:01:18.790> up<00:01:19.180> and<00:01:19.659> it<00:01:20.320> even<00:01:20.590> has<00:01:20.710> a<00:01:20.740> higher

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
down and 103 up and it even has a higher

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.929 
down and 103 up and it even has a higher
link<00:01:21.310> so<00:01:21.490> yet<00:01:21.640> 141<00:01:22.329> to<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:23.469> tethered<00:01:23.939> iPads

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
link so yet 141 to the tethered iPads

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.889 
link so yet 141 to the tethered iPads
134<00:01:25.689> so<00:01:26.079> let's<00:01:26.259> run<00:01:26.439> the<00:01:26.590> second<00:01:26.979> test<00:01:27.899> once

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
134 so let's run the second test once

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.230 
134 so let's run the second test once
again<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.469> performance<00:01:30.100> on<00:01:30.219> the<00:01:30.340> Wi-Fi<00:01:30.759> iPad

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
again the performance on the Wi-Fi iPad

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.630 
again the performance on the Wi-Fi iPad
tether<00:01:31.509> to<00:01:31.719> the<00:01:31.750> iPhone<00:01:32.259> is<00:01:32.560> much<00:01:33.009> better<00:01:33.310> than

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
tether to the iPhone is much better than

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.510 
tether to the iPhone is much better than
that<00:01:33.820> of<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:34.090> 3G<00:01:34.539> iPad<00:01:34.869> we're<00:01:35.200> at<00:01:35.289> 30<00:01:35.649> 98

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
that of the 3G iPad we're at 30 98

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.469 
that of the 3G iPad we're at 30 98
average<00:01:36.969> down<00:01:37.240> and<00:01:37.829> 272<00:01:38.829> average<00:01:39.310> up<00:01:39.520> while

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
average down and 272 average up while

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.819 
average down and 272 average up while
we're<00:01:40.719> at<00:01:41.049> 23<00:01:41.649> 46<00:01:42.340> down<00:01:42.700> and<00:01:43.030> 105<00:01:44.020> up<00:01:44.409> and

we're at 23 46 down and 105 up and

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:47.310 
we're at 23 46 down and 105 up and
latency<00:01:45.130> again<00:01:45.549> is<00:01:45.820> fairly<00:01:46.750> close<00:01:47.079> to<00:01:47.259> each

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
latency again is fairly close to each

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.859 
latency again is fairly close to each
other<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:48.520> time<00:01:48.579> the<00:01:48.969> latency<00:01:49.359> is<00:01:49.390> lower<00:01:49.659> on

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
other this time the latency is lower on

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.249 
other this time the latency is lower on
the<00:01:49.990> 3G<00:01:50.320> iPad<00:01:50.649> at<00:01:50.770> 144<00:01:51.490> versus<00:01:52.240> 161<00:01:52.960> on<00:01:53.109> the

the 3G iPad at 144 versus 161 on the
tethered<00:01:53.560> iPad<00:01:53.979> so<00:01:54.520> let's<00:01:54.700> run<00:01:54.939> this<00:01:55.090> a<00:01:55.149> third

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
tethered iPad so let's run this a third

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.719 
tethered iPad so let's run this a third
time<00:01:55.780> okay<00:01:56.020> we<00:01:56.590> have<00:01:56.710> interesting<00:01:57.130> results<00:01:57.579> on

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
time okay we have interesting results on

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.179 
time okay we have interesting results on
the<00:01:57.880> third<00:01:58.090> test<00:01:58.450> this<00:01:58.719> time<00:01:59.049> the<00:01:59.320> 3G<00:01:59.679> iPad<00:02:00.009> was

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
the third test this time the 3G iPad was

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.950 
the third test this time the 3G iPad was
faster<00:02:00.609> at<00:02:00.990> 27:91<00:02:02.020> average<00:02:02.799> down<00:02:03.450> over<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.570> 18

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
faster at 27:91 average down over the 18

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.730 
faster at 27:91 average down over the 18
27<00:02:05.380> average<00:02:05.859> down<00:02:06.100> on<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.460> Wi-Fi<00:02:06.939> and<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:08.350> up

27 average down on the Wi-Fi and the up

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.800 
27 average down on the Wi-Fi and the up
speed<00:02:09.190> was<00:02:09.429> much<00:02:09.700> better<00:02:09.940> on<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.179> tethered

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
speed was much better on the tethered

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.000 
speed was much better on the tethered

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
Wi-Fi m/l at 263 average up versus 152

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.550

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
average up on the 3G iPad

Lane<00:02:18.040> see<00:02:18.220> again<00:02:18.430> was<00:02:18.580> very<00:02:18.760> close<00:02:19.000> at<00:02:19.180> 152<00:02:20.020> 142

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
Lane see again was very close at 152 142

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.010 
Lane see again was very close at 152 142
so<00:02:21.550> I<00:02:21.580> guess<00:02:21.730> what<00:02:21.910> we<00:02:22.000> can<00:02:22.120> conclude<00:02:22.780> from

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
so I guess what we can conclude from

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.520 
so I guess what we can conclude from
this<00:02:23.380> is<00:02:23.620> that<00:02:23.760> 3G<00:02:24.760> speed<00:02:25.480> is<00:02:25.690> not<00:02:25.900> necessarily

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
this is that 3G speed is not necessarily

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.670 
this is that 3G speed is not necessarily
consistent<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.900> performance<00:02:29.319> seems<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.590> be

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
consistent so performance seems to be

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.320 
consistent so performance seems to be
very<00:02:29.890> close<00:02:30.130> together<00:02:30.310> if<00:02:30.640> you<00:02:30.730> average<00:02:31.120> out

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
very close together if you average out

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.449 
very close together if you average out
the<00:02:31.390> differences<00:02:32.050> but<00:02:32.680> you<00:02:32.770> get<00:02:32.920> surprisingly

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
the differences but you get surprisingly

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:39.170 
the differences but you get surprisingly
good<00:02:33.790> performance<00:02:34.540> out<00:02:34.720> of<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:34.930> tethered<00:02:35.350> iPads

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.030 

let's<00:02:40.180> try<00:02:40.390> loading<00:02:40.719> some<00:02:40.959> pages<00:02:41.349> in<00:02:41.530> Safari

let's try loading some pages in Safari

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.009 
let's try loading some pages in Safari

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
once again we're going to do the Apple

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.959 
once again we're going to do the Apple
page<00:02:44.469> so<00:02:44.950> let's<00:02:45.099> see<00:02:45.219> if<00:02:45.310> I<00:02:45.370> can<00:02:45.579> do<00:02:45.700> this<00:02:45.849> at

page so let's see if I can do this at

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:56.140 
page so let's see if I can do this at
the<00:02:46.060> same<00:02:46.090> time<00:02:46.480> again

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
all right in that case it looks like 3G

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.550

seem to hang up at the end here so I'm

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.699 
seem to hang up at the end here so I'm
not<00:03:37.209> sure<00:03:37.330> what<00:03:37.780> caused<00:03:37.959> that<00:03:37.989> maybe<00:03:38.410> there

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
not sure what caused that maybe there

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:49.660 
not sure what caused that maybe there
was<00:03:38.860> some<00:03:39.099> lengthy<00:03:39.910> hiccup<00:03:40.239> there

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
once again the 3d iPad was slightly

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.190 
once again the 3d iPad was slightly
faster

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200

running<00:05:40.830> on<00:05:41.039> a<00:05:41.069> 3G<00:05:41.370> network<00:05:41.879> but<00:05:42.060> that's

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
running on a 3G network but that's

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.540 
running on a 3G network but that's
enough<00:05:42.479> to<00:05:42.599> fool<00:05:42.810> the<00:05:43.319> Wi-Fi<00:05:43.680> iPad<00:05:44.159> to

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
enough to fool the Wi-Fi iPad to

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.149 
enough to fool the Wi-Fi iPad to
download<00:05:45.060> the<00:05:45.719> full<00:05:46.050> resolution<00:05:46.379> YouTube

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:47.159 
download the full resolution YouTube

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:50.360 
download the full resolution YouTube
video<00:05:47.460> so<00:05:48.650> YouTube's<00:05:49.650> performance<00:05:50.159> on<00:05:50.250> the

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
video so YouTube's performance on the

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.309 
video so YouTube's performance on the
tethered<00:05:50.669> iPad<00:05:51.120> is<00:05:51.419> going<00:05:51.690> to<00:05:51.780> be<00:05:51.870> a<00:05:51.900> lot

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:52.319 
tethered iPad is going to be a lot

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:54.260 
tethered iPad is going to be a lot
better<00:05:52.590> than<00:05:52.710> YouTube<00:05:53.159> performance<00:05:53.669> on<00:05:53.819> a<00:05:53.849> 3G

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
better than YouTube performance on a 3G

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:07.080 
better than YouTube performance on a 3G
iPad<00:05:55.069> now<00:05:56.069> let's<00:05:56.250> try<00:05:56.400> the<00:05:56.460> EBC<00:05:56.729> player

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:24.090 

so<00:06:08.090> let's<00:06:08.300> go<00:06:08.540> to<00:06:10.180> flash-forward

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:24.100 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:35.219 

3gi<00:06:25.100> Passons<00:06:25.729> a<00:06:25.820> low<00:06:25.970> just<00:06:26.240> one<00:06:26.449> more<00:06:26.600> quickly

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:35.229 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:37.990 

so<00:06:36.229> once<00:06:36.380> again<00:06:36.500> it<00:06:36.680> looks<00:06:36.710> like<00:06:36.979> the<00:06:37.190> ipad<00:06:37.790> 3g

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 
so once again it looks like the ipad 3g

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.750 
so once again it looks like the ipad 3g
it's<00:06:38.210> just<00:06:38.360> a<00:06:38.449> little<00:06:38.720> faster<00:06:39.430> let's<00:06:40.430> do<00:06:40.639> the

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:40.760 
it's just a little faster let's do the

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:53.129 
it's just a little faster let's do the
amazon<00:06:41.150> store

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:53.139 

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:55.710 

once<00:06:53.710> again<00:06:53.830> the<00:06:54.099> iPad<00:06:54.430> 3GS<00:06:54.909> knows<00:06:55.120> we<00:06:55.330> faster

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 
once again the iPad 3GS knows we faster

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.390 
once again the iPad 3GS knows we faster
here<00:06:55.960> while<00:06:56.139> the<00:06:56.349> tethered<00:06:56.740> iPad<00:06:57.099> is<00:06:57.189> still

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 
here while the tethered iPad is still

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.100 
here while the tethered iPad is still
loading<00:07:00.060> well<00:07:01.060> that<00:07:01.330> was<00:07:01.419> a<00:07:01.449> big<00:07:01.659> difference

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.110 
loading well that was a big difference

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.050 
loading well that was a big difference
that<00:07:02.259> took<00:07:02.439> quite<00:07:02.680> a<00:07:02.710> bit<00:07:03.039> longer<00:07:03.250> to<00:07:03.550> load<00:07:03.759> and

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:04.060 
that took quite a bit longer to load and

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.909 
that took quite a bit longer to load and
once<00:07:04.270> again<00:07:04.360> it<00:07:04.840> might<00:07:05.139> be<00:07:05.289> some<00:07:05.500> latency

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 
once again it might be some latency

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:07.399 
once again it might be some latency
issue<00:07:06.129> or<00:07:06.400> some<00:07:06.610> hiccup<00:07:06.939> with<00:07:07.180> the

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:07.409 
issue or some hiccup with the

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:10.260 
issue or some hiccup with the
performance<00:07:08.409> of<00:07:08.500> the<00:07:08.590> Wi-Fi<00:07:09.069> on<00:07:09.550> the<00:07:09.610> iPhone

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:10.270 
performance of the Wi-Fi on the iPhone

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.510 
performance of the Wi-Fi on the iPhone
again<00:07:10.479> looks<00:07:10.689> like<00:07:10.810> the<00:07:10.930> iPad<00:07:11.289> 3G<00:07:11.889> is<00:07:12.189> still

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:12.520 
again looks like the iPad 3G is still

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.149 
again looks like the iPad 3G is still
performing<00:07:12.909> better<00:07:13.210> than<00:07:13.360> the<00:07:13.719> iPad<00:07:14.680> tip<00:07:15.039> it

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:15.159 
performing better than the iPad tip it

00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:17.760 
performing better than the iPad tip it
to<00:07:15.250> an<00:07:15.370> iPhone<00:07:15.759> in<00:07:16.030> real-world<00:07:16.479> tests<00:07:17.169> so

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:17.770 
to an iPhone in real-world tests so

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.730 
to an iPhone in real-world tests so
although<00:07:18.099> we<00:07:18.310> saw<00:07:18.550> no<00:07:18.819> real<00:07:19.719> clear<00:07:20.229> winner<00:07:20.530> in

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:20.740 
although we saw no real clear winner in

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.499 
although we saw no real clear winner in
terms<00:07:20.889> of<00:07:21.039> speed<00:07:21.310> tests<00:07:21.699> and<00:07:21.849> in<00:07:22.000> many<00:07:22.120> cases

00:07:22.499 --> 00:07:22.509 
terms of speed tests and in many cases

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:24.990 
terms of speed tests and in many cases
we<00:07:22.659> saw<00:07:22.900> the<00:07:22.960> tethered<00:07:23.439> ipad<00:07:23.860> winning<00:07:24.340> it

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.000 
we saw the tethered ipad winning it

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.850 
we saw the tethered ipad winning it
looks<00:07:25.210> like<00:07:25.360> overall<00:07:25.690> the<00:07:25.990> ipad<00:07:26.289> 3g<00:07:26.500> still

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:26.860 
looks like overall the ipad 3g still

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.059 
looks like overall the ipad 3g still
outperforms<00:07:27.550> it<00:07:28.379> there<00:07:29.379> there<00:07:29.740> are<00:07:29.889> some

00:07:30.059 --> 00:07:30.069 
outperforms it there there are some

00:07:30.069 --> 00:07:32.969 
outperforms it there there are some
advantages<00:07:30.610> to<00:07:30.639> using<00:07:31.000> a<00:07:31.620> ipad<00:07:32.620> that<00:07:32.740> thinks

00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:32.979 
advantages to using a ipad that thinks

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:34.860 
advantages to using a ipad that thinks
it's<00:07:33.129> connected<00:07:33.759> to<00:07:33.849> a<00:07:33.879> Wi-Fi<00:07:34.270> network<00:07:34.300> and<00:07:34.810> we

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:34.870 
it's connected to a Wi-Fi network and we

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.800 
it's connected to a Wi-Fi network and we
saw<00:07:35.020> that<00:07:35.080> with<00:07:35.289> youtube<00:07:35.740> and<00:07:36.009> some<00:07:36.310> other

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:36.810 
saw that with youtube and some other

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.909 
saw that with youtube and some other
content<00:07:37.810> that<00:07:38.020> otherwise<00:07:38.440> can't<00:07:38.800> be

Netflix<00:07:41.169> may<00:07:41.860> indeed<00:07:42.190> work<00:07:42.580> if<00:07:42.849> you're

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:43.000 
Netflix may indeed work if you're

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.230 
Netflix may indeed work if you're
tethering<00:07:43.449> to<00:07:43.870> your<00:07:44.020> iPhone<00:07:44.500> I<00:07:45.090> should<00:07:46.090> also

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.240 
tethering to your iPhone I should also

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.990 
tethering to your iPhone I should also
point<00:07:46.360> out<00:07:46.690> that<00:07:46.900> the<00:07:47.080> 3G<00:07:47.650> on<00:07:47.770> the<00:07:47.919> iPad<00:07:48.400> has

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:49.000 
point out that the 3G on the iPad has

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.179 
point out that the 3G on the iPad has
much<00:07:49.240> better<00:07:49.419> reception<00:07:50.020> so<00:07:50.319> if<00:07:50.409> you<00:07:50.529> want<00:07:50.740> 3G

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:51.189 
much better reception so if you want 3G

00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:53.550 
much better reception so if you want 3G
performance<00:07:52.000> in<00:07:52.210> weaker<00:07:52.779> signal<00:07:53.229> areas

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.050 
performance in weaker signal areas
you're<00:07:53.740> better<00:07:53.919> off<00:07:53.979> carrying<00:07:54.580> the<00:07:54.699> iPad

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:55.060 
you're better off carrying the iPad

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.779 
you're better off carrying the iPad
instead<00:07:55.870> of<00:07:55.960> relying<00:07:56.229> on<00:07:56.409> your<00:07:56.800> iPhone<00:07:57.460> to

00:07:57.779 --> 00:07:57.789 
instead of relying on your iPhone to

00:07:57.789 --> 00:08:00.659 
instead of relying on your iPhone to
tether<00:07:58.440> once<00:07:59.440> again<00:07:59.650> this<00:07:59.770> Detroit<00:08:00.129> bar<00:08:00.490> with

tether once again this Detroit bar with

00:08:00.669 --> 00:08:03.330 
tether once again this Detroit bar with
the<00:08:00.759> test<00:08:00.969> of<00:08:01.090> the<00:08:01.180> 3G<00:08:01.539> speeds<00:08:01.900> of<00:08:02.199> the<00:08:02.620> ipad<00:08:03.039> 3g
