00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
ending to the trilogy and then some side

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.740 
ending to the trilogy and then some side
story<00:03:28.680> comes<00:03:28.980> along<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.519> kind<00:03:29.909> of<00:03:30.030> smashes<00:03:30.599> it

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.309 
of bodies aboard a spaceship I just
think<00:03:55.500> it's<00:03:55.620> pretty<00:03:55.680> dumb<00:03:56.159> also<00:03:57.120> if<00:03:57.540> you<00:03:58.079> had

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
think it's pretty dumb also if you had

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.490 
think it's pretty dumb also if you had
