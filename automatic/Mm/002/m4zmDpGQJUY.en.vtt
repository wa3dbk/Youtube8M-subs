00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:11.190
 chemical saleh this new video for 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.670
 present yourself in game for the maps 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.900
 adventures or even taste map 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.619
 this game is very simple 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:24.660
 the single and unique main objective is 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.939
 arrivara giu the second is not to die 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.330
 obviously then he says with goal is 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.340
 optional because it also depends on the 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.329
 stop below and put it to empty for 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.730
 comfort then we start immediately as yes 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.510
 it just makes you see those 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:46.620
 holes with the activation of a button 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.899
 a lever preferably button yes 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.110
 will activate a series of vertex circuits 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.320
 that pistons will activate there and 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.210
 they will make this water come down 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:05.060
 will form a path as prescribed by you 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:08.310
 in which the user or anyone plays 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.369
 will have to travel to get to the point 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.500
 of destination 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:16.080
 now I've done this very difficult 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.090
 in short, to do it you need to have 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.240
 in fact, many tricks have been put into it 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.049
 a life and I leave you with discretion 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.890
 if you don't believe it 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:31.009
 I'll put a video here at the top left 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:33.720
 to show that it is possible to do so 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:37.820
 however it seems a bullshit but me 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.770
 I must say that if you put the right timing 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:45.149
 a thing will come a thing truly 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:49.350
 difficult now I'll show you a moment 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.460
 what circuits do i use to make 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.939
 this circuit is used 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:58.259
 simply a memory night with 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:00.119
 automatic red hat how it works in 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.460
 this case I'll use a lever though 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.850
 we fixing to pretend it's a 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.850
 button 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.860
 combative as you see by activating this 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.430
 it deactivates attracts this which goes 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.440
 activate all circuits but for i 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.050
 Pistons now don't worry about everyone 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.420
 from this rule used because 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.480
 maybe many more files I have 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.220
 made only for what they are more so 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:31.490
 disabled personal wheelchair covers 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.900
 simply so that even a 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.450
 simple user can go here 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.510
 maybe destroy links are here 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.020
 and take the path that takes 70 years then 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:45.020
 also selecting time seen anyway 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:49.910
 save works like this then when this 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:51.380
 this torch is turned off at this one 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.810
 but not only activates the one you live 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.989
 pistons also activates this that with gods 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.590
 peter that delay the signal at the end 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:03.620
 they come here and reject everything 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:06.980
 obviously is deactivated is a 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.290
 very simple circuit most 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.130
 of the material crisis and network there is it does for 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:16.100
 survival will be more especially for the 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:22.299
 peter but otherwise does not play a mega one 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:23.720
 so abnormal the use of 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:29.000
 materials 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:32.720
 now I'll make some a little there is a 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.670
 little trick on how you should 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.829
 do it because I built it here 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.380
 there was the floor 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:44.860
 but later I noticed and if one does the 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:49.190
 cunning active and going to position 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:52.220
 directly in the last one in the last one 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.920
 water column is the so without risale 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.310
 even to route around thinking about it 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:02.030
 then I said but there are only two 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.670
 ways to get by or do it like me 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.239
 recreate the void and reach up to one 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:12.140
 rock band and empty character so that 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:14.860
 one cannot walk on the ground for 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:18.250
 go and put it down 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.410
 or make a band of signs 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.450
 because as many of you will know i 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.060
 signs block the water anyway you do 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.810
 a band of signs and then so that 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:32.410
 the water does not pass but the player passes 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:39.930
 when khyber pass and here you can put yourself 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:39.930
 of campini and anyway 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:53.139
 and with so as to make a circuit like this 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:05:00.850
 that when one clicks falls 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:05:04.600
 then not only me and so after you go to 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.310
 maybe teleport here thanks to 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.580
 all for looking and next 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.580
 video
