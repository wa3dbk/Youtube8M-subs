00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.760 
alright so this is another one this one
could<00:01:49.750> be<00:01:49.780> a<00:01:50.640> defense<00:01:51.640> or<00:01:51.880> post<00:01:52.439> bomb<00:01:53.439> planted

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
could be a defense or post bomb planted

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.039 
could be a defense or post bomb planted
on<00:01:54.159> offense<00:01:54.700> and<00:01:54.909> you're<00:01:55.479> going<00:01:55.630> to<00:01:55.689> utilize

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
on offense and you're going to utilize

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.169 
on offense and you're going to utilize
this<00:01:56.380> one<00:01:56.590> here<00:01:56.829> very<00:01:57.340> very<00:01:57.490> hard<00:01:57.789> to<00:01:57.909> see<00:01:58.060> the

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
this one here very very hard to see the

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:59.819 
this one here very very hard to see the
laser<00:01:58.329> line<00:01:58.630> and<00:01:58.840> it<00:01:59.200> doesn't<00:01:59.530> have<00:01:59.679> to

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
laser line and it doesn't have to

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.230 
laser line and it doesn't have to
trigger<00:02:00.100> right<00:02:00.369> away<00:02:00.640> as<00:02:00.820> long<00:02:01.060> as<00:02:01.149> they

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
trigger right away as long as they

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.480 
trigger right away as long as they
trigger<00:02:01.539> it<00:02:01.630> somewhat<00:02:02.079> close<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.890> vehicle

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
trigger it somewhat close the vehicle

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.840 
trigger it somewhat close the vehicle
explosion<00:02:04.299> will<00:02:04.479> amplify<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:06.189> damage<00:02:06.609> done

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
explosion will amplify the damage done

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.639 
explosion will amplify the damage done
by<00:02:06.909> that<00:02:07.270> claim<00:02:07.539> or<00:02:07.780> and<00:02:07.960> they<00:02:08.350> don't<00:02:08.440> actually

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
by that claim or and they don't actually

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.350 
by that claim or and they don't actually
have<00:02:08.950> to<00:02:08.979> be<00:02:09.220> near<00:02:09.460> they<00:02:09.670> can<00:02:09.819> be<00:02:09.940> somewhat

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
have to be near they can be somewhat

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.270 
have to be near they can be somewhat
almost<00:02:10.869> past<00:02:11.110> that<00:02:11.380> vehicle<00:02:11.770> and<00:02:12.040> it<00:02:12.250> will

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
almost past that vehicle and it will

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.940 
almost past that vehicle and it will
still<00:02:12.670> kill<00:02:12.940> them<00:02:13.150> so<00:02:13.810> again<00:02:14.140> remember<00:02:14.170> try

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
still kill them so again remember try

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.190 
still kill them so again remember try
and<00:02:14.980> use<00:02:15.370> vehicles<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:16.120> your<00:02:16.240> advantage<00:02:16.540> that

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
and use vehicles to your advantage that

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.290 
and use vehicles to your advantage that
one<00:02:17.440> they're<00:02:17.650> angled<00:02:18.070> across<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.820> rear<00:02:19.120> of

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
now of course this one predominantly

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.680 
now of course this one predominantly
used<00:02:25.560> for<00:02:25.890> offense<00:02:26.880> remember<00:02:27.330> that<00:02:27.450> first

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
used for offense remember that first

facing into where towards where they're

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.309

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
going to actually be walking you want to

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.570 
going to actually be walking you want to
make<00:02:34.440> sure<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.739> do<00:02:34.920> that<00:02:34.950> because<00:02:35.250> if<00:02:35.489> you

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
make sure you do that because if you

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.550 
make sure you do that because if you
angle<00:02:35.940> it<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.209> wrong<00:02:36.360> way<00:02:36.420> if<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.260> angle<00:02:37.470> it

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
angle it the wrong way if you angle it

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.870 
angle it the wrong way if you angle it
towards<00:02:37.950> where<00:02:38.310> they're<00:02:38.459> actually<00:02:38.550> coming

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
towards where they're actually coming

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.970 
towards where they're actually coming
from<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.750> mess<00:02:40.019> out<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.230> lot<00:02:40.530> on<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.769> blast

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
from you mess out a lot on the blast

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.650 
from you mess out a lot on the blast
radius<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.580> they<00:02:41.700> can<00:02:41.849> usually<00:02:41.970> jump<00:02:42.390> through

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
radius and they can usually jump through

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.220 
radius and they can usually jump through
now<00:02:43.620> this<00:02:43.830> one<00:02:44.010> here<00:02:44.250> obviously<00:02:44.870> again<00:02:45.870> I<00:02:45.900> mean

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
now this one here obviously again I mean

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.710 
now this one here obviously again I mean
you<00:02:46.800> have<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.130> think<00:02:47.700> about<00:02:47.849> like<00:02:48.209> if<00:02:48.450> you've

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
you have to think about like if you've

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.150 
you have to think about like if you've
gone<00:02:48.900> through<00:02:49.110> here<00:02:49.230> I've<00:02:49.319> used<00:02:49.530> this<00:02:49.709> one<00:02:49.920> for

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
gone through here I've used this one for

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.460 
gone through here I've used this one for
offense<00:02:50.550> and<00:02:50.700> defense<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.390> depends<00:02:52.080> on<00:02:52.170> how

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
offense and defense it depends on how

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.009 
offense and defense it depends on how
the<00:02:53.220> other<00:02:53.430> team<00:02:53.700> is<00:02:53.850> playing<00:02:54.090> if<00:02:54.450> you're<00:02:54.870> able

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
the other team is playing if you're able

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.479 
the other team is playing if you're able
to<00:02:55.260> get<00:02:55.500> into<00:02:56.900> be<00:02:57.900> for<00:02:58.500> this<00:02:58.590> particular

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
to get into be for this particular

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.059 
to get into be for this particular
instance<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.120> they're<00:03:01.049> all<00:03:01.200> over<00:03:01.380> at<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.769> or

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
instance and they're all over at a or

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.530 
instance and they're all over at a or
you<00:03:02.400> know<00:03:02.580> that<00:03:02.819> some<00:03:03.000> of<00:03:03.030> them<00:03:03.150> are<00:03:03.299> up<00:03:03.390> in

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
you know that some of them are up in

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.000 
you know that some of them are up in
that<00:03:03.630> building<00:03:03.959> then<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.440> claymore<00:03:04.860> is<00:03:04.890> a

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
that building then that claymore is a

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.830 
that building then that claymore is a
really<00:03:05.310> good<00:03:05.430> placement<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.360> other<00:03:06.540> one<00:03:06.720> that

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
really good placement the other one that

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.080 
really good placement the other one that
I<00:03:06.870> prefer<00:03:07.410> actually<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.220> this<00:03:08.580> one<00:03:08.790> is<00:03:08.910> good

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
I prefer actually and this one is good

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.180 
I prefer actually and this one is good
offense<00:03:09.569> defense<00:03:09.780> offense<00:03:10.530> if<00:03:10.709> you've<00:03:10.830> gotten

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
offense defense offense if you've gotten

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.949 
offense defense offense if you've gotten
deepen<00:03:11.519> your<00:03:11.549> teams<00:03:12.090> in<00:03:12.269> there<00:03:12.450> but

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
deepen your teams in there but

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.199 
deepen your teams in there but
definitely<00:03:13.500> defense<00:03:14.010> if<00:03:14.640> they're<00:03:14.880> trying<00:03:15.150> to

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
definitely defense if they're trying to

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.309 
definitely defense if they're trying to
come<00:03:15.360> up<00:03:15.390> here<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.690> then<00:03:15.900> you<00:03:15.989> don't<00:03:16.110> have<00:03:16.140> to

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
come up here and then you don't have to

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.020 
come up here and then you don't have to
really<00:03:16.500> worry<00:03:16.590> about<00:03:16.830> that<00:03:17.160> that's<00:03:17.819> a<00:03:18.000> very

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
really worry about that that's a very

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.750 
really worry about that that's a very
effective<00:03:18.569> Claymore<00:03:19.080> right<00:03:19.260> there<00:03:19.730> make<00:03:20.730> sure

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
effective Claymore right there make sure

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.270 
effective Claymore right there make sure
practice<00:03:21.660> placing<00:03:22.290> those<00:03:22.590> claymores<00:03:23.069> down

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
practice placing those claymores down

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.699 
practice placing those claymores down
facing<00:03:23.880> slightly<00:03:24.480> outward<00:03:25.019> so<00:03:25.200> you<00:03:25.260> get<00:03:25.530> that

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
facing slightly outward so you get that

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.550 
facing slightly outward so you get that
those<00:03:26.070> that<00:03:26.670> proper<00:03:27.090> 45-degree<00:03:27.900> angle<00:03:28.230> the

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
those that proper 45-degree angle the

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.729 
those that proper 45-degree angle the
blast<00:03:28.950> radius<00:03:29.130> and<00:03:29.549> how<00:03:29.640> you<00:03:30.440> angle<00:03:31.440> it<00:03:31.530> is

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
blast radius and how you angle it is

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.970 
blast radius and how you angle it is
very<00:03:32.040> important<00:03:32.579> now<00:03:33.480> this<00:03:33.630> one<00:03:33.840> here<00:03:34.170> again<00:03:34.950> I

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
very important now this one here again I

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.190 
very important now this one here again I
