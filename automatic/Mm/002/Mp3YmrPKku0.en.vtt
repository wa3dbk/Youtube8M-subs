00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.440
 Welcome to Modest Tastes Cuisine 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.200
 we will share a fish recipe in this section 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.680
 "The mackerel" 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.960
 But let's take a look at the list of materials before you want 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.040
 8 pieces of medium size horse mackerel 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.320
 3 pieces of medium size tomatoes 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.600
 4 cloves of garlic 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.600
 2 bay leaves 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.400
 1 coffee cup with olive oil 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.200
 1 teaspoon black pepper 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.000
 and salt 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.120
 For the above; 10-15 branches of parsley 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.800
 After the list of materials ... 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.120
 Let's start the process by chopping our garlics 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.600
 mixing bowl 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.760
 we cut the tomatoes into thin cubes 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.760
 1 coffee cup on olive oil ... 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.480
 adding some salt and pepper 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.480
 we confuse 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 enough 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 now we are getting our trustee ... 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.320
 and a little olive oil 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.080
 headwashing weavers 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.880
 we leave half of the material we prepare on 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.200
 the rest of the mackerel in the same way 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.240
 left over the remaining materials 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.440
 bay leaves to remove the smell of a little tear 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.080
 and placing them on the edges 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.520
 we are closing the cover of our trustee ... 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.600
 keep in refrigerator for at least 1 hour 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.080
 yes our fish has been rested for 1 hour, watered 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.440
 Now, before we put it on the fast fire 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.560
 to cook on a 10-minute quick-fire 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.360
 will look after the water if necessary add 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.120
 and we'll shorten 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.880
 10 minutes have passed, we probably won't have to add water 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.320
 watered, now bring to half fire 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.040
 and cooking for half an hour 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.440
 Yes, half an hour 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.200
 now we're looking, yes cooked 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.080
 close the cover again 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.080
 and rest after 10-15 minutes 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.800
 yes our mackerel moth 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.360
 now we can offer service now 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.720
 Let's take it 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 Let's get another one 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.960
 sprinkle some parsley on 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.480
 a few slices of lemon ... 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.600
 service 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.680
