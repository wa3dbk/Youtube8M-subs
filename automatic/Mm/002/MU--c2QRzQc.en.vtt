by a consumer they were I guess in a
storage<00:01:18.119> facility<00:01:18.479> for<00:01:19.229> some<00:01:19.470> time<00:01:19.650> these<00:01:20.040> are

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250

console only and I'm asking to 30 I know
it<00:02:25.980> seems<00:02:26.189> steep<00:02:26.430> but<00:02:26.639> like<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:26.879> said<00:02:26.939> these<00:02:27.299> are

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
it seems steep but like I said these are

it seems steep but like I said these are

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
newer than some Falcons which is really

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.330 
newer than some Falcons which is really
remarkable<00:02:30.629> to<00:02:31.019> be<00:02:31.049> honest<00:02:31.500> but<00:02:31.980> they're

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
remarkable to be honest but they're

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.339 
remarkable to be honest but they're
late-model<00:02:32.609> Zephyrs<00:02:33.120> they<00:02:33.359> still<00:02:33.900> have<00:02:34.079> the

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
late-model Zephyrs they still have the

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.979 
late-model Zephyrs they still have the

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
first gen CB v sync which is better to

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.089 
first gen CB v sync which is better to
be<00:02:37.079> honest<00:02:37.349> because<00:02:37.500> it's<00:02:37.620> copper<00:02:37.980> it

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
be honest because it's copper it

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.649 
be honest because it's copper it
conducts<00:02:38.430> better<00:02:38.609> than<00:02:38.819> the<00:02:38.939> second<00:02:39.239> aluminum

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
conducts better than the second aluminum

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.770 
conducts better than the second aluminum
one<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.799> has<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.159> extended<00:02:41.549> heat<00:02:42.269> pipe<00:02:42.510> on

one and it has the extended heat pipe on

one and it has the extended heat pipe on
the<00:02:42.840> second<00:02:43.260> gen<00:02:43.379> GPU<00:02:43.889> so<00:02:44.730> that<00:02:44.819> being<00:02:45.030> said

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
the second gen GPU so that being said

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.179 
the second gen GPU so that being said
they're<00:02:46.139> still<00:02:46.409> Zephyrs<00:02:46.739> which<00:02:46.889> is<00:02:47.010> why<00:02:47.099> I'm

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:47.189 
they're still Zephyrs which is why I'm

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:48.619 
they're still Zephyrs which is why I'm
not<00:02:47.280> going<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.489> charge<00:02:47.669> so<00:02:47.849> much<00:02:48.030> for<00:02:48.239> Falcons

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
not going to charge so much for Falcons

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.770 
not going to charge so much for Falcons
but<00:02:49.010> 2:30<00:02:50.010> shift<00:02:50.609> is<00:02:50.819> reasonable<00:02:51.389> in<00:02:51.540> my

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
but 2:30 shift is reasonable in my

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.110 
but 2:30 shift is reasonable in my
opinion<00:02:52.199> for<00:02:52.409> what<00:02:52.439> you're<00:02:52.650> getting<00:02:52.949> so<00:02:53.120> let

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
opinion for what you're getting so let

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.740 
opinion for what you're getting so let
me<00:02:54.209> just<00:02:54.359> turn<00:02:55.169> this<00:02:55.230> one<00:02:55.439> on<00:02:55.530> real<00:02:55.709> fast

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
me just turn this one on real fast

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:09.490 
me just turn this one on real fast
grab<00:02:57.750> controller

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.720 

um<00:03:11.110> I'm<00:03:12.110> not<00:03:12.170> sure<00:03:12.470> which<00:03:12.740> dashboard<00:03:13.280> this<00:03:13.370> /<00:03:13.700> -

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
um I'm not sure which dashboard this / -

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.580 
um I'm not sure which dashboard this / -
this<00:03:14.060> might<00:03:14.240> be<00:03:14.270> 13<00:03:14.780> 1<00:03:14.930> 4<00:03:15.140> 6

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
this might be 13 1 4 6

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.040 
this might be 13 1 4 6
let<00:03:16.370> me<00:03:16.430> check<00:03:16.580> her<00:03:16.700> fast<00:03:16.940> I<00:03:17.240> don't<00:03:18.230> know<00:03:18.500> if

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
let me check her fast I don't know if

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.920 
let me check her fast I don't know if
yeah<00:03:21.050> 13<00:03:21.590> 1<00:03:21.710> 4<00:03:21.860> 6<00:03:22.070> put<00:03:22.340> all<00:03:22.430> updated<00:03:22.790> -<00:03:22.940> 13<00:03:23.300> 5<00:03:23.540> 9<00:03:23.750> 9

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
yeah 13 1 4 6 put all updated - 13 5 9 9

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.480 
yeah 13 1 4 6 put all updated - 13 5 9 9
before<00:03:24.110> I<00:03:24.290> send<00:03:24.530> it

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
before I send it

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.570 
before I send it
just<00:03:26.480> because<00:03:26.780> 30<00:03:27.080> time<00:03:27.320> 9<00:03:27.500> 9<00:03:27.620> came<00:03:27.890> out<00:03:28.100> while

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
just because 30 time 9 9 came out while

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.640 
just because 30 time 9 9 came out while
I've<00:03:28.790> already<00:03:29.060> had<00:03:29.209> these<00:03:29.360> JTAG<00:03:29.780> alright<00:03:30.470> so

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
I've already had these JTAG alright so

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.010 
I've already had these JTAG alright so
we've<00:03:30.770> got<00:03:30.920> X<00:03:31.130> DX<00:03:31.310> menu<00:03:31.730> on<00:03:31.940> the<00:03:32.150> first<00:03:32.360> one<00:03:35.020> the

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
we've got X DX menu on the first one the

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.979 
we've got X DX menu on the first one the
first<00:03:36.940> controller<00:03:38.800> is<00:03:39.800> Moses<00:03:40.989> the

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
first controller is Moses the

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.660 
first controller is Moses the
temperatures<00:03:42.440> are<00:03:42.680> going<00:03:42.980> to<00:03:43.130> be<00:03:43.220> extremely

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
temperatures are going to be extremely

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.520 
temperatures are going to be extremely
low<00:03:43.910> on<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:44.270> GPU<00:03:44.600> and<00:03:44.870> the<00:03:44.900> CPU<00:03:44.959> will<00:03:45.500> be

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
low on the GPU and the CPU will be

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.350 
low on the GPU and the CPU will be
reasonable<00:03:46.100> maybe<00:03:46.489> in<00:03:46.640> the<00:03:46.760> 60s<00:03:47.890> the<00:03:48.890> GPU<00:03:49.370> they

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
reasonable maybe in the 60s the GPU they

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.670 
reasonable maybe in the 60s the GPU they
helped<00:03:50.630> around<00:03:50.840> 50<00:03:51.320> all<00:03:51.530> three<00:03:52.430> of<00:03:52.550> them<00:03:53.680> the

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
helped around 50 all three of them the

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.510 
helped around 50 all three of them the
RAM<00:03:55.250> is<00:03:55.610> around<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:56.660> same<00:03:56.840> about<00:03:57.140> the<00:03:57.410> GPU<00:03:58.100> but

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
RAM is around the same about the GPU but

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.360 
RAM is around the same about the GPU but
the<00:03:58.640> CPU<00:03:58.820> is<00:03:59.480> a<00:03:59.780> little<00:04:00.050> bit<00:04:00.170> higher<00:04:00.350> which<00:04:01.220> is

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
the CPU is a little bit higher which is

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.250 
the CPU is a little bit higher which is
why<00:04:01.489> I<00:04:01.520> always<00:04:01.850> recommend<00:04:01.970> using<00:04:02.690> freestyle

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
why I always recommend using freestyle

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.280 
why I always recommend using freestyle
and<00:04:03.500> 100%<00:04:03.830> fan<00:04:04.160> speed<00:04:04.459> um<00:04:05.110> if<00:04:06.110> there's

and 100% fan speed um if there's

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.020 
and 100% fan speed um if there's
