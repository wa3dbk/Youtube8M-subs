00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.460
 beautiful alpine hills ancient forests 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.160
 and beautiful landscapes accompanied by beautiful 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.280
 melodies then you have to try

 high in fitur where you can rescue 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.320
 uncontrolled flames jump over 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.230
 terrifying ravines dodge rocks 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:22.470
 perform tricks on strings and live 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.970
 an amazing and original adventure 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.680
 Now it's interesting that a game 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.030
 agrees on the Peruvian theme with 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.650
 items for example the scarf 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.960
 yearning that you can see here that is super 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.400
 pretty as you see all the graphics as 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.010
 we wanted the objectives we would call 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.110
 then you call flames and you avoid them 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.610
 rocks that if not every rock if you touch 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.680
 any rock lose then if it is 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.680
 to be careful but generally between 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.920
 the practical the music for example that 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.750
 van wye jumps if it 's a way and 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.510
 we call coins is equal to two 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.220
 tumbling everywhere you relax 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.000
 after seeing everything finished and there's no 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.000
 many games that have 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.830
 wake up very early sometimes we are 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.500
 makes an alarm impossible it is no longer 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.690
 enough group that several of these 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.820
 neither are they while we can 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.270
 turn them off easily and keep sleeping 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:19.360
 Conventional alarms really do not 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.720
 they will not do anything, that's why we bring you 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.450
 alarm the solution for all those to 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.180
 who are stuck the sheets with 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.910
 this app you just have to register a place 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.950
 distant to your bed like the bathroom or a 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.830
 specific object that I forced you to 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.770
 stand up and leave your bedroom and 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.540
 when the alarm sounds in the morning 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.420
 you will have to go to the registered place and 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.610
 take a photo to disable the test 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:50.400
 this new option tries not to do 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.400
 trap and run back to your bed 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.879
 the legendary series of daliÃ¡n hunter 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.459
 returns in its fifth installment after stopping 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.560
 the demonic invasion in the kingdom 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.170
 the world is still shredded so 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.930
 now our hero seeks to avenge the 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.510
 yours in five desolate kingdoms and 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.849
 innumerable dungeons 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.069
 It's your turn to become the greatest 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.549
 that makes rewards for all 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.549
 time 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.599
 now this game similar to the devil 3 in 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.220
 which you have to hit tartar by 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.780
 all sides and kill people but the 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.790
 kind of these invisible walls that do not 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.260
 I understand them very well but then 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.000
 is being adapted prime after a lot of 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.840

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.340

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.380
 those sections which is more us 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.180
 what has to be the tap tap tap tap 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.020
 the funny thing is not bad but in 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.610
 general is a a generic cap is 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.110
 free but you have to buy inside 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.490
