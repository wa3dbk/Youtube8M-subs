00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.890
 or everyone's home here the south that is and 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.269
 we are a new video of gta 5 les 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.880
 I bring an informative video about what 

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:11.490
 if they have the title there and it's about the 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.600
 flamethrower because it has leaked a 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.210
 image that you will be seeing right now 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.890
 on the screen it's ok and also on the 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.359
 response to the description so that you 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.939
 metais in the link the link is better 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.339
 authentic then as you can see there is and 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.740
 3D modeling of the flamethrower as 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:28.259
 you know already uploaded a video about 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.239
 cars some modeled in 3d that 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.859
 because they took what they do to 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.680
 rummage through the game files and 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.410
 Then let me show you that they took out 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.199
 modeled in 3d because of some parts 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.390
 of new cars that in the future 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:44.940
 they will include voucher so this as the 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.219
 true it looks much clearer because it 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.710
 they see flamethrowers like the flamethrower 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.149
 it looks whole you do not see a part of the 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.969
 flamethrower because if it did not look 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.789
 a part we would not take out that it was 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.980
 a flamethrower and I do not know a piece of a 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.449
 weapon that we did not know what it is so 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.370
 well it looks perfectly that it is a 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.769
 flamethrower the truth flamethrower me 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.750
 I missed very much in this gta, it's worth 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.700
 as you already know in gta san andreas 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.600
 I was in flamethrowers and the truth is that 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.160
 it was a pass in gta 4 I think it's not 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.670
 we want to remember that it is not valid but 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.320
 with a musician that I know you can put 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.840
 I am lately as you know I am 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.850
 bundled in with gta 4 modes you have 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.830
 a lot on it and many on the channel already 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.900
 I will bring on flamethrowers water tanks 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.420
 the series is never going to end because there 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.130
 million monk every time I'm with more 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.250
 I want you to leave 75 for pc 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.960
 so what's said following what 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.990
 same the image on the screen is about 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.800
 of the flamethrower the truth is that a weapon 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.570
 that I love already in hackers worth 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.780
 the hackers that like cork ibiza is worth 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.170
 in that a video went up it's worth but that 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:54.509
 Well, through a mod or something like that you can see 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.580
 direction in the silver obviously 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.530
 you could make your weapons well 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.979
 shoot fire be like a flamethrower 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.080
 then there was a guy or a certain 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.539
 What type of weapon do you shoot? 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.759
 threw fire is worth that that fire 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.890
 Well, where did I get it from? 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.610
 of those game files because the 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.830
 gta hackers 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.170
 they do not invent things and they put it 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.580
 it's not like the gta 4 is worth but for 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.110
 be a mod 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.210
 of gta 5 you have to take things out of the 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.800
 game and put them in your own game 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.730
 ok you can not invent it so 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.069
 how it arrives 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.690
 as you have already seen in the 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.400
 channel you have uploaded a video then 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.690
 those guns fire fire and that 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.190
 fire was already the game files 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.760
 so that flamethrower was already 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.799
 thought by rockstar for quite a while 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.080
 time so I love already that 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:44.629
 add this and the best because the snow 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.580
 along with the update of the 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.500
 bank robbery that we were already 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.540
 demonstrated balls of the wait already 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.829
 that's that update so good 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.989
 you also have other information about 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:58.220
 it masks it well I 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.660
 found a not a file a 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.220
 name of a file within the page 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.829
 of social club 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.950
 that he puts to create his own masks 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:09.379
 so many new things I will say 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.030
 also little things that come out such and 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:13.430
 as they go out I always want 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:18.250
 find out about the latest from gta 5 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:21.379
 information that I believe is at least 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.760
 60 percent sure, I'm not going to 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.950
 invent or I will bring anything here 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.420
