water as opposed to about 10 or 11 hit

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.020 
water as opposed to about 10 or 11 hit
with<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.840> upgraded<00:01:19.320> whip<00:01:19.680> they<00:01:20.580> take<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> long

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
with the upgraded whip they take a long

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.240 
with the upgraded whip they take a long
they<00:01:21.450> take<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.659> lot<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:21.900> time<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.409> defeat<00:01:22.799> but

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
they take a lot of time to defeat but

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.070 
they take a lot of time to defeat but
whenever<00:01:23.820> you've<00:01:24.119> got<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.420> water<00:01:24.600> they<00:01:24.900> go

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
whenever you've got the water they go

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.050 
whenever you've got the water they go
down<00:01:25.290> very<00:01:25.560> easily<00:01:25.710> into<00:01:26.310> morphing<00:01:26.729> coal<00:01:26.909> oil

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
down very easily into morphing coal oil

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.120 
down very easily into morphing coal oil
by<00:01:27.360> melting<00:01:27.600> down<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:28.200> since<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.740> holy<00:01:28.860> water

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
by melting down so since the holy water

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.499 
by melting down so since the holy water
makes<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.520> way<00:01:29.670> too<00:01:29.729> easy<00:01:29.909> I'm<00:01:30.119> gonna<00:01:30.240> switch

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
makes it way too easy I'm gonna switch

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.330 
makes it way too easy I'm gonna switch
up<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.869> X<00:01:31.020> beside<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.619> didn't<00:01:31.829> use<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.159> hex

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
up to the X beside I didn't use the hex

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.130 
up to the X beside I didn't use the hex
ever<00:01:32.610> since<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.090> first<00:01:33.329> level<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.840> game

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
ever since the first level of the game

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.440 
ever since the first level of the game
so<00:01:34.740> it's<00:01:34.890> about<00:01:35.100> time<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.579> get<00:01:35.670> used<00:01:36.090> back

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
so it's about time that I get used back

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.010 
so it's about time that I get used back
to<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.900> whole<00:01:37.170> good<00:01:37.439> old<00:01:37.619> tool<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.310> trade

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
to the whole good old tool of the trade

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.530 
to the whole good old tool of the trade
the<00:01:40.020> hexes<00:01:40.439> uses<00:01:40.950> are<00:01:41.159> very<00:01:41.520> powerful<00:01:41.820> they

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
the hexes uses are very powerful they

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.749 
the hexes uses are very powerful they
