 federal in a few hours more beloved 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.680
 presents 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.800
 He had a bullet wound in his abdomen 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.500

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.989
 perforation of large intestine and the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.800
 small intestine was a 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.160
 immediate postoperative period and with good 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.080
 evolution so far what 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.480
 determines that being hemodynamically 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:58.700
 compensated is in a position to be 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:02.180
 transferred to the city ​​of buenos aires 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:05.360
 how many bullet impacts does one have 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.750
 alone but pierced the visors in several 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.750

 immediately 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.980
 during the installation there is no need to wait 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.200
 rather the infections that if this 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.570
 usually appears every time they are drilled 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.780
 the bowels and they overturn their 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.000
 content towards the abdominal cavity the 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.090
 hospital authorized the transfer 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.740
 the treating medical team authorizes the 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.120
 transfer if that place would take them to 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.150
 apparently to a capital clinic 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.630

 federal capital responds to some reason 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.100
 in particular, he has been told 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.400

 they have relatives to the city of rosario 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.000
 then if you are not at risk of relocation 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.730
 that they want to have a new place 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.250
 much closer where the 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.700
 family accompanying the evolution and 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.860
 patient is also the one who 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.960
 first you have requested so there 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:18.930
 policemen guarding the room where he is 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:23.520
 boarding school did the judge acting in 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.860
 the cause ordered the surveillance and 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.290
 patient protection in there 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.380
 he is also in detention 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:34.620
 no, the position has been lifted two years ago 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.260
 hours after the testimonial and 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.470
 then has raised let's say the 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.600
 detention and is in a position to be 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.319
 transferred speaks a statement 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.569
 testimonial they have taken 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:51.200
 a statement of it within the 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.909
 hospital cs city the patient is in 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.340
 condition was able to 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:59.060
 provide the statement so it was 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.510
 taken in the same hospital by the people 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.420
 who make the judge sign 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.459
 consequently the transfer towards good 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:10.290
 aires will have to be done with personnel 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:13.590
 police surveillance 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:18.090

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.270
 the hospital has been guaranteed let's say the

 obviously the patient's safety and 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:33.139
 the whole body treating professionals 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:37.370
 beyond this the patient has been 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:41.280
 released by the judge for having 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:44.699
 investigated everything that was the incident 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.759
 and from our point of view the 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:50.340
 patient would be able to 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:52.910
 be transferred to another institution 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.800
 to continue studying the postoperative period 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.630

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.210
 confrontation with shots inside the 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.560
 hospital and in the adjacencies there was some 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.040
 special security device 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:08.229

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.090
 discreet ridden by the police but 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.340
 discrete because usually the 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:16.289
 behavior of one of all the 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:19.870
 accompanying the patient has been 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:23.560
 adequate therefore there has not been 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:25.660
 need to armed as large 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.190
