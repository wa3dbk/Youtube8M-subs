00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.040

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.510
 a slide through installed 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.979
 the quasi shit if we are just 10 of delicate overwriting fonts 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.650
 or even now that flat were all installed in one go 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.010
 you can also jump on a red Limoux does not have to be like that here 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.400
 obviously here was the problem if everyone marks everything and 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.890
 Right click then you just have to make the option percent year now for that 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.460
 Open up because the whole show is the Market and AIM fonts viewer

 and in each window you have to click install 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.950
 the thing is shit 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.900
 and to show you how it works on that percent if now 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.760

 Why and there we are already and the demolition Indoors 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.049
 First of all, we have to go out to see Windows has hit 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.470
 bonus 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.550
 or Mundenheim reported

 Fuerth 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:24.999
 Copy 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.729
 and now let's have a look 

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:32.369
 Rank yes I have prepared animals were also listed 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:36.529

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:45.169
 at all - calculator afterwards can 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:48.639
 and then was to import the from Cologne without problems 

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:52.399
 as well as copies will be replaced by Marschner 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:58.789
 Pies very little bit 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.119
 make doing 

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:15.289
 around 181 also read but discussed 

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:19.389
 It's about percent and that's why you see it too 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.389
 a subject so large number of fonts 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:28.849
 even under linux is no problem at deuzsama what do Lemon too 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.399
 Secured windows phones 

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:34.719
 around which I have created myself here 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:38.549
 and in the copies we get over to the very early in the Lux 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:43.819
 So we'll see you guys stop right away 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.879
 so I would have more back and the Regiocast 

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:54.949
 What we are doing now is like going in ours 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.689
 a directory 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:01.709
 our online personal folder under for the looks 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:09.799
 and what he has to do now is Na and 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:11.769
 catch what 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.839
 that's exactly what we have to see that too 

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:18.609
 what they have to do now it's the first episode if then Lady 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.150
 she does not 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.440
 and also 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.440
 prohibited parties should now be displayed 

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:28.469
 it has a reason 

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:32.659
 it gives the home directory hidden files that drive all with one dot 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:37.219
 to the like by default Linux relationship so Ubuntu hidden in 

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:40.219
 contain these files 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:41.550
 and 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.970
 the reason why we want to do that now why want to see served 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.160
 We now have a hidden directory here 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.229
 long 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:57.889
 create a folder 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:00.889
 with the name 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.360
 so also the directory created it 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:13.710
 this directory 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.719
 Copy now 

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:18.339
 Fonts 

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:22.309

 Consumption and medium that you newer 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.530
 renew windows computer can plug in or whatever 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.180

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:50.949
 edit No find 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:57.699
 each disconnect now copied 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.439
 and now we have 

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:13.439
 Mederer 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.300

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:31.069
 call the word processor 

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:34.069

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:48.740
 all were now 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.439
 Outline font 

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:52.479

 with which all in sample offers loaded and stand 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.009
 the here as

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:14.219
 User now available 

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:18.649
 what we should do now is 

00:07:18.649 --> 00:07:20.770
 to be hidden 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:25.060
 Files do not hide investigators from all others 

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.360
 Directories what a research 

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.449

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:38.650
 that actually 

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:42.119
 not much heavier than percent 

00:07:42.119 --> 00:07:44.809
 probably just reject it 

00:07:44.809 --> 00:07:46.029
 Percent the war then already
