00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.509
 hello how are you welcome to dÃ­az in 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.669
 they want to know how to avoid getting fat 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:09.370
 during the holiday season and that the 

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:13.920
 turkey the romeritos do not take out a 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.920
 then eat these tips 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.570
 ah 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.400
 who can resist the food of 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.430
 the Christmas and New Year dinners the turkey 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.560
 the romeritos the good cod that they 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.820
 I say unfortunately most of these 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.640
 foods are high in carbohydrates 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.070
 sugars and fats what makes 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.230
 just a few weeks you have several kilos of 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.739
 more for that before you get stuck 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.180
 your grandmother's spaghetti considers this 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.949
 The worst thing you can do is stop 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.080
 eat or eat very little all day 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:47.300
 to save space for dinner 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.460
 never skip meals and do not get to 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.240
 dinner on an empty stomach because in 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.940
 place of a plate you are going to eat 3 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.400
 avoid eating between meals the cookie or 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.770
 the sweet cited will only be adding 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.040
 calories better opt for collations 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.660
 healthy as nuts or fruits but 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.290
 dinner avoids filling you with potatoes and 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.760
 refreshment that is what most fatten 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.070
 during dinner serves you rations 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.980
 small of each saucer and avoids a 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.130
 second round and if you can worth the 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.330
 saturated fats what you can eat without 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.860
 guilt is turkey 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.020
 It is rich in proteins and low in 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.560
 fat although the skin contains a lot 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.540
 fat so you do not eat it 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.170
 you can enjoy eating a dessert 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.329
 but do not repeat between each drink a drink 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.430
 glass of water and avoid sweet cocktails and 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.710
 creamy liquors also avoids 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.860
 high calorie mixers like juices 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.299
 and refreshments and something very important not 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.830
 stop exercising 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.929
 Here I show you a simple but 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.179
 effective routine to counteract the 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:51.140
 weight gain during the holidays that 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:53.700
 you can do 3 to 4 times a week 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.579
 stand on the side board supporting you 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.709
 on your right arm and raise your arm 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.270
 left while without wings and exsal at 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:02.009
 lower your arm below your torso 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.920
 until they arrive as far back as 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.649
 you can again raise and lower after 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.660
 repeat on the opposite side of the foot 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.910
 flex your legs a little and with 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.660
 hands in fist lean a little towards 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.790
 ahead 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.620
 now you jump to your right side and then 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.730
 make your left side as if you had 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.730
 that stretch an imaginary line 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.820
 lie on your back with the 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.070
 arms to the sides and legs 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.050
 flexed there against the abdomen and 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.550
 raise the hip then lift the 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.860
 left leg at an angle of 90 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.020
 degrees and hold the posture for 30 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.410
 seconds then repeat the same thing with the 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.410
 another leg 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.740
 Well, as you can see, this is also a very 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.500
 good time to get moving 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.690

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.790
