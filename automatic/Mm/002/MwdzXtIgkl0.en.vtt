00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.870
 Hey, guys, beauty line. 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.519
 welcome to the master channel and in this 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.120
 video we will talk about how 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.170
 complete the so-called bullet 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.599
 points 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.210
 this is certainly very easy to be 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.689
 complete is and you will get a 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.380
 very cool prize that j energy 90 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:29.699
 That's a very good weapon for here. 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.439
 class in icom is this gun for you to 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.739
 you can conquer there you have to 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.180
 first in class 1 and with 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.550
 select a hitler and there for example 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:44.489
 Here I will select the sv 98 you can 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:47.100
 use them and 98 or finally the other free and 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.649
 here for example the n96 which is also good 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.690
 I'm going to go with sp 98 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.690
 is that video here just to be able to give 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.969
 demonstration for you game but the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.559
 what happens you will have to do 50 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.500
 pounds with that rifle 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.600
 then you will get the 50 that the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.070
 Then you'll have to do three 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.510
 victories in conquest mode dominei chan 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.220
 playing normal I think you do not need 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.580
 necessarily be in the snipe class 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.799
 with one and I also did some testing and and 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:22.320
 It does not seem to work like this. 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.970
 To the head to stop being a sucker. 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.590
 The guy had half of his body to 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.030
 out of the window, right? 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.759
 so what I'm going to do I'm going to give a 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.979
 Pause it now in the video and I'll take it 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.590
 you to the screen to select the 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.860
 server to demonstrate how 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.720
 can a new power show them how it is 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.640
 does it take a map 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.480
 in this module is like that of mineirÃ£o 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.400
 may people 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.880
 one left just in time for us to 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:52.390
 can then complete the goal will be 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.860
 that takes to stay here ends video to only 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.460
 over one but I'm not one more and he 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.770
 dropped down 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.880

 server as here multiplayer saw 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.940
 bronze 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.740
