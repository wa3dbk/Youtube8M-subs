00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
as far as I can remember obviously makes

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.709 
as far as I can remember obviously makes
you<00:00:59.250> jump<00:00:59.780> much<00:01:00.780> higher<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.910> swim<00:01:02.910> fast<00:01:03.390> that

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.380 
basically he is attached to infinity
ward<00:02:51.720> he's<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.050> executive<00:02:52.560> producer<00:02:53.040> and

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
ward he's the executive producer and

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.000 
ward he's the executive producer and
basically<00:02:54.390> he<00:02:54.660> said<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:55.170> it's<00:02:55.320> kind<00:02:55.740> of<00:02:55.860> just

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
basically he said that it's kind of just

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.670 
basically he said that it's kind of just
being<00:02:56.280> kept<00:02:56.580> as<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.820> mystery<00:02:57.420> I<00:02:57.660> have<00:02:57.990> no<00:02:58.230> idea

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
being kept as a mystery I have no idea

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.040 
being kept as a mystery I have no idea
why<00:02:59.070> that<00:02:59.100> would<00:02:59.610> be<00:02:59.820> but<00:03:00.480> apparently<00:03:01.200> that<00:03:01.380> is

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
why that would be but apparently that is

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.840 
why that would be but apparently that is
correct<00:03:04.050> but<00:03:04.500> we're<00:03:05.280> going<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.460> have<00:03:05.520> to<00:03:05.730> wait

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
correct but we're going to have to wait

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.910 
correct but we're going to have to wait
for<00:03:06.150> a<00:03:06.180> hundred<00:03:06.420> percent<00:03:06.720> confirmation<00:03:07.620> so

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
for a hundred percent confirmation so

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.080 
for a hundred percent confirmation so
it's<00:03:08.820> it's<00:03:09.510> looking<00:03:10.230> very<00:03:10.500> very<00:03:11.490> likely<00:03:11.790> that

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
it's it's looking very very likely that

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.850 
it's it's looking very very likely that
it's<00:03:12.420> going<00:03:12.570> to<00:03:12.630> come<00:03:12.810> out<00:03:12.870> for<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.440> Wii<00:03:13.620> U
