channel I would like to do a quote may
be<00:00:07.109> an<00:00:07.290> unusual<00:00:07.440> image<00:00:08.429> quality<00:00:08.730> comparison

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
be an unusual image quality comparison

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.220 
be an unusual image quality comparison
but<00:00:10.650> it's<00:00:11.070> not<00:00:11.550> as<00:00:11.759> unusual<00:00:12.000> as<00:00:12.630> some<00:00:13.080> may

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
but it's not as unusual as some may

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.820 
but it's not as unusual as some may
think<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:14.009> it's<00:00:14.190> between<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.730> sony<00:00:15.830> a6000

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
think and it's between the sony a6000

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.870 
think and it's between the sony a6000
the<00:00:17.130> new<00:00:17.369> sony<00:00:18.199> a6000<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:20.100> let's<00:00:20.490> call<00:00:20.580> it

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
the new sony a6000 and the let's call it

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.470 
the new sony a6000 and the let's call it
old<00:00:21.029> Ricoh<00:00:21.930> GR<00:00:22.220> it's<00:00:23.220> not<00:00:23.430> quite<00:00:23.789> unusual

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
old Ricoh GR it's not quite unusual

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.279 
old Ricoh GR it's not quite unusual
because<00:00:24.920> technically<00:00:25.920> speaking<00:00:26.369> and

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
because technically speaking and

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.740 
because technically speaking and
therefore<00:00:28.289> I'm<00:00:28.380> not<00:00:28.410> really<00:00:28.890> testing<00:00:29.130> the

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
therefore I'm not really testing the

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.410 
therefore I'm not really testing the
a6000<00:00:30.750> as<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.929> camera<00:00:31.560> but<00:00:31.800> more<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.420> a6000

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
a6000 as a camera but more the a6000

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.930 
a6000 as a camera but more the a6000
with<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.809> 2.8<00:00:34.739> 20<00:00:35.130> millimeter<00:00:35.579> lens

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
with the 2.8 20 millimeter lens

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.540 
with the 2.8 20 millimeter lens
combination<00:00:36.780> because<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:38.040> an<00:00:38.160> aps-c

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
combination because this is an aps-c

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.369 
combination because this is an aps-c
size<00:00:39.059> sensor<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.920> 20<00:00:41.610> millimeter<00:00:42.059> lens<00:00:43.050> and

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
size sensor and a 20 millimeter lens and

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.880 
size sensor and a 20 millimeter lens and
this<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.160> an<00:00:44.309> aps-c<00:00:44.730> size<00:00:45.210> sensor<00:00:45.239> on<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.500> reco

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
this is an aps-c size sensor on the reco

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.869 
this is an aps-c size sensor on the reco
with<00:00:47.460> an<00:00:47.670> 18<00:00:48.180> point<00:00:48.780> 3<00:00:49.289> millimeter<00:00:49.860> 2.8<00:00:50.640> lens

with an 18 point 3 millimeter 2.8 lens

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.770 
with an 18 point 3 millimeter 2.8 lens
in<00:00:51.180> both<00:00:51.390> both<00:00:51.809> cases<00:00:52.050> now<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:52.860> did<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.370> because

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
in both both cases now I did it because

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.060 
in both both cases now I did it because
for<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.989> use<00:00:55.289> I'm<00:00:56.270> doing<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.449> these<00:00:58.070> two

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
for the use I'm doing of these two

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.920 
for the use I'm doing of these two
cameras<00:00:59.640> they're<00:00:59.940> pretty<00:01:00.180> similar<00:01:00.510> there

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
cameras they're pretty similar there

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.950 
cameras they're pretty similar there
might<00:01:01.170> well<00:01:01.910> carry<00:01:02.910> around<00:01:03.120> street

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
might well carry around street

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.390 
might well carry around street
photography<00:01:04.710> cameras<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:06.860> ones<00:01:07.860> obviously

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
photography cameras and ones obviously

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.880 
photography cameras and ones obviously
an<00:01:08.670> interchangeable<00:01:09.330> lens<00:01:09.689> camera<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.470> it

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
an interchangeable lens camera and it

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.760 
an interchangeable lens camera and it
fits<00:01:11.189> into<00:01:11.400> my<00:01:11.729> Sony<00:01:12.090> setup<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.260> use<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.619> with

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
fits into my Sony setup so I use it with

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.730 
fits into my Sony setup so I use it with
other<00:01:13.950> lenses<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.180> reco<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.570> one<00:01:16.439> lens

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
other lenses to the reco is one lens

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.570 
other lenses to the reco is one lens
only<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.930> it's<00:01:18.930> my<00:01:19.229> pocket<00:01:19.860> camera<00:01:20.369> let's

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
only and it's my pocket camera let's

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
only and it's my pocket camera let's
call<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:21.470> but<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.590> was<00:01:22.950> expecting<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.210> find<00:01:25.400> more

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
call it but I was expecting to find more

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.830 
call it but I was expecting to find more
quality<00:01:27.680> differences<00:01:28.850> to<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.970> advantage<00:01:30.570> of

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
quality differences to the advantage of

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.929 
quality differences to the advantage of
the<00:01:31.290> Sony<00:01:32.150> and<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.780> did<00:01:34.049> not<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.829> think<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.729> has<00:01:35.909> to

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
the Sony and I did not I think it has to

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.289 
the Sony and I did not I think it has to
do<00:01:36.240> with<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.509> lens<00:01:36.890> not<00:01:37.890> being<00:01:38.310> an<00:01:38.579> extremely

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
do with the lens not being an extremely

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.140 
do with the lens not being an extremely
sharp<00:01:39.689> lens<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.890> reco<00:01:41.280> lens<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.790> an

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
sharp lens and the reco lens is an

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.630 
sharp lens and the reco lens is an
extremely<00:01:42.720> sharp<00:01:42.990> lens<00:01:43.320> but<00:01:44.009> look<00:01:44.430> for

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
extremely sharp lens but look for

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.080 
extremely sharp lens but look for
yourself<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.479> took<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:46.079> few<00:01:46.409> shots<00:01:47.090> actually

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
was surprised to find that the image

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.890 
was surprised to find that the image
quality<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.270> I<00:02:12.360> will<00:02:12.540> show

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
quality and I will show

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.000 
quality and I will show
you<00:02:13.079> this<00:02:13.620> is<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:14.040> 2.8<00:02:15.030> shots<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.750> if<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:16.799> put

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
you this is the 2.8 shots and if I put

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.880 
you this is the 2.8 shots and if I put
them<00:02:17.159> side-by-side<00:02:17.480> at<00:02:18.620> first<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:19.829> mean

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
them side-by-side at first I mean

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.809 
them side-by-side at first I mean
they're<00:02:20.280> both<00:02:20.730> good<00:02:21.299> and<00:02:21.629> if<00:02:22.319> I<00:02:23.010> increase<00:02:23.670> the

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
they're both good and if I increase the

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.830 
they're both good and if I increase the
size<00:02:25.099> the<00:02:26.099> ratio<00:02:26.430> is<00:02:26.489> not<00:02:26.640> perfectly<00:02:27.269> matching

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
size the ratio is not perfectly matching

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.960 
size the ratio is not perfectly matching
because<00:02:28.019> the<00:02:28.799> sony<00:02:29.250> has<00:02:29.549> a<00:02:29.579> lot<00:02:29.939> more

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
because the sony has a lot more

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.559 
because the sony has a lot more
megapixels<00:02:30.900> than<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.439> Ricoh<00:02:32.430> but<00:02:33.180> you<00:02:33.329> see<00:02:33.540> a

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
megapixels than the Ricoh but you see a

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.080 
megapixels than the Ricoh but you see a
huge<00:02:34.230> difference<00:02:34.799> in<00:02:34.980> my<00:02:35.099> perspective<00:02:35.459> it's<00:02:35.970> a

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
huge difference in my perspective it's a

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.750 
huge difference in my perspective it's a
huge<00:02:36.359> difference<00:02:36.900> in<00:02:38.090> in<00:02:40.189> sorry<00:02:41.189> about<00:02:41.489> this

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
huge difference in in sorry about this

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.220 
huge difference in in sorry about this
again

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
again

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.869 
again
in<00:02:43.590> image<00:02:44.220> quality<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.640> sharpness

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
in image quality and sharpness

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.559 
in image quality and sharpness
especially<00:02:45.840> not<00:02:46.049> so<00:02:46.200> much<00:02:46.349> image<00:02:46.680> quality<00:02:46.920> and

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
especially not so much image quality and

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.440 
especially not so much image quality and
if<00:02:48.569> I<00:02:48.900> look<00:02:49.200> at<00:02:49.379> this<00:02:49.700> it<00:02:50.700> really<00:02:51.120> seems

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
if I look at this it really seems

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.160 
if I look at this it really seems
strange<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:52.440> if<00:02:52.560> even<00:02:53.010> if<00:02:53.099> I<00:02:53.250> move<00:02:53.459> around

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
strange and if even if I move around

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.410 
strange and if even if I move around
I<00:02:55.200> even<00:02:55.739> repeated<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.700> test<00:02:56.730> with<00:02:59.420> with

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
I even repeated the test with with

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.270 
I even repeated the test with with
manual<00:03:00.840> focus<00:03:01.260> on<00:03:01.439> the<00:03:01.560> sony<00:03:01.829> because<00:03:02.250> i

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
manual focus on the sony because i

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.129 
manual focus on the sony because i
wasn't<00:03:02.549> sure<00:03:02.760> if<00:03:02.939> it<00:03:03.180> had<00:03:03.389> to<00:03:03.569> do<00:03:03.720> with<00:03:03.750> that

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:04.139 
wasn't sure if it had to do with that

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.819 
wasn't sure if it had to do with that
but<00:03:04.799> this<00:03:05.099> is<00:03:05.280> actually<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:06.870> outcome<00:03:07.379> i<00:03:07.409> got

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
but this is actually the outcome i got

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.740 
but this is actually the outcome i got
and<00:03:08.750> it<00:03:09.889> seems<00:03:10.889> to<00:03:11.310> me<00:03:11.489> like<00:03:11.519> there's<00:03:12.060> a<00:03:12.150> huge

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
and it seems to me like there's a huge

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.410 
and it seems to me like there's a huge
advantage<00:03:12.959> if<00:03:13.859> you<00:03:13.920> look<00:03:14.250> at<00:03:14.459> these<00:03:14.639> parts<00:03:15.239> of

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
advantage if you look at these parts of

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.619 
advantage if you look at these parts of
the<00:03:15.480> image<00:03:16.639> on<00:03:17.639> the<00:03:18.169> reco<00:03:19.169> on<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.799> right<00:03:19.980> side

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:20.629 
the image on the reco on the right side

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:25.789 
the image on the reco on the right side
it's<00:03:21.629> it's<00:03:22.109> really<00:03:22.910> substantial<00:03:23.910> now<00:03:24.799> I'm

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
it's it's really substantial now I'm

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.949 
it's it's really substantial now I'm
still<00:03:26.370> thinking<00:03:26.819> I<00:03:26.940> may<00:03:27.209> have<00:03:27.419> done<00:03:27.629> something

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
still thinking I may have done something

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.770 
still thinking I may have done something
wrong<00:03:28.319> and<00:03:28.590> if<00:03:28.680> some<00:03:28.889> some<00:03:29.370> one<00:03:29.549> of<00:03:29.669> you<00:03:29.849> find

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
wrong and if some some one of you find

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.759 
wrong and if some some one of you find
some<00:03:31.409> flaw<00:03:32.099> to<00:03:32.159> this<00:03:33.440> experiment<00:03:34.440> or

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
some flaw to this experiment or

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.520 
some flaw to this experiment or
something<00:03:35.220> that<00:03:35.430> that<00:03:36.000> may<00:03:36.239> be<00:03:36.530> really

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
something that that may be really

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.059 
something that that may be really
different<00:03:37.949> but<00:03:39.290> even<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.409> image<00:03:40.620> ratio

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
different but even the image ratio

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.949 
different but even the image ratio
difference<00:03:41.579> should<00:03:41.790> not<00:03:42.030> have<00:03:42.449> such<00:03:42.780> an

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
difference should not have such an

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.020 
difference should not have such an
impact<00:03:43.109> because<00:03:44.040> basically<00:03:46.459> still<00:03:47.459> it's<00:03:47.669> a

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
impact because basically still it's a

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.819 
impact because basically still it's a
higher<00:03:48.329> number<00:03:48.750> of<00:03:48.780> megapixels<00:03:49.139> so<00:03:49.650> the

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
higher number of megapixels so the

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.500 
higher number of megapixels so the
definition<00:03:50.489> should<00:03:50.639> be<00:03:50.879> more<00:03:51.060> or<00:03:51.150> less<00:03:51.180> the

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
definition should be more or less the

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.849 
definition should be more or less the
same<00:03:51.799> and<00:03:52.799> even<00:03:53.040> if<00:03:53.310> I<00:03:53.519> pick<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.560> let<00:03:55.560> me<00:03:55.680> go

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
same and even if I pick the let me go

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:03.050 
same and even if I pick the let me go
back<00:03:56.269> to<00:03:57.269> the<00:03:57.599> photos<00:03:58.560> and<00:04:00.500> take<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:01.919> two<00:04:02.310> with

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
back to the photos and take the two with

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.649 
back to the photos and take the two with
the<00:04:03.359> higher<00:04:03.659> or<00:04:04.459> with<00:04:05.459> a<00:04:05.489> smaller<00:04:06.180> aperture

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:08.659 
the higher or with a smaller aperture

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:13.869 
the higher or with a smaller aperture
and<00:04:09.659> if<00:04:09.870> I<00:04:10.049> put<00:04:10.319> them<00:04:10.500> side-by-side<00:04:10.769> again<00:04:11.310> and

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879 
and if I put them side-by-side again and

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:17.240 
and if I put them side-by-side again and
magnify<00:04:14.879> the<00:04:15.599> Sony<00:04:15.900> does<00:04:16.229> get<00:04:16.500> a<00:04:16.530> little<00:04:17.099> bit

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
magnify the Sony does get a little bit

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.800 
magnify the Sony does get a little bit
better<00:04:18.079> but<00:04:19.079> the<00:04:19.739> reco<00:04:20.159> is<00:04:20.190> still

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
better but the reco is still

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.140 
better but the reco is still
substantially<00:04:21.810> sharper<00:04:22.320> in<00:04:22.440> my<00:04:22.620> in<00:04:22.860> my

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
substantially sharper in my in my

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.770 
substantially sharper in my in my
perspective<00:04:23.810> and<00:04:24.080> if<00:04:24.830> I<00:04:25.130> then<00:04:25.479> go<00:04:26.479> back<00:04:26.750> again

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
perspective and if I then go back again

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.760 
perspective and if I then go back again
and<00:04:27.530> put<00:04:27.949> the<00:04:28.900> two<00:04:29.900> sony<00:04:30.350> pictures

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
and put the two sony pictures

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.540 
and put the two sony pictures
side-by-side<00:04:32.650> for<00:04:33.650> you<00:04:33.740> to<00:04:33.949> see<00:04:34.130> that<00:04:34.310> there's

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
side-by-side for you to see that there's

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.730 
side-by-side for you to see that there's
actually<00:04:35.030> an<00:04:35.180> increase<00:04:35.540> in<00:04:35.840> quality<00:04:36.410> you<00:04:36.620> know

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
actually an increase in quality you know

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.950 
actually an increase in quality you know
if<00:04:36.919> you<00:04:37.070> look<00:04:37.250> at<00:04:37.400> these<00:04:37.580> this<00:04:38.060> is<00:04:38.240> the<00:04:38.389> 2.8

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
if you look at these this is the 2.8

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.620 
if you look at these this is the 2.8
aperture<00:04:39.590> on<00:04:39.740> the<00:04:39.770> left<00:04:40.100> side<00:04:40.340> and<00:04:40.699> the<00:04:40.850> 5.6

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
aperture on the left side and the 5.6

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.350 
aperture on the left side and the 5.6
aperture<00:04:42.169> on<00:04:42.320> the<00:04:42.350> right<00:04:42.620> side<00:04:42.949> you<00:04:43.790> do<00:04:44.030> see

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
aperture on the right side you do see

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.360 
aperture on the right side you do see
that<00:04:44.750> the<00:04:44.960> quality<00:04:45.199> the<00:04:45.650> sharpness<00:04:46.220> is

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
that the quality the sharpness is

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.450 
that the quality the sharpness is
getting<00:04:46.760> better<00:04:46.910> but<00:04:47.690> it's<00:04:47.840> still<00:04:47.990> not<00:04:48.229> at<00:04:49.130> the

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
getting better but it's still not at the

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.510 
getting better but it's still not at the
level<00:04:49.850> that<00:04:50.030> you<00:04:50.570> get<00:04:50.750> from<00:04:50.990> the<00:04:51.110> reco<00:04:51.440> and<00:04:51.590> I

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
level that you get from the reco and I

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.020 
level that you get from the reco and I
was<00:04:53.030> actually<00:04:53.870> surprised<00:04:54.440> because<00:04:54.919> I<00:04:55.699> was

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
was actually surprised because I was

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.930 
was actually surprised because I was
expecting<00:04:56.539> some<00:04:57.289> some<00:04:57.530> better<00:04:57.710> quality<00:04:58.310> from

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
expecting some some better quality from

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.650 
expecting some some better quality from
the<00:04:59.150> Sony<00:04:59.680> but<00:05:00.680> I<00:05:01.010> have<00:05:01.400> to<00:05:01.669> say<00:05:01.880> and<00:05:02.210> I'm<00:05:02.360> quite

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
the Sony but I have to say and I'm quite

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.270 
the Sony but I have to say and I'm quite
convinced<00:05:03.260> of<00:05:03.380> this<00:05:03.530> I<00:05:03.590> have<00:05:03.889> no<00:05:04.070> way<00:05:04.250> of

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
convinced of this I have no way of

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.100 
convinced of this I have no way of
comparing<00:05:05.060> it<00:05:05.180> because<00:05:05.449> I<00:05:05.570> don't<00:05:05.930> have

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
comparing it because I don't have

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.730 
comparing it because I don't have
another<00:05:06.650> 20<00:05:07.550> millimeter<00:05:08.240> lens<00:05:08.660> for<00:05:09.139> the<00:05:09.289> for

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
another 20 millimeter lens for the for

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.870 
another 20 millimeter lens for the for

the Sony I may try to get hold of the 19

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.560 
the Sony I may try to get hold of the 19
millimeter<00:05:14.389> Sigma<00:05:15.169> lens<00:05:16.060> that's<00:05:17.060> supposed<00:05:17.479> to

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
millimeter Sigma lens that's supposed to

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.170 
millimeter Sigma lens that's supposed to
be<00:05:17.750> sharper<00:05:18.169> than<00:05:18.199> the<00:05:18.500> Sony<00:05:18.680> lens<00:05:19.039> but<00:05:19.789> really

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
be sharper than the Sony lens but really

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.760 
be sharper than the Sony lens but really
for<00:05:20.510> for<00:05:22.539> for<00:05:23.539> an<00:05:23.630> older<00:05:24.080> camera<00:05:24.590> and<00:05:24.680> this

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
for for for an older camera and this

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.980 
for for for an older camera and this
camera<00:05:24.830> is<00:05:25.250> like<00:05:25.400> three<00:05:25.760> years<00:05:25.789> old<00:05:26.449> now<00:05:26.570> and

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
camera is like three years old now and

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.719 
camera is like three years old now and
this<00:05:27.800> is<00:05:28.070> like<00:05:29.000> not<00:05:29.210> even<00:05:29.419> one<00:05:29.780> year<00:05:29.810> old<00:05:30.729> I'm

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:31.729 
this is like not even one year old I'm

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:34.180 
this is like not even one year old I'm
kind<00:05:32.389> of<00:05:32.510> surprised<00:05:33.020> that<00:05:33.260> the<00:05:33.560> quality

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
kind of surprised that the quality

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.110 
kind of surprised that the quality
difference<00:05:34.370> is<00:05:34.789> so<00:05:35.210> substantial<00:05:36.220> as<00:05:37.220> I<00:05:37.490> said<00:05:37.820> I

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
difference is so substantial as I said I

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.150 
difference is so substantial as I said I
may<00:05:38.780> have<00:05:40.870> gotten<00:05:41.870> something<00:05:42.410> wrong<00:05:42.919> but<00:05:43.099> I

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
may have gotten something wrong but I

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.350 
may have gotten something wrong but I
don't<00:05:43.280> think<00:05:43.700> so<00:05:43.940> and<00:05:45.430> again<00:05:46.430> the<00:05:47.210> most

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
don't think so and again the most

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.279 
don't think so and again the most
important<00:05:47.990> part<00:05:48.229> of<00:05:48.349> this<00:05:49.660> substance<00:05:50.660> is<00:05:50.960> that

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.289 
important part of this substance is that

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:54.070 
important part of this substance is that
the<00:05:51.440> real<00:05:51.620> the<00:05:52.010> real<00:05:52.190> test<00:05:52.610> is<00:05:52.940> probably<00:05:53.419> not

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
the real the real test is probably not

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.750 
the real the real test is probably not
off<00:05:54.669> the<00:05:55.669> sensor<00:05:56.180> but<00:05:56.479> more<00:05:56.840> of<00:05:57.110> the<00:05:57.680> of<00:05:58.460> the

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
off the sensor but more of the of the

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.360 
off the sensor but more of the of the
lens<00:05:59.000> so<00:05:59.270> this<00:06:00.110> lens<00:06:00.349> and<00:06:00.710> I<00:06:00.830> got<00:06:01.039> it<00:06:01.220> because

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
lens so this lens and I got it because

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.820 
lens so this lens and I got it because
it's<00:06:01.699> the<00:06:01.880> smallest<00:06:02.210> you<00:06:02.570> can<00:06:02.780> get<00:06:02.990> and<00:06:03.229> I

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
it's the smallest you can get and I

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.640 
it's the smallest you can get and I
wanted<00:06:04.250> something<00:06:04.639> like<00:06:04.789> a<00:06:04.940> pancake<00:06:05.330> lens<00:06:05.810> for

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
wanted something like a pancake lens for

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.790 
wanted something like a pancake lens for
the<00:06:06.860> for<00:06:07.310> the<00:06:07.430> Sony<00:06:07.990> doesn't<00:06:08.990> seem<00:06:09.380> to<00:06:09.620> be

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
the for the Sony doesn't seem to be

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.350 
the for the Sony doesn't seem to be
really<00:06:10.520> the<00:06:10.669> sharpest<00:06:12.490> option<00:06:13.490> you<00:06:13.880> can<00:06:14.150> get

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
really the sharpest option you can get

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
really the sharpest option you can get
and<00:06:14.570> and<00:06:15.380> to<00:06:15.979> the<00:06:16.099> advantage<00:06:16.220> of<00:06:16.880> the<00:06:17.199> of<00:06:18.199> the

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.380 
and and to the advantage of the of the

reco even as a not really recent camera

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.689 
reco even as a not really recent camera
and<00:06:22.490> the<00:06:22.729> sensor<00:06:23.150> is<00:06:23.270> not<00:06:23.510> the<00:06:24.199> the<00:06:24.889> newest<00:06:25.400> one

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:25.699

the image quality and the sharpness you
get<00:06:28.460> out<00:06:28.639> of<00:06:28.820> this<00:06:29.000> is<00:06:29.210> still<00:06:29.660> fantastic

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.070 
get out of this is still fantastic

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.990

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620 
you could increase the sharpness on the

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.790 
you could increase the sharpness on the
Sony<00:06:36.860> ones<00:06:37.250> with<00:06:37.520> some<00:06:37.729> tools<00:06:37.969> but<00:06:38.590> still<00:06:39.590> it's
