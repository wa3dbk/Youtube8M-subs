00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:18.749
 yes basically channels every four times a look value 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:22.710
 Percent but we have seen investors say we want that 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.939
 physically 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.430
 and then we just imagine the car on one 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.949
 the ham Marquez is being built 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.960
 yes and I want to have done with my life 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.070
 relatively quickly, anyone can identify gold so Manegold Mans in the 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.200
 Hand the cm Freller deeply clear on the hand in the truest sense of the word 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.710
 that even with percent of Chen solution would be vulnerable to quickly check 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.120
 whether that's good or not 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.490
 Percent over it probably in that one still so little value that it is 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.050
 Value to fake 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.770
 Percent relatively expensive little worthwhile 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:00.649
 like right now 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.309
 Once they are in a position to give them Munster in their hands 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.370
 Percent to identify is the platinum palladium or silver 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.060
 Experts would probably already 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.420
 but the market woman percent who sells us for early school leavers 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.750
 So not for use as real money than as a final money 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.369
 Comfort is not just gold and silver in question 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.369
 that's why we put the other 2 aside 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.020
 similar with diamonds 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.420
 there are always many who could come to us then why does he not have any diamonds then 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.330
 would not be able to score a good one out of the bad diamonds 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.750
 then probably most of the others can not be different 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.040
 because gold is the final currency for us 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.110
 that also the position we do not touch at all for training purposes 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.580
 East is in the portfolio, yes that's it 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.280
 we have principle so a little more so short Abs 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.689
 yes so really speculated then so a little different 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.409
 that is the gold of the little man, but of course there is industry 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.560
 Percentage demand there there are considerations about the right GoSee 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.150
 Range shot are now at 45 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.870
 and we should not do that anymore with 18 leagues and silver in relation to the 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.570
 Eco and the mountain earth crust occurs yes you have to go every now and then 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.369
 a little more than he in 

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:27.979
 Yields we have just made with the silver 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:31.339
 that was a wonderful upward movement and who in this 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:34.799
 Upturn as trading position i farm act 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.799
 but the guide has come close 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.780
 meanwhile we have come back clearly and then this one 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:44.759
 also superior to one or the other position to increase
