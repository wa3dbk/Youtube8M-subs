00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.859
 Welcome to the 2013 with the 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.420
 brand new bmw 10 what to do a netbook 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.740
 but of course that could take 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.719
 product category extinct so 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.580
 Let's say so with ebook 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.099
 as it likes to call we have here 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.900
 again a 11.6 inch display as hd 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.300
 with touch of course means I can here 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.109
 wonderfully easy between windows 8 with 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.510
 operate the touch 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.800
 The display does not quite have one 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.779
 but that would be family 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.150
 probably quite pleasant 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.310
 our plan we may not yet the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.260
 best in it which not fully go in 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.870
 may you have to look that's 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.610
 also time 45 50 but from the war 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.530
 gabriel or something similar and we have 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.940
 here an Intel Pentium processor in it 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.620
 see you in the system settings 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.760
 can and fly with wagram course 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.950
 also for everyday work like 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.510
 internet browser and more wonderful 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.789
 I could use it now 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.079
 Let's say it is otherwise nature 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.520
 actually fully regarded so know 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.260
 when do we have both previous social 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.090
 have seen a small caps lock very much 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.160
 good by but for big ships 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.809
 the obergoms be a bit bigger 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.460
 but otherwise could look at the 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.920
 then we have a bit here 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.399
 A power connection had headphones 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.399
 and sec 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.140
 Then we have 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.509
 front we have nothing special so 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:17.679
 status leds and I try to turn around 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.960
 but a bit difficult to know 

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:23.590
 of course hdmi usb 3 is moored 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.539
 network and vegan and can sink 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.429
 corresponding to bottom very beautiful 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:28.179
 is that you ram here and hard disks 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:29.890
 can exchange 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:31.509
 through this flap and the battery 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.829
 you should be able to go out here and 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.319
 can exchange if it is not 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:39.189
 works as well as we have here 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:40.929
 built in 2001 and then it is natural 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.450
 nothing but the display hinges and 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.130
 slightly roughened from the outside 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.099
 plastic that's not good or anything just that 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.810
 from plastic 50 quite cool but 

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:52.360
 of course a bit cheap and in 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.759
 the one not too big trackpad though 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.020
 still completely enough to insert here 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.549
 if you are not around the touchscreen 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.409
 wants to use us out ready 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.729
 opens up very pleasant and 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.469
 Ausschalter city enlightens here nicely 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:07.479
 and is already from the toshiba satellite 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:10.679
 mb 10 to which i will look before 2013 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.679
 and see you next time
