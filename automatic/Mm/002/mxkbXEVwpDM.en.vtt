 to see you again and that shoes 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.030

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.260

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.789

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.400

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.419
 well recovered 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.770
 already end well recovered in surface 1 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.090
 how to say what I think there is 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.000
 a little deeper pain 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.559
 so no hot bah I'm still 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.390
 happy because a week ago today 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:41.860
 for day I told myself that I was going 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.750
 certainly not take the start of the 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.960
 marathon of paris because I was a 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.800
 big dick came engine well carabinÃ©e 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.710
 antibiotics and all that so I'm 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.500
 see wrong party we'll say but my faith 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.820
 my faith I went I won I'm 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.519
 income with the time I had 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.910
 envisioned with pascal of monks from 37-30 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.519
 so 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.660
 Mission filled and hit in eight days 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.210
 what made the difference 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.320
 give yourself to the mobilized like that the 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.670
 mental what sometimes it takes 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.390
 precisely to go to the end I think 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.500
 that we must play on it 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.420
 preparation she had been made of 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.060
 anyway after obviously I 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.530
 was not 100% of my means 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.670
 physically now me this is the 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.530
 mental that makes the difference to this 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.180
 moment there what and so on the race 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.620
 from yesterday site had one thing to remember that 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.210
 what would I say that the strategy 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.520
 race that I set up with 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.710
 not that is to say I proved myself 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.540
 that even starting slowly on a 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.540
 marathon still we can still 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.440
 achieve a good result in the end because 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.650
 that everything is gradually being put in place 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.760
 and the body gets used and I thought 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.990
 not being able to go fast to some 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.410
 moments of the marathon and finally I 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.920
 could do it 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.930
 So here we are at 2:37 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.350
 marathon and the next it 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.060
 should what is better I have 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.410
 gained two minutes almost there on this 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.780
 marathon so has it next time this 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.290
 will be the bar of 2 35 what ok good on 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.290
 wait to see that
