00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.700

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.529
 friends we meet for him for the 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.020
 review already replayed aja and creative 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.460
 not the magazine just after the creative the 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.189
 legend or and a gold balloon with the 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.050
 milan ac he evolved in paris to monaco to 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.120
 marseille chelsea manchester city 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.379
 I have to forget about other clubs but 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.269
 very very big attacker very very strong 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:42.010
 for nothing he was golden balloon 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:44.590
 so we can see the friends on this 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.000
 review the stats 11 games played with 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.610
 it is this goal 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.829
 normally c 17 and a decisive pass 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.030
 but we will not see them because it had 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.070
 curly during the match of the weekend of 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.460
 crunch that you see I had to leave everything 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.440
 simply 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.410
 we can also see its in-game stats 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.320
 very very heavy friends one of the green everywhere 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.750
 it is sap to use his players that in my opinion 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.369
 Guys, it's a monster 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.910
 so we will look at liters and still 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:13.509
 94 finish 95 years free kick is 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:16.090
 abused 91 years penalty 93 in power of 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.200
 hit the guys 93 face we'll see him 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.880
 I'm not cold to spin 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.549
 this him first gameplay sequence 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.020
 the ball bim-sa returns directly six 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.229
 minutes of game first game played at 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.270
 direct he does not laugh and laughs not very 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.439
 nice days of the head I was not thinking 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.900
 but at the same time it's a legend the 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.850
 guy in which he kinda good at all 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.090
 the levels but there at the level of the head 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.740
 I was pleasantly surprised at the RCSC 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.090
 speed of the guys the power of 3 cool 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.130
 keep that 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.409
 a control an acceleration a hit 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.380
 in force simply it goes very fast 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.540
 with him it's hot it's hot 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.430
 frankly look at that they do not fall 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.619
 look at it look at the power 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.799
 costs of hens that but there good little 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.090
 budget is his rocket for me here 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.630
 for my opponent and in addition he 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.090
 to cross 5 0 even if this 0 is the 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.170
 little bonus with nhs sbs small test 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.030
 normally bonus that had to be at the 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.560
 late i played poorly my neck lakers image 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:15.220
 right now that's where a huge huge 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.329
 very technical player I was not thinking about 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.920
 early I play with him for those who 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.200
 were three stars and I got 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.050
 preview in the end that 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.780
 there were four hives preview of his 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.940
 little too late a bit too late our 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.190
 colors he's opportunistic guys 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.190
 very good shot shooter look 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.410
 that little normal gameplay hits in force 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.599
 to summarize web about costs and about 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.760
 the free kicks is a mix between 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:42.810
 ronaldinho and cristiano ronaldo 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.730
 he has the power of a ronaldinho in 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:49.140
 the power of ronaldo alas the 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.160
 subtlety of relay power in 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.410
 train to finally mix you have 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.069
 understood there on this sequence you have 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.420
 well seen that at the shoulder it's huge the 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.099
 his rankings if you saw the call 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.680
 go back and forth 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.360
 look yes to the ischios to the defenders 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.260
 and as soon as I make the pass with the 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.880
 speed he has ben that's the allows of 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.489
 to speed up and then air from medshare 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.840
 what to play cheer had fun too much 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.220
 strong at the controls level look 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.709
 dash scores a second-minute goal 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.239
 he will pick up the balloon and love his 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:22.709
 words is marie focal balloon where i 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:24.569
 the loose smaller bridges frac everything 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.040
 just play enough that guys you 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.389
 give the ball you shoot no matter 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.970
 when no matter how 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:33.109
 his rent is abused the small center 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.750
 to sum up super strong of the head 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:38.220
 the little prÃ©fecture shoot is yes 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.780
 look at it the calls look at the 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.889
 speed and even account 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.550
 will roll strikes in force 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:46.260
 it comes back is beautiful enough him 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.190
 frankly especially the numbers has 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.250
 confused I think it's the best 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:53.190
 attacker test and watch the home 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:56.340
 beautiful pass cross passage that 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.410
 return 1 to the 90th illegally players 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.000
 decisive guys I see very decisive 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.170
 luckily he is there since it is 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.420
 him who scored all the goals of my 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.170
 team almost he kept his the 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.540
 finish facing the keeper quietly 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.040
 also have fun when I know he 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.910
 is opportunistic it's mostly the 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.820
 my opponent's mistakes 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.390
 no pity we push the ball hits 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.330
 in strength 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.290
 it comes back as usual a new 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.330
 times to show that he is opportunistic 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.490
 he often placed his will offensively 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.840
 bise is often very well placed 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.170
 look at a 6th corner 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.120
 he has the ball control and little strikes 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.460
 in finesse quietly so guys 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.860
 and daffy little summary about playing so 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.760
 the most and the least so the chips the 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.430
 speed guy 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.020
 necessarily at 93 speed it's 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.960
 necessarily a plus 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.180
 his punching power which is huge his 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.600
 force it is a very good smuggler 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.669
 very very good gloves facing philipp a 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.830
 evoked in the video but he makes some 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.870
 very beautiful phase dagnivo of a ronaldinho 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.460
 as I say google again I 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.419
 find it's a mix between ronaldinho 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:02.990
 and ronaldo and I thought it's true in 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:06.210
 over and the blunders of which oxfam goethe is 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.760
 pleasantly surprised on perimeter 84 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.620
 so it's going again and a huge finish 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.840
 and guys I tell you you're aiming neither 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.900
 shot and it goes back to the old 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.240
 the numbers 98 it was 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:21.780
 it's whew where there is very very strong for 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.370
 what is - ben often at stake 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.930
 I think this is due to the speed 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.190
 guy who every time stops at 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.020
 defender he accelerates when I do the 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.350
 pass and sometimes a little too early it is 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:34.139
 often judged from is good ten of 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:36.240
 times off game not more than that a little 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.340
 iphone but many times but I am 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.940
 full of goal offside with him he's 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.800
 often hurt 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.380
 on the eleven matches that I did with 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.200
 he was wounded three times when 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:49.350
 even that's still a little a lot the 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.389
 price 2 million 500 thousand and in the 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.680
 month too it's hard placed but good I 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:53.700
 you have done for recreational place 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.100
 so now can be in the east 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.360
 more so here are the guys 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.220
 I hope this little magazine has you 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.140
 it's a first for me 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.300
 will do others on stands and 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:06.660
 other legends or the very big day 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:09.270
 booster on this soft set I wish you 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.669
 wish you a happy new year's Eve 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.960
 Christmas and see you soon for news 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:14.960
 ideas to the houga bi on the cast iron
