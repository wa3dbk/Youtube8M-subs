00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.230
 good starting the test here of the party 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.410
 The first thing I noticed is that 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:14.250
 really lacking torque at low speed 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:18.390
 then the car in town 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.789
 he is a bit slow in responding 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.880
 if it gets krall and become very evident 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.890
 when compared to a golf 2.0 has 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.699
 much more torque at low speed 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:33.719
 so it's a lot slower than golf but 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.590
 if you step on everything it says deep into the 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.120
 accelerator 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:45.000
 then it already shows that it is the engine 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:48.559
 who really have their 130 has a 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.719
 certain arrangement better in high rotation 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.740
 with respect to exchange 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.740
 the first impression 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:01:00.630
 is that it is slower in exchange 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:04.300
 tiptronic of youth in the fights but 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:07.600
 it is well above the motion o 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:12.580
 only one of 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:16.170
 only a clutch but it is not as 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.170
 fast as the 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.619
 Anyway, these are the initial considerations 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.619
 convent 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.010
 It is one thing I am realizing that the 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.590
 exchange rate is slower than that of 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.260
 team brought female football horseshoe 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.550
 it has what it takes to slow down at the time it 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:49.729
 It's you, you step it all in to reduce 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.729
 March is resource here is very timely 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.660
 certain situations a to 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.890
 make the former better accountable 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.250
 indication of management 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.060
 e with respect to the last palm 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.170
 rain 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.240
 there was exchange he is much better he 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.130
 behaves much like the exchange rate 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.360
 Conventional automatic conversation 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.660
 story 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.540
 sometimes the person is not accustomed 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:27.110
 with traditional automatic transmission not 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.110
 What's the difference with this paulo? 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.420
 and the field is good now it is logical that 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.510
 compares with the best year of the two 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.860
 mandates by the market is the hill 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.000
 automatic cameron which is better 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.460
 fast and faster exchange but this one 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.340
 It's good, I liked it a lot better than me. 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:51.600
 said chan in much better than the 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:57.820
 does not have the most remote comparison 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:03:00.850
 beauty spoke I saw really have two 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:05.190
 dots on the body in the 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:12.090
 Front bonnet anchoring understood more 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:20.970
 I did not see him catching I did not see him catching 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:22.810
 a yes may have periods between 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.580
 held down 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.810
 I think it's missing the lack of a 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.810
 rear parking sensor
