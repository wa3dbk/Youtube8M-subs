00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.549
 things to do here know 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.280
 administering the channel has become something 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.750
 heavy is a lot of work for a single 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.930
 person and because you have to take care 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.060
 you just because you do not tell one of your 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.220
 assistants to help you manage the 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.470
 channel because they went to 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.930
 holidays and I do not think it's a 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.660
 good idea the truth none is 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.999
 qualified for that task heck that 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.609
 I can do, I'm very tired of 

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:39.980
 to take care of myself and if you hire 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:41.960
 someone else to help you in fact I was going to 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.870
 ask one of you who 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.969
 could you help me with this today do not look at me 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.249
 I 'm the one in charge of music 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.530
 background and sound effects and 

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:53.659
 then who the hell is taking care 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.819
 of music and sound effects if 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:57.949
 you are here hey i have everything 

00:00:55.819 --> 00:01:00.440
 programmed that's what I do all the 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:03.319
 time and that is after programming the 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.530
 music and the effects I start to see uri 

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:09.560
 xxi people say I plan strategies for 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.299
 use them in a 5 I'm sorry but I can not 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.579
 from time to time I must leave the channel 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.369
 to address important issues in the 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:18.170
 village shit good and what do I need 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.420
 hire someone else 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.950
 well it would not be a bad idea if you hire 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.670
 someone for supervisory work 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.009
 I think you're right and someone 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.470
 is responsible for the task of supervisor not 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.270
 you would have a lot of work in the channel and so 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.759
 I would not have to worry about what 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.770
 do my assistants that way could 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.470
 concentrate on other issues of the channel 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.850
 well I'll write an ad to look for 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.580
 someone who wants the position of 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.179
 supervisor or who do you think I hired 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.750
 keeper I do not know but knowing it will be another 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:49.750
 more girl 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.310
 well today it's supposed to come some 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.840
 candidates for the position to know them 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.990
 I hope to find the right person and 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.130
 as you can see I have a lot of experience 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.439
 corporate that could be very useful 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.079
 well so far everything sounds very good 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:09.860
 I think you're the right one, I think 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:12.110
 I will be your new boss and my boss I thought 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.450
 that was for the position of president not 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.819
 I'll be the employee of a asshole like you 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.700
 go to the 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.620
 but what bad born good the one that follows and 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.780
 well I think it would be perfect for the 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.120
 put well but also participate jazz 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.519
 in the videos of the channel videos that is 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.829
 that next would not be a good 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.599
 choice and if you're not convinced 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:35.659

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.019
 you had a problem with some 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.079
 channel member would cut off his head 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.870
 slowly and painfully next but what 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:53.120

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.500

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.620

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:07.459
 found no suitable candidate and 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:09.829
