00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.330
 no wonder he comes back to park maybe my powers are falling 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:05.640
 organize 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.030
 As you can see this is chalking on the night has survived well 

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:12.159
 and I would say Wartberg 

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:16.730
 Experts say we did not fall over here Bern 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.730
 and Werkschau Marisa might find something there 

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:23.689
 not we all need drinking or too 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:28.329
 because they are just at night in the dark and who has not built a house 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:31.990
 but I think that will come too 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.990
 Zaveck in the ground is the BMW Group 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.760
 eat 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.190
 API so in the recent tests in the area a bit stronger 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.250
 become 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.390
 I've reported something like this, I start building my house is on 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.940
 beautiful little wooden house 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.330
 with band is a clear and a bit glass roof 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.480
 bring the usual newly for starter home tests 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.660
 which in Essen 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.780
 you know me very creative Schlichterrat is just cool St 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.700
 So invest billions even then 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.700
 Xaver Steininger need the whole stone 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.470
 so that's not so bad 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.800
 like Adolf something 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.290
 dismantle 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.280
 and of course he would also spend a bit to the east on Robben 2 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.900
 5 not like that would be so 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.090
 he is there as a blog or 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.490
 and that is sleep h from 11 October 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.120
 around 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.400
 I would say we got stuck 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.060
 which has already been expanded both by the director Polenz 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.680
 or a hole 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.260
 if we really are percent 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.820
 b Poland Pole Maciek continues 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.670
 the percent prime time I was not often as naughty when I was the one 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.740
 cool 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.710
 really good 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.190
 actually 20 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.220
 Kreft 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.560
 but already so has the hope dies last and percent 

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:14.659
 Holly whole he met here for the amplified comes 

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:21.620
 he had quite a pull 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.539
 he pulls completely 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:28.219
 as always, nobody was really that choice 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:30.299
 he will certainly be completely undisturbed 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.689
 I do not think I do not think I'm good at it 

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:38.179
 there the earth somehow 

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:39.509
 be 

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:41.399
 useless use 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:44.829
 I mean like flat 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.239
 or a lot of fat 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.829
 against the example 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.129
 for the current year but that was to be expected 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.819
 and you need it, it gets a bit baffled 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.189
 Scholz already consistently does not keep them sort of 

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:04.529
 Quite an increasing number of stones untested stop are important in mind 

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:05.399
 Has 

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:09.459
 so fail approach was even stupid from Hennef no form ended 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:12.239
 so it works 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.099
 then the fast and 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.299
 I can almost make a mockery of making a decline to men's KEF 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:20.409
 actually 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:24.959
 to my well Kreft but no cage is because they actually just McKay 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.709
 wants to lead 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.779
 Etienne is therefore questionable 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:33.499
 that creates 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:37.159
 becoming a full-blown Chris Schaeffler, but God does not work 

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:42.869
 I want the textures to get 50 points like that 

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:45.079
 both look a bit like 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.539
 Stockum has to be so fond of chocolates 

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:49.889
 I do not know 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.480
 5 percent drawers like flirting 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.069
 to insist 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.449
 Krafts 

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:02.579
 that time looks good with the Saarner future brings 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.829
 same year looks like too 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.709
 Now he is quite good 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.899
 Wenzler Schwerin piggy or 1 

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:13.729
 Munich or no idea what that should be 

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:16.729
 but so what is it anyway 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.259
 But I think the carrots make short prat 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:24.259
 I'll tell her my Kizil again 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:27.090
 we have a small mine 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.389
 Dr and percent 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:30.969
 Meanwhile 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:34.009
 that should be self-negligence 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:36.659
 it is not so far as these are Schulz
