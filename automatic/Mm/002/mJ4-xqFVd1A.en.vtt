00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
stuff like that so you never know I

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.980 
stuff like that so you never know I
wouldn't<00:01:41.579> say<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.759> that's<00:01:42.030> immediately<00:01:42.810> the

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
wouldn't say that that's immediately the

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.240 
wouldn't say that that's immediately the
last<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.350> us<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.619> because<00:01:43.950> it's<00:01:44.070> probably

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
last of us to because it's probably

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.160 
last of us to because it's probably
still<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> ways<00:01:45.060> off<00:01:45.270> but<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.869> never<00:01:45.990> know

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
still a ways off but you never know

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.780 
still a ways off but you never know
personally<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.710> think<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.130> Last<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.460> Us<00:01:47.579> too

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
personally I think the Last of Us too

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.160 
personally I think the Last of Us too
has<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.000> lot<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.299> ammunition<00:01:48.479> because<00:01:48.990> Sony

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
has a lot of ammunition because Sony

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.289 
has a lot of ammunition because Sony
will<00:01:49.500> bankroll<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.310> course<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.850> Last<00:01:51.180> of

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
will bankroll it of course the Last of

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.270 
will bankroll it of course the Last of
Us<00:01:51.390> remastered<00:01:51.600> for<00:01:52.110> ps4<00:01:52.560> has<00:01:52.680> proven<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.130> be<00:01:53.159> a

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
Us remastered for ps4 has proven to be a

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.490 
Us remastered for ps4 has proven to be a
huge<00:01:53.549> success<00:01:53.790> as<00:01:54.180> well<00:01:54.360> as<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.689> ps3<00:01:54.869> version

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
huge success as well as the ps3 version

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.319 
huge success as well as the ps3 version
so<00:01:55.890> Sony<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.460> think<00:01:56.700> will<00:01:56.820> definitely<00:01:57.210> be<00:01:57.299> on

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
so Sony I think will definitely be on

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.969 
so Sony I think will definitely be on
board<00:01:57.600> it's<00:01:57.750> just<00:01:57.810> whether<00:01:58.409> or<00:01:58.560> not<00:01:58.649> Naughty

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
board it's just whether or not Naughty

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.289 
board it's just whether or not Naughty
Dog<00:01:59.219> will<00:01:59.369> want<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.579> be<00:01:59.700> on<00:01:59.790> board<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.119> hope

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
Dog will want to be on board and I hope

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.789 
Dog will want to be on board and I hope
they<00:02:00.420> don't<00:02:00.509> get<00:02:00.659> forced<00:02:00.990> into<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.469> force

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
they don't get forced into it and force

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.200 
they don't get forced into it and force
out<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.009> product<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.759> doesn't<00:02:02.939> work<00:02:03.180> because

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
out a product that doesn't work because

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.819 
out a product that doesn't work because
that's<00:02:03.780> totally<00:02:04.170> against<00:02:04.619> their<00:02:04.710> whole

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
that's totally against their whole

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.469 
that's totally against their whole
studio<00:02:05.130> philosophy<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:05.790> also<00:02:05.939> think<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.299> fact

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
studio philosophy I also think the fact

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.029 
studio philosophy I also think the fact
that<00:02:06.540> they<00:02:06.719> announced<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.290> Last<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.649> Us<00:02:07.740> movie

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039
