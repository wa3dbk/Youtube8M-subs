 he is no longer the only leading player today unemployed for like 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.109
 citizen and presentation 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.359
 in the markets software or a chance so here it is called m6 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.289
 as I pointed out to you two cases the suicide changes 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.029
 we make the presentation 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.999
 we are here 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:26.999
 you want me to tell you 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:29.649
 more than ever 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:31.699
 you do not have to close the console 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.730
 finally kind of black and white consoles 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.140
 if not every site two dogs 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.350
 then for really a 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.580
 either do you do he scored a single seater 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.650
 morning McCarthyism 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.360
 you choose 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.840
 his passion m 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.730
 so she recognized fly 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.730
 I use for the curious 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.570
 simoes for you 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.839
 christine boutin 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.810
 under the fire of the fesf 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.860
 if you are in pain 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.910
 renault noodles 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.910
 his father the pen 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.760
 its current creators 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.890
 for Toulouse 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.080
 it's a black roof 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.410
 you put in the oven of the world and 5 passes 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.970
 on the other hand 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.070
 it's not very good because m 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.300
 it creates a small echo platform 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.300
 for the support of the banks does that the same stuffy that it generates 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.730
 so this year 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.510
 so for those run 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:39.700
 qED 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.700
 you are to move forward 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.020
 then to go see the coach 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.110
 she arises 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.020
 at the back the idea 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.080
 for the right 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.100
 for me it was enough 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.900
 to predict 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.900
 and it's w to lose altitude 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.320
 so after the different speeches 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.050
 but I want to change 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:12.499
 can we do 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:14.409
 you do against me 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:16.399
 ea com 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:18.089
 you choose that 

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:21.169
 selected there to take the most basic points 

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:22.389
 christophe chabert 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:23.299
 you choose 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:24.599
 and it's at the top of the state 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.819
 we bet that choosing the best 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.609
 So here is 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:31.809
 so that's different from the side of what 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:35.109
 the first test shot for selection 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:37.169
 inter of block elements 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:40.569
 across the Atlantic I'm disappointed 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.409
 a point it's gone it's wet 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:46.479
 so after the decennial for selected 

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:49.159
 select I do not know too much 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:51.169
 I think it's bigger for them 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:54.169
 I think it's for the whole height 

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:58.339
 so it does not tempt me too much diluted block is for them 

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:00.389
 remove the balloon 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.349
 on all the material 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.119
 Swedish mythical divalto 

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:06.449
 you judge rather 

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:10.129
 and export to natixis to export and I have selected you on a 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.679
 other hand 

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:13.199
 Why you say 

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:16.319
 when you see the 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.979
 more to do 

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:22.529
 and to steer the bbc right click and to select its little mouths 

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:25.529
 so here it is a damn a shot in the winged 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.099
 So I am 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.119
 the second is for cyclingnews blues 

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:35.430
 I do not find it very well 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.739
 because the word of the people 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.639
 confident 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:41.390
 the surface I do not know what it is 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.949
 testimony 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:45.949
 the mispo too either 

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:50.089
 after five weeks of blocking the figure 

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:51.690
 how are we waiting 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.749
 six Swiss 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:55.879
 to do this 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:57.639
 sign of a hiring 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.639
 the road why I can change the world 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:03.759
 the case is much less 

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:06.759
 so a pyramid 

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:09.289
 he squeezed 

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:11.029
 whatever happens 

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:13.629
 but I find that very much of course 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:16.680
 this software for them not if you can you can not make blocks 

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:21.900
 zito 8% and that's the price 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.590
 so 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.199
 then to predict 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:27.930
 or to those who have something 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.099
 but for example the selected ones 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:34.509
 some small coastal areas 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:36.770
 all selected 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.400
 folders are deleted 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.559
 there too I'm just a bar 

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:44.300
 you go up 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.300
 and on the side you go all the way 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.300
 either you take from the beginning the whole house 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.550
 so after 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.069
 you do 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:55.199
 he has these students 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:56.809
 a left 

00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:58.949
 and the fact that 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:00.620
 and every year a million 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.740
 you click 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.379
 a clone 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:05.680
 she for them 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.309
 because we thought 

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:10.309
 r control that is to say to the article 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.249
 to find their witnesses 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:19.249
 to return to adversities 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.430
 horizontally 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.669
 mirror to form in me 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:25.229
 as we are spoken to 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:27.419
 and after there is a copy do 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:28.770
 so that copies of the air 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.719
 and to conclude the land his copy 

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:34.719
 after we pay them is the number of repetitions so there 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.620
 I am and I win for the two that will appear 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:41.400
 three others 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.879
 the 23 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:46.400
 and so after why did you make this club 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.779
 and saint-claude 

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:51.779
 then after the other his daughters 1st place 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:58.669
 so does it to change into a party 

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:04.219
 what you are and selected 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.550
 after and dead filterers 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.389
 imported to take away for 100 m 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:13.400
 in another world 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.080
 our pleasure is when you appear 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.860
 when you die 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.740
 so it takes a lot of placier 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.400
 above 60 kw 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.869
 otherwise they will tell you where 

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:27.430
 the place 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.770
 common stuttering two places and also occupies a note that you 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.770
 know 

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:38.499
 this mass a tip 

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:42.110
 it's crazy but then double fine mouth on the raw Swiss roads 

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:48.580
 sliimy to appear when you die he will not be able to vatican 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.349
 you are also visible 

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:53.349
 after I am in control of his acts 

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:57.319
 a channel I think it's the whole map to help you 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.080
 so here I do not know too much 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.599
 so can 

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:08.059
 then after it's very convenient 

00:07:08.059 --> 00:07:11.270
 doitel who only has six friends I'm proud 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:15.169
 it's also to prove that I'm far from my line I did but I do not 

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:18.169
 Am I can not wait for the youngest 

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:21.449
 all repeat what does he say 6% 

00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:24.360
 so much better than that, if not better 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.360
 the explosion of a water pipe 

00:07:28.569 --> 00:07:30.680
 Mouloudia Mulhouse 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.899
 which got me to the hole 

00:07:32.899 --> 00:07:33.669
 like that 

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:36.669
 so it's very fragile 

00:07:40.729 --> 00:07:43.399
 this country 

00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:45.080
 m6 

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.669
 and even if we have the best good except for the next internship at the 

00:07:48.669 --> 00:07:49.169
 presentation
