00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
achieve with kill streaks like the

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.840 
achieve with kill streaks like the
dragon<00:04:33.000> ice<00:04:33.180> which<00:04:33.600> is<00:04:33.720> my<00:04:33.930> favorite<00:04:34.320> one<00:04:34.380> and

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
dragon ice which is my favorite one and

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.970 
dragon ice which is my favorite one and
and<00:04:35.850> after<00:04:36.450> that<00:04:36.600> when<00:04:36.930> you<00:04:37.020> hit<00:04:37.110> level<00:04:37.320> 55<00:04:37.800> you

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
and after that when you hit level 55 you

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.680 
and after that when you hit level 55 you
start<00:04:38.220> unlocking<00:04:38.460> things<00:04:38.820> like<00:04:39.060> chrome<00:04:39.390> and

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
start unlocking things like chrome and

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.980 
start unlocking things like chrome and
gold<00:04:40.440> and<00:04:41.150> definitely<00:04:42.150> do<00:04:42.270> some<00:04:42.510> videos<00:04:42.810> when

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
gold and definitely do some videos when

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.500 
gold and definitely do some videos when
i<00:04:43.020> unlock<00:04:43.170> those<00:04:43.530> and<00:04:43.920> I<00:04:44.910> guess<00:04:45.150> we<00:04:45.270> take<00:04:45.480> a

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
i unlock those and I guess we take a

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.510 
i unlock those and I guess we take a
look<00:04:45.840> at<00:04:46.050> my<00:04:47.030> service<00:04:48.030> record<00:04:49.520> leaderboards

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
kills I'm only ranked 906 now for a

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.970 
kills I'm only ranked 906 now for a
while<00:04:56.190> I<00:04:56.490> was<00:04:56.820> like<00:04:57.630> the<00:04:57.810> three<00:04:58.410> four<00:04:58.770> or<00:04:58.830> five

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
while I was like the three four or five

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.150 
while I was like the three four or five
hundreds<00:04:59.460> and<00:05:00.030> I<00:05:01.020> try<00:05:01.350> to<00:05:01.380> get<00:05:01.530> that<00:05:01.710> back<00:05:01.920> up

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
hundreds and I try to get that back up

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.760 
hundreds and I try to get that back up
and<00:05:02.910> I<00:05:02.970> get<00:05:03.120> my<00:05:03.240> KD<00:05:03.510> at<00:05:03.720> one<00:05:03.990> point<00:05:04.260> eight<00:05:04.530> nine

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
and I get my KD at one point eight nine

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.150 
and I get my KD at one point eight nine
which<00:05:05.580> really<00:05:06.420> isn't<00:05:06.600> so<00:05:06.870> great<00:05:07.050> but<00:05:07.440> in<00:05:08.010> this

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
which really isn't so great but in this

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.460 
which really isn't so great but in this
game<00:05:08.280> it's<00:05:09.150> pretty<00:05:09.450> decent<00:05:09.660> I'm<00:05:10.110> sure<00:05:10.320> that

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
game it's pretty decent I'm sure that

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.850 
game it's pretty decent I'm sure that
would<00:05:10.560> go<00:05:10.680> up<00:05:10.770> in<00:05:10.920> time<00:05:12.170> and<00:05:14.060> experience<00:05:15.060> I

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
would go up in time and experience I

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.580 
would go up in time and experience I
guess<00:05:16.860> it's<00:05:17.160> just<00:05:17.220> like<00:05:17.520> XP<00:05:17.970> per<00:05:18.180> minute<00:05:18.590> 509

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
guess it's just like XP per minute 509

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
guess it's just like XP per minute 509
is<00:05:19.830> pretty<00:05:20.190> good

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.340 

play<00:05:25.610> time<00:05:25.940> as<00:05:27.250> tell<00:05:28.250> I<00:05:28.280> played<00:05:29.170> when<00:05:30.170> my

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
play time as tell I played when my

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.450 
play time as tell I played when my
win-loss<00:05:30.860> ratio<00:05:31.490> which<00:05:32.440> it<00:05:33.440> isn't<00:05:33.890> so<00:05:34.280> great

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
win-loss ratio which it isn't so great

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.730 
win-loss ratio which it isn't so great
yet<00:05:34.850> I've<00:05:35.570> been<00:05:35.720> playing<00:05:35.900> with<00:05:36.020> mostly<00:05:36.410> random

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
yet I've been playing with mostly random

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.070 
yet I've been playing with mostly random
so<00:05:37.280> nothing<00:05:37.760> much<00:05:37.910> I<00:05:38.090> knew<00:05:38.270> about<00:05:38.450> that<00:05:38.510> and

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
so nothing much I knew about that and

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.200 
so nothing much I knew about that and
the<00:05:39.680> last<00:05:39.860> one<00:05:40.040> score<00:05:40.490> this<00:05:40.730> really<00:05:41.030> doesn't

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
the last one score this really doesn't

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.450

tedium way more than anything else

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.710
