00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
that Keith Kevin raw and raw now quickly

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.639 
that Keith Kevin raw and raw now quickly
from<00:01:35.640> longwood<00:01:35.880> adobe<00:01:36.569> to<00:01:36.690> be<00:01:36.840> rehashing<00:01:37.319> more

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
from longwood adobe to be rehashing more

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.020 
from longwood adobe to be rehashing more
gimmicks<00:01:40.069> not<00:01:41.069> that<00:01:41.220> I'm<00:01:41.340> saying<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:41.729> that

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
gimmicks not that I'm saying this that

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.480 
gimmicks not that I'm saying this that
that<00:01:42.330> Festus<00:01:42.929> and<00:01:43.110> Jesse<00:01:43.440> are<00:01:43.470> bad<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:44.399> the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
that Festus and Jesse are bad in the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.289 
that Festus and Jesse are bad in the
ring<00:01:44.729> but<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:46.520> really<00:01:47.520> think<00:01:47.759> they<00:01:48.030> could<00:01:48.270> have

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
ring but I really think they could have

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.440 
ring but I really think they could have
done<00:01:48.390> better<00:01:49.610> or<00:01:50.610> hell<00:01:50.789> maybe<00:01:50.819> they<00:01:51.179> couldn't

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
done better or hell maybe they couldn't

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.789 
done better or hell maybe they couldn't
have<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.840> yes<00:01:52.020> they're<00:01:52.170> kind<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.380> running<00:01:52.709> out

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
have it yes they're kind of running out

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.469 
have it yes they're kind of running out
of<00:01:52.860> ideas<00:01:53.069> right<00:01:53.640> now<00:01:53.700> that's<00:01:54.000> kind<00:01:54.269> of<00:01:54.330> why

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
of ideas right now that's kind of why

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.839 
of ideas right now that's kind of why
I'm<00:01:54.539> saying<00:01:54.869> right<00:01:55.050> now<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.800> they<00:01:56.670> keep

00:01:56.839 --> 00:01:56.849 
I'm saying right now is that they keep

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:58.520 
I'm saying right now is that they keep
rehashing<00:01:57.300> gimmicks<00:01:57.780> every<00:01:58.019> now<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.379> then

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
rehashing gimmicks every now and then

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.719 
rehashing gimmicks every now and then
and<00:01:59.959> it<00:02:00.959> is<00:02:01.110> rehashed<00:02:01.560> ated<00:02:02.039> Murdoch's<00:02:02.489> with

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
and it is rehashed ated Murdoch's with

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.060 
and it is rehashed ated Murdoch's with
Jesse<00:02:02.940> and<00:02:03.090> Festus<00:02:03.629> I<00:02:04.099> mean

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
Jesse and Festus I mean

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.760 
Jesse and Festus I mean
I<00:02:07.159> don't<00:02:07.820> know<00:02:07.880> I<00:02:08.289> think<00:02:09.289> it's<00:02:09.410> getting<00:02:09.500> kind

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
I don't know I think it's getting kind

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.970 
I don't know I think it's getting kind
of<00:02:09.830> old<00:02:10.039> right<00:02:10.369> now<00:02:11.440> but<00:02:12.440> really<00:02:12.620> that's<00:02:12.710> just

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
of old right now but really that's just

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.860 
of old right now but really that's just
my<00:02:13.190> opinion<00:02:13.220> on<00:02:13.730> things<00:02:16.090> all<00:02:17.090> right<00:02:17.390> quit

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
my opinion on things all right quit

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.540 
my opinion on things all right quit
logic<00:02:18.230> I<00:02:18.380> really<00:02:18.560> don't<00:02:18.650> watch<00:02:18.830> smackdown<00:02:19.430> the

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
logic I really don't watch smackdown the

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.690 
logic I really don't watch smackdown the
other<00:02:19.700> thing<00:02:19.880> I<00:02:19.970> do<00:02:20.030> raw<00:02:20.420> watches<00:02:21.080> raw<00:02:21.700> but

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
other thing I do raw watches raw but

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.260 
other thing I do raw watches raw but
anyway<00:02:24.010> there's<00:02:25.010> reason<00:02:25.430> for<00:02:25.610> why<00:02:25.790> to<00:02:25.850> watch

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
anyway there's reason for why to watch

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.970 
anyway there's reason for why to watch
smackdown<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:26.990> I'm<00:02:27.320> not<00:02:27.470> going<00:02:27.650> to<00:02:27.740> get<00:02:27.860> into

smackdown and I'm not going to get into
that<00:02:28.100> right<00:02:28.400> now<00:02:28.459> because<00:02:28.940> I'm<00:02:29.030> sure<00:02:29.240> my

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
that right now because I'm sure my
