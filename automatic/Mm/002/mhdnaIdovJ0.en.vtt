not going to be a how-to on this didn't

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.850 
not going to be a how-to on this didn't
even<00:00:34.719> don't<00:00:35.320> even<00:00:35.530> ask<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:37.480> start<00:00:37.660> off<00:00:37.840> they<00:00:38.170> it

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
even don't even ask to start off they it

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.160 
even don't even ask to start off they it
was<00:00:39.070> a<00:00:39.489> pretty<00:00:39.820> simple<00:00:40.210> design<00:00:40.329> actually<00:00:41.020> it

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
was a pretty simple design actually it

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.229 
was a pretty simple design actually it
was<00:00:41.670> served<00:00:42.670> in<00:00:42.699> the<00:00:42.789> back<00:00:42.999> you<00:00:43.960> had<00:00:44.999> the<00:00:45.999> truck

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
was served in the back you had the truck

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.689 
was served in the back you had the truck
itself<00:00:46.570> was<00:00:47.019> a<00:00:47.379> hybrid<00:00:48.039> of<00:00:48.579> 8<00:00:49.359> wide<00:00:49.690> and<00:00:50.429> 6<00:00:51.429> wide

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
itself was a hybrid of 8 wide and 6 wide

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.299 
itself was a hybrid of 8 wide and 6 wide
so<00:00:52.179> what<00:00:52.449> we<00:00:52.569> did<00:00:52.719> in<00:00:52.809> the<00:00:52.870> middle<00:00:53.140> was<00:00:53.350> we

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
so what we did in the middle was we

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.489 
so what we did in the middle was we
actually<00:00:54.699> had<00:00:54.909> these<00:00:55.179> little<00:00:55.479> sloped<00:00:56.260> bricks

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:56.499 
actually had these little sloped bricks

00:00:56.499 --> 00:00:59.340 
actually had these little sloped bricks
here<00:00:57.210> using<00:00:58.210> snot<00:00:58.479> techniques<00:00:58.960> we've<00:00:59.199> had

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
here using snot techniques we've had

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.919 
here using snot techniques we've had
them<00:00:59.609> so<00:01:00.609> it<00:01:00.670> would<00:01:00.789> give<00:01:00.969> it<00:01:01.120> a<00:01:01.149> smooth

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:01.929 
them so it would give it a smooth

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:05.480 
them so it would give it a smooth
transition<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.789> on<00:01:04.300> the<00:01:04.390> back<00:01:04.570> you<00:01:04.839> had

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:05.490 
transition and on the back you had

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.250 
transition and on the back you had
taillights<00:01:06.490> and<00:01:06.640> brake<00:01:06.880> lights<00:01:06.909> a<00:01:07.570> nice<00:01:07.900> step

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
taillights and brake lights a nice step

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.080 
taillights and brake lights a nice step
that's<00:01:08.530> in<00:01:08.740> there<00:01:08.979> they're<00:01:09.549> gonna<00:01:09.670> be<00:01:09.790> two

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.450 
built on a technic caste so it was a
relatively<00:02:04.240> simple<00:02:04.800> sort<00:02:05.800> of<00:02:05.920> structural

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
relatively simple sort of structural

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.029 
relatively simple sort of structural
design<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.930> yeah<00:02:08.110> that's<00:02:08.379> the<00:02:08.500> rejected

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
design so yeah that's the rejected

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.660 
design so yeah that's the rejected
creation<00:02:11.010> hopefully<00:02:12.010> I<00:02:12.069> can<00:02:12.129> come<00:02:12.370> out<00:02:12.519> with<00:02:12.640> a

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
creation hopefully I can come out with a

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.220 
creation hopefully I can come out with a
new<00:02:12.909> one<00:02:13.150> it's<00:02:13.390> probably<00:02:13.510> gonna<00:02:13.750> have<00:02:13.870> smaller

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
new one it's probably gonna have smaller

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.490 
new one it's probably gonna have smaller
wheels<00:02:14.530> just<00:02:15.280> working<00:02:15.580> on<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.909> new<00:02:16.060> scale

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
wheels just working on the new scale

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.330 
wheels just working on the new scale
probably<00:02:17.500> about<00:02:17.739> that<00:02:17.980> size<00:02:18.370> so<00:02:19.980> it<00:02:20.980> seems<00:02:21.220> a

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
probably about that size so it seems a

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.760 
probably about that size so it seems a
bit<00:02:21.490> more<00:02:21.640> lifelike<00:02:22.090> but<00:02:23.020> yeah<00:02:23.200> that's<00:02:23.440> the

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
bit more lifelike but yeah that's the

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:24.870 
bit more lifelike but yeah that's the
the<00:02:24.190> Andy

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
the Andy

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.380 
the Andy
three<00:02:25.240> points<00:02:25.570> five<00:02:25.720> one<00:02:25.870> eight<00:02:25.930> sending<00:02:26.260> out
