00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.860
 then we used the index major 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.050
 to change a little we will use the 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.049
 then pushes the thumb we will use it 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:18.640
 playing on the 6th strings and we're going 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:22.330
 do this we will do four times to 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.560
 empty and then with the first fingers 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.359
 index 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.359
 we're going to do the third box here 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:38.370
 all this of course with a regular rhythm 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.370
 3 and 4 and 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:53.680
 [Music] 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:56.540
 [Laughs] 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.629
 here is to start by doing a 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:03.170
 first little melodic line that is 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.440
 pretty close to blues brothers that's 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.440
 like that 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.850
 [Music] 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.990
 menouar first black 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.990
 3rd first 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.399
 [Music] 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.860
 the normal rhythm it would be rather that 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.430
 [Music] 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:41.930
 m 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.930
 [Music] 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.500
 so we will now see a first 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.710
 little piece whose spirit rather blues 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.820
 rock only play with the thumb with 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.170
 melodic lines that looks like 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.710
 the one we played in the exercise 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:13.880
 previous three guys 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:15.880
 [Music] 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.880
 1 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.020
 [Music] 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:37.890
 and after that it starts again 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:39.890
 [Music] 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.890
 e 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.300
 years 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.400
 1 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.590
 e 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.440
 e 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.510
 2 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.700
 1 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.700
 [Music] 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.700
 1 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.709
 obviously you will find everything 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.600
 we just played in the method 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.600
