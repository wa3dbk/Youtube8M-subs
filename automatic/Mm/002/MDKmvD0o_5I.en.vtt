00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.040
 how long have you been cycling 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.320
 slicing through the air we force others 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.900
 heads turn not so much with 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.670
 it happened to me all the time but about it 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.000
 we will talk to you sometime in another 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.670
 time 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.470
 because today I will tell you about not quite 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.100
 girl what might seem to you 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.860
 strange 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.940
 Scott's newest bike company 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:55.420
 sport carbon scott suet of guys you 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.460
 I like it here too but donâ€™t think 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.400
 that this is just a beautiful exhibit 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.410
 After all, Scott Solis is a super tech 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.080
 bicycle over which the company engineers 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.149
 work several years of convenience 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.180
 aerodynamics and lightness were their goal 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:12.340
 whether it was possible to reach you when you judge 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.920
 manufacturing carbon frames company 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.149
 applies the latest technology ampy she 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.509
 allows you to exclude 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:21.250
 11 percent of the material in the steering unit 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.229
 increasing its rigidity that's what I 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.750
 really like it so that 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.670
 carbon fiber makes the bike climb what 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.280
 allows even such a fragile girl as 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.570
 I raise it almost with one hand and in 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.030
 combination with pipes not 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.640
 the frame is a real model 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.619
 strength and functionality that is very 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.080
 it's really important because he's so 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.510
 thin what when you sit on it think 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.610
 that he breaks right under you but you 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.250
 nothing to worry about it already 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.500
 thought for you so boldly roll with 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.720
 on it I confirm its strength 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.580
 frame geometry is designed for a comfortable 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.830
 landing athlete with more raised 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.140
 trunk this position is suitable for 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.189
 those who love a long workout on 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.130
 average speeds 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:05.140
 vibration dampening system absorbs 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.000
 blows smooths out vibrations without 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.489
 reducing the efficiency of movement 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.440
 scott aira sands division has created 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.930
 unique shape of a bicycle tube 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.239
 which maximizes a red dynamically and 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.440
 effective at low speeds 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.239
 special air flow 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.370
 optimized tube shape allows 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.590
 maintain high average speed 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.810
 while spending as little as possible 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.530
 effort that is you go to 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.930
 bike ride 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.850
 but you do not strain often 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.560
 power sleep that includes yourself 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.510
 stiffened structure 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.910
 promotes better energy transfer 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.530
 pedaling a bicycle transmission and 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.360
 here is comfort zone 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.180
 which is in the frame elements and 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.130
 plugs need to absorb vibration 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.440
 also stabilized movements 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.000
 cyclist wide construction bottom 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.580
 pipe and bark is accurate at knot 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.260
 conveys effort more efficiently ex 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.390
 unnecessary swinging ram 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.440
 and most importantly, I ca n't help but notice 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.140
 bicycle design 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.030
 because he is not just beautiful but still very 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.190
 strong so if you want 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.440
 show off in front of friends or 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.060
 throw cool photos in instagram 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.890
 know this bike is intended 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:15.050
 for you, what do you think to me personally? 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:22.220
 I want to try myself in the saddle of this 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:24.140
 superbike ride all big 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.090
