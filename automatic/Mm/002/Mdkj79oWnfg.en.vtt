before the building falls on them and

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.169 
before the building falls on them and
uprising<00:00:11.190> it's<00:00:11.280> about<00:00:11.400> 25<00:00:11.670> games<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:12.030> school

uprising it's about 25 games of school

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.270 
uprising it's about 25 games of school
and<00:00:12.389> it<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.960> me<00:00:13.080> about<00:00:13.139> 20<00:00:13.620> times<00:00:13.830> before<00:00:14.250> I

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
and it to me about 20 times before I

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.099 
and it to me about 20 times before I
figured<00:00:14.610> out<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.730> foolproof<00:00:15.179> strategy<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.929> do

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
figured out a foolproof strategy to do

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.750 
figured out a foolproof strategy to do
it<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.980> think<00:00:17.130> this<00:00:17.250> will<00:00:17.369> help<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.580> lot<00:00:17.699> of

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
it and I think this will help a lot of

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.859 
it and I think this will help a lot of
people<00:00:17.850> because<00:00:18.180> it's<00:00:18.330> probably<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.750> most

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
people because it's probably the most

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.359 
people because it's probably the most
annoying<00:00:19.380> achievement<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:19.980> get<00:00:20.130> if<00:00:20.279> you're

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
annoying achievement to get if you're

annoying achievement to get if you're
actually<00:00:20.550> intending<00:00:21.240> on<00:00:21.270> going<00:00:21.330> for<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:21.960> it's

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
actually intending on going for it it's

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.750 
actually intending on going for it it's
going<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.680> be<00:00:22.920> named<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.340> it's<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.580> stupid

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760

guys and there's always three there is
ok<00:01:28.560> now<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.399> is<00:01:29.580> it<00:01:29.759> basically<00:01:30.479> as<00:01:30.810> soon<00:01:30.840> as

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
ok now this is it basically as soon as

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.969 
ok now this is it basically as soon as
we<00:01:31.170> step<00:01:31.380> off<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:32.270> faster<00:01:33.270> all<00:01:34.110> right<00:01:34.259> now<00:01:34.410> as

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
we step off this faster all right now as

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.740 
we step off this faster all right now as
soon<00:01:35.130> as<00:01:35.280> we<00:01:35.340> step<00:01:35.520> off<00:01:35.550> this<00:01:35.789> bus<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.450> believe

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
soon as we step off this bus I believe

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.630 
soon as we step off this bus I believe
it's<00:01:36.899> that<00:01:37.050> building<00:01:37.590> there<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:38.250> will<00:01:38.340> fall

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
it's that building there that will fall

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.380 
it's that building there that will fall
on<00:01:38.670> two<00:01:39.390> soldiers<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:40.050> have<00:01:40.140> yet<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.380> spawn<00:01:41.390> I

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
on two soldiers that have yet to spawn I

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.880 
on two soldiers that have yet to spawn I
think<00:01:42.810> we<00:01:42.869> can<00:01:42.990> just<00:01:43.110> see<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> hint<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
think we can just see a hint of the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.380 
think we can just see a hint of the
torch<00:01:44.190> in<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.550> distance<00:01:44.940> maybe<00:01:45.119> they<00:01:45.270> have

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
torch in the distance maybe they have

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.320 
torch in the distance maybe they have
spawned<00:01:45.690> basically<00:01:46.619> um<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.670> tried<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.210> many

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
spawned basically um I tried so many
