00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.790
Upin! Ipin! Where do you think you're going?

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.440
Hurry, Upin! We're going to be late!

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.500
Whoa!

00:00:24.867 --> 00:00:28.784
Heartwarming Lessons.
Part 2.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.420
Upin, you've been crying for three days.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.450
I'm the one with the broken leg, not you.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.560
I just feel bad for you...

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.810
See what happens to naughty kids?

00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:56.982
Stop it, Kak.
Can't you see he's hurt?

00:00:56.982 --> 00:00:58.685
All right.

00:00:58.685 --> 00:01:00.547
Here, finish this.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.940
What about mine?

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.110
Your leg's not broken.
Get it yourself.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.310
Ow, my tummy's hurt!

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.520
Help me, Kak. It hurts!

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.330
That's enough.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.260
Here.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.600
Thanks!

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.670
Don't cry!

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.800
I like it! I like it!
- That's right. I like it, too!

00:01:48.636 --> 00:01:51.021
Hey, Upin! You're alone?

00:01:51.021 --> 00:01:52.522
Where's Ipin?

00:01:52.522 --> 00:01:54.419
At home.

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:56.071
His leg's broken...

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.120
You're kidding!
- Broken?

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.750
Two, three legs broken.
How did it happen?

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.280
I know. He fell down the stairs.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.310
Upin, is that true?

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.460
Yeah...

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.150
So, he can't walk? Poor Ipin...

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.700
No need. He's having
more fun at home.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.240
He can eat whatever he wants.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.120
You're right, Mail!
How did you know that?

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.170
I broke my leg before.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.150
I got to eat all day!

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.590
Can we go see him later?

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.580
Sure!
- Okay.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.830
You're heavy...

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.810
Upin...

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:50.950
Give me that.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.840
You're being bossy. Stop it!

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.450
Here.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.690
Thanks, big brother!

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.510
Upin! Ipin!

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.650
They're here!

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.840
Come in!

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.430
Where is he? Where is he?
- I want to see!

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.580
Ipin, what happened?
- Let me see!

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.670
Where's Ipin?

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.492
Here, Ipin. I brought some oranges.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.970
Man, it's really broken...

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.910
Wow, it's hard!

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.250
Hey, don't touch it!
- You'll hurt him.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.920
But I didn't hurt him!

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.230
Ipin, does it still hurt?

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.270
No. But I can't walk yet...

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.150
When can you walk?

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:42.980
I don't know.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.130
Poor Ipin...
- It's going to take a while.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.680
Get well soon!
So you can go to school again.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.160
Yeah, and play marbles!

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.540
Marbles? I brought some!

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.710
Let's go play!

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:56.660
Let's go!

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.840
Come on!
- Hurry, let's play!

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.700
Upin! Upin!

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.700
What do you want?

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.460
That!

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.430
This one?

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.980
No, wait!

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.350
That one!

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:31.910
It's fried chicken!

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.800
But there's only one.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.220
Can we share?

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.500
No!

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.920
That's mine.

00:04:54.052 --> 00:04:55.509
Can I have one of these?

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:57.093
No, you can't!

00:04:57.093 --> 00:04:59.916
These are all...

00:04:59.916 --> 00:05:01.097
... mine!

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.330
Hmph, whatever!

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.820
I'm going to play.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.790
Upin...

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.160
What now?

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.440
I want to come, too...

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:33.630
Come on.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.880
You can't play.
Just sit and watch, okay?

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:52.330
Okay...

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.680
I'm going to win this time!

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.180
Ipin!

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.710
Hurry, Upin!
- Come on!

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.380
We're going to start!
- Let's go, Upin.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.970
Upin!

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:05.990
Just a bite.

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:12.530
Yummy!

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.800
Watch this!
- Come on!

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.720
To be continued...
