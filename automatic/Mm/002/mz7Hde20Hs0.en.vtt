bass lesson previously we covered all of
the<00:00:09.650> seven<00:00:10.010> modes<00:00:10.480> now<00:00:11.480> that<00:00:11.810> you<00:00:11.870> have<00:00:11.930> these

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
the seven modes now that you have these

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.179 
the seven modes now that you have these
seven<00:00:12.740> modes<00:00:13.340> scales<00:00:14.380> you<00:00:15.380> need<00:00:15.559> to<00:00:15.710> kind<00:00:16.070> of

seven modes scales you need to kind of

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:18.400 
seven modes scales you need to kind of
practice<00:00:16.640> them<00:00:16.789> and<00:00:17.029> learn<00:00:17.689> how<00:00:17.720> they<00:00:18.050> relate

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
practice them and learn how they relate

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.490 
practice them and learn how they relate
to<00:00:18.439> really<00:00:18.950> fully<00:00:19.130> understand<00:00:19.820> them<00:00:20.230> I'd<00:00:21.230> like

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
to really fully understand them I'd like

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.529 
to really fully understand them I'd like
to<00:00:21.650> show<00:00:21.920> you<00:00:21.980> is<00:00:22.220> how<00:00:22.400> do<00:00:22.789> you<00:00:22.940> can<00:00:23.060> chain<00:00:23.330> them

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
to show you is how do you can chain them

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:24.880 
to show you is how do you can chain them
together<00:00:23.660> and<00:00:24.080> it's<00:00:24.289> a<00:00:24.380> cool<00:00:24.590> exercise

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
together and it's a cool exercise

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.500 
together and it's a cool exercise
because<00:00:25.250> it<00:00:25.340> also<00:00:25.490> helps<00:00:25.820> you<00:00:25.910> kind<00:00:26.090> of<00:00:26.180> figure

because it also helps you kind of figure

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.840 
because it also helps you kind of figure
out<00:00:26.660> your<00:00:26.840> fingerboard<00:00:27.140> a<00:00:27.410> little<00:00:27.590> bit<00:00:27.850> let's

green<00:00:55.120> and<00:00:56.120> CIO<00:00:58.299> now<00:00:59.299> I<00:00:59.359> chose<00:00:59.719> those<00:00:59.989> roots

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:00.319 
green and CIO now I chose those roots

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:02.619 
green and CIO now I chose those roots
because<00:01:00.739> they<00:01:00.949> all<00:01:01.159> relate<00:01:01.639> to<00:01:01.850> C<00:01:02.059> major<00:01:02.299> and

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
because they all relate to C major and

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.359 
because they all relate to C major and
what<00:01:03.049> I<00:01:03.079> mean<00:01:03.229> by<00:01:03.289> that<00:01:03.440> if<00:01:03.709> you<00:01:03.799> took<00:01:03.949> any<00:01:04.190> of

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
what I mean by that if you took any of

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.160 
what I mean by that if you took any of
those<00:01:04.460> modes<00:01:04.790> and<00:01:05.089> you<00:01:05.449> sat<00:01:05.750> down<00:01:05.780> and<00:01:06.020> figured

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
those modes and you sat down and figured

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.780 
those modes and you sat down and figured
out<00:01:06.440> the<00:01:06.620> notes<00:01:06.800> you'd<00:01:07.010> realize<00:01:07.340> all<00:01:07.640> the

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
out the notes you'd realize all the

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.400 
out the notes you'd realize all the
notes<00:01:08.000> for<00:01:08.180> sure<00:01:08.330> had<00:01:08.810> no<00:01:08.960> sharps<00:01:09.260> or<00:01:09.350> flats

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410 
notes for sure had no sharps or flats

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.710 
notes for sure had no sharps or flats
they<00:01:09.770> were<00:01:09.830> all<00:01:09.950> natural<00:01:10.430> notes<00:01:10.610> let's<00:01:11.540> try

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
they were all natural notes let's try

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.320 
they were all natural notes let's try
one<00:01:11.930> let's<00:01:12.140> go<00:01:12.260> to<00:01:12.320> that<00:01:12.590> F<00:01:12.770> Lydian<00:01:13.220> we<00:01:13.970> have<00:01:14.060> f

you<00:01:25.910> can<00:01:26.000> see<00:01:26.180> that<00:01:26.210> since<00:01:26.750> they<00:01:26.930> all<00:01:27.140> have<00:01:27.170> the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:27.730 
you can see that since they all have the

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.090 
you can see that since they all have the
same<00:01:28.730> note<00:01:29.420> selections<00:01:30.260> meaning<00:01:30.590> no<00:01:30.770> sharps

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
same note selections meaning no sharps

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.950 
same note selections meaning no sharps
and<00:01:31.190> flats<00:01:31.280> they're<00:01:31.670> all<00:01:31.790> natural<00:01:32.060> notes<00:01:32.420> they

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
and flats they're all natural notes they

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.310 
and flats they're all natural notes they
all<00:01:33.110> relate<00:01:33.410> to<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.710> key<00:01:33.890> of<00:01:34.010> C<00:01:35.080> there's<00:01:36.080> so

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
all relate to the key of C there's so

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.810 
all relate to the key of C there's so
much<00:01:36.380> complexity<00:01:36.980> we<00:01:37.160> can<00:01:37.280> get<00:01:37.400> into<00:01:37.610> that's

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
much complexity we can get into that's

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.700 
much complexity we can get into that's
really<00:01:38.060> beyond<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:38.480> scope<00:01:38.720> of<00:01:38.900> a<00:01:39.260> two<00:01:39.410> to<00:01:39.530> five

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
really beyond the scope of a two to five

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.650 
really beyond the scope of a two to five
minute<00:01:39.980> lesson<00:01:40.340> but<00:01:40.910> what<00:01:41.180> I'd<00:01:41.300> like<00:01:41.330> you<00:01:41.480> do

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.630 
minute lesson but what I'd like you do
is<00:01:41.780> practice<00:01:42.080> them<00:01:42.530> chained<00:01:42.860> in<00:01:43.070> that<00:01:43.310> fashion

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
is practice them chained in that fashion

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.180 
is practice them chained in that fashion
now<00:01:44.210> silly<00:01:44.930> just<00:01:45.110> practice<00:01:45.500> just<00:01:45.770> what<00:01:45.920> i<00:01:45.950> did

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
now silly just practice just what i did

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.610 
now silly just practice just what i did
in<00:01:46.370> the<00:01:46.610> key<00:01:46.790> of<00:01:46.820> C<00:01:46.940> see<00:01:47.810> i<00:01:47.840> own<00:01:48.140> and<00:01:48.320> D<00:01:48.440> Dorian

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
in the key of C see i own and D Dorian

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.100 
in the key of C see i own and D Dorian
and<00:01:49.070> so<00:01:49.730> on<00:01:49.850> so<00:01:49.880> forth<00:01:50.060> then<00:01:50.810> you're<00:01:50.960> going<00:01:51.050> to

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
and so on so forth then you're going to

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.720 
and so on so forth then you're going to
want<00:01:51.230> to<00:01:51.290> practice<00:01:51.680> moving<00:01:52.100> them<00:01:52.280> like<00:01:52.490> we

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
want to practice moving them like we

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.970 
want to practice moving them like we
went<00:01:52.880> to<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.090> key<00:01:53.300> of<00:01:53.390> G<00:01:53.720> which<00:01:54.110> has<00:01:54.320> one<00:01:54.620> sharp

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
went to the key of G which has one sharp

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.240 
went to the key of G which has one sharp
which<00:01:55.220> is<00:01:55.340> f<00:01:55.550> we<00:01:55.820> have<00:01:56.000> G<00:01:56.300> Ionian<00:01:57.100> there's<00:01:58.100> the

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
which is f we have G Ionian there's the

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.740 
which is f we have G Ionian there's the
F<00:01:58.340> sharp

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
F sharp

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.440 
F sharp
then<00:02:00.470> we<00:02:00.620> have<00:02:00.710> a<00:02:00.920> Doran<00:02:01.960> there's<00:02:02.960> a<00:02:03.020> charm

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
then we have a Doran there's a charm

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.529 
then we have a Doran there's a charm
alright<00:02:05.450> then<00:02:05.870> we'd<00:02:06.170> have<00:02:06.200> be<00:02:06.920> fridge<00:02:07.280> in

your fingerboard when I didn't see that
really<00:02:41.120> showed<00:02:41.630> me<00:02:41.780> a<00:02:41.810> systematic<00:02:42.410> way<00:02:42.440> to

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
really showed me a systematic way to

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.070 
really showed me a systematic way to
play<00:02:42.920> every<00:02:43.250> natural<00:02:43.430> note<00:02:43.880> from<00:02:44.270> this<00:02:44.540> see<00:02:44.780> up

play every natural note from this see up
to<00:02:45.410> this<00:02:45.560> mmm<00:02:46.310> think<00:02:46.550> about<00:02:46.730> that<00:02:46.840> by<00:02:47.840> just

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
to this mmm think about that by just

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.780 
to this mmm think about that by just
memorizing<00:02:48.440> some<00:02:48.709> pattern<00:02:49.010> shapes<00:02:49.250> when<00:02:49.760> I

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
memorizing some pattern shapes when I

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.600 
memorizing some pattern shapes when I
moved<00:02:50.060> it<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.330> G<00:02:50.600> I<00:02:50.810> knew<00:02:51.200> every<00:02:51.620> note<00:02:51.800> from

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
moved it to G I knew every note from

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.990 
moved it to G I knew every note from
this<00:02:52.850> gene<00:02:53.090> to<00:02:53.510> this<00:02:53.690> G<00:02:53.900> in<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.500> key<00:02:54.860> of<00:02:54.890> G<00:02:55.160> and

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
this gene to this G in the key of G and

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.400 
this gene to this G in the key of G and
that's<00:02:56.180> going<00:02:56.330> to<00:02:56.390> pay<00:02:56.570> dividends<00:02:57.080> down<00:02:57.260> the

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
that's going to pay dividends down the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.100 
that's going to pay dividends down the
row<00:02:57.590> so<00:02:58.400> chaining<00:02:59.239> the<00:02:59.480> modes<00:02:59.690> together

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110

that's<00:03:00.470> what<00:03:00.650> I<00:03:00.680> want<00:03:00.860> you<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.070> practice<00:03:01.280> this

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
that's what I want you to practice this

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.090 
that's what I want you to practice this
with<00:03:02.480> this<00:03:02.660> video<00:03:03.020> and<00:03:03.260> make<00:03:03.890> sure<00:03:03.920> that
