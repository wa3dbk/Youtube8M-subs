00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:07.109
 hi guys alright personal ne in video 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.570
 Today I'll finally tell 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.950
 you here I found the beauty of the 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.349
 james cardigan 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.660
 I will not summarize or synopsis here 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.880
 in the video so it does not get too tense then 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.410
 I'll leave the link Scooby Doo her 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.720
 down here in the box 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.720
 information but I recommend that you 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.960
 check out the blog post because it has links 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.849
 have synopsis and usually if I forgot 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.160
 comment on the video here. 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.120
 your exclude the part that was extended 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.460
 confused 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.480
 I add a few paragraphs of text 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.340
 there in the post 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.719
 So I'm going to leave everything down here at 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.370
 information box 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.410
 if you do not know anything about the 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.350
 story the synopsis of the dark is already going 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.090
 a good idea of ​​how it starts and I 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.340
 I'll tell you what I most 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.190
 I liked it and I did not like the book. 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.250
 My favorite aspect of this book was 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.219
 how the jeans cardigan built the plot 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.620
 it divides into three timelines this 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.420
 could be a failure because it is very 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.670
 complicated to work with three 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.310
 lines and in this case it is about the 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.740
 same character who is the protagonist of 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.799
 katharine the first timeline is 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.810
 when she is 16 years old and there is a 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.280
 great family tragedy that she 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.530
 very guilty 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.229
 the next year she moves out of the house of 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.049
 parents to live with an aunt a way of 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.150
 try to overcome the event and in 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.570
 year she also goes through a great 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.549
 loss and beyond is her life goes 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.180
 change a lot thereafter because a 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.790
 another event will set the mode 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.060
 how will it continue despite these 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.060
 two consecutive years with two good losses 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.280
 tragedy and the last line of time is the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.299
 the gift of the character where she tells 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.790
 for the reader 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.460
 how she feels today based on the 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.159
 events of the past that are very 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.030
 and that in no way will it 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.340
 forget someday but she 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.380
 had a reason to continue not to 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.840
 give not to think about ending 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.920
 her life and that's more or less what 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.649
 gift 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.790
 We're going to know about Catharine 's focus. 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.590
 this book is 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.200
 drama despite having a bit of 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.780
 romance and address other issues such as 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.420
 family relationships and friendship 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.250
 but his focus is on the drama 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.290
 Another thing I really liked is that I 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.659
 I find them super realistic 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.250
 both by the choice of events 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:32.129
 especially the first one 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.629
 unfortunately it is more common than it should 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.269
 be in our society 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:38.489
 sometimes the yen cardigan she puts two 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.689
 three events really well 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.750
 striking 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:44.790
 it still gives room for some doubts 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.780
 adolescence that is catarina and the 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.930
 other characters that make up the group 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.700
 has this book also 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.290
 much with my psychological I stayed 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.329
 thinking a lot about what is the height 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.030
 placed here both events 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:02.310
 more striking than day to day I 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.019
 I really liked this book because it has 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.730
 a different aspect from other 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.840
 I've already complained 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.609
 a lot here 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.980
 if you 're coming now you 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:13.739
 you will eventually notice the 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.190
 The book is what I think contemporaries 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.379
 with very top teenagers or young people 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.959
 so they do not transgress the rule to 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:24.000
 I'm a little surreal and in that book the 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.449
 characters make it they take 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.639
 some decisions without thinking and without regret 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:32.819
 the consequences at last I mean 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:34.979
 that even when you already know more or 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:38.370
 less than what happened mainly in 

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:42.030
 relation to the first tragedy still 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.780
 the scene is very strong the dn cardigan writes 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.060
 even the full details of what happened 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.250
 in all the days of tragedy and 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.889
 most striking events 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.919
 then gives a certain annoyance is nothing 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:59.220
 so impossible to motto this makes you think 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:01.349
 much about how people act 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.090
 and they react today 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.579
 well I wanted to make a video a bit more 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.319
 not to spoil the surprise of 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.599
 No one, I hope, has woken you. 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.909
 even if it is a little bit of your 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:15.060
 Curiosity I did not give maximum quotation 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:16.919
 for him because it's the dn cardigan writes 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.989
 some things that in the description of 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.630
 scenes has become very clear at times she 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.360
 puts in the dialogues of the characters 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.800
 I smoked I found this a little 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.450
 unnecessary and also because it has a 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.820
 certain moment of the book that goes 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.100
 there is a break between the two 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.470
 characters and will spend a lot of time 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.840
 if they meet again then because she 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.280
 I was going to tell 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.120
 break and spend a lot of time 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.310
 great 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.980
 I thought she might have sandwiched 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.780
 there some other scene to not stay 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.420
 so far 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.100
 an event on the other but that's it 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.680
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.610
 video accompanies the girl's instant at 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.290
