00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
the process but it is definitely easiest

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.660 
the process but it is definitely easiest
to<00:01:19.140> how<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.380> deal<00:01:19.619> with<00:01:19.650> those<00:01:19.950> two<00:01:20.189> parts<00:01:20.520> then

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
same even bother doing that then he will

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.880 
same even bother doing that then he will
also<00:01:50.729> break<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.210> graves<00:01:51.600> if<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.049> try<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.619> use

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
also break the graves if you try to use

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.950 
also break the graves if you try to use
the<00:01:53.009> same<00:01:53.220> tag<00:01:53.460> figure<00:01:53.939> with<00:01:54.270> first<00:01:54.540> two<00:01:54.689> part

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
the same tag figure with first two part

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.680 
the same tag figure with first two part
so<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.229> doesn't

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
so it doesn't

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.270 
so it doesn't
you<00:01:56.170> need<00:01:56.320> to<00:01:56.500> have<00:01:58.260> lots<00:01:59.260> of<00:01:59.470> space<00:01:59.890> between

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
you need to have lots of space between

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.750 
you need to have lots of space between
you<00:02:00.460> and<00:02:00.700> him<00:02:01.800> that<00:02:02.800> way<00:02:02.980> you<00:02:03.040> can<00:02:03.280> avoid<00:02:03.460> his
