destruction changing this is actually

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.340 
destruction changing this is actually
just<00:01:27.080> a<00:01:27.200> simple<00:01:27.470> theory<00:01:27.740> of<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:29.390> catch<00:01:29.660> shelf

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
just a simple theory of the catch shelf

and<00:01:37.910> changing<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:38.300> flow<00:01:38.750> but<00:01:39.380> I<00:01:39.410> made<00:01:39.650> it<00:01:39.770> a

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
and changing the flow but I made it a

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.580 
and changing the flow but I made it a
point<00:01:39.860> when<00:01:40.610> one<00:01:40.850> clip<00:01:41.690> and<00:01:41.960> maybe<00:01:42.229> have<00:01:42.500> to

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
point when one clip and maybe have to

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.930 
point when one clip and maybe have to
actually<00:01:42.800> switch<00:01:43.010> the<00:01:43.130> hand<00:01:43.340> of<00:01:43.400> it<00:01:43.490> here

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
actually switch the hand of it here

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.180 
actually switch the hand of it here
you<00:01:44.150> swish<00:01:44.360> hand<00:01:44.540> off<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:44.810> feed<00:01:45.080> that<00:01:46.009> one

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
you swish hand off the feed that one

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.800 
you swish hand off the feed that one
should<00:01:46.310> come<00:01:46.460> into<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:46.759> shelf<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.390> clip<00:01:47.630> and

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
should come into the shelf the clip and

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.430 
should come into the shelf the clip and
back<00:01:48.380> again<00:01:48.640> and<00:01:49.640> turn<00:01:49.820> it<00:01:49.880> off<00:01:50.229> you<00:01:51.229> can<00:01:51.350> do

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
back again and turn it off you can do

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.070 
back again and turn it off you can do
this<00:01:51.619> by<00:01:51.830> the<00:01:51.890> way<00:01:52.479> it's<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:53.600> third<00:01:53.900> one<00:01:54.050> that

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
this by the way it's the third one that

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.620 
this by the way it's the third one that
I<00:01:54.229> taught<00:01:54.470> here<00:01:55.250> here<00:01:55.610> one<00:01:55.850> two<00:01:56.000> three

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
I taught here here one two three

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.160 
I taught here here one two three
so<00:01:57.380> when<00:01:57.500> he<00:01:57.560> punches<00:01:57.950> I<00:01:58.750> mean<00:01:59.750> that<00:01:59.840> inside

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
so when he punches I mean that inside

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.719 
so when he punches I mean that inside
shot<00:02:00.470> and<00:02:00.740> now<00:02:00.860> view<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:01.130> opinion<00:02:01.580> to<00:02:01.610> the

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
shot and now view the opinion to the

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.790 
shot and now view the opinion to the
fourth<00:02:02.000> now<00:02:02.869> I<00:02:02.899> can<00:02:03.020> do<00:02:03.080> the<00:02:03.170> ATA<00:02:03.380> before<00:02:03.649> that

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
fourth now I can do the ATA before that

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.080 
fourth now I can do the ATA before that
the<00:02:03.860> second<00:02:04.130> time<00:02:04.280> I<00:02:04.310> do<00:02:04.520> it<00:02:04.580> a<00:02:04.640> few<00:02:04.759> times<00:02:04.820> to

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
the second time I do it a few times to

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.430 
the second time I do it a few times to
