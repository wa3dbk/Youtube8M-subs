00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.830
 hi my name is diaz and this is mine 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.830
 brother Dimash 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.560
 I am twelve and I want to understand the axis 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.169
 create a plane something took off sit down i 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.599
 no incident how to launch rockets 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:29.390
 to colonize mars and will open 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:32.900
 new spaces I want to build and 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.300
 do something with your own hands leading 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:41.870
 teaching methods are not able to prepare 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:43.699
 whether i am the future hi my name is iskander 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.370
 and we are a company of Yandiyev 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:49.640
 we developed a cat tool will help 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.489
 diaz and the children of the whole world learn again 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:56.619
 programming electronics so they are in 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:59.269
 future themselves were able to create technology 

00:00:56.619 --> 00:01:00.170
 in our team are leading experts in 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.850
 field of electronics 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.710
 artificial lecturer in the field 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.659
 industrial design and game development 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.590
 which puts the soul in for days 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.970
 creating indie pop indie was this module 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.860
 on the robotic constructor which 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.689
 can be assembled in any configuration and 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.329
 program from our intuitive 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.490
 application for giving a logic circuit 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:20.720
 commands different module as a motor gd 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.850
 crane distance sensor 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.670
 geos can clearly see how andy was 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.400
 execute its programming logic to it 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.470
 it is also possible to attach the blocks lie with andy 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.850
 body as will understand what not to program 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.080
 so difficult and that through 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.710
 programming can be developed 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.540
 simultaneously both creativity and logic we 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.430
 want to run hundreds of pilot nicks and 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.990
 test them with children from all over the world 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.030
 perfection is not for you 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.310
 learning and for that we need your 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.990
 help our product will let you dive 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.760
 into science through gameplay 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.520
 and will also help develop in children how 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.460
 technically so and our creative skills 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.010
 development will drastically change the process 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.940
 learning programming and prepare 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.659
 new generation 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.659
 innovators
