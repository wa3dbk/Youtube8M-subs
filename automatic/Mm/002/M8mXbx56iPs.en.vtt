Schieffelin<00:01:24.710> yeah<00:01:25.010> in<00:01:25.220> this<00:01:25.490> guy<00:01:25.760> that<00:01:25.940> he's

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
Schieffelin yeah in this guy that he's

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.430 
Schieffelin yeah in this guy that he's
fighting<00:01:26.300> I<00:01:26.540> guess<00:01:26.720> backed<00:01:27.020> out<00:01:27.200> of<00:01:27.229> a<00:01:27.409> fight

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
fighting I guess backed out of a fight

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.550 
fighting I guess backed out of a fight
last<00:01:27.890> year<00:01:28.070> so<00:01:28.970> this<00:01:29.150> year<00:01:29.210> I<00:01:29.450> think<00:01:29.869> he's

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
last year so this year I think he's

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.249 
last year so this year I think he's
gonna<00:01:31.630> he's<00:01:32.630> feeling<00:01:32.930> good<00:01:33.020> about<00:01:33.080> himself

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
gonna he's feeling good about himself

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.219 
gonna he's feeling good about himself
but<00:01:33.710> he's<00:01:34.520> up<00:01:34.700> against<00:01:34.970> the<00:01:35.090> big<00:01:35.270> opponent

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
but he's up against the big opponent

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.469 
but he's up against the big opponent
well<00:01:36.979> I<00:01:37.250> think<00:01:37.550> that<00:01:37.820> the<00:01:37.909> city<00:01:38.119> of<00:01:38.210> Lawrence

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
well I think that the city of Lawrence

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.210 
well I think that the city of Lawrence
has<00:01:38.690> to<00:01:38.840> get<00:01:38.960> behind<00:01:39.140> Alexis<00:01:39.770> because<00:01:39.950> I<00:01:40.159> think

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
has to get behind Alexis because I think

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.109 
has to get behind Alexis because I think
both<00:01:40.520> of<00:01:40.580> these<00:01:40.820> guys

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
both of these guys

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.719 
both of these guys
Alexis<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:41.960> Augusto<00:01:42.430> represent<00:01:43.430> the<00:01:43.580> good

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
Alexis and Augusto represent the good

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.060 
Alexis and Augusto represent the good
things<00:01:43.940> that<00:01:44.000> can<00:01:44.149> happen<00:01:44.360> when<00:01:45.050> people<00:01:45.409> take

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
things that can happen when people take

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.520 
things that can happen when people take
charge<00:01:46.610> and<00:01:47.000> guy<00:01:47.570> like<00:01:47.750> Shawn<00:01:47.960> finally<00:01:48.289> takes

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
charge and guy like Shawn finally takes

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.889 
charge and guy like Shawn finally takes
them<00:01:48.710> over<00:01:48.830> and<00:01:49.340> kind<00:01:50.179> of<00:01:50.270> pushes<00:01:50.570> them<00:01:50.750> I

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
them over and kind of pushes them I

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:52.690 
them over and kind of pushes them I
think<00:01:51.140> alexis<00:01:51.590> is<00:01:51.740> probably<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.429> world's

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
think alexis is probably the world's

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.190
