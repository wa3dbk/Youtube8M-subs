the end of the crankshaft you'll have to
get<00:01:34.799> in<00:01:34.950> there<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.340> pry<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.150> work<00:01:36.360> it

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
get in there and pry it and work it

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.840 
get in there and pry it and work it
loose<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.770> will<00:01:37.979> allow<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.280> as<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.670> can

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.050 
it's on the bench I get a good chance to
check<00:01:49.200> out<00:01:49.380> things<00:01:49.890> other<00:01:50.159> than<00:01:50.369> just<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.880> leak

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
check out things other than just a leak

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.670 
check out things other than just a leak
so<00:01:51.810> I'm<00:01:51.899> going<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.110> show<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.290> some<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.619> the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
so I'm going to show you some of the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.800 
so I'm going to show you some of the
things<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:52.979> found<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:54.240> particular

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
things I found on this particular

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.590 
things I found on this particular
transmission

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.560 

I<00:01:59.520> knew<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.670> leak<00:02:00.820> was<00:02:01.000> coming<00:02:01.270> out<00:02:01.360> of<00:02:01.420> the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
I knew the leak was coming out of the

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.240 
I knew the leak was coming out of the
front<00:02:01.750> of<00:02:01.870> transmission<00:02:02.500> but<00:02:02.680> I<00:02:02.740> had<00:02:02.979> to<00:02:03.100> find

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
front of transmission but I had to find

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.969 
front of transmission but I had to find
out<00:02:03.460> just<00:02:03.970> exactly<00:02:04.120> where<00:02:04.750> so<00:02:05.620> I<00:02:05.650> went<00:02:05.920> ahead

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
out just exactly where so I went ahead

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.850 
out just exactly where so I went ahead
and<00:02:06.100> pulled<00:02:06.370> the<00:02:06.520> torque<00:02:06.760> converter<00:02:06.880> off<00:02:07.300> and

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
and pulled the torque converter off and

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.410 
and pulled the torque converter off and
I<00:02:08.860> cleaned<00:02:09.220> this<00:02:09.429> area<00:02:09.789> in<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.030> front<00:02:10.179> here

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
I cleaned this area in the front here

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.780 
I cleaned this area in the front here
last<00:02:10.630> night<00:02:10.899> and<00:02:11.800> I<00:02:11.890> come<00:02:12.130> back<00:02:12.310> this<00:02:12.520> morning

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
last night and I come back this morning

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.740 
last night and I come back this morning
and<00:02:13.740> sure<00:02:14.740> enough<00:02:15.040> if<00:02:15.580> you<00:02:16.300> look<00:02:16.330> right<00:02:16.690> here

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
and sure enough if you look right here

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.550 
and sure enough if you look right here
at<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.230> seal<00:02:17.560> it's<00:02:18.340> fairly<00:02:18.760> dry<00:02:19.110> but<00:02:20.110> if<00:02:20.410> you

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
at the seal it's fairly dry but if you

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.680 
at the seal it's fairly dry but if you
look<00:02:20.830> right<00:02:21.070> down<00:02:21.310> here<00:02:21.550> at<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.790> pump<00:02:22.090> cover<00:02:22.390> I

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
look right down here at the pump cover I

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.070 
look right down here at the pump cover I
see<00:02:23.530> new<00:02:23.740> wetness<00:02:24.160> so<00:02:25.090> that<00:02:25.270> means<00:02:25.600> in<00:02:25.930> this

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
see new wetness so that means in this

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.590 
see new wetness so that means in this
particular<00:02:26.260> transmission<00:02:27.070> the<00:02:27.550> primary<00:02:28.270> leak

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
particular transmission the primary leak

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.990 
particular transmission the primary leak
is<00:02:28.870> not<00:02:29.620> through<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.160> torque<00:02:30.370> converter<00:02:30.490> seal

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
is not through the torque converter seal

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.580 
is not through the torque converter seal
but<00:02:31.870> it's<00:02:32.050> through<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.500> pump<00:02:33.489> housing<00:02:34.470> one<00:02:35.470> of

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
but it's through the pump housing one of

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.350 
but it's through the pump housing one of
the<00:02:35.680> other<00:02:35.830> indications<00:02:36.550> of<00:02:36.700> this<00:02:36.850> is<00:02:37.060> if<00:02:37.209> your

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
the other indications of this is if your

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.180 
the other indications of this is if your
transmission<00:02:37.630> leaks<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.410> lot<00:02:38.530> of<00:02:38.680> fluid<00:02:38.980> just

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
transmission leaks a lot of fluid just

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.120 
transmission leaks a lot of fluid just
sitting<00:02:39.580> if<00:02:39.820> it<00:02:40.750> leaks<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:41.050> lot<00:02:41.170> of<00:02:41.320> fluid<00:02:41.680> after

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
sitting if it leaks a lot of fluid after

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.510 
sitting if it leaks a lot of fluid after
you<00:02:42.310> drive<00:02:42.700> it<00:02:42.910> and<00:02:43.150> then<00:02:44.080> stops<00:02:44.680> it's<00:02:45.250> usually

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
you drive it and then stops it's usually

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.850 
you drive it and then stops it's usually
a<00:02:45.730> problem<00:02:45.970> with<00:02:46.600> this<00:02:46.870> torque<00:02:47.560> converter

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
a problem with this torque converter

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.310 
a problem with this torque converter
seal<00:02:48.130> but<00:02:48.940> if<00:02:49.060> it's<00:02:49.209> leaking<00:02:49.480> fluid<00:02:49.959> all<00:02:50.140> the

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
seal but if it's leaking fluid all the

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.470 
seal but if it's leaking fluid all the
time<00:02:50.560> just<00:02:50.590> sitting<00:02:51.220> in<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.430> garage<00:02:51.580> that's

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
time just sitting in the garage that's

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.020 
time just sitting in the garage that's
usually<00:02:52.989> a<00:02:53.019> good<00:02:53.200> indication<00:02:53.890> that<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.820> leak

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
usually a good indication that the leak

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.960 
usually a good indication that the leak
is<00:02:55.300> coming<00:02:56.140> out<00:02:56.470> of<00:02:56.500> this<00:02:56.769> pump<00:02:57.190> cover<00:02:57.459> what

include a large paper gasket that you'll

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.970 
include a large paper gasket that you'll
need<00:03:54.670> for<00:03:54.910> that<00:03:55.060> housing<00:03:55.570> and<00:03:55.720> of<00:03:56.350> course<00:03:56.650> I

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
need for that housing and of course I

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.390 
need for that housing and of course I

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
always anytime I pull a transmission I

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.240 
always anytime I pull a transmission I
always<00:04:00.700> replace<00:04:01.510> the<00:04:02.260> torque<00:04:02.530> converter<00:04:02.680> seal

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
always replace the torque converter seal

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.009 
always replace the torque converter seal
with<00:04:03.489> a<00:04:03.519> new<00:04:03.790> one<00:04:03.970> there<00:04:04.510> are<00:04:04.660> some<00:04:04.840> other

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
with a new one there are some other

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.900 
with a new one there are some other
places<00:04:05.500> you<00:04:05.590> want<00:04:05.799> to<00:04:05.890> check<00:04:06.100> for<00:04:06.160> leaks<00:04:06.549> while

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
places you want to check for leaks while

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.020 
places you want to check for leaks while
the<00:04:07.090> transmission<00:04:07.810> is<00:04:07.959> on<00:04:08.109> the<00:04:08.260> bench<00:04:09.030> you

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
the transmission is on the bench you

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.970 
the transmission is on the bench you
know<00:04:10.060> we<00:04:10.269> already<00:04:10.419> talked<00:04:10.900> about<00:04:11.049> the<00:04:11.320> Pangaea

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
know we already talked about the Pangaea

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.660 
know we already talked about the Pangaea
get<00:04:12.159> in<00:04:12.310> in<00:04:12.670> a<00:04:12.760> previous<00:04:13.239> video<00:04:13.920> but<00:04:14.920> it<00:04:15.610> is

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
get in in a previous video but it is

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.060 
get in in a previous video but it is
possible<00:04:16.510> that<00:04:16.690> these<00:04:16.870> piston<00:04:17.530> covers<00:04:17.889> can

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
possible that these piston covers can

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.009 
possible that these piston covers can
also<00:04:18.280> leak<00:04:18.669> they<00:04:19.180> are<00:04:19.359> sealed<00:04:19.630> with<00:04:19.840> o-rings

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
also leak they are sealed with o-rings

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.469 
also leak they are sealed with o-rings
and<00:04:20.590> you'll<00:04:21.130> see<00:04:21.340> wetness<00:04:21.760> right<00:04:22.000> at<00:04:22.150> the<00:04:22.240> base

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
and you'll see wetness right at the base

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.230 
and you'll see wetness right at the base
here<00:04:22.870> if<00:04:23.199> there's<00:04:23.500> a<00:04:23.560> problem<00:04:24.000> you<00:04:25.000> can<00:04:25.120> also

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
here if there's a problem you can also

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.659 
here if there's a problem you can also
experience<00:04:25.990> a<00:04:26.260> leak<00:04:26.440> on<00:04:26.620> the<00:04:26.680> backside<00:04:27.280> coming

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
experience a leak on the backside coming

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.510 
experience a leak on the backside coming
out<00:04:27.760> of<00:04:27.880> the<00:04:27.940> shift<00:04:28.210> shaft<00:04:28.449> and<00:04:29.310> you'll<00:04:30.310> always

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
out of the shift shaft and you'll always

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.090 
out of the shift shaft and you'll always
want<00:04:30.729> to<00:04:30.850> take<00:04:31.030> a<00:04:31.060> look<00:04:31.300> at<00:04:31.479> the<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:32.620> rear<00:04:32.830> seal

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
want to take a look at the the rear seal

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.310 
want to take a look at the the rear seal
I<00:04:33.400> found<00:04:33.970> that<00:04:34.180> the<00:04:34.300> rear<00:04:34.479> seals<00:04:34.750> don't<00:04:34.960> leak

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
I found that the rear seals don't leak

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.360 
I found that the rear seals don't leak
as<00:04:35.560> badly<00:04:36.310> as<00:04:36.580> the<00:04:37.150> front<00:04:37.449> and<00:04:37.770> oftentimes<00:04:38.770> I

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
as badly as the front and oftentimes I

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.800 
as badly as the front and oftentimes I
won't<00:04:39.580> replace<00:04:40.000> these<00:04:40.270> because<00:04:40.660> you<00:04:40.780> can

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
won't replace these because you can

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.900 
won't replace these because you can
replace<00:04:41.440> the<00:04:41.650> rear<00:04:41.830> seal<00:04:42.100> with<00:04:42.790> the

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
replace the rear seal with the

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.120 
replace the rear seal with the
transmission<00:04:43.360> of<00:04:43.540> the<00:04:43.600> car<00:04:43.810> but<00:04:44.470> look<00:04:44.830> at<00:04:44.949> here

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
transmission of the car but look at here

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.650 
transmission of the car but look at here
you<00:04:45.280> can<00:04:45.460> see<00:04:45.639> the<00:04:45.760> wetness<00:04:46.120> right<00:04:46.389> in<00:04:46.539> this

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
you can see the wetness right in this

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.050 
you can see the wetness right in this
area<00:04:46.900> and<00:04:47.289> when<00:04:48.039> I<00:04:48.070> started<00:04:48.430> looking<00:04:48.490> closely

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
area and when I started looking closely

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.640 
area and when I started looking closely
at<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.330> seal<00:04:49.660> I<00:04:49.690> grabbed<00:04:50.110> a<00:04:50.260> hold<00:04:50.440> of<00:04:50.530> this

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
at the seal I grabbed a hold of this

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.250 
at the seal I grabbed a hold of this
output<00:04:51.039> shaft<00:04:51.310> angle<00:04:51.630> look<00:04:52.630> at<00:04:52.720> that<00:04:52.930> I've<00:04:53.080> got

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
output shaft angle look at that I've got

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.420 
output shaft angle look at that I've got
some<00:04:53.440> movement<00:04:53.889> here<00:04:54.100> this<00:04:54.729> thing<00:04:55.060> is<00:04:55.240> loose

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
some movement here this thing is loose

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.860 
some movement here this thing is loose
that's<00:04:57.430> a<00:04:57.580> problem<00:04:58.000> you<00:04:58.030> can<00:04:58.240> actually<00:04:58.389> wear

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
that's a problem you can actually wear

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.350 
that's a problem you can actually wear
out<00:04:59.080> the<00:04:59.289> spline<00:04:59.650> on<00:04:59.979> the<00:05:00.100> output<00:05:00.460> shaft<00:05:00.729> if

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
out the spline on the output shaft if

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.510 
out the spline on the output shaft if
this<00:05:01.840> loosens<00:05:02.229> up<00:05:02.440> and<00:05:02.590> is<00:05:02.740> rattling<00:05:03.340> like

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
this loosens up and is rattling like

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.640 
this loosens up and is rattling like
this<00:05:03.760> so<00:05:03.910> we're<00:05:04.060> going<00:05:04.150> to<00:05:04.210> have<00:05:04.449> to<00:05:04.660> to<00:05:05.350> take

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
this so we're going to have to to take

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.680 
this so we're going to have to to take
that<00:05:05.710> nut<00:05:06.130> off<00:05:06.160> and<00:05:06.610> check<00:05:06.820> the<00:05:06.970> spline<00:05:07.300> and

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
that nut off and check the spline and

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.570 
that nut off and check the spline and
retighten<00:05:08.380> this<00:05:08.680> so<00:05:08.860> I'm<00:05:08.979> going<00:05:09.190> to<00:05:09.280> go<00:05:09.460> ahead

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
retighten this so I'm going to go ahead

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.480 
retighten this so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:05:09.850> plan<00:05:10.060> to<00:05:10.870> replace<00:05:11.169> this<00:05:11.560> rear<00:05:11.949> seal<00:05:12.220> at

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
and plan to replace this rear seal at

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.279 
and plan to replace this rear seal at
this<00:05:12.639> time<00:05:12.910> the<00:05:13.690> other<00:05:13.810> thing<00:05:13.990> you<00:05:14.050> want<00:05:14.169> to

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
this time the other thing you want to

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:15.779 
this time the other thing you want to
check<00:05:14.350> while<00:05:14.740> your<00:05:14.860> transmission<00:05:15.460> out<00:05:15.580> is

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
check while your transmission out is

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:18.870 
check while your transmission out is
your<00:05:15.940> driveline<00:05:16.450> assembly<00:05:17.220> look<00:05:18.220> closely<00:05:18.580> at

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
your driveline assembly look closely at

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.580 
your driveline assembly look closely at
the<00:05:19.060> Flex<00:05:19.330> distance<00:05:19.810> is<00:05:19.900> a<00:05:19.930> great<00:05:20.200> time<00:05:20.470> to

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
the Flex distance is a great time to

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.320 
the Flex distance is a great time to
replace<00:05:20.950> these<00:05:21.190> this<00:05:21.580> one<00:05:21.789> is<00:05:21.910> starting<00:05:22.240> to

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
replace these this one is starting to

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.540 
replace these this one is starting to
show<00:05:22.510> age<00:05:22.810> cracking<00:05:23.349> here<00:05:23.620> so<00:05:24.220> I've<00:05:24.370> gone

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
show age cracking here so I've gone

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.760 
show age cracking here so I've gone
ahead<00:05:24.729> and<00:05:24.880> ordered<00:05:25.240> two<00:05:25.660> new<00:05:25.810> flex<00:05:26.139> disks<00:05:26.500> for

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
ahead and ordered two new flex disks for

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.650 
ahead and ordered two new flex disks for
this<00:05:26.950> drive<00:05:27.220> shaft<00:05:27.250> you<00:05:28.120> can<00:05:28.270> see<00:05:28.450> a<00:05:28.479> little

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
this drive shaft you can see a little

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.659 
this drive shaft you can see a little
bulging<00:05:29.289> right<00:05:29.470> there<00:05:29.710> too<00:05:29.950> that<00:05:29.979> shows<00:05:30.430> that

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
bulging right there too that shows that

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:32.040 
bulging right there too that shows that
it<00:05:30.820> started<00:05:31.240> the<00:05:31.330> rubber<00:05:31.510> started<00:05:31.930> to

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050
