00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
weapon we know he used to be there due

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.500 
weapon we know he used to be there due
to<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.309> fact<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.760> he<00:01:02.850> has<00:01:03.030> extensive

so the zombies that are at Newtown are
caused<00:01:09.540> by<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.810> destination<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.650> 115<00:01:11.220> new

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
caused by the destination of the 115 new

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.149 
caused by the destination of the 115 new
being<00:01:11.820> tested<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:13.200> there<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.470> have<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.710> guys<00:01:13.799> I
