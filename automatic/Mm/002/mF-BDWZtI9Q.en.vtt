00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
techniques are used to do that to be

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.760 
techniques are used to do that to be
safe<00:05:19.340> number<00:05:19.970> one<00:05:20.150> is<00:05:20.300> above<00:05:20.660> all<00:05:20.870> is<00:05:21.470> it<00:05:21.620> be

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
safe number one is above all is it be

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.400
