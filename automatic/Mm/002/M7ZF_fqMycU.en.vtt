Dragon<00:00:32.460> Fire<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.790> absolutely<00:00:33.420> awful<00:00:33.600> but

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
Dragon Fire is absolutely awful but

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.780 
Dragon Fire is absolutely awful but
people<00:00:34.170> always<00:00:34.350> tell<00:00:34.739> me<00:00:34.770> all<00:00:35.309> we<00:00:35.489> should<00:00:35.640> use

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
people always tell me all we should use

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.920 
people always tell me all we should use
the<00:00:35.910> Dragon<00:00:36.210> Fire<00:00:36.360> it's<00:00:36.510> really<00:00:36.750> good

whenever<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.260> use<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.710> it's<00:00:38.040> absolutely<00:00:38.460> awful

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969

whenever I use it it's absolutely awful
i've<00:00:39.210> come<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.570> conclusion<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.290> is

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
i've come to the conclusion that it is

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.410 
i've come to the conclusion that it is
because<00:00:40.800> i<00:00:41.040> don't<00:00:41.640> know<00:00:41.700> how<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.940> use<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
because i don't know how to use it the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.670 
because i don't know how to use it the
killstreak<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.930> scores<00:00:43.170> free<00:00:43.350> whatever<00:00:43.620> you

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
killstreak the scores free whatever you

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.660 
killstreak the scores free whatever you
want<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.860> call<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.040> it's<00:00:44.219> probably<00:00:44.489> pretty

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
want to call it it's probably pretty

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.670 
want to call it it's probably pretty
decent<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:45.690> because<00:00:45.930> i'm<00:00:46.050> absolutely<00:00:46.260> awful

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
decent but because i'm absolutely awful

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.020 
decent but because i'm absolutely awful
with<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:47.039> i<00:00:47.070> tend<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.370> stay<00:00:47.550> away<00:00:47.579> from<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:48.000> as

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
with that i tend to stay away from it as

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.400 
with that i tend to stay away from it as
much<00:00:48.210> as<00:00:48.239> i<00:00:48.390> possibly<00:00:48.420> can<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:49.020> do<00:00:49.230> see<00:00:49.379> me
