00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.629
 if not I think that the team yesterday gave a 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.100
 good image I think that is what 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.770
 we are doing right now trying 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.480
 work to make a good team 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.130
 during this time I think we're 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.740
 working well little by little I think that 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.600
 we come picking up more more shape more 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.240
 as in form that emits that we play 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.369
 little by little many of the things well if 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.930
 I think they are matches or it is not very 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.210
 important because we are not going to 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.890
 play with big teams not 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.559
 we will try to live up to 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.540
 matches and we have to work it and that gives 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.400
 I believe that the beyond 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.680
 result we have to be a good 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.589
 match a good team and for the shock 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.239
 90 soon in the league if it's always 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:53.089
 important, I do not know how important to speak 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.890
 a little people are willing we are 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:57.530
 eager to try to start on time 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.170
 the best possible we have split 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.390
 you have to try to get something positive 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.089
 we will try is the last game of 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.200
 preseason hard hard to reach the 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.780
 best possible way good I think that 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.880
 I was in Betis, they always demand you give 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.070
 the most I do not think that a 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.420
 the efficiency is with us needs 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.360
 we also have to be at the height of 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.100
 them I think the technician can 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.170
 say that the season is very long 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.700
 what is that for what time is it for 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.890
 get in shape and I think the team 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.049
 we have a very good team to be able to do 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.640
 something beautiful that season but as I have 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.329
 said before I never have enough 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.069
 complicated there is too much party apart 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.689
 like me that the teams always during 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:41.360
 seasons there is always very little very little 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:44.000
 in a few point differences not me 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.939
 I think the key is to start the 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.950
 season this patient and know that 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.709
 the beginning does not end if one ends the 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.869
 final and says constant especially if what 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:56.299
 first and try to make a good block 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.459
 not a good team works hard and I think 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.020
 what are we doing because it is focused 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:01.869
 because this time is how this has done 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.399
 category that this is a team 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.530
 constant a team fighting a team 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:09.190
 that he fights all because he like I said 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.340
 before we will not give in 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.260
 at Christmas that this time that is 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.600
 here I have since it reaches the end and 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.490
 there are many teams we will try to do 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.260
 a good campaign based on work and 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.290
 of course there is much illusion in the 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.290
 team 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.099
 if not I think that each season is 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.230
 difficult and more competition comes too 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.700
 I think that everyone has to go to 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.379
 oneself to try to be at maximum 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.470
 level so that the subject can count on 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.650
 the 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.830
 yes I think I will try to be much more 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.570
 Vertical not come to get much more 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.090
 bottom line try to enter so that 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.340
 the forwards can see goals and the 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.750
 this truth to keep working diaz 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.730
 to get to the best possible 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.630
 beginning of the Italian season this 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.640
 hobby 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.590
 yes that message that we have the whole world 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.350
 clear notorious team and we have to be 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.360
 a team worked a compact team 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.680
 I do not think that every fellow Mr. 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.630
 very clear that we will work until the 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.790
 end side to try to fight for 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.560
 fight a position and as I said 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.930
 before the competition every time they are 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.930
 larger since behind it is at 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:18.340
 height of the circumstances I think that 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:20.410
 this category does not have no equipment 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.420
 favorite I do not think there's always 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.160
 surprises that happen as years goes by 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.600
 quite a surprise like this one is not going to 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.670
 keep going the same thing I do not think that 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.130
 we have to focus another attempt 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.750
 do things right on the floor and then 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.700
 we would arrive later to the others and 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.820
 that in this fundamental category is 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.760
 finishing what is active at home and then outside 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.170
 house there are difficult fields fields 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.940
 complicated to play but I think what 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.610
 more important is that at home take everything 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.410
 the positive that can be, I do not say 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.900
 whenever I do not know what happened I do not know 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.370
 or what passion I think in a team 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.260
 of so many players and the coach 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.610
 always try hard the best for the 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.920
 team and I think that at that time the 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.600
 coach considered that he had to 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.250
 game your partner had to respect the 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.130
 decision to keep working and wait for the 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.769
 moment that you regret that I give you for 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:09.130
 take advantage of it nothing else I did not have 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:11.230
 helped but I have to as I said 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.069
 before it is not and I have to demand with me 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.260
 same before 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.479
 think what people think 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.269
 but the most important thing is to think what 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:22.160
 how are you yourself how is it only 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.020
 as it is in shape I do not think that what 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.090
 turn faith this year you enter the 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.490
 focus on me to try to help the 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.229
 team I think very well the new 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.180
 they have fit well into the team and it looks 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.770
 who are looking forward to what 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.240
 team also then that we are and the 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.550
 people who have been from the subsidiary also the 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.229
 true that we are a good team you see 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.810
 that people are so committed and about 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:43.430
 everything there is a very good union we have is 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.500
 important that we are all the same 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.449
 line that we are all fighting for the 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.130
 same objective and I believe that I am 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.660
 seeing in both the companions both in 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.940
 the coaching staff as in the people who 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.180
 he works at the club all good me 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.070
 always always that the merger began 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.860
 by the player on the left no but 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.259
 well I think that one band or others what 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.180
 more important is your state moment 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:06.780
 of field and enjoy what you like 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.200
 make football 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.990
 it's a shame because we lose a great 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.720
 player 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.250
 this season and a game more than not 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.770
 I could help in the team but good 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.250
 how it came before simple football to 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:25.290
 those things hits you two we'll try in 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.669
 be good us so you do not get 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:30.120
 of absence of partner and above all 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:32.940
 we give him joy to me as I say 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.800
 always I myself my first virtues that I 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.230
 comes to line with what part of it 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.210
 front hits goals but that this one does not 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.950
 I will also try to be much more vertical 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.550
 try to get more to the area in the account 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.550
 of goal too 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.210
 well that's what I'm working 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.310
 this 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.630
 I tried to enter much more to the one 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:54.860
 shooting also is not the most 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:56.360
 important but I believe that I the past 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.699
 it happened not to do same I think that 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.169
 we are here as you well 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:02.720
 same you said we will not try to get there 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:04.699
 at the end of the season and say that step 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.770
 there is not as negative as year 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:10.010
 past and I think it happened to me was a 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.570
 time hard enough for everyone and I 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.729
 especially I had a really bad time in 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.430
 moments of this season but 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:18.770
 good as I said before the past 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.680
 already happened we will try to look later 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.090
 not if they serve us by regretting what has 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.400
 past we have to make a season 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.270
 this year for the team to be 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.830
 it deserves 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.690
 if I believe that the most important thing in a 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.790
 team is not joy I think that 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.290
 we are working on it recovers that 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.270
 luck of yes when there is joy in a 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.310
 team looks illusion is seen winning me 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.320
 I think the most important thing we will try 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.590
 recover joy can make a good 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.590
 season
