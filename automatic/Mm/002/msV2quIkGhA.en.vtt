how to insulate your hot tub

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.999 
how to insulate your hot tub
the<00:00:30.000> first<00:00:30.330> which<00:00:30.660> we<00:00:30.840> did<00:00:31.080> about<00:00:31.320> 15<00:00:31.560> years

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
the first which we did about 15 years

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.670 
the first which we did about 15 years
ago<00:00:32.160> was<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.520> full<00:00:32.850> foam<00:00:33.180> insulation<00:00:33.680> generally

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
ago was a full foam insulation generally

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.110 
ago was a full foam insulation generally
speaking<00:00:34.980> they<00:00:35.219> just<00:00:35.399> flipped<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.700> hot<00:00:35.910> tub

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
speaking they just flipped the hot tub

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.600 
speaking they just flipped the hot tub
upside<00:00:36.540> down<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.020> pour<00:00:37.559> foam<00:00:37.920> over<00:00:38.190> top<00:00:38.489> of

upside down and pour foam over top of

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.130 
upside down and pour foam over top of
the<00:00:38.670> plumbing<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.239> overtop<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.840> shell

cabinet not a bad way of insulating in

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.760 
cabinet not a bad way of insulating in
fact<00:00:45.149> fairly<00:00:45.570> inner<00:00:45.750> energy<00:00:46.140> efficient<00:00:46.590> but

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
fact fairly inner energy efficient but

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.529 
fact fairly inner energy efficient but
we<00:00:47.700> found<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.090> there<00:00:48.239> was<00:00:48.360> some

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
we found that there was some

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.830 
we found that there was some
difficulties<00:00:49.260> with<00:00:49.500> regards<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.840> very

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
difficulties with regards to that very

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.779 
difficulties with regards to that very
difficult<00:00:52.530> one<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.890> them<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.129> very<00:00:53.160> difficult

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
difficult one of them is very difficult

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.790 
difficult one of them is very difficult
to<00:00:53.940> access<00:00:54.120> any<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.780> plumbing<00:00:54.989> if<00:00:55.500> there's

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
to access any of the plumbing if there's

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.760 
to access any of the plumbing if there's
ever<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.190> problem<00:00:56.780> number<00:00:57.780> two<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.500> have<00:00:58.649> to

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
ever a problem number two is you have to

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.920 
ever a problem number two is you have to
compromise<00:00:59.070> both<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.699> insulation<00:01:00.329> integrity

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
compromise both the insulation integrity

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.139 
compromise both the insulation integrity
and<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.770> structural<00:01:02.280> integrity<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.910> hot

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
and the structural integrity of the hot

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.149 
and the structural integrity of the hot
tub<00:01:03.390> if<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.899> ever<00:01:04.019> have<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.320> fix<00:01:04.559> anything<00:01:04.710> and

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
tub if you ever have to fix anything and

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.039 
tub if you ever have to fix anything and
number<00:01:05.580> three<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.210> basically<00:01:06.479> it's<00:01:06.869> like

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
number three is is basically it's like

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.810 
number three is is basically it's like
putting<00:01:07.380> your<00:01:07.470> furnace<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.130> your<00:01:08.610> house

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
putting your furnace of your house

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.719 
putting your furnace of your house
outside<00:01:09.810> your<00:01:10.049> house<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.470> heat<00:01:10.650> your<00:01:10.830> house<00:01:11.369> so

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
outside your house to heat your house so

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.580 
outside your house to heat your house so
essentially<00:01:12.479> they<00:01:12.720> put<00:01:12.930> all<00:01:13.110> their<00:01:13.290> equipment

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
essentially they put all their equipment

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.920 
essentially they put all their equipment
their<00:01:13.979> plumbing<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.760> their<00:01:15.270> pumps<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:15.810> their

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
their plumbing and their pumps in their

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.109 
their plumbing and their pumps in their
heater<00:01:16.110> outside<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.009> insulation<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.790> eat

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
heater outside the insulation to eat

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.850 
heater outside the insulation to eat
their<00:01:18.270> tub<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.570> second<00:01:18.960> type<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.140> insulation

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
their tub the second type of insulation

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.100 
their tub the second type of insulation
system<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.400> out<00:01:20.700> there<00:01:20.909> it's<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.600> dead<00:01:21.900> air

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
system is out there it's a dead air

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.870 
system is out there it's a dead air
insulation<00:01:22.860> system<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.430> basically<00:01:23.729> what

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
insulation system and basically what

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.420 
insulation system and basically what
they<00:01:24.000> do<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.299> just<00:01:24.570> insulate<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.740> cabinet<00:01:26.250> we

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
they do is just insulate the cabinet we

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.219 
they do is just insulate the cabinet we
also<00:01:26.640> did<00:01:26.939> not<00:01:26.970> as<00:01:27.299> well<00:01:27.540> probably<00:01:27.930> about

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
also did not as well probably about

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.010 
also did not as well probably about
seven<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.310> eight<00:01:29.340> years<00:01:29.820> ago<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.360> it's

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
seven to eight years ago and it's

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.080 
seven to eight years ago and it's
actually<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.710> idea<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.340> correct<00:01:32.790> when<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
actually the idea is correct when the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.390 
actually the idea is correct when the
execution<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.900> faulty<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:35.009> one<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
execution is faulty and one of the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.069 
execution is faulty and one of the
reasons<00:01:35.790> one<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.420> things<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.810> we<00:01:36.900> had

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
reasons one of the things that we had

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.160 
reasons one of the things that we had
problems<00:01:37.530> with<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.180> plumbing

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
problems with is is is that the plumbing

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.660 
problems with is is is that the plumbing
had<00:01:40.439> no<00:01:40.650> support<00:01:40.920> whatsoever<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.659> really

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
had no support whatsoever so so really

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.030 
had no support whatsoever so so really
you<00:01:44.670> know<00:01:44.790> three<00:01:45.509> feet<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.899> pipe<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.290> about<00:01:46.530> 15

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
you know three feet of pipe is about 15

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.830 
you know three feet of pipe is about 15
pounds<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:47.970> we're<00:01:48.060> having<00:01:48.210> quite<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> bit<00:01:48.720> of

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
pounds so we're having quite a bit of

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.710 
pounds so we're having quite a bit of
leaks<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.380> hot<00:01:49.649> tub<00:01:49.820> secondly<00:01:50.820> by

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
leaks on the hot tub secondly by

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.690 
leaks on the hot tub secondly by
insulating<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.470> cabinet<00:01:52.979> what<00:01:53.130> they<00:01:53.280> did<00:01:53.490> was

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
insulating the cabinet what they did was

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.480 
insulating the cabinet what they did was
they<00:01:53.880> they<00:01:54.450> they<00:01:54.689> created<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.710> complete<00:01:56.219> dead

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
they they they created a a complete dead

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.850 
they they they created a a complete dead
air<00:01:56.670> space<00:01:56.700> with<00:01:57.210> no<00:01:57.329> circulation<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:58.079> air<00:01:58.259> so

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
air space with no circulation of air so

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.280 
air space with no circulation of air so
a<00:01:59.189> motor<00:01:59.759> needs<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.360> breathe<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:00.869> we're<00:02:01.020> having

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
a motor needs to breathe so we're having

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.959 
a motor needs to breathe so we're having
a<00:02:01.320> lot<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.500> problems<00:02:01.770> with<00:02:02.100> motor<00:02:02.280> overheating

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
a lot of problems with motor overheating

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.870 
a lot of problems with motor overheating
and<00:02:03.119> tub<00:02:03.810> overheating<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:05.189> brings<00:02:05.460> us<00:02:05.670> to

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
and tub overheating so that brings us to

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.210 
and tub overheating so that brings us to
today's<00:02:06.240> technology<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.530> uh<00:02:07.560> this

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
today's technology and this is uh this

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.440 
today's technology and this is uh this
is<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.369> technology<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:09.149> has<00:02:09.239> been<00:02:09.270> developed

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
is a technology that has been developed

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.270 
is a technology that has been developed
over<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.110> last<00:02:10.140> 35

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
over the last 35

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.089 
over the last 35
in<00:02:12.280> business<00:02:12.760> 35<00:02:13.239> years<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:13.750> and<00:02:13.989> we<00:02:14.890> really

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
in business 35 years and and we really

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.160 
in business 35 years and and we really
believe<00:02:15.220> we<00:02:15.370> have<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.790> what<00:02:16.450> I<00:02:16.480> think<00:02:16.870> is<00:02:17.019> the

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
believe we have the what I think is the

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.860 
believe we have the what I think is the
best<00:02:17.349> insulation<00:02:17.950> system<00:02:18.550> so<00:02:18.760> it's<00:02:19.330> a<00:02:19.480> series

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
best insulation system so it's a series

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.089 
best insulation system so it's a series
of<00:02:19.930> steps<00:02:20.200> that<00:02:20.560> I'm<00:02:20.650> going<00:02:20.769> to<00:02:20.800> bring<00:02:21.010> you

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
of steps that I'm going to bring you

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.530 
of steps that I'm going to bring you
through<00:02:21.129> and<00:02:21.459> how<00:02:21.580> we<00:02:21.640> do<00:02:21.879> there's<00:02:22.060> our<00:02:22.239> six

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
through and how we do there's our six

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.160 
through and how we do there's our six
steps<00:02:22.890> essentially<00:02:23.890> step<00:02:24.190> number<00:02:24.340> one<00:02:24.670> is

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
steps essentially step number one is

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.140 
steps essentially step number one is
creating<00:02:26.170> a<00:02:26.319> insulated<00:02:26.950> air<00:02:27.400> pocket<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.030> way

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
creating a insulated air pocket the way

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.020 
creating a insulated air pocket the way
we<00:02:28.360> do<00:02:28.540> that<00:02:28.720> is<00:02:28.989> we<00:02:29.860> wrap<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.430> plumbing<00:02:30.880> with

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
we do that is we wrap the plumbing with

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.240 
we do that is we wrap the plumbing with
a<00:02:31.060> poly<00:02:31.360> film<00:02:31.780> barrier<00:02:32.230> as<00:02:32.440> you<00:02:32.530> can<00:02:32.709> see<00:02:32.890> here

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
a poly film barrier as you can see here

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.580 
a poly film barrier as you can see here
what<00:02:33.970> that<00:02:34.120> does<00:02:34.420> is<00:02:34.720> two<00:02:34.959> things<00:02:35.319> actually

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
what that does is two things actually

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.490 
what that does is two things actually
three<00:02:36.040> things<00:02:36.340> what<00:02:36.580> that<00:02:36.760> does<00:02:36.970> this<00:02:37.150> is

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
three things what that does this is

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.070 
three things what that does this is
supports<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.709> plumbing<00:02:39.130> right<00:02:39.700> in<00:02:40.060> place<00:02:40.390> so

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
supports the plumbing right in place so

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.869 
supports the plumbing right in place so
that<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.349> heavy<00:02:41.560> planks<00:02:41.950> have<00:02:42.099> some<00:02:42.430> support

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
that the heavy planks have some support

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.210 
that the heavy planks have some support
on<00:02:43.330> top<00:02:43.660> of<00:02:43.780> our<00:02:43.930> dump<00:02:44.170> our<00:02:44.349> triple<00:02:44.769> fast<00:02:44.980> and

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
on top of our dump our triple fast and

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.130 
on top of our dump our triple fast and
high<00:02:45.400> flow<00:02:45.640> plumbing<00:02:46.060> so<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:46.599> does<00:02:46.780> support

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
high flow plumbing so it does support

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.470 
high flow plumbing so it does support
our<00:02:47.290> plumbing<00:02:47.709> the<00:02:48.340> second<00:02:48.760> thing<00:02:48.910> it<00:02:49.060> does<00:02:49.239> is

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
our plumbing the second thing it does is

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.350 
our plumbing the second thing it does is
that<00:02:49.510> it<00:02:49.890> creates<00:02:50.890> a<00:02:51.190> dead<00:02:51.400> air<00:02:51.610> space<00:02:51.640> here

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
that it creates a dead air space here

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.479 
that it creates a dead air space here
and<00:02:52.810> we<00:02:52.930> all<00:02:53.049> know<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.410> best<00:02:53.590> insulator<00:02:54.280> is

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
and we all know the best insulator is

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.300 
and we all know the best insulator is
air<00:02:54.700> similar<00:02:55.569> to<00:02:55.690> a<00:02:55.720> double<00:02:56.049> pane<00:02:56.260> window<00:02:56.680> so

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
air similar to a double pane window so

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.280 
air similar to a double pane window so
it<00:02:57.459> actually<00:02:57.790> insulates<00:02:58.209> inside<00:02:58.870> this<00:02:59.049> area

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
it actually insulates inside this area

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.559 
it actually insulates inside this area
traps<00:02:59.799> the<00:02:59.950> heat<00:02:59.980> of<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.340> shelf<00:03:00.670> and<00:03:00.940> traps

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
traps the heat of the shelf and traps

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.630 
traps the heat of the shelf and traps
the<00:03:01.720> heat<00:03:01.750> of<00:03:02.049> the<00:03:02.140> plumbing<00:03:02.410> in<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.250> dead<00:03:03.459> air

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
the heat of the plumbing in the dead air

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.699 
the heat of the plumbing in the dead air
space<00:03:03.670> there<00:03:04.329> and<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.900> last<00:03:05.110> thing<00:03:05.410> it<00:03:05.530> does

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
space there and the last thing it does

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.130 
space there and the last thing it does
is<00:03:05.950> it<00:03:05.980> allows<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.400> success<00:03:07.000> ability<00:03:07.510> you

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
is it allows the success ability you

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.140 
is it allows the success ability you
know<00:03:08.260> no<00:03:08.440> no<00:03:08.799> manufacturing<00:03:09.549> hot<00:03:09.760> tub<00:03:10.000> is

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
know no no manufacturing hot tub is

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.390 
know no no manufacturing hot tub is
perfect<00:03:10.630> but<00:03:11.110> if<00:03:11.260> there's<00:03:11.500> ever<00:03:11.769> a<00:03:11.860> problem<00:03:11.920> we

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
perfect but if there's ever a problem we

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.550 
perfect but if there's ever a problem we
can<00:03:12.579> get<00:03:12.790> at<00:03:12.970> it<00:03:13.180> because<00:03:13.360> it's<00:03:13.720> not<00:03:13.870> full<00:03:14.230> foam

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
can get at it because it's not full foam

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.610 
can get at it because it's not full foam
the<00:03:15.430> next<00:03:15.730> thing<00:03:15.880> we<00:03:16.000> do<00:03:16.120> step<00:03:16.480> number<00:03:16.630> two<00:03:16.989> is

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
the next thing we do step number two is

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.410 
the next thing we do step number two is
we<00:03:18.010> actually<00:03:18.190> install<00:03:18.819> a<00:03:20.130> thermal<00:03:21.130> blanket

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
we actually install a thermal blanket

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.840 
we actually install a thermal blanket
which<00:03:22.420> basically<00:03:22.870> wraps<00:03:23.319> the<00:03:23.650> hot<00:03:23.859> tub<00:03:24.220> now

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
which basically wraps the hot tub now

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.420 
which basically wraps the hot tub now
essentially<00:03:25.180> how<00:03:25.510> that<00:03:25.750> works<00:03:26.049> is<00:03:26.350> we<00:03:26.709> suck<00:03:27.310> it

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
essentially how that works is we suck it

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.879 
essentially how that works is we suck it
in<00:03:27.549> underneath<00:03:27.880> there<00:03:28.239> and<00:03:28.630> we<00:03:29.079> staple<00:03:29.590> it<00:03:29.709> to

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
in underneath there and we staple it to

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:33.000 
in underneath there and we staple it to
the<00:03:29.920> base<00:03:30.790> of<00:03:30.819> support<00:03:31.209> on<00:03:31.630> our<00:03:31.660> hot<00:03:31.989> tub<00:03:32.019> what

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
the base of support on our hot tub what

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.550 
the base of support on our hot tub what
this<00:03:33.250> does<00:03:33.579> is<00:03:34.000> it<00:03:34.180> further<00:03:34.569> allows<00:03:35.049> us<00:03:35.350> to

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
this does is it further allows us to

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.580 
this does is it further allows us to
trap<00:03:35.859> the<00:03:36.069> heat<00:03:36.340> off<00:03:37.030> of<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.540> shell<00:03:37.870> and<00:03:38.170> off

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
trap the heat off of the shell and off

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.900 
trap the heat off of the shell and off
of<00:03:38.799> the<00:03:38.920> plumbing<00:03:39.160> you<00:03:39.280> can<00:03:39.430> see<00:03:39.549> this<00:03:39.700> is<00:03:39.880> a

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
of the plumbing you can see this is a

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.629 
of the plumbing you can see this is a
reflective<00:03:40.569> liner<00:03:40.840> here<00:03:41.200> so<00:03:41.739> this<00:03:42.280> this

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
reflective liner here so this this

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.590 
reflective liner here so this this
material<00:03:43.209> is<00:03:43.359> used<00:03:43.660> in<00:03:43.989> NASA<00:03:44.590> spacesuits<00:03:45.600> it's

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
material is used in NASA spacesuits it's

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.190 
material is used in NASA spacesuits it's
used<00:03:46.959> on<00:03:47.139> any<00:03:47.470> survival<00:03:48.340> suit<00:03:48.639> pay<00:03:49.329> off<00:03:50.139> of

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
used on any survival suit pay off of

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.140 
used on any survival suit pay off of
cruise<00:03:50.680> ships<00:03:50.709> or<00:03:51.160> anything<00:03:51.340> basically

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
cruise ships or anything basically

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.729 
cruise ships or anything basically
people<00:03:52.329> wrap<00:03:52.660> their<00:03:52.690> bodies<00:03:53.170> and<00:03:53.319> then<00:03:53.470> and

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
people wrap their bodies and then and

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.009 
people wrap their bodies and then and
they<00:03:53.889> prevent<00:03:54.579> hypothermia<00:03:54.910> by<00:03:55.540> using<00:03:55.810> the

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
they prevent hypothermia by using the

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.020 
they prevent hypothermia by using the
heat<00:03:56.200> of<00:03:56.349> their<00:03:56.530> of<00:03:56.739> their<00:03:56.950> body<00:03:57.220> so

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
heat of their of their body so

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.120 
heat of their of their body so
essentially<00:03:58.420> what<00:03:59.200> we<00:03:59.290> do<00:03:59.410> is<00:03:59.530> we<00:03:59.680> wrap<00:03:59.889> that

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
essentially what we do is we wrap that

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.129 
essentially what we do is we wrap that
around<00:04:00.160> the<00:04:00.579> pulley<00:04:00.819> Filaret<00:04:01.420> area<00:04:01.870> right

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
around the pulley Filaret area right

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:04.379 
around the pulley Filaret area right
around<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.500> entire<00:04:02.859> tub<00:04:03.190> staple<00:04:04.000> it<00:04:04.120> to<00:04:04.269> it

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:04.389 
around the entire tub staple it to it

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.080 
around the entire tub staple it to it
that<00:04:04.900> essentially<00:04:05.319> creates<00:04:05.829> the<00:04:06.370> set<00:04:06.670> the<00:04:06.910> the

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
that essentially creates the set the the

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.979 
that essentially creates the set the the
first<00:04:07.919> airspace<00:04:08.919> and<00:04:09.160> the<00:04:09.430> first<00:04:09.760> air<00:04:10.269> pocket

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
first airspace and the first air pocket

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.289 
first airspace and the first air pocket
again<00:04:11.549> reflecting<00:04:12.549> the<00:04:12.700> heat<00:04:12.940> of<00:04:13.180> the

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
again reflecting the heat of the

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.690 
again reflecting the heat of the
plumbing<00:04:13.750> and<00:04:13.870> the<00:04:13.959> shell<00:04:14.470> back<00:04:15.069> into<00:04:15.430> the<00:04:15.519> hot

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
plumbing and the shell back into the hot

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.819 
plumbing and the shell back into the hot
tub<00:04:15.730> and<00:04:16.269> also<00:04:16.660> again<00:04:16.930> remember<00:04:17.440> it<00:04:17.560> allows<00:04:17.799> us

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
tub and also again remember it allows us

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.069 
tub and also again remember it allows us
full<00:04:18.220> accessibility<00:04:19.000> into<00:04:19.539> the<00:04:19.630> plumbing<00:04:19.989> if

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
full accessibility into the plumbing if

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:20.349 
full accessibility into the plumbing if
we

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
we

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.559 
we
have<00:04:20.569> together<00:04:20.889> the<00:04:21.889> third<00:04:22.159> step<00:04:22.550> is<00:04:22.849> is

00:04:23.559 --> 00:04:23.569 
have together the third step is is

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:24.939 
have together the third step is is
basically<00:04:23.930> what<00:04:24.259> we're<00:04:24.409> doing<00:04:24.439> is<00:04:24.770> we're

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
basically what we're doing is we're

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:28.869 
basically what we're doing is we're
creating<00:04:25.129> a<00:04:25.580> secondary<00:04:26.419> air<00:04:26.780> pocket<00:04:27.470> and<00:04:27.879> you

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:28.879 
creating a secondary air pocket and you

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:30.879 
creating a secondary air pocket and you
can<00:04:29.030> see<00:04:29.210> this<00:04:29.449> tub<00:04:29.719> here<00:04:29.750> has<00:04:30.199> the<00:04:30.379> cabinet

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
can see this tub here has the cabinet

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.909 
can see this tub here has the cabinet
installed<00:04:31.460> on<00:04:31.729> it<00:04:31.939> so<00:04:32.620> essentially<00:04:33.620> what<00:04:33.800> we

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
installed on it so essentially what we

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.129 
installed on it so essentially what we
do<00:04:34.099> is<00:04:34.129> as<00:04:34.460> you<00:04:34.699> can<00:04:34.759> see<00:04:34.879> it<00:04:35.569> has<00:04:35.780> the<00:04:35.930> full

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
do is as you can see it has the full

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:38.830 
do is as you can see it has the full
thermal<00:04:36.469> wrap<00:04:36.830> around<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:37.400> first<00:04:37.699> on<00:04:38.270> top<00:04:38.629> and

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
thermal wrap around the first on top and

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.360 
thermal wrap around the first on top and
it's<00:04:38.990> hollow<00:04:39.199> inside<00:04:39.500> there<00:04:39.949> created<00:04:40.280> in<00:04:40.340> that

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
it's hollow inside there created in that

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.969 
it's hollow inside there created in that
first<00:04:40.759> hair<00:04:41.030> air<00:04:41.270> pocket<00:04:41.870> the<00:04:42.439> second<00:04:42.860> thing

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
first hair air pocket the second thing

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:44.140 
first hair air pocket the second thing
we're<00:04:43.129> going<00:04:43.219> to<00:04:43.280> do<00:04:43.490> is<00:04:43.610> we're<00:04:43.759> going<00:04:43.849> to<00:04:43.909> take

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
we're going to do is we're going to take

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.439 
we're going to do is we're going to take
that<00:04:44.389> third<00:04:44.840> seam<00:04:45.490> thermal<00:04:46.490> shield<00:04:46.849> blanket

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
that third seam thermal shield blanket

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:49.029 
that third seam thermal shield blanket
that<00:04:47.569> you<00:04:47.629> see<00:04:47.930> on<00:04:48.110> the<00:04:48.199> inside<00:04:48.379> of<00:04:48.740> the<00:04:48.800> tub

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039 
that you see on the inside of the tub

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.339 
that you see on the inside of the tub
and<00:04:49.550> we're<00:04:49.699> gonna<00:04:49.819> wrap<00:04:50.180> the<00:04:50.539> inside<00:04:51.080> of<00:04:51.259> the

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:51.349 
and we're gonna wrap the inside of the

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:52.089 
and we're gonna wrap the inside of the
cabinet

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:52.099 
cabinet

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:54.070 
cabinet
now<00:04:52.400> what<00:04:52.699> this<00:04:52.940> does<00:04:53.240> is<00:04:53.479> creates<00:04:53.870> the

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
now what this does is creates the

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.950 
now what this does is creates the
secondary<00:04:54.830> air<00:04:55.129> pocket<00:04:55.879> or<00:04:56.240> secondary

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
secondary air pocket or secondary

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.619 
secondary air pocket or secondary
insulation<00:04:57.800> pocket<00:04:58.250> and<00:04:58.639> what<00:04:58.879> it's<00:04:59.060> doing<00:04:59.479> is

00:04:59.619 --> 00:04:59.629 
insulation pocket and what it's doing is

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:01.899 
insulation pocket and what it's doing is
essentially<00:05:00.259> trapping<00:05:00.949> the<00:05:01.129> waste<00:05:01.370> heat<00:05:01.699> of

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:01.909 
essentially trapping the waste heat of

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:04.749 
essentially trapping the waste heat of
the<00:05:02.030> motor<00:05:02.300> and<00:05:02.949> reflecting<00:05:03.949> it<00:05:04.069> back<00:05:04.099> into

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:04.759 
the motor and reflecting it back into

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:06.969 
the motor and reflecting it back into
the<00:05:04.909> tub<00:05:05.150> now<00:05:05.719> the<00:05:05.780> nice<00:05:06.050> thing<00:05:06.080> about<00:05:06.319> this<00:05:06.710> is

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
the tub now the nice thing about this is

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:09.249 
the tub now the nice thing about this is
is<00:05:07.159> that<00:05:07.370> a<00:05:07.520> motor<00:05:07.909> creates<00:05:08.419> a<00:05:08.569> kilowatt<00:05:09.080> and<00:05:09.229> a

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:09.259 
is that a motor creates a kilowatt and a

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:12.010 
is that a motor creates a kilowatt and a
half<00:05:09.469> of<00:05:09.620> heat<00:05:09.830> so<00:05:10.639> you<00:05:10.669> can<00:05:11.060> imagine<00:05:11.300> how<00:05:11.719> hot

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
half of heat so you can imagine how hot

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.100 
half of heat so you can imagine how hot
this<00:05:12.349> gets<00:05:12.710> inside<00:05:13.279> this<00:05:13.580> area<00:05:13.879> so<00:05:14.569> it's<00:05:14.690> it's

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
this gets inside this area so it's it's

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.899 
this gets inside this area so it's it's
actually<00:05:15.560> stapled<00:05:16.039> to<00:05:16.159> the<00:05:16.250> inside<00:05:16.759> of<00:05:16.789> the

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:16.909 
actually stapled to the inside of the

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:19.119 
actually stapled to the inside of the
cabinet<00:05:17.330> right<00:05:17.629> around<00:05:17.900> the<00:05:18.110> whole<00:05:18.289> top<00:05:18.590> pull

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:19.129 
cabinet right around the whole top pull

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:21.339 
cabinet right around the whole top pull
into<00:05:19.400> our<00:05:19.520> cabinet<00:05:20.000> so<00:05:20.659> creating<00:05:21.319> that

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
into our cabinet so creating that

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:23.679 
into our cabinet so creating that
secondary<00:05:21.949> air<00:05:22.279> lock<00:05:22.550> trapping<00:05:23.419> the<00:05:23.509> waste

00:05:23.679 --> 00:05:23.689 
secondary air lock trapping the waste

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:25.570 
secondary air lock trapping the waste
heat<00:05:23.960> of<00:05:24.110> the<00:05:24.199> motor<00:05:24.409> so<00:05:25.039> that's<00:05:25.190> step<00:05:25.520> number

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
heat of the motor so that's step number
