headquarters we're going to tell you how
to<00:00:08.140> lower<00:00:08.410> your<00:00:08.590> a1c<00:00:08.769> level<00:00:09.519> so<00:00:10.150> first<00:00:10.420> what<00:00:10.720> is

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:10.750 
to lower your a1c level so first what is

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.129 
to lower your a1c level so first what is
an<00:00:10.990> a1c<00:00:11.380> level<00:00:11.910> a1c<00:00:12.910> is<00:00:13.179> the<00:00:13.570> measure<00:00:13.809> of<00:00:13.900> your

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:14.139 
an a1c level a1c is the measure of your

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.560 
an a1c level a1c is the measure of your
average<00:00:14.679> blood<00:00:15.009> sugar<00:00:15.129> levels<00:00:15.849> over<00:00:16.539> the

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
average blood sugar levels over the

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.690 
average blood sugar levels over the
previous<00:00:17.110> three<00:00:17.350> months<00:00:17.380> the<00:00:18.370> way<00:00:18.490> they<00:00:18.640> do

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:18.700 
previous three months the way they do

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.820 
previous three months the way they do
that<00:00:18.940> is<00:00:19.120> a<00:00:19.150> blood<00:00:19.510> test<00:00:19.779> and<00:00:20.199> what<00:00:20.439> that<00:00:20.590> blood

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 
that is a blood test and what that blood

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.349 
that is a blood test and what that blood
test<00:00:21.070> tells<00:00:21.279> them<00:00:21.519> is<00:00:21.640> about<00:00:21.880> where<00:00:22.210> your

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:22.359 
test tells them is about where your

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:24.240 
test tells them is about where your
blood<00:00:22.510> sugar<00:00:22.810> is<00:00:22.840> on<00:00:23.050> ours<00:00:23.500> what<00:00:24.099> does<00:00:24.220> that

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
blood sugar is on ours what does that

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.240 
blood sugar is on ours what does that
mean<00:00:24.550> well<00:00:25.449> every<00:00:25.929> day<00:00:25.960> your<00:00:26.740> blood<00:00:27.009> sugar

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
mean well every day your blood sugar

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.269 
mean well every day your blood sugar
Rises<00:00:27.609> and<00:00:28.060> it<00:00:28.630> falls<00:00:28.900> and<00:00:29.289> rises<00:00:29.439> and<00:00:30.009> falls

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
Rises and it falls and rises and falls

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.760 
Rises and it falls and rises and falls
when<00:00:31.150> you're<00:00:31.269> eating<00:00:31.480> it's<00:00:32.230> on<00:00:32.470> the<00:00:32.590> rise

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
when you're eating it's on the rise

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.380 
when you're eating it's on the rise
because<00:00:33.160> everything<00:00:33.640> we<00:00:33.730> eat<00:00:33.790> eventually

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
because everything we eat eventually

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.300 
because everything we eat eventually
turns<00:00:34.600> into<00:00:34.750> blood<00:00:35.080> sugar<00:00:35.350> when<00:00:36.010> your<00:00:36.130> body

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.310 
turns into blood sugar when your body

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.360 
turns into blood sugar when your body
uses<00:00:36.820> the<00:00:36.910> energy<00:00:37.360> you're<00:00:38.080> on<00:00:38.230> the<00:00:38.350> fall<00:00:38.620> for

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
uses the energy you're on the fall for

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.340 
uses the energy you're on the fall for
people<00:00:39.670> with<00:00:39.760> diabetes<00:00:39.910> you<00:00:40.780> can<00:00:40.900> also<00:00:41.020> take

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
people with diabetes you can also take

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.290 
people with diabetes you can also take
medication<00:00:42.040> to<00:00:42.070> help<00:00:42.370> lower<00:00:42.820> your<00:00:43.120> blood

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
medication to help lower your blood

medication to help lower your blood
sugar<00:00:43.360> level<00:00:43.960> what<00:00:44.770> an<00:00:44.860> average<00:00:45.070> blood<00:00:45.700> sugar

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
sugar level what an average blood sugar

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.670 
sugar level what an average blood sugar
level<00:00:46.240> is<00:00:46.420> is<00:00:46.690> right<00:00:47.620> down<00:00:48.630> the<00:00:49.630> middle<00:00:49.680> of

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
level is is right down the middle of

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.610 
level is is right down the middle of
whatever<00:00:50.920> all<00:00:51.280> these<00:00:51.520> highs<00:00:51.820> and<00:00:52.180> lows<00:00:52.450> are<00:00:52.810> so

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
whatever all these highs and lows are so

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.440 
whatever all these highs and lows are so
your<00:00:53.740> average<00:00:53.890> a1c<00:00:54.640> might<00:00:54.850> be<00:00:55.030> something<00:00:55.420> like

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
your average a1c might be something like

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.470 
your average a1c might be something like
a<00:00:56.280> 6.5<00:00:57.280> and<00:00:57.640> that's<00:00:57.850> how<00:00:58.030> they're<00:00:58.240> going<00:00:58.360> to

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
a 6.5 and that's how they're going to

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.330 
a 6.5 and that's how they're going to
express<00:00:59.110> that<00:00:59.380> so

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
express that so

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.970 
express that so
at<00:01:00.850> any<00:01:01.120> one<00:01:01.450> time<00:01:01.480> if<00:01:01.960> I<00:01:02.080> do<00:01:02.140> a<00:01:02.290> finger<00:01:02.710> test

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
at any one time if I do a finger test

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.090 
at any one time if I do a finger test
that's<00:01:03.670> just<00:01:03.910> going<00:01:04.059> to<00:01:04.210> tell<00:01:04.360> me<00:01:04.740> this<00:01:05.740> one

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
that's just going to tell me this one

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.459 
that's just going to tell me this one
day<00:01:06.340> at<00:01:06.640> that<00:01:06.850> one<00:01:07.119> time<00:01:07.360> was<00:01:07.659> my<00:01:07.869> blood<00:01:08.140> sugar

day at that one time was my blood sugar

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:11.789 
day at that one time was my blood sugar

blender<00:03:16.130> bottle<00:03:16.310> this<00:03:17.120> you<00:03:17.329> do<00:03:17.510> want<00:03:17.720> to<00:03:17.750> make

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
blender bottle this you do want to make

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.090 
blender bottle this you do want to make
sure<00:03:17.930> you<00:03:18.200> get<00:03:18.350> on<00:03:18.560> there<00:03:18.709> nice<00:03:18.859> and<00:03:18.920> tight

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
sure you get on there nice and tight

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.680 
sure you get on there nice and tight

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
because if you start shaking before it's

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.690 
because if you start shaking before it's
on<00:03:20.840> they'll<00:03:21.560> end<00:03:21.709> up<00:03:21.799> with<00:03:21.950> a<00:03:21.980> mess<00:03:22.220> but<00:03:22.459> now

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
on they'll end up with a mess but now

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.030 
on they'll end up with a mess but now
it's<00:03:23.120> on<00:03:23.239> there<00:03:23.359> tight<00:03:23.590> you<00:03:24.590> shake<00:03:24.799> it<00:03:24.920> up<00:03:25.010> like

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
it's on there tight you shake it up like

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.740 
it's on there tight you shake it up like
this<00:03:25.340> this<00:03:25.760> is<00:03:25.880> actually<00:03:26.150> really<00:03:26.329> convenient

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
this this is actually really convenient

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:27.910 
this this is actually really convenient
way<00:03:26.989> take<00:03:27.410> this<00:03:27.530> to<00:03:27.709> go

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
way take this to go

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.640 
way take this to go
I<00:03:28.220> usually<00:03:28.820> keep<00:03:29.660> a<00:03:29.750> shake<00:03:29.989> actually<00:03:30.350> in<00:03:30.530> my
