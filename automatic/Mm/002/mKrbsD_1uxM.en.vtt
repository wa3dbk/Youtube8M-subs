 Well, the first thing we're going to do 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.790
 is to fold our fabric we said it's a 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.190
 good meter well we are going to divide it to the 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.590
 half and after having cut that 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.930
 half we go to the half that we cut 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.440
 let's cut another half as well as 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:05.920

 screen and good let's cut and good 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.560
 Well , it's going to stay like this 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.790
 our two parts equally depending 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.579
 of the 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.010
 the size that we want from our 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:29.769
 pillows or our cushions like 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.500
 you prefer to call him good 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:35.799
 this is this is my measure you can 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:40.540
 do it to your liking no and well then let's go 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:44.380
 to continue doing what is this 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.770
 drawing to be able to paint 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.570
 Well now I'm going to draw mini 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.060
 mouse minnie mouse as you 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:55.720

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.300
 drawing his little face the silhouette as 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.000
 want to tell you later 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.240
 After painting it, I am occupying a 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.630
 wax marker in black tone so that 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.970
 let me draw the drawing faster 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.430
 It's waxes faster in the fabric 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.440
 but if they do not have wax they can occupy 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.430
 any other material to draw not 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.500
 matter what it is and well then 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.780
 that you have finished drawing it good 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.580
 I will proceed to what is going to be 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.300
 paint it 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.910
 well then before proceeding to paint him 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.800
 I'm going to put on the inside 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.860
 which are magazine or newspaper sheets 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.830
 so that the other part of 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.650
 the fabric I will occupy textile paint for 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.200
 make the edges of our drawing by 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.290
 Say it like that I'm going to do everything 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.620
 completely this is textile painting or 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.590
 Inflatable in black to be marked 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:57.820
 well and good then we do not have to mark 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:00.700
 with a marker or a pen 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:03.670
 ballpoint pen I do not know things like that and well then 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.800
 you who will give the form I is what 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.710
 what am I doing for the moment and 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.540
 Well, let's also proceed to 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.579
 paint what you wear in black tone 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.190
 Well then before proceeding with what 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:18.680
 is going to be as black as they can be 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.580
 seeing myself in a part of what is the 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.860
 bow I already put red acrylic paint and 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.190
 so I'm going to do everything completely 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.710
 I'm going to put the paint and good 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.650
 then on the edges of the bow as 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:37.490
 they could see I'm going to put painting 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:39.229
 inflatable or textile equal in red tone that 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.419
 is so that you do not miss what is the 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:44.030
 inner shape of the bow and the shape 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:47.449
 outside also at the moment of what 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.860
 we painted and well I hope that you 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:51.229
 go understand and let them go 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.650
 liking what we are doing with 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:58.639
 this design now let's give it a 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.860
 different effect to the tone of the bow I 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:03.050
 I'm getting good at what is 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.270
 white paint you will already decide if 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.940
 they do it or they do not and well this is 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:11.000
 so that it is in a bit of a tone 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.889
 blurred but you already decide if 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.499
 they want to do or not 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:18.680
 and well, that's what we're going to do with 

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:21.439
 all the bow is acrylic white paint 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.439
 what I am putting him and good and 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:26.960
 you will see that the effect is very nice I 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:29.330
 I hope that you also like it and 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.159
 well then let's continue good 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.409
 Now let dry a little what and 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:35.270
 we did with mini mouse and we're going to 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:38.330
 continue with mickey mouse as you can 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.550
 I've already drawn it so it's not too 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.669
 long this video I will only highlight 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:46.250
 a little more so that at the moment of 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:49.639
 start to paint not miss what 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:53.210
 we are doing and well then as 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:55.009
 you can see it 's very easy to do it for 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.500
 those who can not draw good 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:59.689
 try the first on a piece of paper and 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:03.289
 then they pass it to the fabric so that 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:05.659
 are going to be wrong and good as mickey 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:07.339
 more mickey mouse is not very laborious and 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:09.319
 I only wear a tone that is in 

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:11.719

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:27.289
 decorated to the mini mouse bun and good 

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:31.270
