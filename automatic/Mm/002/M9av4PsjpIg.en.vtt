00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.970
 I used to have the instrument harpsichord 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.130
 hated I found it very awful and 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.860
 always thought that it was the name 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.320
 instrument not earned and if you 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.140
 then suddenly what you experience with one 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.700
 instrument that you just really hate 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.619
 and you do not trust anything 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:32.259
 what you then what is possible then 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.100
 I think you can almost get into one 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.100
 lose the instrument 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.780
 every journalist who comes here 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.129
 I fell in love with this harpsichord 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.870
 really nobody met yet 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:48.100
 he says yes is a very nice 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.840
 instrument everyone says I do not have that 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.440
 thought possible that it was something like that 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.440
 great there 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.740
 most people come in this 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.879
 museum, of course, around the 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.680
 marvel at isenheimer altar and then 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.270
 there is music lover respectively 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.980
 of course, especially the harpsichordists 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.500
 have somehow heard there is yet 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.610
 Somehow such a great harpsichord and the 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.270
 then really come from all over the world 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.970
 here to watch this harpsichord 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.340
 to be able to play on it and few 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.990
 may even even this instrument 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.790
 use for a recording and that is for 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.790
 Me a great gift that I am there 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:50.200
 I think a harpsichord for Bach has to be 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.300
 property have very clear and 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.540
 to be transparent at the same time 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.930
 to be able to produce full sound 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:03.940
 it has to be a very good bass register 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:06.640
 have and it must be for the right hand 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.360
 is singing very well for the upper voice 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.550
 can 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.000
 Of course you can not only live in life 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.640
 get it's just that 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.290
 and so beautiful this harpsichord is like that 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.180
 capricious, it is also for example 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.250
 the goals with which the pages 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.560
 Really still be torn 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.860
 bird feathers that means in plain text 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.510
 that just during the recording always 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.330
 must always be reworked 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.310
 it has to be carved again 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.290
 is also the mechanics in total 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.820
 of course a little tired it is easy 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.350
 old instrument that means that the 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.470
 virtuoso moments especially when 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.180
 you also want to play moments 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.920
 almost a new technology therefore require 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.989
 you have to play it incredibly clear 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.730
 Do not want to be too fast 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:58.290
 because that says moment is just no 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.290
 thanks, the next roof will come 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.100
 accompanied by the well-tempered piano 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.840
 a key player in the basics 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.420
 the whole life long in the moment 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.420
 if you are reasonably his finger 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.040
 you can play on the keys to play 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.050
 supposedly easy comedies and joints 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.960
 or maybe just a prelude to that 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.750
 means that is a very long process 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.800
 with the music of Bach and with 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.850
 the well-tempered piano 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.330
 deal 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:40.230
 For a long time it was a big one for me 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:42.600
 wish and with a long time that means 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.830
 really a big wish this year 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.830
 to understand music completely 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.510
 His shot I'm absolutely on me 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:08.569
 there is no audience 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.900
 I have no feedback, there is the music 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.489
 and me and that is a whole 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.000
 intensive matter 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:21.070
 you learn things again landes so 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.810
 be precise with the pace you have to be very 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.539
 You should always play clean 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:30.949
 course to concert but we know 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:32.930
 all that in the concert sometimes more 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:35.389
 can risk and also be more generous 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.229
 can and is difficult to shoot 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.639
 realize 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.320
 you have to try it again and again 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.840
 it just will not be too theoretical but 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.960
 yes it is a very intense and intimate one 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.960
 matter
