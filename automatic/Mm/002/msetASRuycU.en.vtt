good<00:03:56.700> luck<00:03:56.910> knowing<00:03:57.209> what<00:03:57.420> station<00:03:57.750> does<00:03:57.930> what

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
good luck knowing what station does what

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.170 
good luck knowing what station does what
and<00:03:58.380> they<00:03:58.739> all<00:03:58.950> pretty<00:03:59.250> much<00:03:59.370> look<00:03:59.489> alike<00:03:59.970> and

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
and they all pretty much look alike and

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.979 
and they all pretty much look alike and
the<00:04:00.930> icons<00:04:01.440> look<00:04:01.739> exactly<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.430> same<00:04:02.870> so<00:04:03.870> how

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
the icons look exactly the same so how

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.090 
the icons look exactly the same so how

finding<00:04:13.230> your<00:04:13.320> property<00:04:13.709> I<00:04:14.040> started<00:04:14.700> out<00:04:14.790> with

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
finding your property I started out with

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.670 
finding your property I started out with
a<00:04:14.940> freighter<00:04:15.270> and<00:04:15.390> somehow<00:04:15.870> he<00:04:16.080> disappeared

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
a freighter and somehow he disappeared

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.470 
a freighter and somehow he disappeared
not<00:04:16.890> even<00:04:17.100> halfway<00:04:17.370> through<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:17.970> tutorial

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
not even halfway through the tutorial

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.720 
not even halfway through the tutorial
and<00:04:18.630> I<00:04:19.080> never<00:04:19.260> found<00:04:19.560> it<00:04:19.709> again<00:04:19.950> either<00:04:20.430> it<00:04:20.609> was

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
and I never found it again either it was

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.940 
and I never found it again either it was
destroyed<00:04:21.120> or<00:04:21.479> just<00:04:21.750> got<00:04:21.900> lost<00:04:22.169> and<00:04:22.470> the

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
destroyed or just got lost and the

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.800 
destroyed or just got lost and the
terrible<00:04:23.430> map<00:04:23.760> which<00:04:24.030> brings<00:04:24.300> me<00:04:24.360> to<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.570> map

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
terrible map which brings me to the map

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.590 
terrible map which brings me to the map
the<00:04:25.050> galaxy<00:04:25.800> map<00:04:25.950> the

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
the galaxy map the

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.510 
the galaxy map the
had<00:04:26.720> before<00:04:27.110> is<00:04:27.380> replaced<00:04:27.860> with<00:04:28.010> a<00:04:28.130> useless

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
had before is replaced with a useless

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.960 
had before is replaced with a useless
zone<00:04:29.090> system<00:04:29.630> and<00:04:30.050> sector<00:04:30.350> map<00:04:30.680> now<00:04:31.670> basically

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
zone system and sector map now basically

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.940 
zone system and sector map now basically
each<00:04:32.480> sector<00:04:32.930> is<00:04:33.020> a<00:04:33.050> solar<00:04:33.350> system<00:04:33.800> with

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
each sector is a solar system with

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.700 
each sector is a solar system with
multiple<00:04:34.100> zones<00:04:34.580> within<00:04:35.030> it<00:04:35.240> and<00:04:35.450> you<00:04:35.840> use<00:04:36.140> the

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
multiple zones within it and you use the

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.390 
multiple zones within it and you use the
space<00:04:37.700> highways<00:04:38.210> to<00:04:38.930> travel<00:04:39.890> between<00:04:40.040> those

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
space highways to travel between those

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.980 
space highways to travel between those
the<00:04:40.730> space<00:04:40.970> always<00:04:41.330> actually<00:04:41.690> that's<00:04:41.810> only

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
the space always actually that's only

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.540 
the space always actually that's only
the<00:04:42.110> good<00:04:42.410> thing<00:04:42.590> about<00:04:42.620> the<00:04:42.920> game<00:04:43.100> it's<00:04:43.430> a

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
the good thing about the game it's a

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.450 
the good thing about the game it's a
good<00:04:43.820> fast<00:04:44.090> travel<00:04:44.360> system<00:04:44.810> but<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:45.830> map<00:04:46.190> is

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
good fast travel system but the map is

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.610 
good fast travel system but the map is
there's<00:04:47.120> no<00:04:47.300> information<00:04:47.870> on<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.080> map<00:04:48.230> forget

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
there's no information on the map forget

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.620 
there's no information on the map forget
the<00:04:48.770> mat<00:04:48.920> you<00:04:49.460> literally<00:04:49.820> you<00:04:50.090> can<00:04:50.270> look<00:04:50.480> at<00:04:50.600> it

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
the mat you literally you can look at it

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.120 
the mat you literally you can look at it
all<00:04:50.900> day<00:04:50.930> every<00:04:51.470> day<00:04:51.500> and<00:04:51.860> you'll<00:04:51.980> never

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
all day every day and you'll never

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.620 
all day every day and you'll never
figure<00:04:52.430> out<00:04:52.550> where<00:04:52.880> your<00:04:53.030> are<00:04:53.210> what<00:04:53.480> you're

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
figure out where your are what you're

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.360 
figure out where your are what you're
supposed<00:04:53.930> to<00:04:53.990> do<00:04:54.170> what<00:04:54.410> stations<00:04:54.830> where<00:04:55.070> it's

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
supposed to do what stations where it's

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.670 
supposed to do what stations where it's
it's<00:04:56.300> just<00:04:56.450> like<00:04:56.690> a<00:04:56.720> useless<00:04:57.380> piece<00:04:57.620> of

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
it's just like a useless piece of

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.650 
it's just like a useless piece of
garbage<00:04:58.060> actually<00:04:59.060> it's<00:04:59.180> worth<00:04:59.330> getting<00:04:59.510> the

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
garbage actually it's worth getting the

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.080 
garbage actually it's worth getting the
game<00:04:59.810> just<00:05:00.170> for<00:05:00.380> lulz<00:05:00.650> to<00:05:00.950> see<00:05:01.130> it<00:05:01.220> what's

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
game just for lulz to see it what's

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.580 
game just for lulz to see it what's
really<00:05:02.390> sad<00:05:02.600> is<00:05:02.660> that<00:05:02.840> it<00:05:03.050> took<00:05:03.200> them<00:05:03.350> seven
