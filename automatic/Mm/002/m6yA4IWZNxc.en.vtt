example if we spray on blue the white
areas<00:01:26.640> will<00:01:26.880> be<00:01:27.000> blue<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.270> from<00:01:27.840> there<00:01:28.140> as<00:01:28.380> the

areas will be blue and from there as the
grey<00:01:28.799> shades<00:01:29.159> get<00:01:29.430> darker<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.090> does<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.450> blue

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
grey shades get darker so does the blue

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.230 
grey shades get darker so does the blue
until<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.170> hit<00:01:31.290> black<00:01:31.619> at<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:32.790> point<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
until you hit black at this point the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.600 
until you hit black at this point the
model<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.600> completely<00:01:34.110> primered<00:01:34.619> white<00:01:34.860> if<00:01:35.130> we

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
model is completely primered white if we

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.219 
model is completely primered white if we
were<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.850> spray<00:01:36.119> on<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.479> green<00:01:36.689> tint<00:01:36.960> now<00:01:37.170> the

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
were to spray on the green tint now the

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.140 
were to spray on the green tint now the
model<00:01:37.799> would<00:01:37.890> be<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.070> smooth<00:01:38.460> green<00:01:38.820> there<00:01:39.060> are

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
model would be a smooth green there are

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.870 
model would be a smooth green there are
no<00:01:39.240> shadows<00:01:39.540> or<00:01:39.960> shaded<00:01:40.350> areas<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.460> let's<00:01:41.729> go

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
no shadows or shaded areas so let's go

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:49.699 
oil paints or black wash the end results
is<00:01:55.049> what's<00:01:55.320> important

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.020 

now<00:02:50.709> that<00:02:50.890> we've<00:02:51.010> got<00:02:51.189> the<00:02:51.400> parts<00:02:51.700> we<00:02:51.849> need<00:02:52.000> to

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
now that we've got the parts we need to

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.179 
now that we've got the parts we need to
inked<00:02:52.450> up<00:02:52.569> we'll<00:02:53.140> set<00:02:53.319> it<00:02:53.349> aside<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:53.980> let<00:02:54.159> it

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:54.189 
inked up we'll set it aside and let it

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:57.599 
inked up we'll set it aside and let it
dry<00:02:55.290> once<00:02:56.290> dry<00:02:56.590> we'll<00:02:56.799> use<00:02:56.950> a<00:02:56.980> q-tip<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.489> clean

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
dry once dry we'll use a q-tip to clean

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:59.339 
dry once dry we'll use a q-tip to clean
up<00:02:57.909> the<00:02:58.060> wash<00:02:58.239> on<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.510> surface<00:02:58.840> of<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.019> model

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
up the wash on the surface of the model

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.050 
up the wash on the surface of the model
we<00:02:59.980> don't<00:03:00.069> want<00:03:00.280> hard<00:03:00.459> line<00:03:00.579> breaks<00:03:00.849> between

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
we don't want hard line breaks between

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.759 
we don't want hard line breaks between
the<00:03:01.359> wash<00:03:01.569> color<00:03:01.900> and<00:03:02.109> the<00:03:02.170> primer<00:03:02.470> color

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
the wash color and the primer color

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.259 
the wash color and the primer color
there<00:03:03.310> should<00:03:03.459> be<00:03:03.549> a<00:03:03.579> smooth<00:03:03.909> transition

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
there should be a smooth transition

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.509 
there should be a smooth transition
between<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.840> two<00:03:04.870> colors<00:03:05.409> depending<00:03:06.069> on<00:03:06.370> what

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
between the two colors depending on what

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:07.949 
between the two colors depending on what

clean the wash on the surface since I'm

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:13.770 
clean the wash on the surface since I'm
using<00:03:12.370> inks<00:03:12.760> here<00:03:12.909> I'm<00:03:13.120> using<00:03:13.299> airbrush

using inks here I'm using airbrush
cleaner<00:03:13.989> I<00:03:14.349> could<00:03:14.769> also<00:03:14.920> use<00:03:15.129> alcohol

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.839

nooks and crannies needs to be cleared

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.440 
nooks and crannies needs to be cleared
up<00:04:11.620> now<00:04:12.620> we'll<00:04:12.829> apply<00:04:12.889> the<00:04:13.069> candy<00:04:13.609> we're<00:04:14.269> using

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
up now we'll apply the candy we're using

up now we'll apply the candy we're using
the<00:04:14.629> green<00:04:14.840> tint<00:04:15.109> and<00:04:15.290> it's<00:04:15.439> very<00:04:15.620> important

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:16.009 
the green tint and it's very important

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:17.499 
the green tint and it's very important
to<00:04:16.070> remember<00:04:16.340> that<00:04:16.489> to<00:04:16.789> do<00:04:16.940> this<00:04:17.120> in<00:04:17.269> layers

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:17.509 
to remember that to do this in layers

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:19.090 
to remember that to do this in layers
until<00:04:17.900> you<00:04:17.989> get<00:04:18.109> the<00:04:18.169> shaded<00:04:18.500> color<00:04:18.680> you<00:04:18.829> want

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
until you get the shaded color you want

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.039 
until you get the shaded color you want
it<00:04:19.820> dries<00:04:20.000> really<00:04:20.090> fast<00:04:20.299> so<00:04:20.690> there's<00:04:20.870> not<00:04:20.989> much

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
it dries really fast so there's not much

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.110 
it dries really fast so there's not much
wait<00:04:21.410> time<00:04:21.590> in<00:04:21.769> between<00:04:21.889> layers<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.910> more

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
wait time in between layers the more

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.730 
wait time in between layers the more
layers<00:04:23.270> you<00:04:23.419> put<00:04:23.660> on<00:04:23.810> the<00:04:24.259> darker<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:24.710> color

with<00:06:41.499> using<00:06:41.800> a<00:06:41.860> brush<00:06:42.069> is<00:06:42.279> and<00:06:42.430> the<00:06:42.490> candy<00:06:42.849> is

00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:42.909 
with using a brush is and the candy is

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:45.089 
with using a brush is and the candy is
pretty<00:06:43.210> thin<00:06:43.509> if<00:06:43.689> you<00:06:43.779> brush<00:06:44.020> it<00:06:44.229> on<00:06:44.379> you'll<00:06:45.069> be

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:45.099 
pretty thin if you brush it on you'll be

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:46.950 
pretty thin if you brush it on you'll be
quite<00:06:45.400> uneven<00:06:45.819> it<00:06:46.089> will<00:06:46.180> just<00:06:46.330> pool<00:06:46.719> and

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 
quite uneven it will just pool and

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.189
