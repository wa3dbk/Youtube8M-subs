 Let's lecture about temperature lg flash tool 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:13.110
 In the Pyeongtaek factory, 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:16.890
 It's a program we use when it's a common brick. 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.670
 4 Once jusiguyo quickly accepted the file to a blog 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:24.840
 If you're ready, I'll start the lecture. 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.680
 The first thing you should do first is to give the driver a driver 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.680
 I'll install it. 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.790
 4 The driver installation is finished. Let's install the flash frame now. 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.300
 4 Installation is finished. Let's try it once. 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:15.570
 I'm asking for my ID and password like this . 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.950
 The best of me is pressing because there is no authentication ID and password to continue 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.770
 I get an error 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:24.710
 You do this automatically. 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.710
 I'll try to crack using a megalactile file. 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.240
 Cover this way and you'll end up clay. 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.240
 Let's try it now. 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:55.369
 4 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:59.439
 Now, with the top modifier 2d files and files need top file later 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.439
 I'll put it on my blog. 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.720
 Let's try it first. 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.660
 Oh, please. 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.660

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.660
 I'll take it easy. 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.920
 Four more waves. 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.030
 3.4 What are you doing back home? 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.650
 Ah 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:44.760
 Now that you're blushing, 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:47.760
 Do you see the icon like a fish line? 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.659
 I know the port so that it is checked 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:55.230
 You do not need this much and you can turn off all checks. 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:58.290
 Please check only 1 station 1 station. 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:02.370
 Okay, just press show k . 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:08.800
 Then, when you connect your phone now 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:15.090
 Once you enter the downloader mode, you will now be porting between computers. 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:15.090
 Your computer will recognize it and then you'll need to change the port. 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:22.100
 You have to change this port 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.100
 I went in yesterday and got it. 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:31.569
 Please enter the Device Manager 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:35.259
 And here's a look buiIding simyeon Well aware of the solder modem 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:40.899
 If you look at the port android 4 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:43.119
 You can see the usb serial port. The port number is 3 times. 

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:49.919

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:16.839

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:22.060
 I'll do it. 

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:27.930
 Sometimes an error occurs. In this case 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.930
 Have you rested the pc tool and ran it again? 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:35.510
