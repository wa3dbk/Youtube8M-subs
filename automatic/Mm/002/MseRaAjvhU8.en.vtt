00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:03.560
 many motor owners we have taken a man to fend from the shed to 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.150
 enjoy a trip in the sun 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.440
 nevertheless, that first ride is extra risky after the winter 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.140
 you see that the start of the season 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.160
 many motorcyclists go away again since a few months 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.269
 may have forgotten how the motorcycle actually works in practice 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:18.210
 works 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.900
 and inexperienced by the number of kilometers driving each year anyway 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.260
 make estimation errors last weekend shoot no less than four 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.550
 motorbikes songs from languages ​​such as in drents casting 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.700
 a 37 year old motorcyclist died there yesterday after being with his 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.920
 vehicle hit a tree 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.460
 because so many accidents happen at the start of the season 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.569
 bas also the motorcycle association does not have members 

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:46.339
 just do not take a risk and see if you are on the road and has the 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:50.020
 boat stopped for a long time also look at the tire pressure technology owner 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.820
 state of the tires we have or that all is still in order because those are the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.270
 Initial findings from lottery just want the wrong to be safer 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.250
 can move 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.770
 motorists can also contribute to the safety of 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.760
 motorcyclists 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.790
 respect the fact that it is a lance for tigers keep your distance 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.730
 do not cut them it is also that motorcyclist literally give the space to themselves 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.760
 being able to stay on the road I think that is very good 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.460
 that motorists 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.049
 furthermore, you reach a crossroads and watch vermote bike twice 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.900
 lots of objects I can hide very easily behind lamppost of a tree 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.380
 and if you only look once to the left or right then you have 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.320
 big chance you overlook that is a pity of the audit room for anp 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.060
 few actually years they behave 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.620
 actually you know in my eyes when you look at names like we as one 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.430
 suffering losses on multiple players gives it a little space 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.940
 the motorcyclist through life 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.990
 the interest group wants a public campaign every spring 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.010
 to point out the engine to motorists 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.350
 but the anwb does not like that 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.560
 particularly due to the fact that most accidents occur in the spring 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.979
 unilateral accidents are so it is mainly the motorcyclist wheelchair we need 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.150
 I have to aim 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.960
 and of course an empty gesture that becomes nothing can not hurt 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.590
 but the motorcyclist who still has the big risk is his own hand
