00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.640 
like I think you can just draw a really
bad<00:01:28.760> like<00:01:29.060> if<00:01:29.330> you<00:01:29.450> don't<00:01:29.540> open<00:01:29.689> whirlwind<00:01:30.229> if

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
bad like if you don't open whirlwind if

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.950 
bad like if you don't open whirlwind if
you<00:01:31.220> draw<00:01:31.400> all<00:01:31.580> the<00:01:31.700> little<00:01:31.909> monsters<00:01:32.390> like
