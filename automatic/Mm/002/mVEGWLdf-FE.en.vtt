00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.670
 hello geniuses in this video we are going to do 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.349
 this rocking horse of hama beads 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.690
 as you see we are going to need a plate 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.060
 square movice daughter of medium size 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.010
 or midi you just have to copy 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.689
 these three patterns on your plate 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.789
 as you are seeing that of the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.250
 left is the head of the horse the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.650
 up is the tail and the one on the right is 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.929
 the rocker seat we're also going to 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.329
 need a round plate and in it 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.070
 you are going to copy these two patterns and one 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.840
 Once you have copied the patterns already 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.790
 you know we have to put the role of 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.920
 ironed over and let's put it 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.530
 without steam and at medium temperature 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.480
 two faces first for one and then for 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.579
 another one and here I already have them all 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.210
 ironed on both sides and now 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.329
 we are going to mount the rocker or stick it 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.610
 let's take the head of the horse and the 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.760
 seat and head we're going to fit 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.640
 in this hole and in the other hole that 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.650
 we are going to fit the tail we 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.060
 it has to look like this and although it looks good 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.220
 embedded so that we do not go 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.119
 let's go let's give it hot silicone 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.119
 in the bottom 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.390
 and to stick the legs we're going to put a 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:21.810
 little silicone in the holes 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.810
 lateral and now we fit the leg 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.960
 and we do the same thing on the other side 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.200

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.420

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.030
 well that the legs are straight and I do not know 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.460

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.620

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.060

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.550
