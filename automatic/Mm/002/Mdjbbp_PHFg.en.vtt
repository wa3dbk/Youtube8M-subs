there we go there's the flip eNOS but um
I<00:02:34.160> guess<00:02:34.910> battery's<00:02:35.480> going<00:02:35.720> here<00:02:36.019> see<00:02:36.549> ya<00:02:37.549> i

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
I guess battery's going here see ya i

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:41.080 
I guess battery's going here see ya i
think<00:02:38.209> i<00:02:38.299> have<00:02:38.329> to<00:02:38.510> put<00:02:38.660> batteries<00:02:39.140> inside<00:02:40.090> sit

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
think i have to put batteries inside sit

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:47.500 
think i have to put batteries inside sit

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
the batteries in here and have to

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.010 
the batteries in here and have to
scavenge<00:03:41.400> around<00:03:41.460> the<00:03:41.730> house<00:03:41.850> for<00:03:42.060> two<00:03:42.240> triple

a's<00:03:43.170> kind<00:03:44.040> of<00:03:44.130> sucks<00:03:44.340> that<00:03:44.550> it<00:03:44.670> needs<00:03:44.820> its<00:03:45.000> own

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
a's kind of sucks that it needs its own

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.950 
a's kind of sucks that it needs its own
batteries<00:03:45.660> but<00:03:46.280> hey<00:03:47.280> it's<00:03:48.090> probably<00:03:48.330> like

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:48.960 
batteries but hey it's probably like

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.040 
batteries but hey it's probably like
very<00:03:49.430> low<00:03:50.430> energy<00:03:51.000> consumption<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:51.870> it'll

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
very low energy consumption and it'll

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.500 
very low energy consumption and it'll
probably<00:03:52.260> last<00:03:52.590> a<00:03:52.830> good<00:03:52.980> long<00:03:53.040> while<00:03:53.520> so

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
probably last a good long while so

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:02.390
