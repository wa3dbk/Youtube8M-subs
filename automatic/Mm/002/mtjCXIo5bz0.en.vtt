00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.050
 facebook is in the description so let's go 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.050
 Teach you the tip of today's week 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.210
 is to make that famous bicycle 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.550
 bike to humiliate the opponent 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.140
 so let's first teach the commands 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.980
 the buttons for you to make a 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.350
 bike 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.190
 Let's teach first in xbox xbox is 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.710
 simple 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.649
 if you kick the baby with the button b 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.480
 you press the lp together and when the 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.559
 coming crossing you need is not it 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.170
 have another baby 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.329
 then you will pull your bike case 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.579
 it is not lt you press the lb plus one 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.500
 one more baby in case you kick with x 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.480
 in my case that's my case you have a 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.930
 x in xbox 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.670
 you will press the lb button but the x1 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.290
 crossing this simply 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.820
 you are going to pull that goal that is not 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.170
 doing the case is pulling the goalkeeper 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.979
 and cross coming too far 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.020
 understood 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.880
 but if it comes perfect to give 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.830
 bike he will bike 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.509
 Let's go to playstation 3 and playstation 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.780
 3 is already a little more complicated for me 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.729
 Since I do not play for you anymore. 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.920
 you kick you just make yourself 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.890
 You kick the ball, you press the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.840
 l2 plus ball if it is not l2 and 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.070
 press the l1 plus one ball every time 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.720
 these two buttons 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.060
 you can see that you have this logic and 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.310
 if you kick the square 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.680
 you will press the square l2 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.689
 or if it is not 2 you press L1 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.070
 more square then but if you me 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.720
 question how will I know this? 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.860
 Guilherme, you're just going to come here. 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.170
 oh come here, skill games or training 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.700
 skill and will see the second option 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.920
 where to stay and is probably not the 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.170
 Time, you 're not in Portuguese, you're going. 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.939
 see this option to kick in that will 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.640
 it's written there in the blue above 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.530
 shutting then you will see here will're 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.420
 these three options closed 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.000
 I advise you open notes 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.080
 complete the bronze option to complete the 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.330
 option silva 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.710
 and arrive at the bond option click here and 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.970
 choose the leonel messi that is the best 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.430
 to bike 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.650
 So you're going to do the training here. 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.870
 what were you doing, you're really going to 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.950
 train the bike or worry 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.380
 to hit the targets 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.540
 so it's okay and you have other ways of course 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.210
 has several ways and two more in 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.820
 you will instead that even if the games and 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.400
 here comes the arena in practice and the 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.780
 will come with leonel messi here near the 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.750
 small area does not need inside 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.700
 You're going to bother raising the ball. 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.740
 directional back and he will do is 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.440
 kind of a volleyball and a bicycle is 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.940
 difficult it w perfect 50 because 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.010
 He's going to lift the ball for himself. 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.810
 So he was pulling a bike, it will take time. 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.420
 Let's win or not now. 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.220
 achieved but many times will achieve 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.230
 Why are you getting ahead then? 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.140
 You're training there at your house. 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.610
 go try twice more here is one 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.160
 volley and we will try to do a search 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:13.080
 I want to bike now, let's go. 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:15.180
 There it was, it's not that way, so the other one. 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:19.230
 That's the way you play it. 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.209
 really plays and plays and plays and crosses the 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.470
 ball in the area when it comes perfect 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.080
 you press the commands that I 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.200
 I taught that the new case state kicks in the 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.750

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.350
 lt is run over the baby lb 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.900
 if you kick at 1 x lb plus x is 6 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.750
 certainty on playstation 3 if you 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.030

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.739

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.250
