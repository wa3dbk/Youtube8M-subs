often<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.790> might<00:01:35.970> keep<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.390> blood<00:01:36.570> sugar

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
often it might keep the blood sugar

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.950 
often it might keep the blood sugar
levels<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.470> even<00:01:38.189> balance<00:01:38.369> however<00:01:39.119> usually

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
levels and even balance however usually

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.289 
levels and even balance however usually
over<00:01:40.680> eating<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.340> eating<00:01:41.430> too<00:01:41.759> much<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
over eating and eating too much is the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.899 
over eating and eating too much is the
problem<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.869> begin<00:01:42.990> with<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.549> do<00:01:44.670> recommend

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
problem to begin with so I do recommend

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.899 
problem to begin with so I do recommend
eating<00:01:45.659> higher<00:01:46.259> quality<00:01:46.710> foods<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.310> eating

eating higher quality foods and eating

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.899 
eating higher quality foods and eating
wiser<00:01:48.360> eating<00:01:48.930> less<00:01:49.140> often<00:01:49.470> now<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.670> might

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
wiser eating less often now this might

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.210 
wiser eating less often now this might
sound<00:01:51.329> weird<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.869> somebody<00:01:52.350> who<00:01:52.470> has<00:01:52.680> type<00:01:53.009> 2

the day or not graze because that's what

doctors will tell them to do to keep

their blood sugar level stabilized but I

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.719 
their blood sugar level stabilized but I
don't<00:02:04.469> want<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.649> treat<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.979> problem<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.579> want

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
don't want to treat the problem I want

don't want to treat the problem I want
to<00:02:05.820> treat<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.060> cause<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.689> issue<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.229> if

to treat the cause of the issue and if

to treat the cause of the issue and if
the<00:02:08.160> cause<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.399> your<00:02:08.700> issue<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.000> you're<00:02:09.300> eating

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
the cause of your issue is you're eating

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.950 
the cause of your issue is you're eating
too<00:02:09.660> much<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:10.020> begin<00:02:10.170> with<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:11.099> answer<00:02:11.489> isn't

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
too much to begin with the answer isn't

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.080 
too much to begin with the answer isn't
to<00:02:12.320> keep<00:02:12.710> doing<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.130> same<00:02:13.160> thing<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:13.790> eating

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
to keep doing the same thing and eating

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.450 
to keep doing the same thing and eating
too<00:02:14.240> much<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:15.140> answer<00:02:15.500> is<00:02:15.530> to<00:02:15.770> slow<00:02:16.010> down<00:02:16.220> now

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
too much the answer is to slow down now

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.700 
too much the answer is to slow down now
you're<00:02:17.360> going<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.570> have<00:02:17.780> some<00:02:18.020> weak<00:02:18.200> moments

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
you're going to have some weak moments

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.950 
you're going to have some weak moments
there<00:02:18.860> because<00:02:19.310> your<00:02:19.640> need<00:02:20.450> to<00:02:20.690> keep<00:02:20.930> that

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
there because your need to keep that

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.290 
there because your need to keep that
blood<00:02:21.290> sugar<00:02:21.650> balance<00:02:21.830> but<00:02:22.370> when<00:02:22.880> you<00:02:23.000> stop

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
blood sugar balance but when you stop

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.270 
blood sugar balance but when you stop
eating<00:02:23.540> so<00:02:23.810> much<00:02:24.020> sugar<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.590> begin<00:02:24.890> with<00:02:25.070> and

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
eating so much sugar to begin with and

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.250 
eating so much sugar to begin with and
you<00:02:25.610> stop<00:02:25.880> grazing<00:02:26.570> throughout<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:27.050> day<00:02:27.200> to

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
you stop grazing throughout the day to

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.950 
you stop grazing throughout the day to
begin<00:02:27.500> with<00:02:27.830> on<00:02:27.980> unhealthy<00:02:28.160> foods<00:02:28.820> the<00:02:29.630> body

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
begin with on unhealthy foods the body

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.960 
begin with on unhealthy foods the body
will<00:02:30.290> will<00:02:30.710> take<00:02:30.920> care<00:02:31.130> of<00:02:31.190> itself<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:31.820> will

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
will will take care of itself and will

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.480 
will will take care of itself and will
balance<00:02:32.360> things<00:02:32.600> out<00:02:32.810> so<00:02:33.500> I<00:02:33.530> don't<00:02:34.040> think<00:02:34.370> the

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
balance things out so I don't think the

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.920 
balance things out so I don't think the
answer<00:02:34.880> is<00:02:34.910> to<00:02:35.210> continue<00:02:35.600> eating<00:02:35.750> all

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
answer is to continue eating all

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.230 
answer is to continue eating all
throughout<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.230> day<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.650> first<00:02:36.890> thing

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
throughout the day the first thing

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.970 
throughout the day the first thing
particularly<00:02:38.240> for<00:02:38.690> this<00:02:38.810> lady<00:02:39.020> karen<00:02:39.530> is<00:02:39.740> what

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
particularly for this lady karen is what

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.530 
particularly for this lady karen is what
you<00:02:40.100> have<00:02:40.130> to<00:02:40.430> do<00:02:40.580> is<00:02:40.730> you<00:02:40.850> have<00:02:40.880> to<00:02:41.180> figure<00:02:41.390> out

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
you have to do is you have to figure out

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.260 
you have to do is you have to figure out
why<00:02:42.350> you<00:02:42.380> have<00:02:42.800> an<00:02:42.920> upset<00:02:43.160> stomach<00:02:43.220> in<00:02:43.760> general

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
why you have an upset stomach in general

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.870 
why you have an upset stomach in general
when<00:02:44.840> you<00:02:44.960> do<00:02:45.170> eat<00:02:45.350> what<00:02:45.980> exactly<00:02:46.190> are<00:02:46.580> you

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
when you do eat what exactly are you

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.330 
when you do eat what exactly are you
eating<00:02:47.330> see<00:02:48.050> it's<00:02:48.320> an<00:02:48.440> individual<00:02:48.890> thing<00:02:49.100> for

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
eating see it's an individual thing for

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.360 
eating see it's an individual thing for
everyone<00:02:49.670> but<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.870> main<00:02:51.110> answer<00:02:51.560> is<00:02:51.710> for<00:02:52.010> type

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
everyone but the main answer is for type

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.080 
everyone but the main answer is for type
2<00:02:52.550> diabetes<00:02:53.030> and<00:02:53.480> hypoglycemia<00:02:55.090> they're

2 diabetes and hypoglycemia they're

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.170 
2 diabetes and hypoglycemia they're
they're<00:02:56.630> mostly<00:02:57.050> diet<00:02:57.440> related<00:02:57.680> issues<00:02:58.460> so

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
they're mostly diet related issues so

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.700 
they're mostly diet related issues so
you<00:02:59.210> don't<00:02:59.810> want<00:02:59.960> to<00:03:00.020> just<00:03:00.140> treat<00:03:00.320> the<00:03:00.470> problem

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
you don't want to just treat the problem

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.530 
you don't want to just treat the problem
you<00:03:01.040> want<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.280> treat<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.580> course<00:03:01.850> and<00:03:02.150> the

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
you want to treat the course and the

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.690 
you want to treat the course and the
course<00:03:02.570> is<00:03:03.110> usually<00:03:03.650> eating<00:03:03.980> too<00:03:04.190> much<00:03:04.400> too

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
course is usually eating too much too

often and too late to start off with
what<00:03:07.670> I<00:03:07.700> would<00:03:07.880> recommend<00:03:08.030> is<00:03:08.660> the<00:03:08.870> daylight
