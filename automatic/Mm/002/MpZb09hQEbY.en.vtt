gasoline<00:06:02.949> gauge<00:06:04.110> amperes<00:06:05.110> and<00:06:05.439> then<00:06:05.889> this<00:06:06.580> I

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:06.789 
gasoline gauge amperes and then this I

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:08.749 
gasoline gauge amperes and then this I
found<00:06:07.060> interesting<00:06:07.240> the<00:06:07.750> temperature<00:06:08.500> gauge

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 
found interesting the temperature gauge

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:10.649 
found interesting the temperature gauge
there's<00:06:09.759> water<00:06:10.060> down<00:06:10.330> there

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:10.659 
there's water down there

this is cold normal and hot and then

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.050 
this is cold normal and hot and then
below<00:06:16.509> that<00:06:17.189> there's<00:06:18.189> a<00:06:18.310> little<00:06:18.550> arrow<00:06:18.849> that

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 
below that there's a little arrow that

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.589 
below that there's a little arrow that
points<00:06:19.300> up<00:06:19.539> about<00:06:19.810> halfway<00:06:20.080> on<00:06:20.560> the<00:06:20.680> normal
