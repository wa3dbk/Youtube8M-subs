 Well, not a new pokemon episode 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.340

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.650
 finished but welcome to this video 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.050
 where I'll show you how to capture 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.080
 article and well then what we have to 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.140
 to do is fly to this site minister 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.590
 al tom city 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.590
 but no 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.340
 and well, here as I tell you 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.660
 first let's capture the article 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.360
 make sure you have because ball 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.310
 ultra balls and all that and well I have 30 and 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.170
 I think that with that is the armo 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.240
 and well, let's do the following 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.760
 let's 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.720
 have to go through that from here and 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.720
 amanita be 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:53.690
 well here challenges us an explains 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.040
 we are going to approach barbecue 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.140
 damn you put this but good 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.600
 I hope it has not appeared in the video 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.160
 and well, let's give it a run in this 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.300
 pinche is explained the truth is that I do not 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.390
 they interest pokemon right now 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:11.470
 we are going to avoid this type so that we do not 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:14.200
 catch and here good good right now I saw 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.790
 that was barbecue in front if it is 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.030
 article I think it will be better 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.030
 put in front I do not know a little weaker 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.250
 I imagine that they will be like the level 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.040
 cc I do not think they are level 50 and well 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.510
 so as not to step out 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.510
 we turn around here 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:38.290
 Now this fucking clown we're going to 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.290
 dodge I also know 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:49.680
 well then as you can see here is 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:52.170
 article for those who did not know I say there 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.830
 many who may already know 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.170
 Well, good, but there are still many 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.090
 they do not know how to get to article I have 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.460
 seen some videos and then I do not 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.960
 they explain very well and I want to tell you 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.080
 I if I'll explain very well how 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.729
 get to every common so good then 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.740
 first of all let's save it if it's 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:16.360
 that we can not capture it 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.360
 and let's go to plain 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.150
 against item that is at level 50 yo 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.440
 it turned off by ivo which is the pokemon more 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.460
 low that I have so far this level 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.040
 66 and well let's go for a water press to 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.480
 see how much damage we are going to do and 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.670
 so for the best we get 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.980
 confuse it, it's not like that, it makes agility 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.280
 to increase your speed by two points 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.680
 and obviously be faster about 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.580
 any pokemon and well then it 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.990
 reflected which increases the defense does not 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.520
 matter I'm using attack 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.820
 special for which the defense does not 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:58.530
 Interested then one year 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:00.420
 more or less I hope not to 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.120
 remove it with the following water pools 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.960
 to leave it in red life that would be what 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.440
 ideal not and well, we're like this now 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.900
 if we go for more because bags are going to 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.260
 ultra bold I have 30 we are going to launch the 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.260
 first 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.350
 and well this bastard escapes towards 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.020
 anfield power to increase I think 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.450
 that your statistics wants to search and 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.390
 well get a critic but I do not 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.250
 it hurt a lot and I do not know you or anything 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.560
 so well let's continue with the 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.319
 blue trouble 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.990
 12 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.910
 the bastard gets out 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.610
 use the reflection again but good 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.430
 there is still the effect of the previous 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.920
 so it did not have any effect 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.420
 we continue with the ultra bold 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.150
 I hope this time if we get one 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.550
 and we do not get it click article 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.160
 continue with power craving I do not care 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.830
 oatmeal that manages to show its good 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.420
 his statistics about his attack his 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.690
 defenses or special attack your defense 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.940
 special and its speed the effect of 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.920
 reflection is over, which is why 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.540
 you can use it but then you're welcome 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.760
 it would serve because the I what I do not want 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.760
 it is already attacking what it wants is 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.799
 capture it and well then do not let him 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.040
 Follow with agility you already have six points 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.180
 it seems to me in agility in speed 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:26.650
 sorry 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.570
 of no use and I continue with 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.470
 Ultra ball is not left, it does not stop 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:36.220
 article is not left either I think 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:39.760
 take what hours in the videos like 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.410
 for 10 minutes for each pokemon 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.450
 depending also this is because 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.530
 way like art one for the saab century 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:49.300
 2003 all of them are not that difficult 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.220
 so good 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.110
 we can see that if they are a little 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.940
 difficult are they are getting 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.250
 putting strawberry here gets 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.970
 freeze with a civil 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:03.039
 it's something not so common but what 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.770
 they get me because I do not care and I 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:07.690
 I continue with the ultra vol 12 damn 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.250
 he only reached 1 he continues with 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.500
 agility but good can no longer 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:15.449
 increase more utility even though 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.449
 already liked with the power lance 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.889
 and no one is left punch 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:27.129
 well, let's keep trying 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.940
 and good do you think yes 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.060
 subscribe 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.680
 the unworthy channel I will say of those who 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.050
 I will leave in the description simply 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.060
 you can enter and subscribe I will give 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:49.020
 advertising in the videos also by itself 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:52.950
 they want to be any of the 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.480
 channels that you publish so you can tell me 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.880
 in a comment or send a message 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.220
 etcetera but good is not because of being 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.770
 clown I want to evaluate also the 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.330
 channels that I could recommend as they should 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.630
 to have at least a good design 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.460
 they must upload videos at that and have a 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.420
 slight amount of subscribers I say 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.420
 minimum of 100 

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:16.639
 so that their videos have good quality 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.639
 and nothing more 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:26.050
 so you know right now, I hope 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:28.610
 subscribe to the description channel and 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.470
 Well, let's pretend that it's the 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.510
 they want you to subscribe to the 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.430
 so good subscribe to the channel 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:38.320
 that would leave the descriptions leave 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:40.980
 your nile like comments to the video 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:43.410
 then add to favorites 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:45.910
 and then that article is not left not 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:50.560
 let capture the bastard 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:53.730
 so good I'll be a little while 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.730
 talk until we capture it 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.530
 so, well, what do you think if I cut the 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.880
 battle when we capture it so that it does not 

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.880
 we are so long this video 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:15.110
 well then we capture articles in 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:19.710
 level 50 is type or ice and flying 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:24.600
 look how much of that if it does not measure 5 meters and 

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:26.370
 it weighs 122.1 pounds and well then let's 

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.640
 put a nickname what do you think if you 

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.640
 we put 

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.250
 not always 

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:39.220
 let's leave them the names just like 

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:41.770
 are in this case articulated and so is 

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:44.410
 how friends are captured good I hope them 

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:47.260
 have liked the video like a little hand 

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:49.540
 up to be so do not subscribe for more 

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:52.080
 videos that well then also 

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:55.690
 I'll bring the next legendary pokémon 

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:58.060
 also add favorites share in 

00:07:55.690 --> 00:08:00.820
 Your social networks liked it clearly 

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:03.360
