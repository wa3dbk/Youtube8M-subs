00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.750
 the plan 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.180
 proposed by felipe calderón 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.180
 it's a plan that is on the right track 

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:11.479
 that help 

00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:12.869
 to solve 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:15.909
 part of the fundamental problem 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:17.019
 who lives today 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:18.529
 the country 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:19.679
 dam 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:21.109
 deser 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.470
 a recognition of the party of the revolution 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.739
 earth worth 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:29.769
 who said that 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:31.189
 who said that 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:32.770
 do not pope 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.740
 prince and happen 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.740
 lupillo exhaust their orange music 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.460
 for this speed 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.380
 for this I'm seeing that speed 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.010
 when the 'manuel valcárcel' legitimate president was going to end up being 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.010
 2nd lady 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.350
 but to all to see the cardón cheers to the one of the pines day 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.460
 ads on it 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.160
 on the right track of how 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.860
 Give him more strength 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.840
 to the Mexican economy in the face of a financial crisis that 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.170
 inevitably tells us all this in mind as we relapse down 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.120
 economic 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.750
 55 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.750
 same museum the refinery said it is very good 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.800
 trillo warned them 13 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.270
 if you are already very well because the rights of the crisis 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.390
 ikea are the best experts in dealing with these things you asked 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.390
 who will they do to face the monster 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.009
 can improve a little bit more in terms of my ideas all and he manages the 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:40.990
 money 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.100
 but like all of us who work hard 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.480
 they expected 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.190
 how good the situation 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.990
 second line for 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.600
 when critical times come as excellent 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.920
 that economize because we do not know if 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.780
 if you're going to raise the dollar a little more 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.600
 gasoline in all 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.030
 the careful work those who have work 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.840
 and from now we have been able to do more than the state petroecuador 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.659
 a little more 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:11.929
 2 but the earlier and leave it common 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:13.949
 mechel m 60 

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:16.000
 the afternoon until at least Monday 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.770
 the consumption of products that are not so expensive the government gifts and that between 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.479
 some new people fresh with 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:27.209
 with innovative ideas prepare for example that invest in infrastructure 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.169
 it's something alive something quite important 

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:34.189
 i above all time in this part public spending is also a measure 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:35.279
 What can be 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:36.909
 that may be important 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.019
 you can generate a little more sources 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.499
 I'm saying companies 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:44.889
 open 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:46.789
 navas 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:47.859
 industries 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:51.930
 bcr reduce taxes for companies to open 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:55.669
 and so it has been falling without 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:59.299
 keep your work and that you really commit and be responsible 

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:03.399
 the institutions strengthened a little braver 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.499
 I do not know if I had more confidence and the private initiative could invest 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:12.439
 a little more his two could enter more here in the city not generate more 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:14.179
 better paid jobs 

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:17.449
 of every 100 pesos each in your home and sell it 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.329
 lower the salary to the deputies 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.769
 for a trust to be convened 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.589
 to 

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:29.299
 curry the jobs of the workers that even by sources of 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:30.909
 center 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:32.170
 reacted 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.550
 In addition to the proposal duel of the people I will go the proposals 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.339
 since we opened the president 

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:41.769
 that's why I say that characterizes it not 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.969
 with that energy to risk police and quantum physics tone 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:48.969
 well there are two other proposals 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.469
 the secretary of social development 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:54.299
 ernesto lamb 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.200
 It has very modern and very effective 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.200
 anti-crisis measures well 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.400
 I know I do not know how the president did not include them 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.579
 in the plan 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.579
 it turns out that neither tito lamb fry 

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:13.929
 He also cited Lamb proposes 

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:18.219
 fatten chickens and you can play or face them 

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:20.390
 nothing else 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.139
 abounds 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.099
 I started to see how it's going to stop us 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:26.419
 the same and then 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.889
 It surprises us and teaches us to be 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:31.360
 a breeding ground 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.630
 with carnitas michoacán style band 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.330
 new products and those that the board has compared 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.060
 in one of those I was afraid to attack until I did not surprise with the idea of 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.060
 to cross a hen with an aralar pig 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:51.009
 because already a whole town with some pork rinds 

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:56.559
 I here and now despite that not with the result for padilla deceased country 

00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:58.789
 baquero the super secretary 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:00.629
 he proposes us 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:03.740
 ernesto lamb the same 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.149
 that we become investors in a mac like serve 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.270
 it's called I do not know if you in new contexts 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.419
 we invite you in the coming years 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.419
 panda 

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:22.970
 so all sides of the plate 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.740
 this decline 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.520
 the screen 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.370
 to little it is not of Chávez an advance to its time thus according to the bank and Spain 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.520
 abaroa 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.150
 This is how the tail coat has arrived 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.479
 expensive viviana 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:42.300
 nothing nothing nothing of this does not result 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.289
 so 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:45.789
 we will have to follow plan b 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:49.319
 10 the recommendation of don diego monroy 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:52.639
 already in straight 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:55.639
 the rector of the basilica 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:59.379
 there to pray to the virgin of guadeloupe 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:02.419
 because it seems that today 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:05.439
 White 

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:10.129
 so there is no whale if there is no body, always for the pp 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:10.809
 acted
