00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 nick parishes we found 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.069
 rescued hikers who have nothing 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.880
 forgotten about the tragedy the road is 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.590
 impracticable 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.780
 it is therefore on foot that it is necessary to advance 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.519
 despite the danger we are four 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.090
 days after the earthquake and landslides 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.050
 are daily 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.520
 these three men are the first 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.680
 to reach this ravaged area 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.240
 a feat in the team here is there 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.260
 a very epic day is the man the 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.539
 world's fastest mountain jordi 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.009
 Thorzain has already come to him 28 times 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.160
 Nepal 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.329
 Sebastian Montaz Movie Their Adventure This 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.140
 are devastated villages he 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.270
 discover for miles and nothing 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.610
 who actually stands a day the 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.200
 marseillais devil is that passes 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.680
 and the apples the Caribbean which is 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.770
 complete 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.530
 so it's a lot of time and it 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.460
 will need a lot of future slabs and 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.469
 build these mountaineers have given themselves 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.420
 a mission to identify those who are 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.129
 gone missing then they seek 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.409
 clues in everything they find 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.180
 photo or passport are immediately 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.180
 picked up a French and a French 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.200
 and then there are these atrocious discoveries 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:19.360
 in this destroyed village they found 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.330
 Friborg six dead here a child 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:28.030
 near the big pebble big brother 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:31.390
 again again here at moliÃ¨re immediately d 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.960
 record coordinates gps 0 this and by 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.090
 phone 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.180
 it gives the exact location where this 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.830
 climate we are in lantin this mission of 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.960
 reconnaissance at 3300 meters altitude 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.390
 has been of great help to the authorities 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.770
 as humanitarian workers because they have 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.780
 describes the situation so that the 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.470
 food can be brought from 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.660
 back home 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.880
 Sebastian Montaz decided to mount a 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.740
 documentary with all these images for 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.450
 continue to help nepal the profits 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.880
 of the documentary a great deal go 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.770
 go to nepal to an association that 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.810
 is called langtang reconstruction that will 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.510
 focus on reconstruction in 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.800
 this langtang valley is a task 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.420
 which is arduous because all 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.490
 roads are cut and 90% of 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.810
 dwellings are on the ground 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.550
 today the nepal how his 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.340
 reconstruction but the big cities 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.190
 lack of equipment the isolated villages 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.380
 they have to fend for themselves with the 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.150
 means of the edge 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.520
 the students go back to school but the 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.600
 more often outside while the monsoon 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.890
 will start soon 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.890
 according to the latest estimates
