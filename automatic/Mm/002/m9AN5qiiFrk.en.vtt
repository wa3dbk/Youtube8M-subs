00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 traction of how we would eat 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.779
 a pigeon with probe mars syringe of 20 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.080
 milliliters or with the tsarina of a 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.080
 milliliter 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.550
 if we have a floor of this size of 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.560
 four weeks could already be eating 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.840
 just in fact this question is a 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.690
 demonstration of how we would give 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.720
 probe the probe what will you give us 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.040
 is to give more quantity in one shot and 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.320
 get directly to be craw 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.990
 skipping the respiratory to avoid 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.390
 pneumonias by aspiration then how 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.980
 we give the probe a person grabs the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.840
 body of the bird to control in the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.730
 movements in the other handles the head 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:44.780
 and we stretch the song in the chest and 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.780
 we introduce with care 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.850
 inside simply 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.110
 administer the valley family of 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.750
 aguadilla 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.270
 in a pigeon this size could 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.150
 get up to take 120 milliliters 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.970
 distributed in 6 or 7 shots 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.680
 also we can not have probe 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.840
 then the typical warm insulin 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.720
 of a milliliter with these we can give 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.360
 also some baby food is very 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.340
 tired long or if it is not very useful 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.840
 for medications we would all skip what 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.460
 same 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.110
 and the pigeon plate 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.290
 we introduce it carefully to the 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:26.770
 craw jumps with the respiratory and 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.860
 we give good this pigeon has four 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:34.090
 weeks is eating just one you saw and 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.040
 supplies for pigeons however if 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.479
 if it were a pigeon less than three 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.009
 brothers we can not give you big 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.290
 forgetting then we can provoke what 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.729
 a lot have to take pills the 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.470
 quality of this pill has to be 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.659
 of the highest possible quality for example 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.780
 the commune and ready for parrots if not 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.550
 we had pills for achievements 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.380
 we should go to the milk article 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.390
 of sweet and your wife how to make a 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.110
 Adequate protein and fat porridge 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.000
 for chicks vitamins and minerals 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.830
 since if they have signed the smallest 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.259
 be for example of a week two you 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.940
 We give a poor diet in 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:10.090
 quantity or quality will have problems 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.300
 growth will have rickets or 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.410
 for example, start to get sick or have 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.450
 other problems 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.280
 let's see how we give it a little 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.599
 once the chicks start 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.310
 eat and we can give them some 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.110
 grain in this case one's opinions on 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.670
 one this bug is not rebellious 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.500
 already eat alone and do not want to make 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.330
 demonstration 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.120
 Normally when pigeon has between 2 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.700
 and 6 weeks and he brings forth one would be 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.250
 let feed the same person can 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.530
 remember that 7 you have to verify the 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.870
 initial chepo article how to act if 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.660
 we found a pigeon and the milk of 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.200
 crawl apart from the nest of the pigeon and 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.200
 of the sick
