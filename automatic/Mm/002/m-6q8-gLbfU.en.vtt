maybe sure there's two blocks between
okay<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.380> see<00:01:19.500> your<00:01:19.740> two<00:01:20.220> blocks<00:01:20.580> okay

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
okay you can see your two blocks okay

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.130 
okay you can see your two blocks okay
not<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.430> dirt<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.820> just<00:01:24.060> place<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.479> look

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
not to the dirt I just place this look

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.859 
not to the dirt I just place this look
there's<00:01:25.380> two<00:01:25.590> two<00:01:26.189> blocks<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.180> hole<00:01:27.570> and

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
there's two two blocks in that hole and

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.010 
there's two two blocks in that hole and
put<00:01:28.439> your<00:01:28.710> water<00:01:28.860> at<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.189> end<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.810> so<00:01:30.810> it

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
put your water at the end of it so it

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.920 
put your water at the end of it so it
can<00:01:31.049> stream<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.220> little<00:01:33.000> bit<00:01:33.180> out<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.689> your

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
can stream a little bit out and your

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.420 
can stream a little bit out and your
letter<00:01:34.200> or<00:01:35.299> sign<00:01:36.299> will<00:01:36.979> prevent<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.250> from

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
letter or sign will prevent it from

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.530 
letter or sign will prevent it from
falling<00:01:38.520> down<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.890> you<00:01:40.890> might<00:01:41.130> if<00:01:41.759> you're

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
falling down so you might if you're

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.249 
falling down so you might if you're
smart<00:01:42.899> you're<00:01:43.259> using<00:01:43.530> stairs<00:01:44.399> because<00:01:45.259> then

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
smart you're using stairs because then

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.950 
smart you're using stairs because then
you<00:01:46.380> con<00:01:46.619> can't<00:01:47.340> go<00:01:47.490> down<00:01:47.700> or<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.299> just<00:01:48.509> have<00:01:48.750> a

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
you con can't go down or you just have a

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.480 
you con can't go down or you just have a
pool<00:01:49.229> where<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.890> can<00:01:50.070> land<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:50.990> but<00:01:51.990> yeah

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
pool where you can land in but yeah

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.160 
pool where you can land in but yeah
having<00:01:53.490> stairs<00:01:53.970> it's<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.570> smartest<00:01:54.930> thing<00:01:55.140> to

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
having stairs it's the smartest thing to

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.370 
having stairs it's the smartest thing to
do<00:01:55.939> so<00:01:57.380> it's<00:01:58.380> basically<00:01:59.040> it's<00:01:59.820> just<00:02:00.380> having

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
do so it's basically it's just having

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.230 
do so it's basically it's just having
water<00:02:01.740> streaming<00:02:02.250> from<00:02:03.740> from<00:02:04.740> some

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
water streaming from from some

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.950 
water streaming from from some
sun<00:02:07.470> going<00:02:08.470> down<00:02:08.619> to<00:02:09.130> going<00:02:09.460> up<00:02:09.610> okay<00:02:10.240> and<00:02:10.479> two

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
sun going down to going up okay and two

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.840 
sun going down to going up okay and two
blocks<00:02:11.260> between<00:02:11.560> that's<00:02:12.070> all<00:02:12.370> you<00:02:12.610> need<00:02:12.760> to

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
blocks between that's all you need to

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.350 
blocks between that's all you need to
know<00:02:13.440> so<00:02:14.440> here<00:02:15.190> I'm<00:02:15.370> trying<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.910> do<00:02:16.000> something
