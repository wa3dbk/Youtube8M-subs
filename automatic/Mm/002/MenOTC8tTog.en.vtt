00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.910
 let them sell them we keep buying 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.830
 what is the worst 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.680
 because I'm selling it to you but you can not 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:16.029
 sell what touch of flavor we continue 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.140
 buying that little detail that does not bring 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.360
 really nothing because good was a hit 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.710
 very strong media if we all 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.240
 surprised that attraction of choosing the 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.650
 Dutch school as the school more 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.960
 good of johan core to be able 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.619
 evolve to be able to change what 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.399
 I was going through chivas but I'm 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.199
 no place of banchile will be called 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.990
 Rodriguez would already be at home 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.160
 long time 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.410
 unfortunately the disappointment for me 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.130
 for me personally is to see that there is no 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.020
 nothing different that has not come to 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.080
 to show no system of government is 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.090
 another way of working that they bring 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.280
 we would have expected something else, not me 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.080
 I see no revolution sincerely 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.360
 He has loved seeing something different because 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.040
 only by thinking that the 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.320
 resentment with all his work team and 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.170
 the people that he determines to be able to be 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.740
 the one that commands the chivas project 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.020
 we thought something was coming 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.270
 different usually the term 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.040
 revolutionizing football like this 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.500
 different times has been holland but 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.290
 no but sincerely in chivas I do not see 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.240
 no difference playing 433 lion well and 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.920
 playing the same before arriving in america 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.830
 I saw Chivas play well with Guero 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.020
 real and unfortunate already saved the real 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.600
 we do not look at you thinking that in that 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.970
 if we win we delete files or nothing and 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.009
 it will come from pylon but no no no 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.259
 is the idea the idea is of course to win 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.840
 a classic and the gunner is happy 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.280
 but if afterwards there is a bonus plus that 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.420
 good but already bouncing but it's not 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.750
 our idea we are not thinking 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.970
 less cold win is the reality the 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.610
 people do not forgive you for losing a match 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.520
 the interrogative then very good to 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.410
 the steel bar cover all the 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.080
 tournament interesting things to see in a 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.730
 very unlucky solvent archer I had 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.440
 a very classic error and good what 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.700
 they load there in a you and I think that then 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.690
 it's obvious that brand classics do not 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.190
 It is always prohibited but also 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.200
 classics not and more and more of the 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.470
 prohibited channels to see any 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.460
 party more especially a classic 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.460
 about the machines
