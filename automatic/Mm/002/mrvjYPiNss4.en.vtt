 hello guys welcome to today's video 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.379
 Today I'm going to show you how to make a 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.000
 jeweler with a glass bottle and a 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.570
 plastic branch these tastes 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.910
 good for this video we will use 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.050
 an empty glass bottle that you can 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.050
 find anywhere 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.940
 some bracelets 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.090
 some rings 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.940
 and a tree branch in this case you see it 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.830
 that is painted white but because 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.440
 I painted it with a spray you can 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.070
 take it on the street in the countryside where 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.739
 you want 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.739
 let's start by placing the bracelets 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:49.320
 it is very important to put one as a stop 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.320
 because if not some could sneak 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.370
 p 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.370
 and we are placing the rest 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.539
 in the order that we like 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:15.150
 once we have the bracelets 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:17.700
 put we are going to put the branch 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.370
 I like more painted then a 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.910
 trick to be able to paint with spray and not 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:28.940
 to put it all lost is to put the branch in 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:31.110
 empty cardboard box and from there 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.420
 put the spray 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.170
 I really like this idea because 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.810
 I have the whole view that normally if 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.909
 you have it in a closed jewelry box 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:47.999
 you do not see it and in this way 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.999
 you have clear that you have and that you do not have 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.260
 well up here the video today I hope 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.380
 that you liked it and that you put it in 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.850
 practice already know that in this way 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.670
 you have everything in sight and always 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.350
 you can find in an easy way and 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.710
