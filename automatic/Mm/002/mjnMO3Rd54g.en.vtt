discover<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.210> planet<00:00:39.629> obviously<00:00:40.020> we<00:00:40.559> have<00:00:40.710> to

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
discover a planet obviously we have to

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.830 
discover a planet obviously we have to
use<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.040> word<00:00:41.160> believe'<00:00:41.489> because<00:00:41.940> we<00:00:42.149> have<00:00:42.300> no

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
use the word believe' because we have no

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
idea when we've date back to ancient

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.369 
idea when we've date back to ancient
philosophers<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.539> ancient<00:00:45.930> astronomers

whether<00:00:46.620> someone<00:00:47.039> even<00:00:47.520> younger<00:00:47.760> might<00:00:48.120> have

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
whether someone even younger might have

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.000 
whether someone even younger might have
first<00:00:48.570> spotted<00:00:48.960> one<00:00:49.079> before<00:00:49.350> him<00:00:49.530> but

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
first spotted one before him but

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.770 
first spotted one before him but
certainly<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.760> our<00:00:50.789> knowledge<00:00:51.149> he<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
certainly to our knowledge he is the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.450 
certainly to our knowledge he is the
youngest<00:00:52.050> person<00:00:52.140> 15<00:00:52.829> year<00:00:52.980> old<00:00:53.100> people<00:00:53.280> were

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
youngest person 15 year old people were

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.130 
youngest person 15 year old people were
just<00:00:53.640> expecting<00:00:54.090> him<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.270> make<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.750> teas<00:00:54.930> and

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
just expecting him to make the teas and

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.410 
just expecting him to make the teas and
coffees<00:00:55.410> most<00:00:55.680> likely<00:00:56.039> now<00:00:56.670> they<00:00:57.000> have<00:00:57.180> to

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
coffees most likely now they have to

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.939 
coffees most likely now they have to
come<00:00:57.750> up<00:00:57.780> with<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.020> name<00:00:58.289> for<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.559> planet

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
come up with a name for the planet

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.260 
come up with a name for the planet
I<00:00:59.070> think<00:00:59.309> they<00:00:59.399> should<00:00:59.460> name<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.760> after<00:00:59.940> him

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
I think they should name it after him

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.060 
I think they should name it after him
personally<00:01:00.600> but<00:01:01.320> they've<00:01:01.530> launched<00:01:01.980> a

Jupiter's<00:02:13.590> are<00:02:13.830> basically<00:02:14.400> very<00:02:15.090> very<00:02:15.240> big

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
Jupiter's are basically very very big

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.320 
Jupiter's are basically very very big
around<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.860> size<00:02:17.099> of<00:02:17.340> Jupiter<00:02:17.640> which<00:02:18.060> we<00:02:18.209> know

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
around the size of Jupiter which we know

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.699 
around the size of Jupiter which we know
to<00:02:18.390> be<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.840> biggest<00:02:19.110> planet<00:02:19.470> in<00:02:19.530> our<00:02:19.650> solar

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
to be the biggest planet in our solar

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.699 
to be the biggest planet in our solar
system<00:02:20.310> but<00:02:20.459> also<00:02:21.209> very<00:02:21.810> very<00:02:22.140> hot<00:02:22.500> because

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
system but also very very hot because

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.160 
system but also very very hot because
they<00:02:23.040> orbit<00:02:23.550> very<00:02:23.970> close<00:02:24.239> to<00:02:24.540> their<00:02:24.690> star<00:02:25.020> and

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
they orbit very close to their star and

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.530 
they orbit very close to their star and
this<00:02:25.770> one<00:02:25.980> in<00:02:26.069> particular<00:02:26.190> orbits<00:02:26.849> every<00:02:27.300> two

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
this one in particular orbits every two

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.470 
this one in particular orbits every two
days<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:28.020> we<00:02:28.140> orbit<00:02:28.410> our<00:02:28.500> Sun<00:02:28.530> every<00:02:29.160> 365<00:02:29.700> days

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
days so we orbit our Sun every 365 days

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.380 
days so we orbit our Sun every 365 days
but<00:02:30.930> this<00:02:31.050> one<00:02:31.260> has<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:31.860> two-day<00:02:32.610> year<00:02:32.970> so<00:02:33.180> every

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
but this one has a two-day year so every

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.729 
but this one has a two-day year so every
time<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.660> passed<00:02:33.870> in<00:02:34.110> front<00:02:34.319> of<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.500> star

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
time it passed in front of the star

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.260 
time it passed in front of the star
there<00:02:35.250> was<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.400> dip<00:02:35.640> in<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.850> light<00:02:36.030> which<00:02:36.239> he

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
there was a dip in the light which he

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.570 
there was a dip in the light which he
spotted<00:02:36.780> it's<00:02:37.739> about<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:37.920> thousand<00:02:38.459> light

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
spotted it's about a thousand light

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.400 
spotted it's about a thousand light
years<00:02:38.610> away<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.540> can't<00:02:39.780> have<00:02:39.870> been<00:02:39.930> easy<00:02:40.019> to

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
years away so it can't have been easy to

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.740 
years away so it can't have been easy to
have<00:02:40.530> spotted<00:02:40.769> it<00:02:40.980> but<00:02:41.580> here's<00:02:42.120> what<00:02:42.300> Tom<00:02:42.510> said

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
have spotted it but here's what Tom said

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.540 
have spotted it but here's what Tom said
about<00:02:43.080> his<00:02:43.260> fine<00:02:43.470> he<00:02:43.680> said<00:02:43.890> I'm<00:02:44.099> hugely

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
about his fine he said I'm hugely

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.160 
about his fine he said I'm hugely
excited<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.150> have<00:02:45.239> found<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.540> new<00:02:45.660> planet<00:02:45.989> and

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
excited to have found a new planet and

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.170 
excited to have found a new planet and
I'm<00:02:46.500> very<00:02:46.800> impressed<00:02:47.340> that<00:02:47.430> we<00:02:47.580> can<00:02:47.730> find<00:02:47.970> them

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
I'm very impressed that we can find them

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.380 
I'm very impressed that we can find them
so<00:02:48.630> far<00:02:48.989> away<00:02:49.410> very<00:02:49.830> modest<00:02:50.250> referring<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.910> his

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
so far away very modest referring to his

find as we around a thousand of these

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.300 
find as we around a thousand of these
planets<00:02:55.080> have<00:02:55.319> been<00:02:55.350> discovered<00:02:55.739> by

as we know it so what do you think of

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.289 
as we know it so what do you think of
this<00:03:00.930> find<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.500> new<00:03:02.040> planet<00:03:02.459> that<00:03:02.640> also<00:03:02.970> will

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
this find a new planet that also will

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.509 
this find a new planet that also will
seemingly<00:03:03.630> very<00:03:04.170> very<00:03:04.650> hot<00:03:04.980> it's<00:03:05.160> probably

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
seemingly very very hot it's probably

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.520 
seemingly very very hot it's probably
filled<00:03:05.940> with<00:03:06.480> clouds<00:03:06.870> of<00:03:07.140> molten<00:03:07.470> rock
