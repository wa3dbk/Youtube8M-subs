00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
route 43 route options and we were just

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.550 
route 43 route options and we were just
looking<00:01:52.210> it<00:01:52.479> was<00:01:52.510> upwind<00:01:52.960> to<00:01:53.110> get<00:01:53.260> into<00:01:53.439> the

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
looking it was upwind to get into the

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.520 
looking it was upwind to get into the
rabbit<00:01:54.180> ki<00:01:55.180> basin

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
rabbit ki basin

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.850 
rabbit ki basin
short<00:01:57.369> tacking<00:01:57.960> against<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:59.170> current<00:01:59.500> it<00:01:59.770> was

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
short tacking against the current it was

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.469 
short tacking against the current it was
dead<00:02:00.040> upwind<00:02:00.430> and<00:02:00.640> we<00:02:00.729> figured<00:02:01.060> coming<00:02:01.360> out

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
dead upwind and we figured coming out

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.480 
dead upwind and we figured coming out
here<00:02:01.720> wasn't<00:02:02.440> a<00:02:02.590> lot<00:02:02.740> longer<00:02:02.920> if<00:02:03.190> your<00:02:03.310> apt

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
here wasn't a lot longer if your apt

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.120 
here wasn't a lot longer if your apt
attack<00:02:03.850> linds<00:02:04.840> gone<00:02:04.990> right<00:02:05.290> so<00:02:05.710> yeah<00:02:05.979> we

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
attack linds gone right so yeah we

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.969 
attack linds gone right so yeah we
probably<00:02:06.580> sailed<00:02:06.909> some<00:02:07.060> extra<00:02:07.299> distance<00:02:07.979> have

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
probably sailed some extra distance have

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:26.420 
probably sailed some extra distance have
an<00:02:09.130> ad

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:03:02.420 

alright<00:02:27.500> try<00:02:28.500> again<00:03:00.889> alright<00:03:01.889> maybe<00:03:02.099> we<00:03:02.220> got
