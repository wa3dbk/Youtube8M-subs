00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
should we start out right now in belfie

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.859 
should we start out right now in belfie
three<00:01:22.200> suppression<00:01:22.920> less<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.210> kind<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.720> long

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
three suppression less and kind of long

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.410 
three suppression less and kind of long
you<00:01:25.229> get<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.590> kind<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.860> quick<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.420> increases

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
you get it kind of quick it increases

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.630 
you get it kind of quick it increases
bullet<00:01:27.720> spread<00:01:27.990> blood<00:01:28.590> deviation<00:01:29.159> as<00:01:29.369> well<00:01:29.549> as

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
bullet spread blood deviation as well as

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.330 
bullet spread blood deviation as well as
the<00:01:29.759> recoil<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.390> also<00:01:30.900> keeps<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.040> from

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
the recoil and also keeps you from

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.390 
the recoil and also keeps you from
regenerating<00:01:33.030> health<00:01:33.530> so<00:01:34.530> lots<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.159> stuff

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
regenerating health so lots of stuff

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.300 
regenerating health so lots of stuff
just<00:01:35.759> annoying<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:37.229> idea<00:01:37.650> itself<00:01:38.100> is

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
just annoying and the idea itself is

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.700 
just annoying and the idea itself is
pretty<00:01:39.030> cool<00:01:39.420> actually<00:01:39.659> but<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
pretty cool actually but the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.800 
pretty cool actually but the
implementation<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.430> just<00:01:42.119> totally<00:01:42.570> wrong<00:01:42.780> and

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
implementation is just totally wrong and

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.389 
implementation is just totally wrong and
just<00:01:43.200> rewards<00:01:43.829> loops<00:01:44.689> that<00:01:45.689> are<00:01:45.750> like<00:01:46.399> pray

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
just rewards loops that are like pray

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.480 
just rewards loops that are like pray
and<00:01:47.549> spray<00:01:47.670> kind<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.659> people<00:01:49.020> but<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.470> yeah<00:01:50.220> in

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
and spray kind of people but and yeah in

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.429 
and spray kind of people but and yeah in
belfie<00:01:51.149> for<00:01:51.420> it's<00:01:51.540> going<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.960> be<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.110> little<00:01:52.320> bit

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
rounds like light machine guns

rounds like light machine guns
bolt-action<00:01:58.110> rounds<00:01:58.649> only<00:01:59.430> stuff<00:01:59.759> like<00:01:59.969> that

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
bolt-action rounds only stuff like that

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.749 
bolt-action rounds only stuff like that
is<00:02:00.420> able<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:01.320> really<00:02:01.920> suppress<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.640> I'm

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
is able to really suppress you and I'm

is able to really suppress you and I'm
not<00:02:02.790> completely<00:02:03.149> sure<00:02:03.360> only<00:02:03.719> semi<00:02:03.930> autos<00:02:04.290> or

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
not completely sure only semi autos or

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.219 
not completely sure only semi autos or
just<00:02:05.130> 18<00:02:05.369> hours<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:05.729> general<00:02:06.000> if<00:02:06.630> they're<00:02:06.899> also

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
just 18 hours in general if they're also

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.790 
just 18 hours in general if they're also
going<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.649> have<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.629> increased<00:02:09.800> suppression

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
going to have a increased suppression

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.600 
going to have a increased suppression
effect<00:02:10.890> personally<00:02:11.760> I

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
effect personally I

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.610 
effect personally I
you<00:02:12.670> don't<00:02:13.210> see<00:02:13.480> them<00:02:13.660> have<00:02:13.900> one<00:02:14.140> because<00:02:14.290> it's

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
you don't see them have one because it's

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.030 
you don't see them have one because it's
so<00:02:14.740> easy<00:02:14.980> to<00:02:15.130> just<00:02:15.570> fire<00:02:16.570> those<00:02:16.900> round<00:02:17.440> query<00:02:17.800> I

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
so easy to just fire those round query I

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.030 
so easy to just fire those round query I
think<00:02:18.640> would<00:02:18.790> not<00:02:19.120> make<00:02:19.240> sense<00:02:19.480> but<00:02:20.040> besides

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
think would not make sense but besides

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.020 
think would not make sense but besides
em<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.610> LMGs<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.630> sniper<00:02:23.620> rifles<00:02:24.030> the

em the LMGs and the sniper rifles the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
vehicle and guns they're all still and

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.130 
vehicle and guns they're all still and
they're<00:02:36.130> still<00:02:36.400> suppressing<00:02:36.820> you<00:02:36.940> however<00:02:37.840> am

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
they're still suppressing you however am

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.170 
they're still suppressing you however am
suppression<00:02:38.709> goes<00:02:38.950> away<00:02:39.130> a<00:02:39.310> lot<00:02:39.580> quicker<00:02:39.850> like

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
suppression goes away a lot quicker like

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.720 
suppression goes away a lot quicker like
it<00:02:40.420> lasts<00:02:40.630> for<00:02:40.900> maybe<00:02:41.200> one<00:02:41.860> second<00:02:42.280> or<00:02:42.400> so<00:02:42.550> and

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
it lasts for maybe one second or so and

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.280 
it lasts for maybe one second or so and
then<00:02:42.790> it's<00:02:43.060> already<00:02:43.360> gone<00:02:43.540> may<00:02:43.840> one<00:02:44.050> half

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
then it's already gone may one half

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.040 
then it's already gone may one half
maybe<00:02:44.500> two<00:02:44.740> and<00:02:44.890> you<00:02:45.700> if<00:02:45.970> you<00:02:46.090> watch<00:02:46.240> the<00:02:46.450> e3

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
maybe two and you if you watch the e3

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
maybe two and you if you watch the e3
stream<00:02:47.290> again<00:02:47.410> you<00:02:47.590> will<00:02:47.680> definitely<00:02:47.920> see

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
stream again you will definitely see

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.070 
stream again you will definitely see
that<00:02:48.250> it's<00:02:48.610> fading<00:02:49.180> off<00:02:49.300> extremely<00:02:49.630> quick

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
that it's fading off extremely quick

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.320 
that it's fading off extremely quick
also<00:02:50.980> AM<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:52.450> suppression<00:02:52.840> effect<00:02:53.020> itself

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
also AM the suppression effect itself

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.870 
also AM the suppression effect itself
will<00:02:55.330> first<00:02:56.070> develop<00:02:57.070> its<00:02:57.250> its<00:02:57.640> full

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
will first develop its its full

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.050 
will first develop its its full
potential<00:02:58.239> at<00:02:58.630> a<00:02:58.660> medium<00:02:59.260> range<00:02:59.500> so<00:02:59.800> and<00:03:00.060> I

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
potential at a medium range so and I

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.900 
potential at a medium range so and I
think<00:03:01.120> you<00:03:01.420> have<00:03:01.510> to<00:03:01.660> like<00:03:02.230> an<00:03:03.160> hour<00:03:03.310> maybe<00:03:03.520> 20

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
think you have to like an hour maybe 20

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.400 
think you have to like an hour maybe 20
meters<00:03:04.150> away<00:03:04.270> or<00:03:04.510> so<00:03:04.690> because<00:03:05.020> if<00:03:05.290> you're

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
meters away or so because if you're

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.900 
meters away or so because if you're
really<00:03:05.560> close<00:03:05.800> up<00:03:06.040> there<00:03:06.310> is<00:03:06.430> almost<00:03:06.640> no

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
really close up there is almost no

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.000 
really close up there is almost no
suppression<00:03:07.180> effect<00:03:07.420> so<00:03:07.900> that's<00:03:08.620> their<00:03:08.830> way

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
suppression effect so that's their way

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.479 
suppression effect so that's their way
of<00:03:09.870> putting<00:03:10.870> out<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.230> nupes<00:03:11.770> praying<00:03:12.160> pray

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
of putting out the nupes praying pray

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.420 
of putting out the nupes praying pray
aspect<00:03:13.180> of<00:03:13.830> newbie<00:03:14.830> gunfights<00:03:15.190> of

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
aspect of newbie gunfights of

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.729 
aspect of newbie gunfights of
suppression<00:03:16.300> so<00:03:16.720> I<00:03:16.750> think<00:03:16.900> it's<00:03:17.110> actually

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
suppression so I think it's actually

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.979 
suppression so I think it's actually
pretty<00:03:18.040> cool<00:03:18.250> weather<00:03:18.489> what<00:03:19.180> they<00:03:19.360> are<00:03:19.600> doing

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
pretty cool weather what they are doing

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.470 
pretty cool weather what they are doing
and<00:03:20.170> what<00:03:20.380> they've<00:03:20.560> done<00:03:20.890> there<00:03:21.130> and<00:03:21.340> I<00:03:22.239> think

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
and what they've done there and I think

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.420 
and what they've done there and I think
this<00:03:22.600> is<00:03:22.720> actually<00:03:23.049> am<00:03:23.260> a<00:03:23.769> good<00:03:24.130> way<00:03:24.400> to

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
this is actually am a good way to

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.280 
this is actually am a good way to
balance<00:03:24.760> it<00:03:25.030> out<00:03:25.120> just<00:03:25.450> at<00:03:25.959> least<00:03:26.110> from<00:03:26.200> my

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
balance it out just at least from my

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.380 
balance it out just at least from my
point<00:03:26.560> of<00:03:26.650> view<00:03:26.709> again<00:03:27.489> and<00:03:27.790> stuff<00:03:28.239> like

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
point of view again and stuff like

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.930 
point of view again and stuff like
carbines<00:03:28.810> assault<00:03:29.200> rifles<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:29.730> pw<00:03:30.730> stay

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
carbines assault rifles and pw stay

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.759 
carbines assault rifles and pw stay
still<00:03:31.269> and<00:03:31.510> there<00:03:32.049> they<00:03:32.410> are<00:03:32.440> still

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
still and there they are still

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.180 
still and there they are still
suppressing<00:03:33.280> but<00:03:34.090> not<00:03:34.510> a<00:03:34.540> lot<00:03:34.660> and<00:03:35.190> it's

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
suppressing but not a lot and it's

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.330 
suppressing but not a lot and it's
probably<00:03:36.640> well<00:03:37.630> the<00:03:38.110> people<00:03:38.440> at<00:03:38.650> e3<00:03:38.769> said<00:03:39.190> it's

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
probably well the people at e3 said it's

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.789 
probably well the people at e3 said it's
almost<00:03:39.670> not<00:03:40.030> noticeable<00:03:40.600> so<00:03:41.170> I<00:03:41.200> think<00:03:41.530> I'm

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
almost not noticeable so I think I'm

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:46.140 
almost not noticeable so I think I'm
suppression<00:03:42.459> won't<00:03:42.790> be<00:03:43.000> a<00:03:43.360> big<00:03:43.840> deal<00:03:43.870> in<00:03:45.150> in

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
suppression won't be a big deal in in

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.520 
suppression won't be a big deal in in

suppression<00:03:57.459> and<00:03:57.610> you<00:03:57.730> also<00:03:57.910> like<00:03:58.180> the<00:03:58.390> buff

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
suppression and you also like the buff

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.390 
suppression and you also like the buff
which<00:03:58.900> tends<00:03:59.380> or<00:03:59.650> class<00:03:59.860> gets<00:04:00.100> through

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
which tends or class gets through

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.910 
which tends or class gets through
through<00:04:01.299> that<00:04:01.420> but<00:04:01.630> yeah<00:04:01.810> I<00:04:02.049> think<00:04:02.350> just<00:04:02.769> wraps

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
through that but yeah I think just wraps

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.070 
through that but yeah I think just wraps
it<00:04:03.040> up<00:04:03.130> for<00:04:03.370> suppression<00:04:04.000> bills<00:04:04.239> before<00:04:04.390> if

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080
