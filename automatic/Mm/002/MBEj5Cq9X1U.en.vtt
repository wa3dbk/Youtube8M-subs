00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.710
 all electrical work in the building 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:52.440
 here we go electrical work 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:56.059
 metal grounding lighting 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.059
 local route with

 everything is ready for installation here 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.570
 equipment that will start in 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.789
 soon established 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.159
 metal floor cable floor 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.080
 hundreds of them will soon reach out 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.180
 kilometers of cable that will power 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.369
 all building management equipment 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.640

 particular many 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.220
 replenished wife on technical workers 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.550
 come to study embroidered us a lot with

 previously missed during restructuring 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.319
 Now after perestroika there were 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.910
 gaps 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.950
 highly skilled workers and 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.260
 respectively, rather than technical works 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.720
 and there are those workers who 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.200
 worked a lot for 30 years and 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.710
 more that can give before pass
