00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
here you just got the car at the front

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.000 
here you just got the car at the front
there<00:00:32.980> is<00:00:33.010> the<00:00:33.489> camera<00:00:33.670> and<00:00:34.390> just<00:00:34.420> has<00:00:34.809> like

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
there is the camera and just has like

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.170 
there is the camera and just has like
meant<00:00:36.010> to<00:00:36.100> be<00:00:36.190> the<00:00:36.309> explosive

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
meant to be the explosive

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.440 
meant to be the explosive
unlike<00:00:37.719> the<00:00:37.840> kill<00:00:38.020> streak<00:00:38.320> in<00:00:38.710> the<00:00:38.860> game<00:00:39.010> and

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:44.499 
so on this is really like them goes up

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:49.040 
so on this is really like them goes up
and<00:00:44.769> down<00:00:45.030> has<00:00:46.030> spring<00:00:46.600> there<00:00:46.899> and<00:00:47.320> there<00:00:47.670> so

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
and down has spring there and there so

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.829 
and down has spring there and there so
this<00:00:50.050> one<00:00:50.350> requires<00:00:50.859> six<00:00:51.850> batteries<00:00:52.269> and<00:00:52.570> the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:52.839 
this one requires six batteries and the

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:54.660 
this one requires six batteries and the
remote<00:00:53.199> requires<00:00:53.710> six<00:00:54.100> battery<00:00:54.489> so

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
remote requires six battery so

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.579 
remote requires six battery so
altogether<00:00:54.969> you<00:00:55.420> need<00:00:55.569> 12<00:00:55.870> batteries<00:00:56.199> so

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
altogether you need 12 batteries so

the battery is there use this like go

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.539 
the battery is there use this like go
from<00:01:13.320> like<00:01:14.320> spin<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:17.500> that's<00:01:18.159> just<00:01:18.340> like

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
from like spin that that's just like

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.859 
from like spin that that's just like
trim<00:01:18.939> so<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:20.350> front<00:01:20.619> wheels<00:01:20.860> like<00:01:21.159> move<00:01:21.869> got

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869
