00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.089

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.240
 to have mortal kombat for free I you 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.219
 invite you to visit the test video 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.509
 of the deadly kombat game on my channel 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.099
 second is actually this comment is 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.260
 so feel free to click on the link 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.390
 the notation that is on your 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.850
 screen so we find ourselves right away 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.350
 for the tutorial about the crash of 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:32.750
 mortal kombat immediately 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:34.020
 [Music] 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.149
 well 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.680
 hello to all and to all those I hope 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.329
 that you're fine I'm going very 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.579
 very well today we end up 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.350
 for the crack of mortal kombat so 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.540
 it's the full version of the game without the 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.190
 multiplayer I specify without the 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.790
 multiplayer it is not available for 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.059
 this version 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.290
 so it's been two weeks since I 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.579
 did not do it simply because 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.600
 I am I went on vacation 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.400
 during one week 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.470
 and so I could not make videos 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.420
 during this period there so I 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.199
 inform on my twitter account for 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.049
 those who follow me 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.610
 and so that's how I usually do you 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.200
 invite to go in the description 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.760
 just below the video you 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.340
 so find the different links a 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.520
 micro torrent of winrar and damon all that 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.490
 so is the link the pirate bay 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.960
 to be able to download game so we will 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.700
 on the link the pirate bay and you 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.380
 just click on get this 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.930
 torrent so you launch the application 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.490
 and these will launch automatically 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:31.560
 in the microsoft software 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.390
 then you have a file that is 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.409
 names mortal kombat complete edition and 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.300
 flutes and once you have 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.740
 downloaded I so double click you 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.480
 on it and you click on the dvd 1 so 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.950
 we have two dvd folders 2 why 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.570
 because after a while we 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.520
 we will have to switch to the folder 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.310
 dvd so we just click on sure 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.710
 to avoid one and we'll just 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.180
 double click on the file or saw that 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.830
 my software and in default programs 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.830
 no I just have to double-click 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.570
 so we're waiting for the image of the game to be 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.750
 mounted virtually so we run the 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.229
 setup once this is done you 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.940
 install game so we do ok following 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.039
 following me I'm yes because I already 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.709
 installed following have created a shortcut 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.299
 we add a shortcut on the desktop 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.269
 as well as in the next start menu 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.379
 is installed so I have this little 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.900
 message to because I had installed 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.510
 previously 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.470
 Director so I'll do it next 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.230
 will do it automatically 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.769
 you do not have this message there so we 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.760
 keep on going 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.840
 now here is the installation of goals 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.040
 I 'm going to cut the video to prevent that 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.110
 it is too long we find ourselves all 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.840
 following because we will have to switch with the 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.220
 folder dvd 2 at once 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.950
 so here is the first part of 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.959
 the installation is complete so you 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.750

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:55.069
 in the folder dvd 2 so you double 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:56.690
 click on file iso you 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.510

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.639

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.340
 and I cut the video again 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:06.760

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.200
