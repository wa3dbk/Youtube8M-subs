00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:07.210
 Summer is the most anticipated time of 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.980
 year plus sun hours holiday now 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.959
 we all want to go to the beach 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.299
 but in thyssenkrupp encasa we gave ourselves 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:17.029
 realize that summer is not the same for 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.189
 all thousands of people with disabilities 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.890
 with mobility problems and our 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.750
 older people discover great obstacles to 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.019
 the time to travel and find a destination 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.150
 accessible so we set out to help 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.949
 to create a summer without barriers for it 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.670
 We decided to promote the beach more 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:37.910
 accessible from Spain but common 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.769
 social networks so the beach was born 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.230
 accessible from fans through 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.480
 facebook and twitter we ask all 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.820
 fans and followers who recommended us 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.090
 accessible beaches according to your opinion and 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.160
 experience and with all its proposals 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:55.070
 we create the most accessible beach point is 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.379
 for the first time we could all vote the 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.840
 more accessible beach and so find 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.789
 between all a destination without barriers but 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.949
 we wanted to do something else take this 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.560
 recognition of social networks to 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.360
 the best valued beach we created the 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.060
 accessible beach flag of the 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.429
 fans and we promised to take her to the 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.920
 most voted beach so we did the 

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:20.409
 suitcases and we headed to the beach 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:23.330
 in isla cantabria with 22,553 votes 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.920
 It was the best rated beach squares 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.670
 of parking for people with 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.580

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.950
 support throughout the summer the 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.500
 City Hall and the Government of Cantabria 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.229
 they joined the movement and thanked 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.390
 the support of all those people and that is 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.429
 something good is happening thousands of 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.100
 people brought us to a summer without 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:57.020
 barriers we all realized the 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.840
 importance of belonging to something else 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.319
 bigger than ourselves but 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.440
 everything that accessibility is a right 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:05.440
 universal
