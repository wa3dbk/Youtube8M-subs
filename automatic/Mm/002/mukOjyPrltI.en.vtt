00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
I was recording this and ultimate team

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.170 
I was recording this and ultimate team
is<00:02:18.190> one<00:02:18.340> of<00:02:18.430> those<00:02:18.520> things<00:02:18.640> where<00:02:18.790> you<00:02:19.000> either

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
is one of those things where you either

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.210 
is one of those things where you either
have<00:02:19.480> to<00:02:19.660> go<00:02:19.750> balls<00:02:20.020> out<00:02:20.380> and<00:02:20.740> build<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:21.040> team

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
have to go balls out and build a team

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.610 
have to go balls out and build a team
for<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.730> win<00:02:21.940> because<00:02:22.540> everything<00:02:23.230> is<00:02:23.350> very

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
for the win because everything is very

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.940 
for the win because everything is very
very<00:02:23.830> win<00:02:24.250> oriented<00:02:25.180> now<00:02:25.330> it's<00:02:25.600> hard<00:02:25.870> to<00:02:25.990> uh<00:02:26.230> I

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
very win oriented now it's hard to uh I

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.680 
very win oriented now it's hard to uh I
suppose<00:02:27.430> it's<00:02:27.610> semi<00:02:27.820> hard<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.240> try<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:28.450> just

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
suppose it's semi hard to try to just

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:29.910 
suppose it's semi hard to try to just
kind<00:02:28.870> of<00:02:28.900> go<00:02:29.050> out<00:02:29.080> and<00:02:29.290> play<00:02:29.380> a<00:02:29.440> match<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:29.800> have

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
kind of go out and play a match and have

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.200 
kind of go out and play a match and have
a<00:02:29.980> good<00:02:30.130> time<00:02:30.280> because<00:02:30.460> you<00:02:30.640> come<00:02:30.820> up<00:02:30.940> against

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
a good time because you come up against

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.750 
a good time because you come up against
teams<00:02:31.420> like<00:02:31.540> this<00:02:31.870> for<00:02:32.230> 12<00:02:32.410> 12<00:02:32.950> BP<00:02:33.220> outside

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
teams like this for 12 12 BP outside

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.180 
teams like this for 12 12 BP outside
they're<00:02:34.480> stronger<00:02:34.990> than<00:02:35.020> me<00:02:35.260> they're<00:02:35.710> faster

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
they're stronger than me they're faster

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.270 
they're stronger than me they're faster
than<00:02:36.310> me<00:02:36.460> and<00:02:36.610> I<00:02:37.440> you<00:02:38.440> know<00:02:38.470> it's<00:02:38.740> just<00:02:38.890> it's<00:02:39.160> a

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
than me and I you know it's just it's a

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.860 
than me and I you know it's just it's a
tough<00:02:39.520> it's<00:02:39.880> a<00:02:39.940> tough<00:02:39.970> winter<00:02:40.330> it's<00:02:40.660> a<00:02:40.690> tough

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
tough it's a tough winter it's a tough

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.030 
tough it's a tough winter it's a tough
way<00:02:41.020> to<00:02:41.050> go<00:02:41.260> for<00:02:41.470> it<00:02:41.530> but<00:02:41.650> we're<00:02:41.740> heading<00:02:41.920> into

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
way to go for it but we're heading into

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.100 
way to go for it but we're heading into
halftime<00:02:42.130> and<00:02:42.700> add<00:02:43.270> half<00:02:43.510> time<00:02:43.750> I<00:02:43.960> was

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
halftime and add half time I was

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.360 
halftime and add half time I was
actually<00:02:44.290> controlling<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:44.980> game<00:02:45.070> pretty

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
actually controlling the game pretty

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.950 
actually controlling the game pretty
well<00:02:45.460> fifty-seven<00:02:46.330> percent<00:02:46.390> possession

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
well fifty-seven percent possession

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.720 
well fifty-seven percent possession
you'd<00:02:47.080> only<00:02:47.230> had<00:02:47.440> one<00:02:47.650> shot<00:02:47.680> not<00:02:48.160> even<00:02:48.580> on

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
you'd only had one shot not even on

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.970 
you'd only had one shot not even on
target<00:02:49.360> so<00:02:49.960> I<00:02:49.990> felt<00:02:50.260> pretty<00:02:50.380> good<00:02:50.650> with<00:02:50.860> my

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
target so I felt pretty good with my

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.300 
target so I felt pretty good with my
chances<00:02:51.370> going<00:02:51.610> into<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:51.940> second<00:02:52.330> half<00:02:52.360> but

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
chances going into the second half but

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.730 
chances going into the second half but
it<00:02:54.310> would<00:02:54.520> all<00:02:54.730> be<00:02:55.000> for<00:02:55.570> naught<00:02:55.840> here<00:02:56.140> 62nd

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
it would all be for naught here 62nd

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.110 
it would all be for naught here 62nd
minute<00:02:56.770> he<00:02:57.010> plays<00:02:57.160> a<00:02:57.190> wonderful<00:02:57.640> passing<00:02:58.030> on
