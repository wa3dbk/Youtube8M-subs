from 0 to 100 in nine point nine seconds
which<00:01:33.920> doesn't<00:01:34.580> sound<00:01:34.700> like<00:01:34.850> much<00:01:34.970> but<00:01:35.479> the

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
which doesn't sound like much but the

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.180 
which doesn't sound like much but the
car<00:01:36.440> actually<00:01:36.710> feels<00:01:37.250> much<00:01:37.940> faster<00:01:39.190> probably

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
car actually feels much faster probably

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.580 
car actually feels much faster probably
it's<00:01:40.640> because<00:01:41.149> the<00:01:41.270> engine<00:01:41.600> is<00:01:41.690> quite<00:01:42.020> loud<00:01:42.259> as

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
it's because the engine is quite loud as

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.060 
it's because the engine is quite loud as
you<00:01:42.920> may<00:01:43.070> hear<00:01:43.340> and<00:01:44.020> secondly<00:01:45.020> because<00:01:45.289> the

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
you may hear and secondly because the

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.090 
you may hear and secondly because the
cabin<00:01:46.789> insulation<00:01:47.420> leaves<00:01:48.170> a<00:01:48.320> lot<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:48.800> be

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
cabin insulation leaves a lot to be

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.719 
cabin insulation leaves a lot to be
desired

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.999 

now<00:01:52.729> the<00:01:53.030> point<00:01:53.270> of<00:01:53.420> buying<00:01:53.570> crossovers<00:01:54.440> is

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
now the point of buying crossovers is

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.070 
now the point of buying crossovers is
that<00:01:55.460> you<00:01:55.610> ride<00:01:55.940> higher<00:01:56.270> you<00:01:56.660> got<00:01:56.840> a<00:01:56.869> better

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
that you ride higher you got a better

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.109 
that you ride higher you got a better
view<00:01:57.410> of<00:01:57.440> the<00:01:57.530> road<00:01:57.649> and<00:01:58.039> here<00:01:58.399> in<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:58.580> maca<00:01:58.940> I
