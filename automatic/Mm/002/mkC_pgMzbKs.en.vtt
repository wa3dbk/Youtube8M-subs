from our main male character of high Q

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.490 
from our main male character of high Q
but<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.590> see<00:01:16.799> how<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:18.330> starts<00:01:19.140> like<00:01:19.320> he

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
but to see how in this starts like he

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.039 
but to see how in this starts like he
has<00:01:19.619> like<00:01:19.799> no<00:01:19.950> presence<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.700> really<00:01:21.150> just<00:01:21.869> has

has like no presence it really just has

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.260 
has like no presence it really just has
a<00:01:22.080> different<00:01:22.530> unique<00:01:22.830> perspective<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:24.000> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
a different unique perspective on the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.370 
a different unique perspective on the
series<00:01:24.630> but<00:01:24.780> especially<00:01:25.110> when<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.259> have<00:01:25.350> a

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.870 
series but especially when you have a
character<00:01:25.619> like<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:26.280> couple<00:01:26.340> weeks<00:01:26.580> back

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
popularity it definitely must be good

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.029 
popularity it definitely must be good
for<00:02:05.600> it's<00:02:05.930> a<00:02:06.020> half<00:02:06.200> three<00:02:06.470> seasons<00:02:06.860> and

for it's a half three seasons and

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:08.740 
for it's a half three seasons and
warrant<00:02:07.399> three<00:02:07.700> seasons<00:02:08.179> so<00:02:08.330> it's<00:02:08.479> definitely

warrant three seasons so it's definitely
selling<00:02:09.110> well<00:02:09.289> when<00:02:09.890> it<00:02:09.979> comes<00:02:10.160> to<00:02:10.429> terms<00:02:10.849> of

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
selling well when it comes to terms of

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.210 
selling well when it comes to terms of
the<00:02:11.269> animation<00:02:12.050> quality<00:02:12.200> I<00:02:12.709> think<00:02:13.069> this

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
the animation quality I think this

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.630 
the animation quality I think this
series

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
series

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.870 
series
Kuroko<00:02:14.330> no<00:02:14.360> basket<00:02:14.870> came<00:02:15.140> out<00:02:15.319> in<00:02:15.519> 2012<00:02:16.519> I

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
Kuroko no basket came out in 2012 I

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.040 
Kuroko no basket came out in 2012 I
think<00:02:17.060> that's<00:02:17.209> when<00:02:17.420> season<00:02:17.720> when<00:02:17.810> we<00:02:17.870> came

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
think that's when season when we came

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.680 
think that's when season when we came
out<00:02:18.110> if<00:02:18.590> so<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:19.790> animation<00:02:20.120> quality<00:02:20.330> looks

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
out if so the animation quality looks

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.990 
out if so the animation quality looks
pretty<00:02:20.900> damn<00:02:21.080> good<00:02:21.380> like<00:02:21.709> it<00:02:21.860> really<00:02:22.280> curb

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
pretty damn good like it really curb

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.780 
pretty damn good like it really curb
stomps<00:02:23.420> a<00:02:23.540> lot<00:02:23.780> of<00:02:23.930> things<00:02:24.170> from<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:25.370> recent

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
stomps a lot of things from the recent

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.550 
stomps a lot of things from the recent
seasons<00:02:26.150> of<00:02:26.239> anime<00:02:26.510> it<00:02:26.660> really<00:02:27.019> does<00:02:27.200> like<00:02:27.440> the

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
seasons of anime it really does like the

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.840 
seasons of anime it really does like the
animation<00:02:27.980> quality<00:02:28.040> looks<00:02:28.400> really<00:02:28.730> good

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
animation quality looks really good

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.390 
animation quality looks really good
solid<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:29.569> I<00:02:30.019> don't<00:02:30.380> think<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:30.650> really<00:02:30.890> saw<00:02:31.069> any

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
solid and I don't think I really saw any

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.250 
solid and I don't think I really saw any
dirt<00:02:31.910> either<00:02:32.480> actually<00:02:32.870> if<00:02:32.930> I<00:02:32.989> think<00:02:33.049> about

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
dirt either actually if I think about

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.650 
dirt either actually if I think about
usually<00:02:33.680> when<00:02:33.799> I<00:02:33.830> see<00:02:34.069> an<00:02:34.190> anime<00:02:34.610> I<00:02:34.819> can<00:02:35.420> point

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
usually when I see an anime I can point

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.420 
usually when I see an anime I can point
out<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:35.930> dirts<00:02:36.349> when<00:02:36.590> it<00:02:36.680> comes<00:02:36.860> to<00:02:37.010> facial

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
out the dirts when it comes to facial

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.979 
out the dirts when it comes to facial
expressions<00:02:38.120> of<00:02:38.299> the<00:02:38.390> characters<00:02:38.810> in<00:02:38.930> the

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
expressions of the characters in the

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.050 
expressions of the characters in the
backgrounds<00:02:39.500> but<00:02:39.680> I<00:02:39.860> didn't<00:02:40.310> see<00:02:40.489> much<00:02:40.790> of

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
backgrounds but I didn't see much of

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.360 
backgrounds but I didn't see much of
those<00:02:41.360> and<00:02:41.660> so<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.769> only<00:02:43.069> thing<00:02:43.190> I<00:02:43.280> could

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
those and so the only thing I could

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.640 
those and so the only thing I could
really<00:02:43.489> say<00:02:43.910> that<00:02:44.390> it<00:02:45.200> comes<00:02:45.410> to<00:02:45.560> the

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
really say that it comes to the

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.380 
really say that it comes to the
animation<00:02:46.099> that's<00:02:46.220> kind<00:02:46.400> of<00:02:46.459> bad<00:02:46.670> is<00:02:47.060> some

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
animation that's kind of bad is some

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.080 
animation that's kind of bad is some
usages<00:02:47.959> of<00:02:48.019> CGI<00:02:48.890> for<00:02:49.099> instance<00:02:49.790> when<00:02:49.910> it<00:02:50.000> came

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
usages of CGI for instance when it came

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.720 
usages of CGI for instance when it came
to<00:02:50.269> the<00:02:50.390> basket<00:02:50.870> moving<00:02:51.230> with<00:02:51.349> a<00:02:51.380> CGI<00:02:51.830> or<00:02:51.950> when

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
to the basket moving with a CGI or when

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:53.800 
to the basket moving with a CGI or when
it<00:02:52.849> came<00:02:52.970> to<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.239> vehicles<00:02:53.599> in<00:02:53.720> the

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
it came to the vehicles in the

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.360 
it came to the vehicles in the
background<00:02:54.290> that<00:02:54.709> was<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:54.890> only<00:02:55.040> time<00:02:55.340> I

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
background that was the only time I

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.930 
background that was the only time I
think<00:02:55.549> the<00:02:55.820> animation<00:02:56.480> was<00:02:56.690> that<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.109> best<00:02:57.380> so

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
think the animation was that the best so

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.940 
think the animation was that the best so
overall<00:02:58.940> though<00:02:59.180> animation<00:02:59.959> very<00:03:00.290> solid<00:03:00.829> when

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
overall though animation very solid when

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.500 
overall though animation very solid when
it<00:03:01.040> comes<00:03:01.250> down<00:03:01.400> to<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.670> point<00:03:01.850> of<00:03:02.150> the

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
it comes down to the point of the

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.180 
it comes down to the point of the
matches<00:03:03.049> and<00:03:03.079> what<00:03:03.500> I<00:03:03.530> saw<00:03:03.920> so<00:03:04.160> far

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
matches and what I saw so far

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.220 
matches and what I saw so far
demonstrated<00:03:05.030> to<00:03:05.120> me<00:03:05.150> in<00:03:05.480> these<00:03:05.810> first<00:03:06.049> two

demonstrated to me in these first two

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.370 
demonstrated to me in these first two
episodes<00:03:06.380> so<00:03:07.340> what<00:03:07.910> is<00:03:08.239> this<00:03:08.660> series<00:03:09.019> about<00:03:09.170> if

that's<00:03:42.260> also<00:03:42.680> a<00:03:42.889> kind<00:03:43.250> of<00:03:43.370> a<00:03:43.430> sports<00:03:43.639> series<00:03:44.030> so

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
that's also a kind of a sports series so

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.090 
that's also a kind of a sports series so
yeah<00:03:44.540> chihaya's

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
yeah chihaya's

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.559 
yeah chihaya's
slightly<00:03:46.100> sports<00:03:46.400> so<00:03:46.579> I<00:03:46.609> guess<00:03:46.880> six<00:03:47.209> let's

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
slightly sports so I guess six let's

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.660 
slightly sports so I guess six let's
just<00:03:47.780> say<00:03:47.930> five<00:03:48.380> or<00:03:48.620> six<00:03:48.889> series<00:03:49.220> I<00:03:49.370> watched

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
just say five or six series I watched

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.800 
just say five or six series I watched
when<00:03:49.850> it<00:03:49.970> comes<00:03:50.090> to<00:03:50.180> sports<00:03:50.389> I<00:03:50.480> think<00:03:50.510> that's

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
when it comes to sports I think that's

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.900 
when it comes to sports I think that's
everything<00:03:51.079> I<00:03:51.440> think<00:03:52.010> that<00:03:52.220> it<00:03:52.370> is<00:03:52.459> but

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
everything I think that it is but

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.670 
everything I think that it is but
regardless<00:03:53.269> of<00:03:53.450> that<00:03:53.510> C<00:03:53.840> I<00:03:53.870> haven't<00:03:54.500> watched

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
regardless of that C I haven't watched

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.199 
regardless of that C I haven't watched
much<00:03:54.950> sports<00:03:55.310> anime<00:03:55.670> at<00:03:55.850> all<00:03:56.090> so<00:03:57.160> yeah<00:03:58.160> it's<00:03:59.060> a

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
much sports anime at all so yeah it's a

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.000 
much sports anime at all so yeah it's a
kind<00:03:59.540> of<00:03:59.569> a<00:03:59.689> fresh<00:04:00.049> experience<00:04:00.799> for<00:04:00.950> me

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
kind of a fresh experience for me

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.280 
kind of a fresh experience for me
because<00:04:01.129> majority<00:04:01.730> of<00:04:01.879> the<00:04:02.000> sports<00:04:02.450> anime<00:04:02.959> I

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
because majority of the sports anime I

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.160 
because majority of the sports anime I
scene<00:04:03.680> has<00:04:04.310> been<00:04:04.340> very<00:04:04.840> realistic<00:04:05.840> I've<00:04:06.019> been

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
scene has been very realistic I've been

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.800 
scene has been very realistic I've been
told<00:04:06.469> that<00:04:06.680> chrono<00:04:07.549> basket<00:04:07.969> isn't<00:04:08.209> the<00:04:08.599> most

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
told that chrono basket isn't the most

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.589 
told that chrono basket isn't the most
realistic<00:04:09.799> sports<00:04:10.459> so<00:04:11.030> instead<00:04:11.359> we're<00:04:11.510> gonna

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
realistic sports so instead we're gonna

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.660 
realistic sports so instead we're gonna
be<00:04:11.719> a<00:04:11.840> different<00:04:12.469> take<00:04:12.829> to<00:04:13.129> the<00:04:13.280> sports<00:04:13.579> genre

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
be a different take to the sports genre

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.420 
be a different take to the sports genre
for<00:04:14.390> me<00:04:14.689> because<00:04:15.409> I<00:04:15.590> personally<00:04:15.950> watched<00:04:16.310> a

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430

for me because I personally watched a
lot<00:04:16.609> of<00:04:16.639> the<00:04:16.850> realistic<00:04:17.479> type<00:04:17.630> takes<00:04:17.930> on

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
lot of the realistic type takes on

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:19.960 
lot of the realistic type takes on
sports<00:04:18.620> anime<00:04:19.009> because<00:04:19.160> you<00:04:19.370> know<00:04:19.489> you<00:04:19.850> always

series or not like that that's something
I've<00:04:50.419> really<00:04:50.750> noticed<00:04:50.930> when<00:04:51.259> it<00:04:51.349> comes<00:04:51.530> to

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
I've really noticed when it comes to

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.189 
I've really noticed when it comes to
this<00:04:51.830> genre<00:04:52.130> of<00:04:52.310> anime<00:04:52.430> because<00:04:53.180> usually<00:04:53.870> when

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199 
this genre of anime because usually when

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:55.900 
this genre of anime because usually when
it<00:04:54.289> comes<00:04:54.470> to<00:04:54.620> the<00:04:54.710> plot<00:04:55.039> it's<00:04:55.639> just

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
it comes to the plot it's just

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.270 
it comes to the plot it's just
characters<00:04:56.509> wanting<00:04:57.110> to<00:04:57.320> get<00:04:57.740> to<00:04:57.860> the<00:04:57.949> end<00:04:58.099> I

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
characters wanting to get to the end I

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.490 
characters wanting to get to the end I
get<00:04:58.520> to<00:04:58.610> Nationals<00:04:58.849> and<00:04:59.330> win<00:04:59.810> that's<00:05:00.259> pretty

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
get to Nationals and win that's pretty

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.379 
get to Nationals and win that's pretty
much<00:05:00.710> what<00:05:01.009> the<00:05:01.160> main<00:05:01.340> goal<00:05:01.610> is<00:05:01.820> and<00:05:02.030> almost

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:02.389 
much what the main goal is and almost

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:05.170 
much what the main goal is and almost
every<00:05:02.720> single<00:05:02.930> sports<00:05:03.740> anime<00:05:04.160> I<00:05:04.190> have<00:05:04.639> seen

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
every single sports anime I have seen

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.510 
every single sports anime I have seen
busts<00:05:05.449> for<00:05:05.690> and<00:05:06.080> so<00:05:06.560> it's<00:05:06.770> not<00:05:06.919> really<00:05:07.250> much

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
busts for and so it's not really much

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.450 
busts for and so it's not really much
different<00:05:07.849> or<00:05:08.659> diverse<00:05:09.050> between<00:05:09.560> the<00:05:09.740> goals<00:05:10.099> I

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
different or diverse between the goals I

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.760 
different or diverse between the goals I
think<00:05:11.240> the<00:05:11.300> main<00:05:11.479> reason<00:05:11.510> what<00:05:11.960> really<00:05:12.229> spices

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
think the main reason what really spices

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.800 
think the main reason what really spices
these<00:05:12.919> type<00:05:13.130> of<00:05:13.159> anime<00:05:13.699> series<00:05:13.940> up<00:05:14.300> is<00:05:14.510> the

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
these type of anime series up is the

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.540 
these type of anime series up is the
character<00:05:15.349> so<00:05:15.500> I'm<00:05:15.650> really<00:05:15.860> hoping<00:05:16.280> that<00:05:16.340> the

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
character so I'm really hoping that the

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.420 
character so I'm really hoping that the
cast<00:05:16.760> of<00:05:16.909> characters<00:05:17.360> that<00:05:17.539> we<00:05:17.690> get<00:05:18.050> in

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
cast of characters that we get in

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.710 
cast of characters that we get in
croqueta<00:05:19.430> Basket<00:05:19.849> is<00:05:20.000> going<00:05:20.300> to<00:05:20.389> be<00:05:20.479> very

personalities two of them

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.779 
personalities two of them
characterization<00:05:24.979> I'm<00:05:25.250> just<00:05:25.550> looking

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:25.789 
characterization I'm just looking

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:26.680

forward<00:05:25.970> to<00:05:26.120> seeing<00:05:26.300> what<00:05:26.479> type<00:05:26.659> of

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
forward to seeing what type of

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.540 
forward to seeing what type of
characters<00:05:27.110> we<00:05:27.199> have<00:05:27.260> because<00:05:27.560> so<00:05:27.740> far<00:05:28.039> only

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
characters we have because so far only

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.399 
characters we have because so far only
two<00:05:28.909> characters<00:05:29.389> really<00:05:29.570> had<00:05:29.810> the<00:05:29.930> spotlight

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:30.409 
two characters really had the spotlight

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:32.620 
two characters really had the spotlight
and<00:05:30.740> kaga<00:05:31.340> me<00:05:31.550> and<00:05:31.760> chrono<00:05:32.000> Co<00:05:32.180> are<00:05:32.330> like<00:05:32.510> the

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
and kaga me and chrono Co are like the

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.390 
and kaga me and chrono Co are like the
only<00:05:32.930> characters<00:05:33.349> with<00:05:33.620> the<00:05:33.740> spotlight<00:05:34.010> in

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
only characters with the spotlight in

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.909 
only characters with the spotlight in
the<00:05:34.639> series<00:05:34.940> thus<00:05:35.210> far<00:05:35.240> in<00:05:35.659> episode<00:05:36.139> 2<00:05:36.320> and<00:05:36.740> I

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
the series thus far in episode 2 and I

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:38.170 
the series thus far in episode 2 and I
guess<00:05:37.070> you<00:05:37.190> could<00:05:37.280> say<00:05:37.340> Keisei<00:05:37.849> one<00:05:38.030> of<00:05:38.090> the

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
guess you could say Keisei one of the

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.790 
guess you could say Keisei one of the
generation<00:05:38.630> of<00:05:38.750> miracles<00:05:38.960> got<00:05:39.409> the<00:05:39.560> spotlight

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
generation of miracles got the spotlight

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.980 
generation of miracles got the spotlight
at<00:05:40.099> the<00:05:40.190> end<00:05:40.370> of<00:05:40.460> episode<00:05:40.580> 2<00:05:41.060> but<00:05:41.690> at<00:05:41.870> the

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
at the end of episode 2 but at the

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.870 
at the end of episode 2 but at the
moment<00:05:42.349> we<00:05:42.409> don't<00:05:42.530> really<00:05:42.830> know<00:05:42.949> much<00:05:43.370> of<00:05:43.430> his

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
moment we don't really know much of his

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.850 
moment we don't really know much of his
characterization<00:05:44.270> so<00:05:44.810> I<00:05:44.840> can't<00:05:45.110> really<00:05:45.260> go

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
characterization so I can't really go

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.920 
characterization so I can't really go
into<00:05:45.889> that<00:05:46.130> so<00:05:46.760> at<00:05:46.970> the<00:05:47.120> moment<00:05:47.330> only<00:05:47.750> two

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
into that so at the moment only two

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.839 
into that so at the moment only two
characters<00:05:48.590> are<00:05:48.800> really<00:05:49.159> shining<00:05:49.520> so

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:49.849 
characters are really shining so

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:51.820 
characters are really shining so
hopefully<00:05:50.240> the<00:05:50.419> other<00:05:50.570> teammates<00:05:51.349> get<00:05:51.710> their

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
hopefully the other teammates get their

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.010 
hopefully the other teammates get their
own<00:05:51.979> personal<00:05:52.520> characterization<00:05:53.360> along<00:05:53.900> with

long<00:06:37.490> time<00:06:37.880> ago<00:06:38.090> like<00:06:38.120> about<00:06:38.919> seven<00:06:39.919> months

ago<00:06:42.200> I<00:06:42.320> know<00:06:42.680> the<00:06:42.919> manga<00:06:43.430> ended<00:06:43.639> very<00:06:44.300> recent

season<00:06:47.660> three<00:06:47.840> is<00:06:47.900> going<00:06:48.080> to<00:06:48.169> be<00:06:48.229> wrapping<00:06:48.560> up

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:48.979

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:51.490 
season three is going to be wrapping up
the<00:06:49.220> entirety<00:06:49.580> of<00:06:49.790> chronal<00:06:50.630> basket<00:06:51.080> and<00:06:51.260> I

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:51.500 
the entirety of chronal basket and I

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.629 
the entirety of chronal basket and I
think<00:06:51.710> that's<00:06:51.830> why<00:06:51.950> the<00:06:52.010> majority<00:06:52.160> of<00:06:52.430> cheem

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 
think that's why the majority of cheem

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:53.980 
think that's why the majority of cheem
it's<00:06:52.790> her<00:06:52.880> wanting<00:06:53.150> me<00:06:53.270> to<00:06:53.300> actually<00:06:53.780> sit<00:06:53.960> down

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:53.990 
it's her wanting me to actually sit down

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.870 
it's her wanting me to actually sit down
