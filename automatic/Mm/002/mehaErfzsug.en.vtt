00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
we call it the eight it's a shape of an

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.180 
we call it the eight it's a shape of an
eight<00:00:48.839> lying<00:00:49.320> down<00:00:49.559> eight<00:00:51.199> okay<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.500> we're

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
eight lying down eight okay and we're

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.540 
eight lying down eight okay and we're
going<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.420> use<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:55.050> motion<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.710> going<00:00:56.039> up<00:00:56.250> and

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
going to use that motion of going up and

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.060 
going to use that motion of going up and
down<00:00:56.640> just<00:00:57.539> making<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.050> more<00:00:58.079> round<00:00:59.210> one<00:01:00.210> two

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
down just making it more round one two

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.500 
down just making it more round one two
three

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
three

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.190 
three
so<00:01:03.510> what<00:01:03.690> did<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:03.929> do<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.350> did<00:01:04.830> one<00:01:05.929> until<00:01:06.929> I

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
so what did I do I did one until I

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.090 
so what did I do I did one until I
brought<00:01:07.679> my<00:01:08.009> hip<00:01:08.310> my<00:01:09.119> right<00:01:09.450> hip<00:01:09.720> back<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.289> I

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
brought my hip my right hip back and I

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.120 
brought my hip my right hip back and I
didn't<00:01:12.090> going<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.570> move<00:01:12.720> exactly<00:01:13.289> as<00:01:13.679> the<00:01:13.890> legs

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
didn't going to move exactly as the legs

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.999 
didn't going to move exactly as the legs
meaning<00:01:14.940> if<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.450> step<00:01:15.840> with<00:01:15.990> my<00:01:16.140> right<00:01:16.170> foot<00:01:16.470> my
