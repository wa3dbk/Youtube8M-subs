show you guys a mod on the fengxi the

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.650 
show you guys a mod on the fengxi the
new<00:00:07.379> cube<00:00:07.649> that<00:00:07.770> came<00:00:07.919> out<00:00:08.269> this<00:00:09.269> cube<00:00:09.540> is

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
new cube that came out this cube is

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.570 
new cube that came out this cube is
actually<00:00:10.080> really<00:00:10.260> good<00:00:10.500> a<00:00:11.070> lot<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.519> people

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
actually really good a lot of people

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.830 
actually really good a lot of people
have<00:00:11.880> been<00:00:11.910> saying<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.450> lot<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.660> good<00:00:12.750> things

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
have been saying a lot of good things

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.060 
have been saying a lot of good things
about<00:00:13.049> it<00:00:13.139> but<00:00:13.230> there<00:00:13.469> are<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.620> few<00:00:13.769> slight

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
about it but there are a few slight

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.650 
about it but there are a few slight
problems<00:00:14.460> that<00:00:14.639> have<00:00:14.759> been<00:00:14.969> very<00:00:15.269> annoying<00:00:15.570> to

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
problems that have been very annoying to

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.560 
problems that have been very annoying to
ask<00:00:15.870> you<00:00:16.279> one<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.609> endless<00:00:17.880> locking<00:00:18.390> up

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
ask you one is the endless locking up

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.320 
ask you one is the endless locking up
when<00:00:18.930> smaller<00:00:19.380> wrist<00:00:19.680> corner<00:00:19.949> cuts<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.970> is

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
when smaller wrist corner cuts to is

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.179 
when smaller wrist corner cuts to is
when<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:22.350> corner<00:00:23.250> twist<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:24.890> corners<00:00:25.890> twist

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
when the corner twist the corners twist

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.189 
when the corner twist the corners twist
actually<00:00:26.670> what<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.269> found<00:00:27.449> out<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.900> corners

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
actually what I found out is the corners

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.290 
actually what I found out is the corners
do<00:00:28.320> not<00:00:28.439> twist<00:00:28.650> actually<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.429> easy<00:00:29.670> it's<00:00:30.000> due

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
do not twist actually that easy it's due

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.330 
do not twist actually that easy it's due
to<00:00:30.480> catching<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.349> doesn't<00:00:31.650> actually<00:00:31.830> actually

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
to catching it doesn't actually actually

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.490 
to catching it doesn't actually actually
takes<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.610> lot<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.880> force<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.329> actually<00:00:33.870> twist

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
takes a lot of force to actually twist

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.299 
takes a lot of force to actually twist
the<00:00:34.739> corner<00:00:35.100> just<00:00:35.820> like<00:00:36.030> on<00:00:36.210> other<00:00:36.420> cubes<00:00:36.780> like

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
the corner just like on other cubes like

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.490 
the corner just like on other cubes like
this<00:00:38.309> type<00:00:38.610> C<00:00:38.850> takes<00:00:39.600> actually<00:00:39.960> much<00:00:40.140> about

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
this type C takes actually much about

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.850 
this type C takes actually much about
the<00:00:41.070> same<00:00:41.250> effort<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:42.110> a<00:00:43.460> fan<00:00:44.460> con<00:00:45.800> but<00:00:46.800> I

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
the same effort and a fan con but I

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.279 
the same effort and a fan con but I
think<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.160> takes<00:00:47.280> more<00:00:47.399> for<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.879> dying<00:00:48.180> cube<00:00:48.870> in

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
think it takes more for a dying cube in

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.950 
think it takes more for a dying cube in
my<00:00:49.469> opinion<00:00:49.770> but<00:00:53.059> yeah<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.539> mod<00:00:54.719> it

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
my opinion but yeah this is the mod it

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.029 
my opinion but yeah this is the mod it
what<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.620> does<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.570> doesn't<00:00:57.570> prevent<00:00:58.039> it

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
what it does is it doesn't prevent it

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.340 
what it does is it doesn't prevent it
tries<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.489> prevent<00:00:59.940> corner<00:01:00.300> twists<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.809> it

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
tries to prevent corner twists and it

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.020 
tries to prevent corner twists and it
gets<00:01:01.530> rid<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.890> annoying<00:01:02.070> lock<00:01:02.579> up<00:01:02.820> that

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
gets rid of that annoying lock up that

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.770 
gets rid of that annoying lock up that
you<00:01:03.270> guys<00:01:03.420> have<00:01:03.750> or<00:01:04.290> should<00:01:04.320> get<00:01:05.010> rid<00:01:05.159> of

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
you guys have or should get rid of

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.789 
you guys have or should get rid of

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
your cube or in any other aspect of any

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.499 
your cube or in any other aspect of any
other<00:01:27.150> cube<00:01:27.479> or<00:01:27.659> anything<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.850> forget<00:01:30.390> I

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
other cube or anything so I forget I

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.359 
other cube or anything so I forget I
just<00:01:30.810> looked<00:01:30.960> at<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.170> cube<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:32.009> edges<00:01:32.280> in

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
just looked at the cube and the edges in

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.920 
just looked at the cube and the edges in
the<00:01:32.460> corner<00:01:32.700> oh<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:33.119> just<00:01:33.509> in<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.659> corners

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
the corner oh I just in the corners

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.749 
the corner oh I just in the corners
don't<00:01:34.110> need<00:01:34.229> any<00:01:34.380> modding<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:34.920> that's<00:01:35.579> pretty

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
don't need any modding so that's pretty

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.020 
don't need any modding so that's pretty
nice<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.119> my<00:01:36.150> opinion<00:01:37.549> so<00:01:38.549> these<00:01:38.670> don't<00:01:38.880> need

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
nice in my opinion so these don't need

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.999 
nice in my opinion so these don't need
modding<00:01:39.360> what<00:01:40.170> really<00:01:40.380> needs<00:01:40.409> modding<00:01:40.890> is

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
modding what really needs modding is

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.539 
modding what really needs modding is
actually<00:01:41.490> de<00:01:41.610> centerpiece<00:01:43.220> it's<00:01:44.220> actually

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
actually de centerpiece it's actually

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.660 
actually de centerpiece it's actually
quite<00:01:45.030> simple<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:46.070> I'm<00:01:47.070> going<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.310> keep<00:01:47.460> this

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
quite simple so I'm going to keep this

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.310 
quite simple so I'm going to keep this
edge<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:48.180> just<00:01:48.509> for<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.780> purpose<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.200> this

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
edge in just for the purpose of this

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.310 
edge in just for the purpose of this
video<00:01:49.500> or<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.700> show<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:50.970> why<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:51.840> makes

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
video or to show you why this makes

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.889 
video or to show you why this makes
sense<00:01:52.560> because<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.700> can<00:01:53.880> tell<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.180> how<00:01:54.420> its

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
sense because I can tell you how its

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.480 
sense because I can tell you how its
modded<00:01:55.320> but<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.710> won't<00:01:55.920> make<00:01:56.040> sense<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.430> you

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
modded but it won't make sense to you

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.719 
modded but it won't make sense to you
guys<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:57.829> if<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:58.920> look<00:01:59.070> at<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.310> edge<00:01:59.460> right

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
guys so if you look at the edge right

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.760 
guys so if you look at the edge right
here<00:01:59.790> you<00:02:00.750> can<00:02:00.869> see<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.380> edge<00:02:01.530> is

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
here you can see that the edge is

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.940 
here you can see that the edge is
actually<00:02:02.250> held<00:02:02.520> up<00:02:02.670> by<00:02:02.850> these<00:02:03.390> centers<00:02:04.380> well

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
actually held up by these centers well

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.600 
actually held up by these centers well
by<00:02:05.729> here<00:02:06.259> but<00:02:07.259> if<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.560> look<00:02:07.770> at<00:02:07.979> this

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
by here but if you look at this

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.790 
by here but if you look at this
but<00:02:10.180> if<00:02:10.240> you<00:02:10.330> look<00:02:10.509> at<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.750> top<00:02:10.930> center<00:02:11.170> it's

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
but if you look at the top center it's

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.130 
but if you look at the top center it's
really<00:02:12.310> not<00:02:12.460> serving<00:02:12.940> a<00:02:13.030> purpose<00:02:13.270> it's<00:02:13.810> just

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
really not serving a purpose it's just

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.770 
really not serving a purpose it's just
kind<00:02:14.350> of<00:02:14.470> kind<00:02:15.400> of<00:02:15.550> sitting<00:02:15.730> there<00:02:15.970> see<00:02:16.540> it's

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
kind of kind of sitting there see it's

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.330 
kind of kind of sitting there see it's
not<00:02:16.900> even<00:02:17.080> touching<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.560> edge<00:02:17.800> piece<00:02:18.070> I<00:02:18.220> can

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
not even touching the edge piece I can

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.970 
not even touching the edge piece I can
actually<00:02:18.460> have<00:02:18.690> some<00:02:19.690> space<00:02:20.080> in<00:02:20.110> between<00:02:20.380> it

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.910 

so<00:02:24.240> solution<00:02:25.240> is<00:02:25.390> because<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.470> problem<00:02:26.830> is

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
so solution is because the problem is

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.620 
so solution is because the problem is
that<00:02:29.640> let<00:02:30.640> me<00:02:30.730> get<00:02:30.910> another<00:02:31.060> two<00:02:31.360> edges

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
that let me get another two edges

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:39.900 
that let me get another two edges
beckons<00:02:37.410> dang<00:02:38.410> it<00:02:38.530> it's<00:02:38.890> fangshi<00:02:39.430> I<00:02:39.459> just<00:02:39.760> take

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
beckons dang it it's fangshi I just take

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.740 
beckons dang it it's fangshi I just take
forever<00:02:40.150> to<00:02:40.840> put<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:41.140> okay<00:02:42.270> so<00:02:43.270> when<00:02:43.450> it<00:02:43.570> goes

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
forever to put it okay so when it goes

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.080 
forever to put it okay so when it goes
for<00:02:43.990> reverse<00:02:44.260> corner<00:02:44.560> cut<00:02:44.880> since<00:02:45.880> I've

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
for reverse corner cut since I've

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.000 
for reverse corner cut since I've
already<00:02:46.240> modded<00:02:46.630> it<00:02:46.750> there's<00:02:47.020> usually<00:02:47.260> extra

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
already modded it there's usually extra

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.210 
already modded it there's usually extra
the<00:02:48.790> centerpiece<00:02:49.270> is<00:02:49.510> actually<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.170> lot<00:02:50.530> on<00:02:51.160> my

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
the centerpiece is actually a lot on my

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.979 
the centerpiece is actually a lot on my
seconds<00:02:52.739> focus<00:02:53.739> it's<00:02:53.980> actually<00:02:54.300> a<00:02:55.300> lot<00:02:55.690> it's

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
seconds focus it's actually a lot it's

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.990 
seconds focus it's actually a lot it's
actually<00:02:56.230> this<00:02:56.500> part<00:02:57.400> of<00:02:57.459> the<00:02:57.520> centerpiece<00:02:57.850> is

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
actually this part of the centerpiece is

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.180 
actually this part of the centerpiece is
actually<00:02:58.450> jet<00:02:58.720> out<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:58.900> little<00:02:59.110> bit<00:02:59.290> so<00:03:00.070> when

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
actually jet out a little bit so when

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.860 
actually jet out a little bit so when
you're<00:03:00.370> averse<00:03:00.610> corner<00:03:00.940> cut<00:03:01.120> it<00:03:01.330> will<00:03:01.510> catch

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
you're averse corner cut it will catch

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.350 
you're averse corner cut it will catch
on<00:03:01.900> actually<00:03:02.770> the<00:03:02.950> center<00:03:03.459> right<00:03:03.700> here<00:03:03.730> and

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
on actually the center right here and

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.740 
on actually the center right here and
then<00:03:05.170> ill<00:03:05.440> either<00:03:06.070> lock<00:03:06.640> up<00:03:06.880> or<00:03:07.060> corner<00:03:07.510> twists

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
then ill either lock up or corner twists

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.300 
then ill either lock up or corner twists
so<00:03:08.709> by<00:03:09.160> sanding<00:03:10.120> this<00:03:10.239> down<00:03:10.510> right<00:03:10.540> here<00:03:11.310> it

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
so by sanding this down right here it

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.350 
so by sanding this down right here it
will<00:03:13.030> eliminate<00:03:13.390> that<00:03:14.070> potentially<00:03:15.070> and<00:03:15.360> so

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
will eliminate that potentially and so

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.300 
will eliminate that potentially and so
far<00:03:16.630> it<00:03:16.720> has<00:03:16.870> for<00:03:17.140> me<00:03:17.260> I'm<00:03:18.010> going<00:03:18.130> to<00:03:18.220> an

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
far it has for me I'm going to an

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.960 
far it has for me I'm going to an
example<00:03:18.730> solve<00:03:18.880> after<00:03:19.269> this<00:03:19.420> but<00:03:20.580> it<00:03:21.580> seems<00:03:21.880> to

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
example solve after this but it seems to

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.340 
example solve after this but it seems to
be<00:03:22.060> working<00:03:22.269> for<00:03:22.600> me<00:03:22.780> and<00:03:24.540> so<00:03:25.540> basically<00:03:25.870> this

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
be working for me and so basically this

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.289 
be working for me and so basically this
right<00:03:26.860> here<00:03:27.070> so<00:03:27.250> it's<00:03:27.370> absolutely<00:03:27.880> no<00:03:28.030> purpose

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
right here so it's absolutely no purpose

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.490 
right here so it's absolutely no purpose
but<00:03:29.190> looking<00:03:30.190> good<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.900> place<00:03:32.140> where<00:03:32.380> you<00:03:32.440> can

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
but looking good the place where you can

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.170 
but looking good the place where you can
put<00:03:32.650> your<00:03:32.769> sticker<00:03:33.040> on<00:03:33.280> to<00:03:33.790> make<00:03:33.940> sure<00:03:34.060> it's

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
put your sticker on to make sure it's

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.479 
put your sticker on to make sure it's
flush<00:03:34.480> to<00:03:35.380> have<00:03:35.470> a<00:03:35.530> center<00:03:35.860> cap<00:03:36.040> on<00:03:36.250> I<00:03:36.280> don't

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
flush to have a center cap on I don't

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.100 
flush to have a center cap on I don't
know<00:03:36.549> et<00:03:36.730> cetera<00:03:36.880> that's<00:03:37.360> the<00:03:37.630> only<00:03:37.870> purpose

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
know et cetera that's the only purpose

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.440 
know et cetera that's the only purpose
of<00:03:38.440> this<00:03:38.680> it's<00:03:39.459> really<00:03:39.700> actually<00:03:39.820> just<00:03:40.150> a<00:03:40.239> cap

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
of this it's really actually just a cap

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.660 
of this it's really actually just a cap
it<00:03:40.720> what<00:03:41.320> matters<00:03:41.650> is<00:03:41.680> this<00:03:42.070> is<00:03:42.310> not<00:03:42.459> really

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
it what matters is this is not really

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.630 
it what matters is this is not really
this<00:03:42.970> so<00:03:43.930> this<00:03:44.380> really<00:03:44.860> doesn't<00:03:45.220> make<00:03:45.430> any

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
this so this really doesn't make any

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.720 
this so this really doesn't make any
sense<00:03:45.850> honestly<00:03:46.720> so<00:03:47.049> it<00:03:47.290> it<00:03:47.769> really<00:03:48.310> catches

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
sense honestly so it it really catches

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.910 
sense honestly so it it really catches
most<00:03:49.180> of<00:03:49.299> the<00:03:49.360> time<00:03:49.540> so<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:50.260> caching<00:03:50.620> is<00:03:50.739> in

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
most of the time so the caching is in

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.710 
most of the time so the caching is in
this<00:03:51.220> piece<00:03:51.459> not<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:51.760> actual<00:03:52.120> bottom<00:03:52.510> part

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
this piece not the actual bottom part

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.630 
this piece not the actual bottom part
everything<00:03:53.590> else<00:03:53.709> is<00:03:53.860> fine<00:03:54.040> everything<00:03:54.489> else

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
everything else is fine everything else

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.520 
everything else is fine everything else
is<00:03:54.820> properly<00:03:55.570> rounded<00:03:55.989> the<00:03:56.080> only<00:03:56.260> thing<00:03:56.440> I

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
is properly rounded the only thing I

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.800 
is properly rounded the only thing I
could<00:03:56.590> find<00:03:56.709> that<00:03:57.280> would<00:03:58.000> be<00:03:58.180> nitpicky<00:03:58.630> on

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
could find that would be nitpicky on

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.460 
could find that would be nitpicky on
probably<00:03:59.440> rounding<00:03:59.950> this<00:04:00.640> off<00:04:01.260> this<00:04:02.260> off

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
probably rounding this off this off

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.500 
probably rounding this off this off
right<00:04:02.620> here<00:04:05.100> yeah<00:04:06.100> that's<00:04:07.030> the<00:04:07.120> only<00:04:07.269> thing<00:04:07.360> to

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
right here yeah that's the only thing to

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.900 
right here yeah that's the only thing to
find<00:04:07.720> rounding<00:04:08.019> off<00:04:08.140> nothing<00:04:08.860> else<00:04:09.010> so<00:04:09.820> I'm

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
find rounding off nothing else so I'm

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.319 
find rounding off nothing else so I'm
going<00:04:09.940> to<00:04:10.090> an<00:04:10.239> example<00:04:10.660> solve<00:04:10.840> after<00:04:11.290> I<00:04:12.329> put

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
going to an example solve after I put

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:20.010 
going to an example solve after I put
this<00:04:13.450> back<00:04:13.690> together

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.870 

and<00:04:21.020> I'm<00:04:21.680> going<00:04:21.860> to<00:04:21.890> show<00:04:21.950> you<00:04:22.160> a<00:04:22.280> little<00:04:22.700> bit

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
and I'm going to show you a little bit

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:30.520 
and I'm going to show you a little bit
of<00:04:22.970> performance<00:04:23.560> by<00:04:24.560> solving<00:04:24.950> a<00:04:25.010> but<00:04:25.160> like<00:04:29.530> so

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
of performance by solving a but like so

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.400 
of performance by solving a but like so
how<00:04:31.280> people<00:04:31.550> get<00:04:31.640> corner<00:04:31.940> twists<00:04:32.300> when<00:04:33.290> you're

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
how people get corner twists when you're

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.950 
how people get corner twists when you're
doing<00:04:33.620> a<00:04:33.710> finger<00:04:34.010> trick<00:04:34.190> or<00:04:34.610> if<00:04:35.510> you<00:04:35.750> have<00:04:35.810> an

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
doing a finger trick or if you have an

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.700 
doing a finger trick or if you have an
extreme<00:04:36.400> corner<00:04:37.400> cut<00:04:37.580> for<00:04:38.470> reverse<00:04:39.470> corner

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
extreme corner cut for reverse corner

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.590 
extreme corner cut for reverse corner
cut<00:04:39.830> it's<00:04:39.980> a<00:04:40.040> small<00:04:40.280> corner<00:04:40.520> cut<00:04:40.730> and<00:04:40.910> then<00:04:41.480> you

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
cut it's a small corner cut and then you

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.470 
cut it's a small corner cut and then you
do<00:04:41.750> this<00:04:42.020> it'll<00:04:42.470> usually<00:04:43.030> do<00:04:44.030> a<00:04:44.060> quarter<00:04:44.360> to

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
do this it'll usually do a quarter to

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.510 
do this it'll usually do a quarter to
list<00:04:44.600> though<00:04:44.780> wait<00:04:45.560> a<00:04:45.590> good<00:04:45.860> way<00:04:45.950> to<00:04:45.980> reenact

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
list though wait a good way to reenact

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.460 
list though wait a good way to reenact
this<00:04:46.700> is<00:04:46.940> to<00:04:47.240> do<00:04:47.570> reverse<00:04:47.840> corner<00:04:48.110> cut<00:04:48.260> with<00:04:48.350> my

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
this is to do reverse corner cut with my

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.430 
this is to do reverse corner cut with my
finger<00:04:48.770> right<00:04:48.920> here<00:04:49.780> see<00:04:50.780> that's<00:04:50.960> how<00:04:51.080> a

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
finger right here see that's how a

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.910 
finger right here see that's how a
corner<00:04:51.920> twists<00:04:53.080> that's<00:04:54.080> what's<00:04:54.290> four<00:04:54.530> so<00:04:54.770> I

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
corner twists that's what's four so I

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.590 
corner twists that's what's four so I
have<00:04:54.950> to<00:04:55.280> force<00:04:55.580> out<00:04:55.820> the<00:04:55.940> corner<00:04:56.180> twists<00:04:56.420> so

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
have to force out the corner twists so

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.510 
have to force out the corner twists so
when<00:04:56.750> I<00:04:56.780> do<00:04:56.870> this<00:04:57.110> I<00:04:57.170> actually<00:04:57.980> to<00:04:58.280> push<00:04:58.490> down

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
when I do this I actually to push down

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.170 
when I do this I actually to push down
to<00:04:59.090> make<00:04:59.270> the<00:04:59.450> corner<00:05:00.440> twists<00:05:00.710> so<00:05:01.670> it's

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
to make the corner twists so it's

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.930 
to make the corner twists so it's
actually<00:05:02.390> i<00:05:02.690> think<00:05:02.750> the<00:05:03.110> mod<00:05:03.290> isn't<00:05:03.830> that

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
actually i think the mod isn't that

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.520 
actually i think the mod isn't that
effective<00:05:04.940> for<00:05:05.600> a<00:05:05.660> limiting<00:05:05.990> that<00:05:06.170> corner<00:05:06.410> to

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
effective for a limiting that corner to

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.550 
effective for a limiting that corner to
examine<00:05:07.190> had<00:05:07.340> I've<00:05:07.880> had<00:05:08.050> one<00:05:09.050> corner<00:05:09.350> twist

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
examine had I've had one corner twist

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.890 
examine had I've had one corner twist
out<00:05:09.800> of<00:05:09.980> average<00:05:10.610> of<00:05:10.730> one<00:05:10.820> hundred<00:05:10.940> and<00:05:11.240> that

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
out of average of one hundred and that

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.200 
out of average of one hundred and that
was<00:05:12.080> during<00:05:12.590> a<00:05:12.740> scramble<00:05:13.190> so<00:05:13.820> it<00:05:13.910> wasn't<00:05:14.090> that

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
was during a scramble so it wasn't that

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.530 
was during a scramble so it wasn't that
big<00:05:14.360> of<00:05:14.450> a<00:05:14.540> deal<00:05:15.460> so<00:05:16.460> I<00:05:16.700> actually<00:05:16.850> had<00:05:17.060> to<00:05:17.180> force

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
big of a deal so I actually had to force

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.040 
big of a deal so I actually had to force
the<00:05:17.720> corner<00:05:17.990> piece<00:05:18.170> down<00:05:18.320> like<00:05:18.560> that<00:05:20.020> so<00:05:21.020> I

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
the corner piece down like that so I

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.530 
the corner piece down like that so I
just<00:05:21.320> do<00:05:21.470> regularly<00:05:22.250> it<00:05:22.970> doesn't<00:05:23.300> corners

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 
just do regularly it doesn't corners

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.060 
just do regularly it doesn't corners
with<00:05:24.730> the<00:05:25.730> lockups<00:05:26.650> don't<00:05:27.650> really<00:05:27.890> exist

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070

anymore<00:05:30.490> let<00:05:31.490> me<00:05:31.610> just<00:05:31.820> do<00:05:31.970> a<00:05:32.000> quick<00:05:32.420> solve

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
anymore let me just do a quick solve

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:47.310 
anymore let me just do a quick solve
that<00:05:34.570> see<00:05:35.570> i<00:05:35.600> can<00:05:35.720> assume<00:05:36.020> that<00:05:36.110> a<00:05:36.260> little<00:05:36.470> more

two anyways at some point just to show
off<00:06:21.800> the<00:06:22.070> tube<00:06:25.150> so<00:06:26.150> that's<00:06:26.360> really<00:06:26.480> it<00:06:26.630> for<00:06:26.990> the

off the tube so that's really it for the

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.630 
fang shi maat it's quite effective into

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.520 
fang shi maat it's quite effective into
a<00:06:29.660> few<00:06:29.870> more<00:06:30.020> turns<00:06:31.840> I'm<00:06:32.840> going<00:06:32.990> to<00:06:33.110> take<00:06:33.410> the

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530 
a few more turns I'm going to take the

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.140 
a few more turns I'm going to take the
results<00:06:33.860> right<00:06:33.950> now<00:06:34.160> as<00:06:34.370> of<00:06:34.850> what<00:06:35.000> I've

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150 
results right now as of what I've

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.540 
results right now as of what I've
discovered<00:06:35.510> that's<00:06:35.930> different<00:06:36.380> it<00:06:37.160> changed

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:37.550 
discovered that's different it changed

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.780 
discovered that's different it changed
to<00:06:37.670> feel<00:06:38.000> just<00:06:38.300> a<00:06:38.450> tiny<00:06:38.840> bit<00:06:39.050> enliven<00:06:39.800> it's<00:06:40.580> a

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:40.790 
to feel just a tiny bit enliven it's a

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:46.240 
to feel just a tiny bit enliven it's a
bit<00:06:40.970> more<00:06:41.770> crispy<00:06:42.770> which<00:06:43.730> I<00:06:43.910> like<00:06:44.980> it<00:06:45.980> makes

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:46.250 
bit more crispy which I like it makes

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.090 
bit more crispy which I like it makes
the<00:06:46.430> cube<00:06:46.730> feel<00:06:47.090> like<00:06:47.780> a<00:06:48.260> speak<00:06:48.710> you<00:06:48.860> I<00:06:48.890> don't

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:49.100 
the cube feel like a speak you I don't

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.910 
the cube feel like a speak you I don't
know<00:06:49.160> it<00:06:49.340> doesn't<00:06:49.610> lock<00:06:49.730> up<00:06:49.970> anymore<00:06:50.920> so

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:51.920 
know it doesn't lock up anymore so

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.480 
know it doesn't lock up anymore so
that's<00:06:52.640> the<00:06:52.880> good<00:06:52.910> thing<00:06:53.890> of<00:06:54.890> course<00:06:55.160> that<00:06:55.370> it

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.490 
that's the good thing of course that it

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.250 
that's the good thing of course that it
locks<00:06:55.640> up<00:06:55.850> if<00:06:56.000> I<00:06:56.090> do<00:06:56.150> an<00:06:56.390> extreme<00:06:56.780> corner<00:06:57.110> cut

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:57.260 
locks up if I do an extreme corner cut

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.160 
or a nail file nail file it probably be
more<00:07:44.190> accurate<00:07:44.370> but<00:07:44.730> I<00:07:44.760> used<00:07:45.030> to<00:07:45.120> dremel<00:07:45.450> so

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:46.170
