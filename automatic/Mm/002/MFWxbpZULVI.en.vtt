00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.010
 it all looks like a very clear thing from the statistics 

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.710
 speaks for the zebras of the NSV at home still undefeated Münster against it 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.480
 the second-worst away all-second team only freshman 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.680
 Schweinfurt surpasses the Prussians in this nut ranking 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.159
 Duisburg is now sure what is 

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:24.379
 the promotion aspirant from the Rader Auto announced tonight against Münster 

00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:26.780
 nearly 10 000 spectators most 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:32.700
 Offensive in this series with the last game does us to risk 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.280
 the Rosenheimer 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.280
 Lothar archs 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.520
 and if the win minute the first chance 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.230
 Macy's parents 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.230
 Stand for 120 seconds 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.020
 Emergency brake today especially motivated against its owners 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.120
 recommendable 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.400
 but watch out 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.770
 Own goal of the month I would like to say of virtual one 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.970
 12 minutes 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.430
 left the MSV with 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.430
 SZ 0 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.070
 classical 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.070
 Münster too passive Jochen Terhaar and Thomas Nord II because of a yellow card suspension 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.740
 Only promising chance the flank of Edelmann 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.460
 Reason for expulsion 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.370
 Patrick Norddorf rolls off wet songs 31 minutes 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.750
 we wanted the Dutch both over long stretches of the first half 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.750
 do it again 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.920
 s &amp; p wants through the 4 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.420
 Nevertheless, the company sees itself again 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.200
 in a classroom 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.990
 the subsequent free kick 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.479
 Robert Zepp named Michel Périn who otherwise slowed it down a lot 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.489
 to 1 0 for the MSV Duisburg 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:20.419
 39 s minute and fishing this gate, of course, many parents of her death 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:22.239
 is 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.239
 for Sunday 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:34.340
 The zebras now in a frenzy the Prussians had hardly anything to order in this 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.549
 phase 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.829
 the leather for the 1st 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.829
 are recommended alone in front of the Bahamas 

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:46.539
 he parries 6 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.459
 the subsequent corner kicked by pro track 

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:03.539
 and ambushed pretty weird 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.969
 then worthy of Bruns says the mood in the Veda stadium she was 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:19.239
 The second 45 minutes it was over but then "need 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.009
 Bourgeois wanted to dictate that happen 

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:24.699
 however, prophesied beforehand 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:28.149
 In addition, he had Olic he with an adductor injury 

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:30.319
 whether staying in the cabin came for him 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.319
 the winning picture 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:36.169
 the flank of Lino and abundance 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:39.169
 the trip 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:46.039
 in return the tires 

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:47.789
 Rainer Edelmann 

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:50.789
 on live-pr the possibility to hit the line 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:55.669
 at the place 

00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:01.509
 a short time later 

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:04.980
 another ball from Tucson else hacker-pschorr 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.249
 already before the holidays Schmelzer and he brings in the 70th minute 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.019
 the deciding one 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.719
 equal to zero 

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:15.719
 Dennis is dead 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.349
 Fairness Norwegians 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:26.349
 many of these opportunities to this stage 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.069
 for example the St 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:32.069
 a free kick from 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.999
 World class the leather 

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:37.309
 by header from Stuckmann 

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:38.460
 and for everyone 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.460
 in the spotlight of the action 

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:45.889
 again Denis tree 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.889
 Substitute Steve Hooker empty 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.669
 According to the one-man show that would be a Schmöker Chancellor 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.219
 1 0% and 1 5% 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:03.020
 the ZIS minute the final decision the 14 o'clock 

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:14.249
 Münster on the ground of the MSV had an easy game Prussia invited for goal shooting 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:17.089
 one and the NSV 

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:18.639
 at the Fontana 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.719
 lousy parents of their order 

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:24.589
 his eleventh goal of the season succeeds the 5 2 0 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.990
 30 years old he is not rare her son now experienced something like 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.990
 his second spring 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.120
 it remained in Dielsdorf 15 03 11 1 2 goal drew 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.870
 but so is the MSV shopping tips and Münster 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.830
 a relegation candidate 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.449
 These worries are allowed
