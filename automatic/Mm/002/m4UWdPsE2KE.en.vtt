basically went you know zero carbs
straight<00:00:40.840> away<00:00:41.050> because<00:00:41.290> I<00:00:41.470> didn't<00:00:41.680> know<00:00:41.739> what

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:47.370 
no carbs before I have limited the carbs
like<00:01:43.570> our<00:01:43.840> function<00:01:44.439> I<00:01:44.850> think<00:01:45.850> some

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
like our function I think some

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.500 
like our function I think some
I<00:01:48.380> just<00:01:49.330> haven't<00:01:50.330> evolved<00:01:50.990> and<00:01:51.740> still

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
I just haven't evolved and still

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.120 
I just haven't evolved and still
basically<00:01:53.510> should<00:01:54.440> be<00:01:54.560> living<00:01:54.740> like<00:01:54.950> the

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
basically should be living like the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.730 
basically should be living like the
caveman<00:01:55.580> days<00:01:55.880> so<00:01:56.630> needing<00:01:56.990> you<00:01:57.410> know<00:01:57.530> your

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
caveman days so needing you know your

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.530 
caveman days so needing you know your
ferns<00:01:58.130> vegetables

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
ferns vegetables

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.600 
ferns vegetables
which<00:02:00.050> are<00:02:00.230> cops<00:02:00.440> by<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:00.830> way<00:02:01.040> but<00:02:01.340> they're

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
which are cops by the way but they're

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.010 
which are cops by the way but they're
the<00:02:02.350> car

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
the car

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.340 
the car
the<00:02:04.289> earth<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:05.479> leading<00:02:06.479> proteins<00:02:07.020> and

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
the earth and leading proteins and

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.969 
the earth and leading proteins and
things<00:02:07.530> like<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.340> hopefully<00:02:09.769> almost<00:02:10.769> a

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
things like that so hopefully almost a

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.410 
things like that so hopefully almost a
feeling<00:02:11.340> we'll<00:02:11.489> be<00:02:11.519> better<00:02:11.849> all<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.090> really

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
feeling we'll be better all and really

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.479 
feeling we'll be better all and really
start<00:02:13.080> feeling<00:02:13.319> better<00:02:13.650> within<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.459> first

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
start feeling better within the first

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.980 
start feeling better within the first
day<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.450> am

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
day I I am

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.920 
day I I am
I<00:02:17.080> started<00:02:17.980> doing<00:02:18.160> it<00:02:18.490> my<00:02:18.670> workout<00:02:19.150> before<00:02:19.570> my

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
I started doing it my workout before my

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.789 
I started doing it my workout before my
alarm<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:21.010> really<00:02:21.460> good

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.650 

starting<00:02:24.799> to<00:02:24.950> get<00:02:25.069> rid<00:02:25.280> of<00:02:25.310> a<00:02:25.610> little<00:02:25.849> bit

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.300 

that's<00:02:29.140> my<00:02:29.380> thought<00:02:29.620> for<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.950> day

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.510 

comes<00:02:32.700> back

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520
