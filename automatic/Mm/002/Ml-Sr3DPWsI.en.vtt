00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.490
 cb 2014 at the sapphire stand 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.630
 and there is a whole here 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.410
 special interesting he 92 100 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.150
 Although the toxic in the preview version 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.890
 As you can see, there are the tricks 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.080
 from cooler in a revised 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:27.189
 version and two and a half slot for 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:29.320
 In 1990, he made a special feature of the job 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:32.230
 is added the very fine features 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.329
 which allowed the card in the 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.980
 idle condition only by a fan 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.310
 Chilled is how well see here now 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.989
 the map is in the desktop 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.489
 Mode that means there is no load 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.640
 and the card is only by one 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.300
 Cooler supplied with fresh air 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.040
 is signaled that also by the 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.300
 blue lettering that is 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.740
 cooling by a fan is on 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:57.940
 the job sufficiently on the back 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.350
 is there and right here at the back 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.030
 There is one back of the board 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.050
 small switch with which he has the feature 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.490
 on or 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.470
 could turn off that is 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.000
 By default, the card runs with one 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.720
 Fan in idle mode if needed 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.189
 should be 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.170
 then it could be the three fans 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:12.759
 turn on to the specifications there 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.270
 It does not quite say so much 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.530
 is probably the fastest he 9 290 iks im 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.299
 custom design 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.520
 the card has eight gigabytes 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.299
 memory that is twice as many as 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.009
 normal 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:27.009
 speak the normal cards have in the 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.509
 reference design or 4gb like that 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.490
 clock rates at the memory will fail 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.619
 still show little feature on the 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.560
 backside you see the toxic here 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.030
 lettering and the individual phases 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.619
 the power supply depending on 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.740
 utilization or responsiveness 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.969
 the leds shine like that or to 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.289
 I said cool if the card 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:47.200
 is sufficiently cooled then running 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:50.139
 only one fan I start now once 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.960
 on the test system next to me the june 

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:56.540
 go 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:58.130
 benchmark so that is currently the 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.900
 card has warmed up or 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.770
 the temperature is reached that the 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.770
 start fan 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.230
 So now you have seen the airs 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.540
 starting at a temperature of 60 degrees 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:15.060
 be in addition to other two 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.830
 fan added and the sapphire 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.660
 Lettering up here is no longer lit. 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.590
 blue but yellowish or slightly green 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.810
 the temperature is too high 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.520
 that is about 70 degrees running the stop 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.140
 to bread that should be automatic 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.000
 however fan control never 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.430
 because of the cooler over sufficient 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.870
 reserves over the as I said about 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.540
 the individual or the final taktraten 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.100
 you can not say anything exactly 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.390
 The same applies to the price of the card 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.700
 will of course be due to the double 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.620
 graphics memory your certain extra charge 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.950
 compared to other cards have the 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.000
 Availability is for middle or to end 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.000
 announced april
