00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.090 
it's going to go 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8<00:02:03.360> 1<00:02:03.689> 2<00:02:03.719> 3<00:02:03.899> 4<00:02:04.290> 5<00:02:04.500> 6<00:02:04.680> 7<00:02:04.799> 8<00:02:05.009> 1<00:02:05.310> 2<00:02:05.340> 3<00:02:05.549> 4<00:02:05.939> 5<00:02:06.119> 6<00:02:06.329> &amp;<00:02:06.570> 8

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 &amp; 8

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:24.400 
8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 &amp; 8
so<00:02:07.850> it's<00:02:08.000> going<00:02:08.119> to<00:02:08.179> go<00:02:08.270> like<00:02:08.390> this<00:02:23.260> now<00:02:24.260> your

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
so it's going to go like this now your

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.710 
so it's going to go like this now your
base<00:02:24.650> it's<00:02:25.550> going<00:02:25.730> to<00:02:25.910> have<00:02:26.030> a<00:02:26.120> first<00:02:26.420> segment

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
base it's going to have a first segment

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.470 
base it's going to have a first segment
like<00:02:27.080> like<00:02:27.830> the<00:02:28.100> hands<00:02:28.340> do<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.880> then<00:02:29.360> the

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
like like the hands do and then the

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.760 
like like the hands do and then the
first<00:02:29.690> time<00:02:29.870> you<00:02:29.989> hit<00:02:30.140> your<00:02:30.260> base<00:02:30.470> when<00:02:30.709> you

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
first time you hit your base when you

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.229 
first time you hit your base when you
first<00:02:30.980> start<00:02:31.220> this<00:02:31.370> beat<00:02:31.610> your<00:02:31.819> base<00:02:31.970> is<00:02:32.150> going

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
first start this beat your base is going

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.020 
first start this beat your base is going
to<00:02:32.330> hit<00:02:32.450> on<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.660> number<00:02:32.930> one<00:02:33.850> every<00:02:34.850> time

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
to hit on the number one every time

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.520 
to hit on the number one every time
after<00:02:35.300> that<00:02:35.630> it's<00:02:35.870> going<00:02:36.080> to<00:02:36.140> hit<00:02:36.230> on<00:02:36.380> the

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
after that it's going to hit on the

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:45.880 
after that it's going to hit on the
number<00:02:43.030> four<00:02:44.030> so<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.080> first<00:02:45.290> part<00:02:45.620> of<00:02:45.769> your

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
number four so the first part of your

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.080 
number four so the first part of your
beat<00:02:46.130> it's<00:02:46.340> going<00:02:46.550> to<00:02:46.580> get<00:02:46.670> them<00:02:46.790> number<00:02:47.060> one

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
beat it's going to get them number one

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.120 
beat it's going to get them number one
then<00:02:47.810> after<00:02:48.080> that<00:02:48.200> is<00:02:48.410> always<00:02:48.800> going<00:02:48.950> to<00:02:49.040> in

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
then after that is always going to in

00:02:49.130 --> 00:03:03.280 
then after that is always going to in
our<00:02:49.220> new<00:02:49.340> more<00:02:49.550> for<00:03:01.480> now<00:03:02.480> first<00:03:02.840> it<00:03:02.989> might<00:03:03.080> seem

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
our new more for now first it might seem

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.710 
our new more for now first it might seem
a<00:03:03.319> little<00:03:03.530> bit<00:03:03.650> complicated<00:03:04.100> but<00:03:05.000> everything

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
a little bit complicated but everything

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.150 
a little bit complicated but everything
you<00:03:06.080> know<00:03:06.260> when<00:03:06.470> we're<00:03:06.680> starting<00:03:07.040> out

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
you know when we're starting out

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.800 
you know when we're starting out
anything<00:03:07.610> new<00:03:07.640> seems<00:03:08.060> complicated<00:03:08.330> at<00:03:08.780> first

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
anything new seems complicated at first

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.360 
anything new seems complicated at first

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
numbers down again and try it again so

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:58.420 
numbers down again and try it again so
here's<00:03:35.390> what<00:03:35.570> its<00:03:35.690> gonna<00:03:35.780> sound<00:03:36.049> like

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.370 

that's<00:03:59.430> it<00:03:59.640> fast<00:03:59.910> and<00:04:00.210> so<00:04:00.720> for<00:04:00.930> a<00:04:00.960> villain<00:04:01.200> like

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380
