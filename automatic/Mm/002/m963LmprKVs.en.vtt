00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:07.220
 this dry river in a warm desert the 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.790
 north of sonora once had waters 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.290
 crystalline and full of life 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.050
 incredibly in this sonoyta river 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:18.250
 two species survive hidden 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:21.040
 endemic fish 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.470
 it might seem ridiculous to go looking 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.860
 native fish in this altar desert 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.680
 in sound and maybe even more foolish the 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.450
 foolishly look for them in a river where the 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.330
 water does not run anywhere 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.129
 this is the river sonoyta to see it our 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.010
 Hope to find your native fish 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:41.350
 it vanished immediately but the 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.900
 nature always surprises us with its 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.420
 Resilience or resilience 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.090
 in some stagnant puddles we could 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.760
 find clinging to existence a 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.620
 group of fish unfortunately not all 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.230
 the fish in the pond are the fish 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.750
 original of this river since 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.360
 some years invading fish released 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.770
 for the human have settled here and 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.350
 they compete with the native fish 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.479
 originals leaving them to extinction 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.520
 staff of the national commission of 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.680
 protected natural areas study 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.440
 methodically the remaining populations 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.140
 of the fish fit the desert if pine where 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.659
 we want and a native charal of this river 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.960
 in lakes and christ caster 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.539
 for this they use trap cages once 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.819
 the fish inside the quotas and 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:30.490
 native charales and are returned to their 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:32.979
 original habitat on the other hand it 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.420
 they extract the harmful exotic fish that 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.789
 the man introduced so 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.219
 irresponsible among various fish 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:41.890
 invaders we discover with joy that the 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:44.109
 sonoyta river is still habitat for quotas 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.179
 of the desert and the charales of son today 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:48.579
 it is in a place of medium waters 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:51.099
 stagnant we look for the cipri no where 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:53.979
 we will make a space inside the puddle 

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:55.929
 It seems to be their favorite and found 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.119
 several blue males 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:00.549
 these images may not be those of 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.009
 crystal clear waters of an aquarium but they are 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.959
 the octopuses in their natural environment their 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.929
 ability to survive in waters 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:11.230
 muddy hot and with little oxygen is 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:13.359
 amazing the fish with hatches are 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.459
 sonoyta charales although in 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:17.950
 North America there are many bodies of 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.140
 water and big rivers like the colorado and 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.840
 the brave river in this small river of 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.020
 sonoyta that meanders between the us and 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.630
 mexico is a drier desert river 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.430
 frequency does not have water this is the 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.130
 home of the river desert octopus 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.830
 sonoyta and his partner the lake be 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.080
 chris or caster here we have two species 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.050
 representative of native fish that is 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.840
 the octopus of the desert and the 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.720
 long fin the problem of these 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.420
 native fish are two factors one the 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.220
 exploitation of aquifers and the 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.980
 competition with other fish species 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.080
 as a conservation strategy have been 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.550
 created four artificial shelters for 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.210
 the conservation of these native fish 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.010
 which consists of a small small pit 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.430
 of water or a body of controlled water 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.230
 by filters and pumps not only in the 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.720
 invasive species like the mosquito fish 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.690
 and an exotic dance threaten the fish 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.970
 endemic to the sonoyta river this 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.280
 more water in the past but extraction 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.160
 excessive water from wells adjacent to 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.740
 river also lowered the water level of the 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.500
 river are also oit a nearby drainage 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.690
 to the population of the same name pours 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.540
 your untreated waste in the few 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.710
 waters of this thirsty river and while 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.720
 we see if it is allowed 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.970
 have more water and the river is cleaner 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.370
 oit to the address of the reservation of the 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.040
 Pinacate biosphere and great desert of 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.440
 altar manages four shelters for 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.620
 safeguard the two species of fish 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.350
 endemic to this poor river here at 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.940
 less could they expect better times if 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.640
 is that the weights of the 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.770
 sonoyta in his own habitat hopefully 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.020
 the day arrives and soon when the river is 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.720
 today it is restored take water as in 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.540
 the past and its native fish can 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.060
 travel the length and breadth of one of 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.160
 the most interesting desert rivers of 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.980
 North America 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.560
 I hope that soon the river sonoyta 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.720
 it can be environmentally rescued the 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.660
 nature would return water in abundance 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.060
 and the native fish would be an indicator 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:25.260
 of the health of systemic and human ccoo 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.260
 Here I leave task
