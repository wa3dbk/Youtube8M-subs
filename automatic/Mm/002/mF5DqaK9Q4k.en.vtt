00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.230
 hello I am even benavidence and this is a 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.570
 advice over practical natural cooking 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.790
 this time we are going to make a snack 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.059
 is a snack can also be a 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.150
 entrance an accompaniment to me 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.890
 love to vote it is very simple and 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.510
 original proposal that you have only been 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.859
 You have eaten or what you've seen so see a 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.199
 restaurant in someone's house or 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.449
 then you can surprise your visitors 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:29.000
 even your family not on a Tuesday in 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:32.239
 on a Monday or at a larger meal with 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.309
 with more members on Sunday the case is 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.819
 which is very simple and everyone is going to 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:40.940
 Like is the fried parsley with cheese 

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:44.899
 panela is very easy what you need is 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.209
 a bunch of parsley and 200 or 300 grams 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.620
 of panela cheese this amount obviously 

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:50.929
 it will vary depending on the number of 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.510
 people this is like for two or three 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:55.670
 people what we are going to do is going to be 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.909
 first obviously wash our pÃ©rez and 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.499
 perfectly disinfect and remove 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:02.499
 the greatest number of twigs 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.930
 carlos not very if it can not be the leaves 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.500
 quite whole 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.790
 and canada 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.520
 and let's fry well the easy we put in 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.229
 the pan a little oil and what 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.660
 Warm up as it's fine 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.180
 hot let's add the parsley have 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.010
 careful because the parsley has a lot 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.350
 water then you can can jump and 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.210
 jump but well nothing happens to the 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.940
 time to put it later when when 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.910
 start to dehydrate as you can 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.979
 handle it easier and the point is that 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.740
 the parsley has to be crispy 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.410
 this you will feel it with the little stick 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.990
 to go dehydrating and is going to be doing 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.960
 increasingly crunchy and when 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.320
 totally full with consistency 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.229
 how much harder it is when it's already gone 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.580
 to put salt in the process a little bit of 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.070
 Salt 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.140
 since we finished with the parsley we are going to 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.700
 pass with the cheese that we're just going to 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.010
 fry but this will be with very little 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.960
 of oil, I recommend that you take the 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.350
 napkin put a little bit of 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.360
 oil and seize it in the pan or the 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.320
 comal or where are you going to do what are we going 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.330
 to do 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.700
 cut it into bits can be but their 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.710
 big enough to make portions 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.570
 individual depending on the size of 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.760
 your cheese as it is there are some rounds 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.310
 a few squares until you estimate how 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.490
 doraditos as a color in cafecito 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.550
 some cheese points are ready and 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.230
 well let's serve it on a plate 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.700
 I say it can be as input when it is 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.170
 entry and now I'm going to serve you as 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.270
 an entry but it can be a 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.110
 accompaniment 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.650
 you put it on the plate like a bed 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.650
 coriander 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.159
 and there are going to be people who are going to eat the 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.569
 cheese and will not eat the parsley les 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:58.830
 You say I know how the parsley is what 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:01.290
 richest is the most original is the joke 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:06.590
 of this profession the parsley is the 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.590
 star we put the bed 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:14.670
 of the wonderful herb called parsley 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:17.060
 and let's put the bits of 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.060
 cheese 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.750
 and you will be extraordinarily well 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.030
 and you will like schoijett very much 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.239
 benavidence and remember that we are what 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.239
 we eat
