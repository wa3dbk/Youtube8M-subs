00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
hey guys is chain man 11 um I was it

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.220 
hey guys is chain man 11 um I was it
barnes<00:00:08.670> noble<00:00:09.120> recently<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:09.930> i<00:00:10.490> picked<00:00:11.490> up<00:00:11.730> a

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
barnes noble recently and i picked up a

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.740 
barnes noble recently and i picked up a
new<00:00:13.230> Rubik's<00:00:13.709> item<00:00:14.539> the<00:00:15.539> Rubik's<00:00:15.900> icon<00:00:16.470> um

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
new Rubik's item the Rubik's icon um

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.790 
new Rubik's item the Rubik's icon um
does<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.900> mean<00:00:19.050> I'm<00:00:19.199> boxing<00:00:19.680> video<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:21.800> i

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
does it mean I'm boxing video and i

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.489 
does it mean I'm boxing video and i
don't<00:00:23.640> know<00:00:23.669> if<00:00:23.730> i'll<00:00:23.970> build<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.419> I'm<00:00:25.140> just<00:00:25.380> an

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:25.499 
don't know if i'll build it I'm just an

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:37.000 
don't know if i'll build it I'm just an
dude<00:00:26.240> I'll<00:00:27.240> do<00:00:27.509> a<00:00:27.539> small<00:00:27.810> review

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:58.200 

okay<00:00:51.670> this<00:00:52.670> weird<00:00:53.089> thing<00:00:56.440> another<00:00:57.440> support

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
okay this weird thing another support

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:06.670 
okay this weird thing another support
and<00:00:59.379> you<00:01:00.379> have<00:01:02.170> Rubik's<00:01:03.170> icon<00:01:05.020> comes<00:01:06.020> a<00:01:06.350> little

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
and you have Rubik's icon comes a little

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.830 
and you have Rubik's icon comes a little
plastic<00:01:06.979> thing<00:01:07.960> then<00:01:08.960> you<00:01:09.050> have<00:01:09.170> the<00:01:09.259> stand<00:01:09.619> I

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
plastic thing then you have the stand I

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.300 
plastic thing then you have the stand I
think<00:01:11.840> that's<00:01:12.020> it<00:01:12.170> inside<00:01:12.500> this<00:01:12.619> box<00:01:12.890> the<00:01:13.159> box

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
think that's it inside this box the box

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.300 
think that's it inside this box the box
is<00:01:13.550> weirdly<00:01:13.880> shaped<00:01:14.000> I<00:01:14.890> don't<00:01:15.890> know<00:01:16.159> if

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
is weirdly shaped I don't know if

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.930 
is weirdly shaped I don't know if
there's<00:01:16.520> anything<00:01:16.610> else<00:01:17.979> yeah<00:01:18.979> I<00:01:19.250> mean<00:01:19.429> it

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
there's anything else yeah I mean it

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.460 
there's anything else yeah I mean it
doesn't<00:01:20.270> even<00:01:20.330> come<00:01:20.600> with<00:01:20.720> an<00:01:20.869> instruction

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
doesn't even come with an instruction

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.820 
doesn't even come with an instruction
guide<00:01:21.759> just<00:01:22.759> just<00:01:23.090> these<00:01:23.390> two<00:01:23.659> things<00:01:23.929> it's

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
guide just just these two things it's

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.160 
guide just just these two things it's
all<00:01:24.979> comes<00:01:25.250> with<00:01:25.490> um<00:01:27.850> so<00:01:28.850> if<00:01:29.000> you<00:01:29.030> so<00:01:29.929> if<00:01:30.020> you're

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
all comes with um so if you so if you're

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.690 
all comes with um so if you so if you're
going<00:01:30.380> to<00:01:30.440> get<00:01:30.619> this<00:01:30.830> make<00:01:31.069> sure<00:01:31.100> you<00:01:31.429> know<00:01:31.580> it

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
going to get this make sure you know it

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.340 
going to get this make sure you know it
already<00:01:31.880> so<00:01:32.270> long<00:01:32.479> as<00:01:32.630> it<00:01:32.750> doesn't<00:01:32.899> come<00:01:33.319> with

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
already so long as it doesn't come with

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.480 
already so long as it doesn't come with
an<00:01:33.560> instruction<00:01:34.100> guide<00:01:35.470> I'm<00:01:36.470> just<00:01:36.950> by<00:01:37.130> doing<00:01:37.190> a

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
an instruction guide I'm just by doing a

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.969 
an instruction guide I'm just by doing a
couple<00:01:38.289> a<00:01:39.289> couple<00:01:40.420> moves<00:01:41.420> I<00:01:41.840> could<00:01:42.770> feel<00:01:42.920> it

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
couple a couple moves I could feel it

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.460 
couple a couple moves I could feel it
already<00:01:43.250> is<00:01:43.640> smooth<00:01:44.030> so<00:01:44.989> right<00:01:45.170> out<00:01:45.289> of<00:01:45.349> the

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
already is smooth so right out of the

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:52.270 
already is smooth so right out of the
box<00:01:45.649> it's<00:01:45.979> really<00:01:46.250> smooth<00:01:46.810> um<00:01:47.810> I<00:01:50.349> think<00:01:51.349> it

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
box it's really smooth um I think it

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.369 
box it's really smooth um I think it
will<00:01:52.429> be<00:01:52.610> easy<00:01:52.849> but<00:01:53.660> some<00:01:53.929> of<00:01:53.989> these<00:01:54.080> colors

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:54.379 
will be easy but some of these colors

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:59.440 
will be easy but some of these colors
like<00:01:55.030> like<00:01:56.030> these<00:01:56.330> two<00:01:57.819> are<00:01:58.819> like<00:01:59.149> really

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
like like these two are like really

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.930 
like like these two are like really
alike<00:01:59.869> so<00:02:00.619> whenever<00:02:00.890> you're<00:02:00.979> solving<00:02:01.310> you

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
alike so whenever you're solving you

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.669 
alike so whenever you're solving you
kind<00:02:02.209> of<00:02:02.239> have<00:02:02.420> to<00:02:02.450> like<00:02:02.569> take<00:02:03.110> a<00:02:03.170> second

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
kind of have to like take a second

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:07.290 
kind of have to like take a second
glance<00:02:03.830> at<00:02:04.220> them<00:02:04.989> just<00:02:05.989> make<00:02:06.200> sure<00:02:06.229> they<00:02:06.470> are

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
glance at them just make sure they are

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.790 
glance at them just make sure they are
like<00:02:08.300> are<00:02:08.629> the<00:02:09.019> right<00:02:09.170> color<00:02:09.410> that<00:02:09.649> you're

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
like are the right color that you're

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:18.460 
like are the right color that you're
working<00:02:10.250> with<00:02:10.369> um<00:02:13.599> yeah<00:02:14.599> I<00:02:14.900> suggest<00:02:15.650> it<00:02:17.470> it's

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
working with um yeah I suggest it it's

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:26.259 
working with um yeah I suggest it it's
very<00:02:18.680> it's<00:02:19.220> very<00:02:19.370> smooth<00:02:20.239> I<00:02:23.140> am<00:02:24.909> yeah<00:02:25.909> it's

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
very it's very smooth I am yeah it's

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.290 
very it's very smooth I am yeah it's
very<00:02:26.510> smooth<00:02:26.900> it's<00:02:27.170> like<00:02:27.349> smoother<00:02:28.069> than<00:02:28.310> what

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
very smooth it's like smoother than what

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.449 
very smooth it's like smoother than what
like<00:02:29.569> a<00:02:29.599> regular<00:02:29.870> Rubik's<00:02:30.440> Cube<00:02:30.800> now<00:02:31.370> the

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
like a regular Rubik's Cube now the

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.399 
like a regular Rubik's Cube now the
thing<00:02:31.640> that<00:02:31.790> people<00:02:32.090> don't<00:02:32.180> know<00:02:32.390> is<00:02:32.599> the

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:33.409 
thing that people don't know is the

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:35.530 
thing that people don't know is the
Rubik's<00:02:33.739> icon<00:02:34.280> for<00:02:34.819> those<00:02:35.000> of<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:35.239> that<00:02:35.390> don't

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
Rubik's icon for those of you that don't

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.780 
Rubik's icon for those of you that don't
know<00:02:35.690> it's<00:02:36.470> a<00:02:36.620> regular<00:02:36.769> Rubik's<00:02:37.370> Cube<00:02:37.670> you

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
know it's a regular Rubik's Cube you

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.640 
know it's a regular Rubik's Cube you
know<00:02:37.909> Terrans<00:02:38.390> eat<00:02:38.599> scrambled<00:02:38.959> up<00:02:39.319> and<00:02:39.560> then

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
know Terrans eat scrambled up and then

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.030 
know Terrans eat scrambled up and then
you<00:02:39.680> solve<00:02:39.980> it<00:02:40.159> but<00:02:41.080> there's<00:02:42.080> like<00:02:42.349> there's<00:02:42.890> a

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
you solve it but there's like there's a

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.610 
you solve it but there's like there's a
black<00:02:43.370> side<00:02:43.700> there's<00:02:44.060> a<00:02:44.120> white<00:02:44.330> side<00:02:44.659> there<00:02:45.590> is

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
black side there's a white side there is

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.509 
black side there's a white side there is
a<00:02:45.889> like<00:02:46.370> a<00:02:46.670> silver<00:02:47.359> side<00:02:47.599> um<00:02:48.249> it's<00:02:49.249> like

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
a like a silver side um it's like

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:50.470 
a like a silver side um it's like
reflective

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
reflective

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.940 
reflective
and<00:02:50.599> then<00:02:50.900> there's<00:02:51.110> three<00:02:51.319> different<00:02:51.470> shades

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
and then there's three different shades

00:02:51.950 --> 00:03:00.220 
and then there's three different shades
of<00:02:52.340> gray<00:02:53.680> so<00:02:54.680> um<00:02:55.870> I<00:02:57.879> suggested<00:02:59.080> just<00:03:00.080> I<00:03:00.170> don't

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
of gray so um I suggested just I don't

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.839 
of gray so um I suggested just I don't
know<00:03:00.440> how<00:03:00.680> hard<00:03:00.980> it<00:03:01.129> would<00:03:01.190> be<00:03:01.250> to<00:03:01.400> solve

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
know how hard it would be to solve

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.940 
know how hard it would be to solve
because<00:03:02.390> you<00:03:02.930> need<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.230> be<00:03:03.319> in<00:03:03.379> like<00:03:03.560> an<00:03:03.680> elated

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
because you need to be in like an elated

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.809 
because you need to be in like an elated
area<00:03:04.489> probably<00:03:05.500> because<00:03:06.500> you<00:03:07.280> probably<00:03:07.580> will

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
area probably because you probably will
