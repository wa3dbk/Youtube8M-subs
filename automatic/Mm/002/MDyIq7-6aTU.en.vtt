and how the work in general okay so okay
we've<00:00:28.960> got<00:00:29.140> an<00:00:29.350> the<00:00:29.590> standard<00:00:30.010> kind<00:00:30.190> of

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
we've got an the standard kind of

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.459 
we've got an the standard kind of
airbrush<00:00:30.850> and<00:00:31.539> I'll<00:00:31.750> just<00:00:31.900> grab<00:00:32.050> out<00:00:32.199> some<00:00:32.349> of

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:32.469 
airbrush and I'll just grab out some of

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:34.799 
airbrush and I'll just grab out some of
the<00:00:32.529> parts<00:00:32.949> and<00:00:33.159> I<00:00:33.670> don't<00:00:33.730> even<00:00:33.969> know<00:00:34.179> it's<00:00:34.719> a

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
the parts and I don't even know it's a

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.169 
the parts and I don't even know it's a
gravity<00:00:34.989> feed<00:00:35.350> air<00:00:35.530> balloon<00:00:35.920> or<00:00:36.039> because<00:00:36.489> the

00:00:37.169 --> 00:00:37.179 
gravity feed air balloon or because the

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:39.509 
gravity feed air balloon or because the
paint<00:00:37.570> and<00:00:37.899> where<00:00:38.319> the<00:00:38.409> pin<00:00:38.649> is<00:00:39.039> stored<00:00:39.370> here

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:39.519 
paint and where the pin is stored here

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:42.149 
paint and where the pin is stored here
and<00:00:39.940> it's<00:00:40.839> fed<00:00:41.230> down<00:00:41.440> by<00:00:41.649> gravity

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:42.159 
and it's fed down by gravity

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:44.369 
and it's fed down by gravity
no<00:00:42.940> that<00:00:43.120> types<00:00:43.329> you<00:00:43.480> can<00:00:43.539> get<00:00:43.749> our<00:00:43.960> suction

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
no that types you can get our suction

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.979 
no that types you can get our suction
and<00:00:44.829> air<00:00:45.489> brushes<00:00:45.850> where<00:00:46.059> there's<00:00:46.420> a<00:00:46.600> little

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
and air brushes where there's a little

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:47.910 
and air brushes where there's a little
container<00:00:47.350> here

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
container here

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.040 
container here
and<00:00:48.010> it<00:00:48.370> sucks<00:00:48.670> it<00:00:48.850> up<00:00:48.999> but<00:00:49.629> these<00:00:49.870> are<00:00:49.989> the

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
and it sucks it up but these are the

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.959 
and it sucks it up but these are the
most<00:00:50.199> common<00:00:50.589> and<00:00:50.859> most<00:00:51.010> people<00:00:51.429> have<00:00:51.550> gravity

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
most common and most people have gravity

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.069 
most common and most people have gravity
feeds<00:00:52.210> and<00:00:52.510> so<00:00:53.229> part<00:00:53.789> here<00:00:54.789> on<00:00:54.940> the<00:00:55.300> end<00:00:55.449> will

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
feeds and so part here on the end will

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.289 
feeds and so part here on the end will
have<00:00:56.109> the<00:00:56.589> needle<00:00:56.949> cup<00:00:57.190> and<00:00:57.429> this<00:00:57.969> just

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:58.299 
have the needle cup and this just

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:59.910 
have the needle cup and this just
protects<00:00:58.839> the<00:00:58.929> needle<00:00:59.229> from<00:00:59.350> getting<00:00:59.649> bent

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
protects the needle from getting bent

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.000 
protects the needle from getting bent
and<00:01:00.249> and<00:01:01.149> just<00:01:01.629> below<00:01:01.870> this<00:01:02.049> here<00:01:02.379> which<00:01:02.679> can't

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
and and just below this here which can't

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.510 
and and just below this here which can't
screw<00:01:03.339> up<00:01:03.370> is<00:01:04.150> the<00:01:04.420> air<00:01:04.629> head<00:01:04.960> so<00:01:05.710> we're<00:01:06.400> going

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
screw up is the air head so we're going

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.940 
screw up is the air head so we're going
to<00:01:06.610> just<00:01:06.760> go<00:01:06.910> ahead<00:01:07.000> and<00:01:07.240> screw<00:01:07.450> this<00:01:07.510> off<00:01:07.950> now

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
to just go ahead and screw this off now

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.990 
to just go ahead and screw this off now
the<00:01:09.490> air<00:01:09.700> head<00:01:10.000> is<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:10.900> part<00:01:11.170> that<00:01:11.470> just<00:01:12.370> goes

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
the air head is the part that just goes

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.720 
the air head is the part that just goes
over<00:01:13.330> the<00:01:13.690> edge<00:01:13.840> of<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.080> needle<00:01:14.410> and<00:01:14.730> also

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:15.730 
over the edge of the needle and also

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.530 
over the edge of the needle and also
houses<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:17.160> nozzle<00:01:18.160> all<00:01:18.730> sometimes<00:01:19.180> called

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
houses the nozzle all sometimes called

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.040 
houses the nozzle all sometimes called
the<00:01:19.660> needle<00:01:19.960> tip<00:01:20.170> and<00:01:20.910> now<00:01:21.910> when<00:01:22.450> we're<00:01:22.630> taking

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
the needle tip and now when we're taking

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.660 
the needle tip and now when we're taking
the<00:01:23.260> air<00:01:23.440> pressure<00:01:23.620> part<00:01:24.010> it's<00:01:24.220> important<00:01:24.610> to

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
the air pressure part it's important to

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.450 
the air pressure part it's important to
take<00:01:24.910> these<00:01:25.510> parts<00:01:25.930> off<00:01:26.050> first<00:01:26.410> and<00:01:26.620> then<00:01:26.710> we

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
take these parts off first and then we

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.090 
take these parts off first and then we
can<00:01:27.520> go<00:01:27.730> around<00:01:27.820> to<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.180> back<00:01:28.330> and<00:01:28.980> we<00:01:29.980> can

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
can go around to the back and we can

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.460 
can go around to the back and we can
actually<00:01:30.250> unscrew<00:01:30.760> the<00:01:31.030> needle<00:01:31.330> out<00:01:31.540> so<00:01:32.410> you

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
actually unscrew the needle out so you

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.440 
actually unscrew the needle out so you
just<00:01:32.650> remove<00:01:32.920> this<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:34.530> carefully<00:01:35.530> remove

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
just remove this and carefully remove

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.800 
just remove this and carefully remove
needle<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:40.219> that<00:01:41.219> is<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:42.119> part<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.659> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
needle and that is the part of the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.630 
needle and that is the part of the
airbrush<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.469> are<00:01:43.860> most<00:01:44.100> important

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
airbrush that are most important

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.980 
airbrush that are most important
especially<00:01:44.939> when<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.390> comes<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.659> cleaning

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
especially when it comes to cleaning

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.230 
especially when it comes to cleaning
okay<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.039> way<00:01:47.189> in<00:01:47.250> which<00:01:47.369> air<00:01:47.789> brushes

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
okay so the way in which air brushes

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.230 
okay so the way in which air brushes
work<00:01:48.500> and<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.590> way<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:49.890> one<00:01:50.100> works<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.610> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
work and the way this one works is the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.840 
work and the way this one works is the
airs<00:01:51.450> fed<00:01:51.810> up<00:01:51.960> through<00:01:52.289> here<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:53.310> it's<00:01:53.579> fed

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
airs fed up through here and it's fed

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.690 
airs fed up through here and it's fed
out<00:01:54.119> through<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.170> nozzle<00:01:55.319> or<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.159> needle<00:01:56.340> tip

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
out through the nozzle or the needle tip

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.649 
out through the nozzle or the needle tip
and<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:57.860> basically<00:01:58.860> when<00:01:59.069> we<00:01:59.219> push<00:01:59.460> this<00:01:59.759> leave

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
and so basically when we push this leave

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.809 
and so basically when we push this leave
are<00:02:00.840> down<00:02:01.049> now<00:02:01.289> this<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.619> dual<00:02:01.860> action<00:02:02.069> arif<00:02:02.520> so

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:02.819 
are down now this is dual action arif so

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:05.569 
are down now this is dual action arif so
we<00:02:02.939> can<00:02:03.060> control<00:02:03.329> how<00:02:04.049> much<00:02:04.200> air<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.890> how<00:02:05.399> much

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
we can control how much air and how much

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.509 
we can control how much air and how much
paint<00:02:05.969> comes<00:02:06.240> out<00:02:06.479> at<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.689> same<00:02:06.750> time<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.519> two

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
paint comes out at the same time and two

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.600 
paint comes out at the same time and two
IR<00:02:08.819> brushes<00:02:09.209> just<00:02:09.869> control<00:02:10.380> how<00:02:10.860> much<00:02:11.039> air<00:02:11.280> and

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
IR brushes just control how much air and

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.250 
IR brushes just control how much air and
then<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.060> pin<00:02:12.269> will<00:02:12.420> just<00:02:12.630> spray<00:02:12.900> out<00:02:12.989> with

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
then the pin will just spray out with

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.160 
then the pin will just spray out with
this<00:02:13.349> you<00:02:13.530> can<00:02:13.590> control<00:02:13.950> growth<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.690> so<00:02:15.690> the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
this you can control growth and so the

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.930 
this you can control growth and so the
air<00:02:16.349> come<00:02:16.620> up<00:02:16.739> through<00:02:16.920> yeah<00:02:17.160> we're<00:02:17.760> going<00:02:17.910> to

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
air come up through yeah we're going to

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.150 
air come up through yeah we're going to
release<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.329> air<00:02:18.480> by<00:02:18.630> pushing<00:02:18.930> this<00:02:19.110> down<00:02:19.170> and

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
release the air by pushing this down and

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.180 
release the air by pushing this down and
then<00:02:20.519> as<00:02:20.849> will<00:02:21.450> pull<00:02:21.690> us<00:02:21.870> back<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.739> needle

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
then as will pull us back the needle

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.789 
then as will pull us back the needle
itself<00:02:23.489> moves<00:02:24.000> back<00:02:24.299> and<00:02:24.569> you<00:02:25.440> can<00:02:25.590> release

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
itself moves back and you can release

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.729 
itself moves back and you can release
how<00:02:26.099> much<00:02:26.340> paint<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.450> control<00:02:28.049> how<00:02:28.200> much<00:02:28.319> pain

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
how much paint and control how much pain

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.190 
how much paint and control how much pain
is<00:02:28.920> released<00:02:29.310> from<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.760> nozzle<00:02:30.239> by<00:02:30.780> moving

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
is released from the nozzle by moving

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.710 
is released from the nozzle by moving
the<00:02:31.470> needle<00:02:31.620> back<00:02:31.890> that's<00:02:32.130> like<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.459> so<00:02:33.329> that

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
the needle back that's like that so that

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.839 
the needle back that's like that so that
is<00:02:33.870> basically<00:02:34.110> how<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.650> average<00:02:34.980> works<00:02:35.579> on

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
is basically how the average works on

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.100 
is basically how the average works on
the<00:02:35.970> pin<00:02:36.239> is<00:02:36.510> fed<00:02:36.810> down<00:02:37.500> through<00:02:37.860> here<00:02:38.660> so<00:02:39.660> this

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
the pin is fed down through here so this

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.229 
the pin is fed down through here so this
is<00:02:40.319> a<00:02:40.349> compressor<00:02:40.889> and<00:02:41.250> this<00:02:41.639> section<00:02:41.910> here

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
is a compressor and this section here

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.520 
is a compressor and this section here
and<00:02:42.480> this<00:02:43.019> is<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.500> totally<00:02:44.280> our<00:02:44.489> tank<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.530> so

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
and this is a totally our tank and so

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.009 
and this is a totally our tank and so
the<00:02:46.920> way<00:02:47.069> this<00:02:47.250> works<00:02:47.519> is<00:02:47.730> most<00:02:48.269> people<00:02:48.750> just

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
the way this works is most people just

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.490 
the way this works is most people just
have<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.290> compressor<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.450> this<00:02:51.500> compresses

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
have a compressor and this compresses

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.840 
have a compressor and this compresses
the<00:02:52.650> air<00:02:52.680> I'll<00:02:53.100> feed<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.430> through<00:02:53.670> the

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
the air I'll feed it through the

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.319 
the air I'll feed it through the
airbrush<00:02:54.420> but<00:02:55.200> this<00:02:56.130> one<00:02:56.310> name<00:02:56.549> is<00:02:56.910> a<00:02:56.940> little

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
airbrush but this one name is a little

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.300 
airbrush but this one name is a little
bit<00:02:57.450> better<00:02:57.600> because<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:58.590> will<00:02:58.739> compress<00:02:59.100> the

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
bit better because it will compress the

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.000 
bit better because it will compress the
air<00:02:59.340> which<00:03:00.060> is<00:03:00.239> stored<00:03:00.690> in<00:03:01.019> this<00:03:01.139> tank<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.709> you

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
air which is stored in this tank and you

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.970 
air which is stored in this tank and you
can<00:03:02.100> control<00:03:02.519> how<00:03:03.180> much<00:03:03.239> air<00:03:03.600> stored<00:03:04.109> I<00:03:04.380> am

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
can control how much air stored I am

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.120 
can control how much air stored I am
changing<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.549> pressure<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:06.269> so<00:03:06.989> it's<00:03:07.530> silent

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
changing the pressure and so it's silent

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.710 
changing the pressure and so it's silent
when<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.400> use<00:03:08.609> that<00:03:08.910> word<00:03:09.180> which<00:03:09.420> because<00:03:09.600> all

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
when you use that word which because all

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.360 
when you use that word which because all
the<00:03:09.840> air<00:03:10.019> will<00:03:10.170> be<00:03:10.260> being<00:03:10.500> taken<00:03:11.130> out<00:03:11.190> with

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
the air will be being taken out with

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.099 
the air will be being taken out with
this<00:03:11.489> time<00:03:11.790> rather<00:03:12.180> than<00:03:12.329> being<00:03:12.660> compressed

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
this time rather than being compressed

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.530 
this time rather than being compressed
then<00:03:13.440> blown<00:03:13.829> straight<00:03:14.190> out<00:03:14.370> it's<00:03:14.790> storming

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
then blown straight out it's storming

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.390 
then blown straight out it's storming
out<00:03:15.630> so<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:16.380> can<00:03:16.530> actually<00:03:16.680> just<00:03:16.859> compress

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
out so you can actually just compress

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.849 
out so you can actually just compress
the<00:03:17.579> air<00:03:17.609> a<00:03:17.970> little<00:03:18.540> all<00:03:18.989> my<00:03:19.049> view<00:03:19.500> stop

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
the air a little all my view stop

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.319 
the air a little all my view stop
compressing<00:03:20.430> it<00:03:20.489> what's<00:03:20.639> the<00:03:20.790> time<00:03:20.970> it's<00:03:21.120> full

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
compressing it what's the time it's full

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.660 
compressing it what's the time it's full
so<00:03:21.989> a<00:03:22.349> little<00:03:22.829> bit<00:03:22.950> more<00:03:23.130> money<00:03:23.280> but<00:03:23.400> it's

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
so a little bit more money but it's

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.539 
so a little bit more money but it's
definitely<00:03:23.910> worth<00:03:24.269> that<00:03:24.540> for<00:03:24.750> money<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.549> so

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
definitely worth that for money and so

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.789 
definitely worth that for money and so
to<00:03:26.609> connect<00:03:27.120> this<00:03:27.299> to<00:03:27.359> the<00:03:27.630> air<00:03:27.780> above<00:03:27.959> you

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
to connect this to the air above you

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.520 
to connect this to the air above you
just<00:03:29.040> use<00:03:29.280> a<00:03:29.609> tube<00:03:29.849> like<00:03:30.060> this<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.540> you<00:03:31.500> should

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
just use a tube like this and you should

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.570 
just use a tube like this and you should
have<00:03:31.799> an<00:03:31.920> adapter<00:03:32.489> which<00:03:32.760> will

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
have an adapter which will

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.940 
have an adapter which will
connected<00:03:34.150> to<00:03:34.270> the<00:03:34.390> airbrush<00:03:34.750> um<00:03:35.080> it'll<00:03:35.740> also

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
connected to the airbrush um it'll also

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.100 
connected to the airbrush um it'll also
stop<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:36.520> airflow<00:03:36.880> want<00:03:37.360> to<00:03:37.510> remove<00:03:37.900> the

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
stop the airflow want to remove the

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.440 
stop the airflow want to remove the
others<00:03:38.380> from<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.740> wire<00:03:39.100> so<00:03:39.790> you<00:03:39.850> just<00:03:40.300> go

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
others from the wire so you just go

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.120 
others from the wire so you just go
ahead<00:03:40.600> and<00:03:41.080> attach<00:03:41.830> this<00:03:42.250> tube<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:44.530> end

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
ahead and attach this tube to the end

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.660 
ahead and attach this tube to the end
here<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:46.890> this<00:03:47.890> is<00:03:48.040> where<00:03:48.220> you<00:03:48.370> can<00:03:48.490> actually

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
here and this is where you can actually

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.840 
here and this is where you can actually
control<00:03:49.210> the<00:03:49.360> pressure<00:03:49.630> using<00:03:50.590> this<00:03:50.740> and<00:03:51.070> you

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
control the pressure using this and you

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.260 
control the pressure using this and you
should<00:03:52.060> be<00:03:52.270> looking<00:03:52.690> at<00:03:52.990> how<00:03:53.200> to<00:03:53.260> round<00:03:53.910> to<00:03:54.910> bar

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
should be looking at how to round to bar

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.050 
should be looking at how to round to bar
and<00:03:55.600> which<00:03:56.380> is<00:03:56.560> a<00:03:56.590> nice<00:03:56.920> pressure<00:03:57.400> for<00:03:57.790> using

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
and which is a nice pressure for using

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.090 
and which is a nice pressure for using
an<00:03:58.180> airbrush<00:03:58.510> you<00:03:59.050> can't<00:03:59.350> do<00:03:59.620> other<00:03:59.800> pressure

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
an airbrush you can't do other pressure

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.140 
an airbrush you can't do other pressure

more fine detail you can actually reduce
the<00:04:07.120> pressure<00:04:07.300> and<00:04:07.720> do<00:04:08.650> it<00:04:08.800> like<00:04:08.950> that<00:04:08.980> book<00:04:09.340> to

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
the pressure and do it like that book to

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.480 
the pressure and do it like that book to

bar is a nice pressure you use and your

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.900 
bar is a nice pressure you use and your
adapter<00:04:13.300> will<00:04:13.750> go<00:04:13.930> on<00:04:14.050> this<00:04:14.260> end<00:04:14.530> of<00:04:15.520> the<00:04:15.670> tube

finish pin and you've been paying for a

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.600 
finish pin and you've been paying for a
session<00:04:31.720> and<00:04:32.230> you<00:04:32.290> just<00:04:32.560> feel<00:04:32.890> like<00:04:32.920> you<00:04:33.460> need

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
to clean the airbrush up just before you

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.080 
to clean the airbrush up just before you
pull<00:04:35.500> it<00:04:35.560> away<00:04:35.650> so<00:04:36.490> we're<00:04:36.670> going<00:04:36.760> to<00:04:36.850> look<00:04:36.940> at

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
pull it away so we're going to look at

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.390 
pull it away so we're going to look at
how<00:04:37.270> to<00:04:37.330> do<00:04:37.480> that<00:04:37.510> so<00:04:37.930> first<00:04:38.340> you're<00:04:39.340> probably

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
how to do that so first you're probably
