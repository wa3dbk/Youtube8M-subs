00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.450 

I<00:00:05.330> had<00:00:06.330> some<00:00:06.540> arches<00:00:06.899> oil<00:00:07.290> paper<00:00:07.589> in<00:00:07.859> my<00:00:07.890> studio

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
I had some arches oil paper in my studio

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.320 
I had some arches oil paper in my studio
after<00:00:08.990> about<00:00:10.040> six<00:00:11.040> tries<00:00:11.490> this<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.150> what<00:00:12.300> I

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
after about six tries this is what I

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.629 
after about six tries this is what I
found<00:00:12.599> out<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.620> first<00:00:13.799> thing<00:00:14.009> I<00:00:14.130> like<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.460> do

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
found out the first thing I like to do

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.000 
found out the first thing I like to do
is<00:00:14.940> oil<00:00:15.450> in<00:00:15.660> with<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.870> mixture<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.350> linseed<00:00:16.650> oil

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
is oil in with a mixture of linseed oil

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.330 
is oil in with a mixture of linseed oil
and<00:00:17.250> turpentine<00:00:17.609> plus<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.810> color<00:00:19.500> wash<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:20.100> some

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
and turpentine plus a color wash of some

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.730 
and turpentine plus a color wash of some
kind<00:00:20.670> this<00:00:21.420> gets<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.840> surface<00:00:22.170> ready<00:00:22.439> for

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
kind this gets the surface ready for

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.500 
kind this gets the surface ready for
painting<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.310> it's<00:00:23.430> not<00:00:23.640> as<00:00:23.820> absorbent<00:00:24.359> on

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
painting and it's not as absorbent on

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.720 
painting and it's not as absorbent on
what<00:00:24.810> I'm<00:00:24.960> laying<00:00:25.199> down<00:00:25.320> some<00:00:26.160> people<00:00:26.340> really

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
what I'm laying down some people really

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.339 
what I'm laying down some people really
like<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:26.970> absorbent<00:00:27.660> thing<00:00:27.840> right<00:00:28.050> off<00:00:28.199> the

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
like that absorbent thing right off the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.400 
like that absorbent thing right off the
bat<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.849> like<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.880> closed<00:00:30.240> surface<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:31.019> for<00:00:31.289> me

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
bat I like a closed surface so for me

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.970 
bat I like a closed surface so for me
this<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.910> workaround<00:00:33.350> then<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.500> just<00:00:34.739> draw

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
this is a workaround then you just draw

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.930 
this is a workaround then you just draw
into<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.630> like<00:00:36.630> normal<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:38.070> don't<00:00:38.250> need<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.550> lot

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
into it like normal you don't need a lot

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.430 
into it like normal you don't need a lot
more<00:00:38.969> medium<00:00:39.480> after<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.020> because<00:00:40.320> the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
more medium after that because the

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.369 
more medium after that because the
surface<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.860> pretty<00:00:41.129> slippery<00:00:42.020> but<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.140> can't

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
surface is pretty slippery but you can't

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.410 
surface is pretty slippery but you can't
really<00:00:43.800> get<00:00:44.129> back<00:00:44.430> down<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.210> paper

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
really get back down to the paper

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.569 
really get back down to the paper
because<00:00:45.870> it's<00:00:46.050> absorbent<00:00:46.710> it's<00:00:46.920> going<00:00:47.430> to

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
because it's absorbent it's going to

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.119 
because it's absorbent it's going to
stain<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.539> can<00:00:48.989> pull<00:00:49.200> off<00:00:49.410> thick<00:00:49.829> paint

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
stain so you can pull off thick paint

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.799 
stain so you can pull off thick paint
but<00:00:50.309> pulling<00:00:50.520> off<00:00:50.789> thin<00:00:51.539> paint<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:53.809> difficult

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
but pulling off thin paint is difficult

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.010 
but pulling off thin paint is difficult
and<00:00:55.050> leaves<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.070> haze<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.390> have<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.629> be<00:00:57.750> real

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
and leaves a haze so you have to be real

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.229 
and leaves a haze so you have to be real
real<00:00:58.289> careful<00:00:58.350> about<00:00:58.920> your<00:00:59.190> drawing<00:00:59.520> right

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
real careful about your drawing right

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.319 
real careful about your drawing right
from<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.629> beginning<00:01:01.160> this<00:01:02.160> sketch<00:01:02.609> was<00:01:02.940> just

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
from the beginning this sketch was just

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.710 
from the beginning this sketch was just
done<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:04.170> illustrate<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:05.100> paper<00:01:05.720> it's

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
done to illustrate the paper it's

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.140 
done to illustrate the paper it's
definitely<00:01:07.350> not<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.560> drawing<00:01:07.920> demonstration<00:01:08.820> I

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
definitely not a drawing demonstration I

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.289 
definitely not a drawing demonstration I
am<00:01:09.979> not<00:01:10.979> using<00:01:11.220> any<00:01:11.549> kind<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.909> technique<00:01:12.270> that

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
am not using any kind of technique that

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.899 
am not using any kind of technique that
I<00:01:12.510> could<00:01:12.720> recommend<00:01:13.020> here<00:01:13.530> but<00:01:14.220> just<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.700> play

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
I could recommend here but just to play

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.270 
I could recommend here but just to play
around<00:01:14.939> with<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.810> try<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.110> see<00:01:16.500> what<00:01:17.159> was

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
around with it and try and see what was

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.190 
around with it and try and see what was
going<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.490> happen<00:01:17.670> in<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.270> thin<00:01:18.540> versus<00:01:18.960> thick

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
going to happen in the thin versus thick

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.760 
going to happen in the thin versus thick
areas<00:01:19.650> it's<00:01:20.369> fun<00:01:20.729> it's<00:01:21.090> it's<00:01:21.869> nice<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.409> smooth

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
areas it's fun it's it's nice and smooth

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.300 
areas it's fun it's it's nice and smooth
it<00:01:23.360> holds<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.450> lot<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.840> paints<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.500> doesn't<00:01:25.979> warp

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
it holds a lot of paints it doesn't warp

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.120 
it holds a lot of paints it doesn't warp
or<00:01:26.549> buckle<00:01:26.939> at<00:01:27.210> all<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:28.530> can<00:01:28.680> cut<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:28.890> to

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
or buckle at all and you can cut it to

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.929 
or buckle at all and you can cut it to
size<00:01:29.930> really<00:01:30.930> easily<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.619> was<00:01:32.400> able<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.700> get<00:01:32.909> a

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
size really easily I was able to get a

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.660 
size really easily I was able to get a
few<00:01:33.150> layers<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.600> paint<00:01:33.780> onto<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.680> surface<00:01:35.340> in

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
few layers of paint onto the surface in

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.499 
few layers of paint onto the surface in
about<00:01:36.119> an<00:01:36.270> hour<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.689> half<00:01:36.900> but<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:38.479> had<00:01:39.479> a

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
about an hour and a half but I had a

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.770 
about an hour and a half but I had a
really<00:01:39.900> hard<00:01:40.140> time<00:01:41.090> modeling<00:01:42.090> areas<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.720> I

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
really hard time modeling areas that I

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.139 
really hard time modeling areas that I
had<00:01:42.930> designated<00:01:43.079> as<00:01:43.680> darks<00:01:44.070> back<00:01:44.670> into<00:01:45.030> the

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
had designated as darks back into the

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.569 
had designated as darks back into the
medium<00:01:45.570> range<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.680> wasn't<00:01:47.009> as<00:01:47.130> sensitive

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
medium range so it wasn't as sensitive

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.109 
medium range so it wasn't as sensitive
as<00:01:47.790> what<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.500> really<00:01:49.500> would<00:01:50.220> normally<00:01:50.670> see<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:50.939> a

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
as what I really would normally see in a

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.130 
as what I really would normally see in a
panel<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.720> had<00:01:51.840> prepared<00:01:53.180> still<00:01:54.180> really

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
panel that I had prepared still really

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.719 
panel that I had prepared still really
lightweight<00:01:55.350> really<00:01:55.619> flexible<00:01:56.280> as<00:01:56.430> far<00:01:56.640> as

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
lightweight really flexible as far as

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.259 
lightweight really flexible as far as
sizes<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.390> I'll<00:01:57.630> give<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.079> try
