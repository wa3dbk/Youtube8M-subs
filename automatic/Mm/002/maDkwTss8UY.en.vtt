00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.120
 hey everyone if unpleasant here and 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.480
 welcome to today video today video 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.520
 is a murder review and the montague is 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.520
 cookies tomorrow is the cookies moss 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.680
 a moth that has various items in you 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.900
 game add as here we have 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.779
 the role of a cookie hear the cookie ears 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.910
 add block code cookie block half 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.369
 cookie and have with golden cookie 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.559
 demigods and normal cookies 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:38.670
 so the nice thing about this 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.250
 these items is the golden cookie 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.629
 who can give your mind these two things so the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.329
 goal to your 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.950
 and the cookie hear those strains in you too 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.829
 world in new chimps or new 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.110
 created wild and if you have that mind ' 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.320
 so you get your mind that month 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.460
 and if you do this might get normal cookie 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:03.059
 so it god a cookie if you diet that 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.240
 makes your whole food trail full again 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.850
 that so cool and then half a cookie 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.790
 I think half a century of bar in this one 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.580
 does for me half a half eat one 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.549
 piece and it does the same as before 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.759
 then we also have your block here 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.530
 which is easy in the long term and fun for 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.200
 decoration 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.270
 the golden one and now he still has these two horse 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.270
 that you can find in the mind 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.020
 we also have the cookie here 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.369
 tools such as singing for cookie 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.820
 sword 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:43.189
 cookie peck cookie x and the shovel 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.570
 these items are on the plug up to 10 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.840
 maximum 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.880
 and are really crazy so can see here 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.280
 with kilt all at once above and 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.990
 the people who culti in and twice is late 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.990
 let me see this 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:11.660
 and reaper and one can see once and 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:15.620
 mine twice and then go anyway 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.349
 a game on 0 so the duration on this 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.120
 Cookie items are very slow or may have gone 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.849
 better than mine 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.500
 I think I still say survival than see now 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:29.260
 breaks quickly 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:32.150
 wrong 18 show full and now went and 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.190
 so very fast but they are also very fast 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.859
 easy to make because cookies are in 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.160
 very easy to make with cocoa 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:43.310
 it's really worth the trick black 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.880
 that they are all very quick and on 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:52.489
 then we still have this for the tree 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:54.019
 so let 's just see the king and 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.260
 I tested it, it's really faster 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:59.980
 then a painful wax and he brings you 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.980
 this also much faster 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.389
 can see something like that 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.099
 and then the pickaxe newest one needed 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.719
 pickings also very quickly from detail to detail 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:17.079
 its very easy on him 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:17.439
 but also with stone and they can like it 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:21.790
 good is 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:25.139
 otherwise mine and I already have an option that 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.139
 you call it hip hop cerium 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:34.310
 to my job 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.590
 so can see option in so perfect the mind 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:45.750
 so everything to mind glowstone 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:49.650
 natural wood and other things 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:52.739
 just as quickly with your hand I think 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.379
 yes something like that and of course these things 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.610
 here are also almost a stent and then the 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:02.430
 blocks 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:04.829
 go something slower set 0 so this is 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.060
 how you make the tools this is a pickaxe 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.519
 and like a normal project only one 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.079
 three cookies this is an ex 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.670
 just like an ex but with three 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:14.220
 cookies there 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.599
 this is the sword and finally the 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.150
 shovel 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:20.010
 so this is the cookies mouth it is one 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:24.300
 very nice joke 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:26.699
 and so an easy moth to 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.470
 install and I will do that installation 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:31.470
 show them in a moment 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:35.849
 so now what we are going to do so we are going 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:38.130
 just looking if there are cookies 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:39.450
 spawned which are or are cookies 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.729
 these tension 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:45.009
 said just as argon and cold is not 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:47.169
 very strange it is not very rare though 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.789
 that is to test me so I go to 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.379
 new chunks 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:52.360
 and say that new new new 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:54.610
 world what is spawned i don't know 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:05:00.639
 whether this is new world 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:03.960
 I think so because it's because it's here 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:07.749
 the land still blows like a tree 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.759
 yes look if you can see it exciting in it 

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:10.659
 the world and here we have a whole 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:13.749
 big piece 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:15.669
 this is quite a lot and you can do this 

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:20.110
 so quite a lot of tools to make 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:23.169
 this tension and then of course you just have 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.809
 like the role the cookie i heard there 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:28.289
 requests taken I don't know if that 

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:31.809
 more rare is probably though 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:34.659
 always considered so yes we can still 

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:36.370
 for a bit if we search this is 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:38.789
 Kate keeps on going too nice cape 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.789
 town's 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:48.099
 okay so here on my have 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:49.389
 what if you the two files from this 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:51.550
 description download 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.199
 So you have these two files in with 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.339
 winrar i also need that in the 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:57.069
 Description 

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:59.679
 the loader if you put on your desktop 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:01.300
 And then you have the cookie mouth too 

00:05:59.679 --> 00:06:02.999
 your desk what there is a folder but me 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.520
 pretend this is my desktop 

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:08.800
 just simple so what you have the first 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.770
 cow someone who open you then you have 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.939
 here a brochure and it was also on you 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:16.240
 desktop 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:18.369
 then you close WinRAR and then go to 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.580
 ring and copy 

00:06:18.369 --> 00:06:24.399
 all these files go back 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:27.789
 create a new windy file 

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:29.800
 windy archive 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:30.819
 and you just call it cookie or what 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.749
 also 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:38.529
 open it and collapse these files here 

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:42.459
 that's okay we let him go again 

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:44.589
 to magic launcher 

00:06:42.459 --> 00:06:48.629
 teeselink stick in the description then go 

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:51.099
 put you to and then I just have to 

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:52.089
 take away that is nothing for you 

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:58.209
 like this 

00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:59.079
 click on add go to you for this go to you 

00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:00.639
 desktop 

00:06:59.079 --> 00:07:02.559
 I have is of course true in the folder 

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:04.360
 You have them Gilbert light this stand 

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:06.430
 head to foot lower mouth is in Lodorp 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.619
 is ok here 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:13.539
 then add the cookie mouth or 

00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:20.039
 at least the brochure that we had 

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:20.039
 made in going back 

00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:28.909
 sorry you didn't have to make a wind archive 

00:07:26.719 --> 00:07:32.029
 but you had to confuse a new one 

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:35.619
 ship archive and so paste the 

00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:35.619
 files in the folder 

00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:43.550
 and we therefore call for just cookie 

00:07:40.249 --> 00:07:44.330
 the fun and then this I already have the mouth 

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:46.519
 loader 

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:50.779
 go out and if you shit your cookie point 

00:07:46.519 --> 00:07:52.189
 open and and if you are ok then and then again 

00:07:50.779 --> 00:07:57.849
 also log in 

00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:57.849
 and then you are ready and you have all 

00:07:58.159 --> 00:08:02.209
 all the dust with then you just have it and 

00:08:00.949 --> 00:08:05.059
 then you can just get the moss 

00:08:02.209 --> 00:08:07.309
 just like in the video so use this 

00:08:05.059 --> 00:08:09.559
 is how you put it in the stable in it 

00:08:07.309 --> 00:08:11.889
 thanks for watching and see you next 

00:08:09.559 --> 00:08:11.889
 times
