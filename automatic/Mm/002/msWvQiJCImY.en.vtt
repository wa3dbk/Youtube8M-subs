specifically<00:00:33.960> designed<00:00:34.079> for<00:00:34.710> police

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
specifically designed for police

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.709 
specifically designed for police
interceptors<00:00:35.910> but<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.149> got<00:00:36.360> something<00:00:36.660> a

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
interceptors but I got something a

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.780 
interceptors but I got something a
little<00:00:36.840> bit<00:00:37.020> more<00:00:37.170> comfortable<00:00:37.710> these<00:00:38.579> are

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
little bit more comfortable these are

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.389 
little bit more comfortable these are
yokohama<00:00:39.300> avid<00:00:39.570> ascend<00:00:40.230> they<00:00:41.070> are<00:00:41.190> low

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
yokohama avid ascend they are low

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.580 
yokohama avid ascend they are low
rolling<00:00:41.610> resistance<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.510> they<00:00:42.750> save<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> little

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
rolling resistance so they save a little

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.709 
rolling resistance so they save a little
bit<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.800> gas<00:00:44.070> i've<00:00:44.280> noticed<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.700> little<00:00:45.480> bit<00:00:45.690> of

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
bit of gas i've noticed a little bit of

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.350 
bit of gas i've noticed a little bit of
an<00:00:45.840> increased<00:00:46.230> fuel<00:00:46.739> economy<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:48.210> other

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
an increased fuel economy and the other

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.479 
an increased fuel economy and the other
thing<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.690> note<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:48.870> actually<00:00:49.469> i<00:00:49.710> got<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.340> little

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
thing to note is actually i got a little

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.459 
thing to note is actually i got a little
bit<00:00:50.730> higher<00:00:50.940> aspect<00:00:51.449> ratio<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.960> help<00:00:52.170> fill<00:00:52.350> out

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
bit higher aspect ratio to help fill out

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.720 
bit higher aspect ratio to help fill out
these<00:00:52.649> wheel<00:00:52.890> wells<00:00:52.920> i<00:00:53.309> think<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.579> really

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
these wheel wells i think it really

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.720 
these wheel wells i think it really
makes<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.120> look<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.420> lot<00:00:54.840> better<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:56.309> other

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
makes it look a lot better so and other

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.970 
makes it look a lot better so and other
than<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.000> you'll<00:00:57.300> see<00:00:57.510> these<00:00:57.660> caps<00:00:58.410> actually

biggest thing you'll notice is that I do
have<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> center<00:01:23.400> console<00:01:23.880> now<00:01:24.170> got<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.439> out

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
have a center console now got this out

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.840 
have a center console now got this out
of<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:26.689> 2004<00:01:27.689> Mountaineer<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.250> had<00:01:29.430> no<00:01:29.640> lid

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
of a 2004 Mountaineer and it had no lid

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.560 
of a 2004 Mountaineer and it had no lid
on<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.049> lid<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.530> from<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.920> 2002<00:01:32.850> Explorer

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
on it so the lid is from a 2002 Explorer

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.929 
on it so the lid is from a 2002 Explorer
if<00:01:34.409> you'll<00:01:34.560> notice<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.950> lids<00:01:35.159> grey<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.759> this

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
if you'll notice the lids grey and this

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.819 
if you'll notice the lids grey and this
is<00:01:36.119> supposed<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.869> be<00:01:36.930> black<00:01:37.290> but<00:01:37.500> they<00:01:37.650> match

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
is supposed to be black but they match

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.200 
is supposed to be black but they match
pretty<00:01:38.070> well<00:01:38.159> because<00:01:38.549> Ford<00:01:38.850> could<00:01:39.030> never

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
pretty well because Ford could never

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.690 
pretty well because Ford could never
match<00:01:39.420> interior<00:01:39.990> plastics<00:01:40.460> so<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:41.610> in

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
match interior plastics so it's in

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.520 
match interior plastics so it's in
pretty<00:01:41.850> good<00:01:41.939> shape<00:01:42.270> it's<00:01:42.930> got<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> little<00:01:43.290> bit

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
pretty good shape it's got a little bit

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.340 
pretty good shape it's got a little bit
of<00:01:43.560> rippling<00:01:44.009> right<00:01:44.189> here<00:01:44.430> but<00:01:44.610> that's<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:45.350> and

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
of rippling right here but that's it and

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.830 
of rippling right here but that's it and
it's<00:01:47.220> actually<00:01:47.579> not<00:01:47.700> really<00:01:47.759> even<00:01:48.360> secured

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
it's actually not really even secured

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.260 
it's actually not really even secured
down<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.500> fits<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.220> between<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.670> seats<00:01:50.970> really

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
down it fits in between the seats really

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.389 
down it fits in between the seats really
snuggly<00:01:51.810> like<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.110> can't<00:01:52.350> can't<00:01:53.009> really<00:01:53.189> move

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
snuggly like I can't can't really move

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.469 
snuggly like I can't can't really move
it<00:01:53.579> at<00:01:53.700> all<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:54.960> worked<00:01:55.170> out<00:01:55.290> really<00:01:55.350> well

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
it at all so that worked out really well

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.780 
it at all so that worked out really well
what<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.540> did<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.079> took<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.320> Dremel<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.070> I

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
what I did is I took the Dremel and I

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.840 
what I did is I took the Dremel and I
cut<00:02:00.090> out<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.780> little<00:02:01.680> spot<00:02:02.009> for<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.340> radio<00:02:02.640> so

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
cut out a little spot for the radio so

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.179 
cut out a little spot for the radio so
the<00:02:02.969> radio<00:02:03.240> sits<00:02:03.540> down<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.780> lot<00:02:04.079> lower<00:02:04.290> instead

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
the radio sits down a lot lower instead

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.760 
the radio sits down a lot lower instead
of<00:02:05.219> me<00:02:05.430> having<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.790> reach<00:02:06.090> for<00:02:06.780> eons<00:02:07.170> trying<00:02:07.649> to

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
of me having to reach for eons trying to

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.410 
of me having to reach for eons trying to
reach<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:08.160> radio<00:02:08.550> with<00:02:08.700> how<00:02:08.819> much<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.179> change

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
reach this radio with how much I change

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.470 
reach this radio with how much I change
music<00:02:09.929> so<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.170> put<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.619> down<00:02:10.800> here<00:02:11.160> it's<00:02:12.090> much

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
music so I put that down here it's much

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.790 
music so I put that down here it's much
easier<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.959> get<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.379> because

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
easier to get to because

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.040
