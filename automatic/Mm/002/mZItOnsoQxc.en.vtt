overzealous and I'll just run out there
and<00:00:47.760> die<00:00:48.000> usually<00:00:48.539> but<00:00:48.780> in<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:48.989> one<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.440> stayed

where<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.210> really<00:00:54.329> could<00:00:54.539> have<00:00:54.629> went<00:00:54.750> either

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
where it really could have went either

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.229

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
way and I could have died but I ended up

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.849 
way and I could have died but I ended up
getting<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.570> kill<00:00:57.750> anyway<00:00:58.109> without<00:00:58.410> dying

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859

is<00:01:05.909> fun<00:01:06.619> but<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.650> still<00:01:07.920> prefer<00:01:08.159> domination<00:01:08.939> to

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
is fun but I still prefer domination to

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.420 
is fun but I still prefer domination to
it<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.420> know<00:01:09.540> one<00:01:09.750> hundred<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.110> one

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
it you know one hundred to one

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.530 
it you know one hundred to one
domination<00:01:11.430> really<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.909> best<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.299> get<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
domination really is the best to get the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.000 
domination really is the best to get the
really<00:01:12.750> high<00:01:12.900> scoring<00:01:13.260> game<00:01:13.350> play<00:01:13.740> scope

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
really high scoring game play scope

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.340 
really high scoring game play scope
confirmed<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.909> can<00:01:15.180> but<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.570> really<00:01:15.689> depends

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
confirmed you can but it really depends

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.080 
confirmed you can but it really depends
a<00:01:16.530> lot<00:01:17.009> on<00:01:17.070> your<00:01:17.220> teammates<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.820> how<00:01:17.880> fast

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
a lot on your teammates and how fast

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.520 
a lot on your teammates and how fast
they<00:01:18.270> pick<00:01:18.450> up<00:01:18.570> tags<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.110> really<00:01:19.380> like

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
they pick up tags so I really like

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.160 
they pick up tags so I really like
domination<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.220> lot<00:01:20.400> more<00:01:20.670> but<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.810> just<00:01:21.960> wanted

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
domination a lot more but I just wanted

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.450 
domination a lot more but I just wanted
to<00:01:22.259> talk<00:01:22.409> about<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.770> vector<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.100> little<00:01:23.340> bit

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
to talk about the vector a little bit

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.340 
to talk about the vector a little bit
because<00:01:23.670> at<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.780> start<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.170> game

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
because at the start of the game

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.840 
because at the start of the game
whenever<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.799> first<00:01:25.920> whenever<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.549> game<00:01:26.700> was

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
whenever the first whenever the game was

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.920 
whenever the first whenever the game was
first<00:01:27.030> released<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:28.250> really<00:01:29.689> didn't<00:01:30.689> like<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
first released I really didn't like the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.710 
first released I really didn't like the
vector<00:01:31.530> at<00:01:31.799> all<00:01:32.040> like<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.909> used<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.509> get<00:01:33.570> my

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
vector at all like I used it to get my

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.899 
vector at all like I used it to get my
diamond<00:01:34.110> camos<00:01:34.470> for<00:01:34.710> my<00:01:34.799> submachine<00:01:35.400> guns<00:01:35.640> and

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
diamond camos for my submachine guns and

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.120 
diamond camos for my submachine guns and
then<00:01:36.000> from<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.180> point<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.990> really<00:01:37.710> didn't

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
then from that point on I really didn't

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.370 
then from that point on I really didn't
touch<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.400> because<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.329> just<00:01:39.509> hated<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.320> much

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
touch it because I just hated it so much

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.319 
touch it because I just hated it so much
because<00:01:41.220> when<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.520> played<00:01:41.820> with<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.090> at<00:01:42.210> the

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
because when I played with it at the

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.760 
because when I played with it at the
start<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.720> game<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.140> just<00:01:43.170> felt<00:01:43.500> like<00:01:43.619> I

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
start of the game it just felt like I

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.789 
start of the game it just felt like I
couldn't<00:01:44.130> get<00:01:44.220> anything<00:01:44.490> going<00:01:44.939> with<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.450> and

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
couldn't get anything going with it and

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.289 
couldn't get anything going with it and
maybe<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:46.979> was<00:01:47.100> because<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.060> skill

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
maybe that was because of the skill

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.850 
maybe that was because of the skill
based<00:01:48.450> matchmaking<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:49.259> really<00:01:49.530> couldn't<00:01:49.770> get

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
used to it it really was something that

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.410 
used to it it really was something that
I<00:01:53.040> had<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.430> get<00:01:53.579> used<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:54.000> scho<00:01:54.240> based

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.149 
I had to get used to scho based
matchmaking<00:01:54.600> was<00:01:55.229> something<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:55.890> had<00:01:56.070> to

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
matchmaking was something that I had to

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.980 
matchmaking was something that I had to
adjust<00:01:56.310> my<00:01:56.759> play<00:01:57.000> style<00:01:57.299> in<00:01:57.509> public<00:01:57.810> matches

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
adjust my play style in public matches

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.749 
adjust my play style in public matches
too<00:01:58.350> because<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.219> people<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.640> was

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
too because the people that I was

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.819 
too because the people that I was
playing<00:02:00.030> against<00:02:00.299> weren't<00:02:00.719> completely<00:02:01.170> asked

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
playing against weren't completely asked

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.260 
playing against weren't completely asked
all<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.040> time<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.549> think<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.909> they<00:02:03.030> sort

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
all the time and I think that they sort

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.510 
all the time and I think that they sort
of<00:02:03.360> took<00:02:03.600> out<00:02:03.750> skill<00:02:04.049> based<00:02:04.229> matchmaking<00:02:04.740> I'm

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
to me and it's just something I've been

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.270 
to me and it's just something I've been
wanting<00:02:52.170> to<00:02:52.200> know<00:02:52.380> for<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.620> while<00:02:52.829> because<00:02:53.099> it

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
wanting to know for a while because it

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.069 
wanting to know for a while because it
seems<00:02:53.489> like<00:02:53.519> they<00:02:53.700> did<00:02:53.880> switch<00:02:54.120> it<00:02:54.269> but<00:02:54.930> back

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
seems like they did switch it but back

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:56.690 
seems like they did switch it but back
to<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.349> vector<00:02:55.530> so<00:02:55.799> I<00:02:55.829> used<00:02:56.190> it<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.459> get<00:02:56.549> my

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
to the vector so I used it to get my

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.440 
to the vector so I used it to get my
diamond<00:02:57.120> camos<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:58.190> it<00:02:59.190> really<00:02:59.519> I<00:02:59.879> don't<00:03:00.299> know

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
diamond camos and it really I don't know

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.000 
diamond camos and it really I don't know
I<00:03:00.480> just<00:03:00.569> wouldn't<00:03:00.989> get<00:03:01.079> the<00:03:01.230> job<00:03:01.440> done<00:03:01.680> for<00:03:01.890> me

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
I just wouldn't get the job done for me

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.979 
I just wouldn't get the job done for me
I<00:03:02.040> felt<00:03:02.280> like<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.549> kill<00:03:02.790> time<00:03:03.060> was<00:03:03.299> very<00:03:03.599> slow

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
I felt like the kill time was very slow

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.050 
I felt like the kill time was very slow
on<00:03:04.019> it<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.950> fire<00:03:05.160> rate<00:03:05.430> was<00:03:05.579> really<00:03:05.879> high

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
on it the fire rate was really high

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.880 
on it the fire rate was really high
which<00:03:06.450> made<00:03:07.049> no<00:03:07.200> sense<00:03:07.410> I<00:03:07.590> was<00:03:07.680> like<00:03:07.769> at<00:03:07.860> the

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
which made no sense I was like at the

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.130 
which made no sense I was like at the
fire<00:03:08.099> rates<00:03:08.370> this<00:03:08.579> high<00:03:08.819> why<00:03:09.599> is<00:03:09.660> it<00:03:09.840> taking<00:03:09.959> so

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
fire rates this high why is it taking so

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.199 
fire rates this high why is it taking so
long<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.470> kill<00:03:10.890> it's<00:03:11.579> sort<00:03:11.819> of<00:03:11.849> like<00:03:11.970> a<00:03:12.000> square

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
long to kill it's sort of like a square

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.819 
long to kill it's sort of like a square
peon<00:03:12.660> but<00:03:12.810> it's<00:03:12.930> a<00:03:13.019> little<00:03:13.140> bit<00:03:13.260> weaker<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:13.799> it

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
peon but it's a little bit weaker and it

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.880 
peon but it's a little bit weaker and it
doesn't<00:03:14.129> have<00:03:14.220> that<00:03:15.079> not<00:03:16.079> that<00:03:16.379> high<00:03:16.620> of<00:03:16.799> a

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
doesn't have that not that high of a

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
don't know why I feel like I run out of

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.390 
don't know why I feel like I run out of
bullets<00:04:39.199> a<00:04:39.289> lot<00:04:39.440> and<00:04:39.620> sometimes<00:04:39.860> I<00:04:40.190> feel<00:04:40.340> like

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
bullets a lot and sometimes I feel like

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.129 
bullets a lot and sometimes I feel like
it's<00:04:40.610> inconsistent<00:04:40.910> burst<00:04:41.360> guns<00:04:41.630> sometimes

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
it's inconsistent burst guns sometimes

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:43.480 
it's inconsistent burst guns sometimes
they're<00:04:42.320> just<00:04:42.350> really<00:04:42.740> inconsistent<00:04:42.860> for

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
they're just really inconsistent for

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.249 
they're just really inconsistent for
some<00:04:43.669> reason<00:04:43.970> just<00:04:44.120> because<00:04:44.630> it's<00:04:45.110> like<00:04:45.199> a

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:45.259 
some reason just because it's like a

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:47.590 
some reason just because it's like a
battle<00:04:45.710> rifle<00:04:45.979> in<00:04:46.070> Halo<00:04:46.370> when<00:04:46.520> you<00:04:46.610> shoot<00:04:46.940> all

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
battle rifle in Halo when you shoot all

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.150 
battle rifle in Halo when you shoot all
the<00:04:47.870> bullets<00:04:47.900> don't<00:04:48.440> get<00:04:48.620> there<00:04:48.770> at<00:04:48.860> the<00:04:48.949> same

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
the bullets don't get there at the same

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.710 
the bullets don't get there at the same
time<00:04:49.460> and<00:04:49.699> sometimes<00:04:50.000> it's<00:04:50.180> like<00:04:50.270> a<00:04:50.330> split

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
time and sometimes it's like a split

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.749 
time and sometimes it's like a split
second<00:04:51.139> they<00:04:51.259> dodge<00:04:51.500> it<00:04:51.770> like<00:04:52.100> by<00:04:52.460> a

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:52.759 
second they dodge it like by a

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.820 
second they dodge it like by a
millisecond<00:04:53.570> and<00:04:53.720> it<00:04:54.259> doesn't<00:04:54.620> end<00:04:54.770> up

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
millisecond and it doesn't end up

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.040 
millisecond and it doesn't end up
getting<00:04:55.100> you<00:04:55.190> the<00:04:55.310> kill<00:04:55.580> for<00:04:56.300> it<00:04:56.360> because<00:04:56.780> you

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
getting you the kill for it because you

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.330 
getting you the kill for it because you

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
guns really aren't my thing unless it's

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.240 
guns really aren't my thing unless it's
an<00:05:02.449> m8<00:05:02.780> that<00:05:02.960> mates<00:05:03.229> are<00:05:03.380> really<00:05:03.620> good<00:05:03.740> /<00:05:03.949> stun

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
an m8 that mates are really good / stun

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.409 
an m8 that mates are really good / stun
but<00:05:05.090> um<00:05:05.590> using<00:05:06.590> select<00:05:06.889> fire<00:05:07.130> on<00:05:07.400> guns<00:05:08.090> like

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
but um using select fire on guns like

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.480 
but um using select fire on guns like
using<00:05:08.960> select<00:05:09.350> fire<00:05:09.560> on<00:05:09.770> a<00:05:09.830> tight<00:05:10.010> 25<00:05:10.460> I

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
using select fire on a tight 25 I

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.070 
using select fire on a tight 25 I
wouldn't<00:05:11.000> be<00:05:11.060> able<00:05:11.150> to<00:05:11.270> do<00:05:11.479> which<00:05:11.780> I've<00:05:11.900> seen

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
wouldn't be able to do which I've seen

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.529 
wouldn't be able to do which I've seen
people<00:05:12.350> do<00:05:12.440> in<00:05:12.530> the<00:05:12.590> past<00:05:12.789> but<00:05:13.789> other<00:05:14.240> things

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
people do in the past but other things

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:17.050 
people do in the past but other things
just<00:05:14.660> like<00:05:15.020> that<00:05:15.229> I<00:05:15.260> just<00:05:15.860> burst<00:05:16.280> guns<00:05:16.550> I<00:05:16.910> don't

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
just like that I just burst guns I don't

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.730 
just like that I just burst guns I don't
know<00:05:17.330> they're<00:05:17.660> not<00:05:17.780> that<00:05:17.990> good<00:05:18.169> to<00:05:18.320> me<00:05:18.440> but

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
know they're not that good to me but

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.230 
know they're not that good to me but
like<00:05:18.919> the<00:05:19.070> vector<00:05:19.340> was<00:05:19.460> under<00:05:19.729> that<00:05:19.880> so<00:05:20.090> now

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
like the vector was under that so now

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.689 
like the vector was under that so now
you<00:05:20.300> just<00:05:20.660> see<00:05:20.870> how<00:05:21.560> much<00:05:21.770> I<00:05:21.979> dislike<00:05:22.280> the

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:22.699 
you just see how much I dislike the

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:24.129 
you just see how much I dislike the
vector<00:05:23.000> at<00:05:23.060> the<00:05:23.180> start<00:05:23.389> of<00:05:23.449> the<00:05:23.539> game<00:05:23.720> and<00:05:23.930> it

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 
vector at the start of the game and it

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:25.900 
vector at the start of the game and it
really<00:05:24.320> has<00:05:24.530> grown<00:05:24.800> on<00:05:24.949> me<00:05:25.099> I<00:05:25.130> really<00:05:25.639> do<00:05:25.759> enjoy

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
really has grown on me I really do enjoy

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.719 
really has grown on me I really do enjoy
using<00:05:26.300> it<00:05:26.479> now<00:05:26.630> and<00:05:26.930> I'm<00:05:27.740> still<00:05:28.190> gonna<00:05:28.370> use<00:05:28.490> it

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
using it now and I'm still gonna use it

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:31.210 
using it now and I'm still gonna use it
a<00:05:28.820> little<00:05:28.970> bit<00:05:29.150> but<00:05:29.360> not<00:05:29.509> as<00:05:29.660> much<00:05:29.840> you<00:05:30.650> know<00:05:30.800> in

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
a little bit but not as much you know in

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.379 
a little bit but not as much you know in
my<00:05:31.520> my<00:05:32.180> honesty<00:05:32.750> being<00:05:33.590> honest<00:05:34.010> I<00:05:34.310> still<00:05:34.849> like

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
my my honesty being honest I still like

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.330 
my my honesty being honest I still like
the<00:05:35.599> other<00:05:35.630> guns<00:05:36.020> a<00:05:36.229> lot<00:05:36.440> more<00:05:36.740> than<00:05:36.979> this<00:05:37.099> one

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
the other guns a lot more than this one

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.010 
the other guns a lot more than this one
but<00:05:37.580> it<00:05:37.760> definitely<00:05:37.940> has<00:05:38.330> grown<00:05:38.660> on<00:05:38.840> me<00:05:38.990> a

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
but it definitely has grown on me a

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.750 
but it definitely has grown on me a
little<00:05:39.260> bit<00:05:39.410> and<00:05:39.949> I<00:05:40.070> don't<00:05:40.130> hate<00:05:40.430> it<00:05:40.580> anymore

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
little bit and I don't hate it anymore

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.920 
little bit and I don't hate it anymore
so<00:05:41.090> you<00:05:41.180> know<00:05:41.300> that<00:05:41.510> is<00:05:41.660> always<00:05:42.020> good<00:05:42.789> but<00:05:43.789> uh

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:47.949 
like I said I end up finishing 68 No and

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:51.339 
like I said I end up finishing 68 No and
drone<00:05:48.949> is<00:05:49.280> really<00:05:49.639> nadeshot<00:05:50.539> pointed<00:05:51.260> this

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:51.349
