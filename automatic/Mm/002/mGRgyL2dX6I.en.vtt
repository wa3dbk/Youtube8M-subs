but<00:01:55.880> this<00:01:56.880> looked<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.270> little<00:01:57.390> more<00:01:57.630> serious

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
but this looked a little more serious

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.600 
but this looked a little more serious
and<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.200> think<00:01:58.439> more<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.710> for<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.460> he

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
and I think more and for that he

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.600 
and I think more and for that he
confessed<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.420> was<00:02:00.540> consensual<00:02:00.899> sex

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
confessed that it was consensual sex

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.149 
confessed that it was consensual sex
that's<00:02:02.610> that's<00:02:02.939> something<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.950> was<00:02:04.950> pretty

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159
