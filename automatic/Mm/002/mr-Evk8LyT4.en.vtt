00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
that that's my favorite as some people

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.430 
that that's my favorite as some people
say<00:02:10.850> they<00:02:11.330> don't<00:02:11.360> know<00:02:11.630> how<00:02:11.750> we<00:02:11.810> do<00:02:12.020> what<00:02:12.140> we<00:02:12.260> do

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
say they don't know how we do what we do

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.900 
say they don't know how we do what we do
and<00:02:12.680> it's<00:02:13.070> a<00:02:13.130> magic<00:02:13.430> that<00:02:13.580> even<00:02:13.820> though

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
and it's a magic that even though

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.250 
and it's a magic that even though
everyone<00:02:14.420> here<00:02:14.630> is<00:02:14.780> very<00:02:14.810> talented

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
everyone here is very talented

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:32.640 
everyone here is very talented
individually<00:02:16.010> it's<00:02:16.130> a<00:02:16.190> magic<00:02:16.490> that<00:02:16.640> we<00:02:16.730> can

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.790 

what<00:02:33.650> chapter<00:02:33.890> six<00:02:34.130> certainly<00:02:34.520> does<00:02:34.730> have<00:02:34.940> a

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
what chapter six certainly does have a

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.370 
what chapter six certainly does have a
purpose<00:02:36.800> in<00:02:37.220> a<00:02:37.940> style<00:02:38.540> that<00:02:38.840> I<00:02:38.870> think

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
purpose in a style that I think

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.350 
purpose in a style that I think
definitely<00:02:39.740> makes<00:02:40.070> me<00:02:40.190> different<00:02:40.430> from<00:02:40.910> from

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
definitely makes me different from from

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:51.040 
definitely makes me different from from
the<00:02:41.480> top<00:02:41.660> names<00:02:41.990> in<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:43.040> a<00:02:43.100> cappella<00:02:43.220> industry

students about you know we're not famous

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:07.069 
students about you know we're not famous
but<00:04:04.620> we<00:04:05.040> still<00:04:05.400> hold<00:04:06.209> for<00:04:06.450> a<00:04:06.480> living<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:06.870> we<00:04:06.959> do

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
but we still hold for a living and we do

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:13.520 
but we still hold for a living and we do
it<00:04:07.169> full-time<00:04:07.409> and<00:04:07.950> you<00:04:08.370> don't<00:04:08.549> have<00:04:08.730> to<00:04:12.530> I

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
it full-time and you don't have to I

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.319 
it full-time and you don't have to I
think<00:04:13.980> initially<00:04:14.159> we<00:04:14.489> started<00:04:14.819> the<00:04:14.909> band<00:04:15.090> to

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
think initially we started the band to

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.830 
think initially we started the band to
simply<00:04:15.599> see<00:04:15.780> if<00:04:15.900> we<00:04:16.019> could<00:04:16.259> make<00:04:16.949> a<00:04:16.979> living<00:04:17.310> at

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
simply see if we could make a living at

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.339 
simply see if we could make a living at
producing<00:04:18.840> quality<00:04:19.799> acapella<00:04:20.729> concerts<00:04:21.359> and

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
producing quality acapella concerts and

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:23.450 
producing quality acapella concerts and
now<00:04:22.530> that<00:04:22.680> we've<00:04:22.830> been<00:04:23.039> doing<00:04:23.220> that

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
now that we've been doing that

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.800 
now that we've been doing that
successfully<00:04:23.789> for<00:04:24.210> a<00:04:24.240> period<00:04:24.509> of<00:04:24.570> time<00:04:24.750> I

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
successfully for a period of time I

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.689 
successfully for a period of time I
think<00:04:25.050> we've<00:04:25.590> had<00:04:25.740> to<00:04:25.860> kind<00:04:26.130> of<00:04:26.160> regroup<00:04:26.310> and

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
think we've had to kind of regroup and

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.189 
think we've had to kind of regroup and
think<00:04:26.880> about<00:04:27.060> what<00:04:27.300> where<00:04:27.720> do<00:04:27.810> we<00:04:27.900> want<00:04:28.050> to<00:04:28.080> go

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
think about what where do we want to go

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:30.500 
think about what where do we want to go
now<00:04:28.349> as<00:04:28.470> a<00:04:28.560> band<00:04:28.800> I<00:04:29.039> think<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:29.760> goals<00:04:30.000> for

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
now as a band I think the goals for

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.230 
now as a band I think the goals for
myself<00:04:30.630> from<00:04:30.990> the<00:04:31.199> group<00:04:31.409> is<00:04:31.620> just<00:04:31.830> to<00:04:32.030> step<00:04:33.030> up

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
myself from the group is just to step up

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.180 
myself from the group is just to step up
a<00:04:33.300> little<00:04:33.539> musically<00:04:33.990> and<00:04:34.169> just<00:04:34.320> making

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
a little musically and just making

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.760 
a little musically and just making

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
doing that there's just something about

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.760 
doing that there's just something about
the<00:04:39.270> family<00:04:39.630> in<00:04:39.690> Chapter<00:04:39.960> six<00:04:40.199> you<00:04:40.320> look<00:04:40.620> down
