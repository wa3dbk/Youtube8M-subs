it by here the reason why I'm doing this

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.540 
it by here the reason why I'm doing this
is<00:01:01.140> sometimes<00:01:01.350> we<00:01:01.739> have<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.890> little<00:01:02.129> bit<00:01:02.309> fine

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
is sometimes we have a little bit fine

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.119 
is sometimes we have a little bit fine
lines<00:01:02.879> underneath<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.539> eyes<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.890> makeup

lines underneath the eyes and the makeup

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.270 
lines underneath the eyes and the makeup
tends<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.760> get<00:01:06.450> creased<00:01:06.840> underneath<00:01:07.650> there<00:01:07.950> so

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
tends to get creased underneath there so

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.640 
tends to get creased underneath there so
