00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.390 

this<00:00:05.740> is<00:00:05.920> peugeot<00:00:06.430> 3008<00:00:07.420> hybrid<00:00:08.290> 4<00:00:08.650> and<00:00:08.950> the

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:09.400 
this is peugeot 3008 hybrid 4 and the

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.089 
this is peugeot 3008 hybrid 4 and the
clue<00:00:09.700> is<00:00:09.730> in<00:00:09.969> the<00:00:10.000> name<00:00:10.410> hybrid<00:00:11.410> meaning

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:12.099 
clue is in the name hybrid meaning

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:14.879 
clue is in the name hybrid meaning
hybrid<00:00:12.730> obviously<00:00:13.150> but<00:00:13.900> for<00:00:14.260> standing<00:00:14.769> for

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:14.889 
hybrid obviously but for standing for

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:16.440 
hybrid obviously but for standing for
four<00:00:15.099> wheel<00:00:15.340> drive<00:00:15.730> and<00:00:15.969> the<00:00:16.059> clever<00:00:16.360> bit

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:16.450 
four wheel drive and the clever bit

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.839 
four wheel drive and the clever bit
about<00:00:16.750> this<00:00:16.990> car<00:00:17.320> is<00:00:17.529> that<00:00:17.860> the<00:00:18.189> diesel<00:00:18.580> engine

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:18.849 
about this car is that the diesel engine

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:21.060 
about this car is that the diesel engine
powers<00:00:19.270> the<00:00:19.300> front<00:00:19.660> wheels<00:00:19.869> and<00:00:20.230> the<00:00:20.680> electric

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
powers the front wheels and the electric

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.640 
powers the front wheels and the electric
motor<00:00:21.190> powers<00:00:21.699> the<00:00:21.730> rear<00:00:22.060> wheels<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:23.500> what

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
motor powers the rear wheels so what

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.500 
motor powers the rear wheels so what
that<00:00:23.680> means<00:00:24.070> is<00:00:24.340> you've<00:00:24.940> got<00:00:25.119> four-wheel

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.510 
that means is you've got four-wheel

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.630 
that means is you've got four-wheel
drive<00:00:25.840> if<00:00:26.140> and<00:00:26.289> when<00:00:26.410> you<00:00:26.439> need<00:00:26.740> it<00:00:27.010> a<00:00:27.189> bit<00:00:27.520> of

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
drive if and when you need it a bit of

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.550 
drive if and when you need it a bit of
extra<00:00:27.910> shove<00:00:28.240> from<00:00:28.390> the<00:00:28.570> electric<00:00:28.960> motor<00:00:29.140> for

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
extra shove from the electric motor for

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.980 
extra shove from the electric motor for
acceleration<00:00:30.039> and<00:00:30.910> it<00:00:31.029> can<00:00:31.180> even<00:00:31.300> operate<00:00:31.689> in

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
acceleration and it can even operate in

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.680 
acceleration and it can even operate in
electric-only<00:00:32.590> mode<00:00:33.449> now<00:00:34.449> this<00:00:34.629> is

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
electric-only mode now this is

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.420 
electric-only mode now this is
production<00:00:35.080> reality<00:00:35.710> so<00:00:35.920> we're<00:00:36.070> going<00:00:36.159> to<00:00:36.250> see

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
production reality so we're going to see

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.399 
production reality so we're going to see
this<00:00:36.580> car<00:00:36.850> in<00:00:37.000> the<00:00:37.120> summer<00:00:37.390> but<00:00:38.110> it's<00:00:38.260> not

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:38.409 
this car in the summer but it's not

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:40.530 
this car in the summer but it's not
going<00:00:38.500> to<00:00:38.589> be<00:00:38.710> cheap<00:00:38.739> around<00:00:39.430> 25,000<00:00:40.390> pounds

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
going to be cheap around 25,000 pounds

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.649 
going to be cheap around 25,000 pounds
we<00:00:40.839> think<00:00:41.080> this<00:00:41.949> peugeot<00:00:42.460> 3008<00:00:43.150> is<00:00:43.510> the

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:43.659 
we think this peugeot 3008 is the

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:45.689 
we think this peugeot 3008 is the
world's<00:00:44.019> first<00:00:44.229> production<00:00:44.680> diesel<00:00:45.460> hybrid

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
world's first production diesel hybrid

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:48.000 
world's first production diesel hybrid
so<00:00:46.629> it's<00:00:46.930> going<00:00:47.140> to<00:00:47.199> claim<00:00:47.440> some<00:00:47.710> really

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
so it's going to claim some really

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.579 
so it's going to claim some really
impressive<00:00:48.220> figures<00:00:48.760> such<00:00:49.030> as<00:00:49.080> 74<00:00:50.080> miles<00:00:50.350> to

the gallon and ninety nine grams of co2

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.859 
the gallon and ninety nine grams of co2
per<00:00:53.260> kilometer<00:00:54.040> for<00:00:54.850> such<00:00:55.000> a<00:00:55.030> big<00:00:55.299> car<00:00:55.600> that's

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:55.869 
per kilometer for such a big car that's

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:57.390
