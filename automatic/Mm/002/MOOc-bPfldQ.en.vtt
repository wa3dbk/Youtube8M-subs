 of my own and which is one of the 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.090
 cars from the brazilian neighborhood 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.069
 now in this world of the rodeo we know 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:56.640
 which is a very strong competition is a 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:58.769
 space you have to get from you 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.519
 What is the biggest difficulty in the world today? 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.250
 of the rodeo 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.620
 look at all work all activity 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.319
 there are professionals against the 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.970
 script is different there is there are 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.750
 difficulties we face in the day 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.579
 on the day 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.609
 there are barriers that are sometimes 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:19.169
 created by professionals of the 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:21.299
 rodeo but it's in those 26 years of rodeo 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:24.329
 God gave me wisdom and balance 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:27.419
 to manage this and take into account 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:29.250
 front and back again presented a 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:32.700
 good job depends on a good 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.799
 sound quality that a good sound a 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.209
 good team that I have to accompany me 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:40.079
 life answers to make this work 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:42.750
 and is in good health emotionally 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:44.129
 to be able to transmit to people that 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.959
 that we have what we learn 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.449
 during these twenty-six years the 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:53.250
 right now for us is that close the 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:55.260
 reverse the verse of the rodeo and a poem 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.480
 This is for you, and I'm going home. 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.639
 I have serious drunken system dilemma 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.739
 that I want to live in everything I do is the 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:03.930
 month is a problem to solve 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.980
 but thus volunteering to fight without 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.660
 go back 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.849
 to be honest and tell the truth and 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.889
 Honesty is hard to win. 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.019
 I see friends passing by where I 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:14.879
 I intend one day to come but to follow. 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.199
 I dishonestly say them frankly 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.970
 I'd rather stay 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:20.370
 I'd rather be bond than those who pass by. 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.300
 cat bed of those who fall if I 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.610
 do not get where many arrive 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.740
 I have celebrated amparos that have been regressing 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.389
 always consulting my pillow I think 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.580
 that 's how I'm acting not 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.370
 I have greed I do not want riches 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.650
 I just want to fulfill my duty I do not use 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.470
 weapons in my defense and those of nobility 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.650
 will defend me and the one who rules all 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:44.229
 God nature will send the prize that I 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.879
 deserving the position was a civilian 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:50.620
 matheus liked this 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:52.900
 he is very good to the verse there is has 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.210
 three things fate if God gives me I 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.789
 I wanted to find a long-sleeved 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.240
 farm in the bay a woman from the bush 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:03.879
 thick to give me affection every day 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.819
 Evangeline sees herself in Porto Alegre 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:10.270
 north made a detour opening 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:12.699

 A big hug for you for everything. 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:40.479
 viewer of the overall balance sheet for 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:42.779
 the population of confresa I have been with 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:45.849
 arrested in an interview with an FM radio station 

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:48.610
 Very happy, I was very well received. 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:51.430
 I hope to be there with you doing 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.620
 Confresa and rodeos and the Douro region 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.620
 only to end the legion of thought 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.529
 God grant me serenity to accept the 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:02.349
 things I can not change courage 

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:05.229
 to change what you can and wisdom to 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:06.969
 recognize the difference by closing with 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:09.909
 golden key in the interview that night 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:13.620
 is that there are no images and matheus cláudio 

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:13.620
 tavares for the balance sheet now
