I<00:00:03.529> really<00:00:04.529> do<00:00:04.950> believe<00:00:05.130> that<00:00:05.629> examining<00:00:06.629> ism

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
I think it has financial personal and

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.490 
I think it has financial personal and
professional<00:00:14.130> benefits<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.330> I<00:00:16.080> would

and<00:00:49.590> saved<00:00:49.800> throughout<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.250> year<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.579> that's

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
and saved throughout the year so that's

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.000 
and saved throughout the year so that's
that's<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.120> big<00:00:51.539> benefit<00:00:51.960> but<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.590> do<00:00:52.710> think

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
that's a big benefit but I do think

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.319 
that's a big benefit but I do think
there<00:00:53.190> are<00:00:53.340> personal<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.210> professional

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
there are personal and professional

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.049 
there are personal and professional
benefits<00:00:55.170> as<00:00:55.350> well<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.739> certainly<00:00:56.550> make<00:00:57.030> it

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
benefits as well that certainly make it

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.479 
benefits as well that certainly make it
a<00:00:57.300> more<00:00:57.420> attractive<00:00:57.539> prospect<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.620> think<00:00:59.250> also

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
a more attractive prospect I think also

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.910 
a more attractive prospect I think also
the<00:01:00.210> opportunity<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.930> look<00:01:01.050> at<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.230> range<00:01:01.530> of

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
the opportunity to look at a range of

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.090 
the opportunity to look at a range of
papers<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.760> really<00:01:03.510> helpful<00:01:04.019> because<00:01:04.619> you

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
papers is really helpful because you

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.340 
papers is really helpful because you
don't<00:01:06.000> actually<00:01:06.210> know<00:01:06.510> what<00:01:06.689> your<00:01:06.960> students

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
don't actually know what your students

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.020 
don't actually know what your students
doing<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.650> an<00:01:07.740> exam<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.220> think<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.880> do

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
doing in an exam you think you do

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.149 
doing in an exam you think you do
because<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.720> do<00:01:09.990> mock<00:01:10.170> exams<00:01:10.560> but<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:10.979> don't

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
because you do mock exams but you don't

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.280 
because you do mock exams but you don't
know<00:01:11.340> how<00:01:11.850> how<00:01:12.360> they<00:01:12.510> behave<00:01:12.840> once<00:01:13.140> they're

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
know how how they behave once they're

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.810 
know how how they behave once they're
under<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.619> additional<00:01:14.100> pressure<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.700> and

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
under that additional pressure and and

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.749 
under that additional pressure and and
seeing<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.689> breadth<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.890> exam<00:01:17.220> papers<00:01:17.610> you

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
seeing a breadth of exam papers you

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.260 
seeing a breadth of exam papers you
recognise<00:01:19.460> frequent<00:01:20.460> errors<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.090> can

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
recognise frequent errors and you can

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.420 
recognise frequent errors and you can
guide<00:01:21.479> your<00:01:21.720> own<00:01:21.750> students<00:01:22.350> against<00:01:23.250> making

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
guide your own students against making

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.090 
guide your own students against making
those<00:01:23.759> errors<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.270> think<00:01:24.990> as<00:01:25.140> well<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.890> there

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
those errors I think as well that there

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.550 
those errors I think as well that there
is<00:01:26.220> definite<00:01:26.640> CPD<00:01:27.240> opportunities<00:01:28.140> available

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
is definite CPD opportunities available

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.780 
is definite CPD opportunities available
to<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.920> if<00:01:29.009> you've<00:01:29.130> been<00:01:29.280> examining

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
to you if you've been examining

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.350 
to you if you've been examining
certainly<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.720> can<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.259> can<00:01:31.920> offer<00:01:32.360> training

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
certainly you can you can offer training

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.429 
certainly you can you can offer training
sessions<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.750> people<00:01:34.049> within<00:01:34.170> your<00:01:34.259> own

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
sessions to people within your own

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.630 
sessions to people within your own
department<00:01:35.009> about<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.400> because

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
department about it because

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.969 
department about it because
theoretically<00:01:35.880> you're<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:37.170> expert<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.829> that

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
theoretically you're the expert in that

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.569 
theoretically you're the expert in that
in<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.220> particular<00:01:38.549> paper<00:01:40.009> doing<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.189> can

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
in that particular paper doing that can

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.550 
in that particular paper doing that can
then<00:01:41.729> lead<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.479> other<00:01:42.780> opportunities<00:01:43.380> within

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
then lead to other opportunities within

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.499 
then lead to other opportunities within
the<00:01:43.740> school<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.009> think<00:01:44.369> because<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.640> show<00:01:44.939> an

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
the school I think because you show an

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.679 
the school I think because you show an
ability<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.350> confidence<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.920> perhaps

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
ability and a confidence that perhaps

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.399 
ability and a confidence that perhaps
senior<00:01:48.689> management<00:01:49.049> might<00:01:49.170> not<00:01:49.320> otherwise

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
senior management might not otherwise

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.889 
senior management might not otherwise
have<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.829> chance<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.280> see<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.670> think<00:01:51.119> if<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.750> can

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
have a chance to see I think if you can

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.450 
have a chance to see I think if you can
have<00:01:52.079> people<00:01:52.470> more<00:01:52.799> in<00:01:52.950> your<00:01:53.070> department

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
have people more in your department

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.830 
have people more in your department
marking<00:01:53.729> papers<00:01:53.880> sort<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.270> across<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.540> range

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
marking papers sort of across the range

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.090 
marking papers sort of across the range
of<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.049> papers<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.350> do<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.619> does<00:01:55.799> give<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.040> an

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
of the papers you do it does give you an

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.620 
of the papers you do it does give you an
increased<00:01:56.399> understanding<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.210> way<00:01:57.360> in

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
increased understanding of the way in

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.760 
increased understanding of the way in
which<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:58.530> entire<00:01:58.920> subject<00:01:59.880> works<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:01.140> so

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
which the entire subject works and so

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.109 
which the entire subject works and so
that's<00:02:01.950> useful<00:02:02.280> as<00:02:02.369> well<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.640> also<00:02:02.759> means<00:02:03.060> that

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
that's useful as well it also means that

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.980 
that's useful as well it also means that
when<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.390> do<00:02:03.509> mock<00:02:03.719> exams<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.560> you've<00:02:05.399> got<00:02:05.640> an

when you do mock exams and you've got an

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.600 
when you do mock exams and you've got an
expert<00:02:06.990> if<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.259> like<00:02:07.409> across<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:08.069> each<00:02:08.220> sort

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
expert if you like across in each sort

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.180 
expert if you like across in each sort
of<00:02:08.640> area<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.209> those<00:02:09.750> people<00:02:10.020> can<00:02:10.500> standardize

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
of area and those people can standardize

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.890 
of area and those people can standardize
other<00:02:11.489> people<00:02:11.849> within<00:02:11.970> your<00:02:12.090> department<00:02:12.720> now

if

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.860 
if
doing<00:02:13.400> that<00:02:13.550> you're<00:02:14.240> getting<00:02:14.420> much<00:02:14.660> more

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
doing that you're getting much more

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.710 
doing that you're getting much more
accurate<00:02:15.500> results<00:02:16.340> from<00:02:16.460> your<00:02:16.640> mock<00:02:16.790> exam<00:02:17.210> so

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
accurate results from your mock exam so

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.330 
accurate results from your mock exam so
your<00:02:18.110> data<00:02:18.320> that<00:02:18.650> you're<00:02:18.770> passing<00:02:18.980> on<00:02:19.190> to

your data that you're passing on to

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.650 
your data that you're passing on to
senior<00:02:19.640> management<00:02:19.880> is<00:02:20.150> again<00:02:20.420> much<00:02:20.630> more

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
senior management is again much more

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.180 
senior management is again much more
accurate<00:02:21.230> and<00:02:21.320> your<00:02:21.410> predictions<00:02:21.920> are<00:02:22.010> much

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
accurate and your predictions are much

accurate and your predictions are much
more<00:02:22.370> accurate<00:02:22.550> which<00:02:22.850> is<00:02:22.970> great<00:02:23.180> as<00:02:23.390> a<00:02:23.450> head

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
more accurate which is great as a head

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.090 
more accurate which is great as a head
of<00:02:23.780> faculty<00:02:24.170> because<00:02:24.440> you<00:02:24.530> can<00:02:24.650> show<00:02:24.860> that

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
of faculty because you can show that

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.220 
of faculty because you can show that
that<00:02:25.580> you<00:02:25.700> do<00:02:25.910> know<00:02:26.090> what<00:02:26.240> you're<00:02:26.270> doing<00:02:26.690> great

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
that you do know what you're doing great

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.110 
that you do know what you're doing great
for<00:02:27.500> students<00:02:27.920> because<00:02:28.190> they<00:02:28.370> then<00:02:28.610> have

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
for students because they then have

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.700 
for students because they then have
realistic<00:02:29.420> expectations<00:02:30.350> about<00:02:30.470> where

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
realistic expectations about where

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.250 
realistic expectations about where
they're<00:02:30.860> going<00:02:30.890> and<00:02:31.250> also<00:02:31.940> it's<00:02:32.780> good<00:02:33.020> because

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
they're going and also it's good because

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.110 
they're going and also it's good because
you<00:02:33.530> can<00:02:33.710> intervene<00:02:34.400> you<00:02:34.700> can<00:02:34.850> recognize

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
you can intervene you can recognize

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.850 
you can intervene you can recognize
those<00:02:35.480> groups<00:02:35.720> of<00:02:35.840> student<00:02:36.140> need<00:02:36.380> extra<00:02:36.710> help

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
those groups of student need extra help

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.370 
those groups of student need extra help
and<00:02:37.100> perhaps<00:02:37.280> that<00:02:38.180> teacher<00:02:38.510> that<00:02:38.750> that<00:02:39.080> knows

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
and perhaps that teacher that that knows

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.140 
and perhaps that teacher that that knows
that<00:02:39.560> paper<00:02:39.800> well<00:02:40.040> can<00:02:40.250> work<00:02:40.460> separately<00:02:41.030> with

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
that paper well can work separately with

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.030 
that paper well can work separately with
those<00:02:41.270> students<00:02:41.660> to<00:02:41.810> try<00:02:42.050> and<00:02:42.260> solve<00:02:42.830> those

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
those students to try and solve those

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.500 
those students to try and solve those
problems<00:02:43.430> before<00:02:43.550> they<00:02:43.790> even<00:02:43.910> get<00:02:44.150> into<00:02:44.390> the

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
problems before they even get into the

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.320 
problems before they even get into the
exam<00:02:44.750> I<00:02:45.020> think<00:02:45.800> it's<00:02:45.920> a<00:02:45.980> person<00:02:46.520> it's<00:02:46.850> useful

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
exam I think it's a person it's useful

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.930 
exam I think it's a person it's useful
to<00:02:47.360> like<00:02:47.960> I<00:02:48.200> feel<00:02:48.710> professionally<00:02:49.490> much<00:02:49.730> more

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
to like I feel professionally much more

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.880 
to like I feel professionally much more
confident<00:02:50.390> since<00:02:50.690> I've<00:02:50.840> been<00:02:51.020> working<00:02:51.410> for<00:02:51.590> a

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
confident since I've been working for a

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.400 
confident since I've been working for a
QA<00:02:52.220> and<00:02:52.580> working<00:02:53.180> closely<00:02:53.390> with<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:54.170> exam

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
QA and working closely with the exam

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.190 
QA and working closely with the exam
board<00:02:54.680> so<00:02:55.340> I<00:02:55.370> think<00:02:55.570> that<00:02:56.570> confidence<00:02:57.050> comes

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
board so I think that confidence comes

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.710 
board so I think that confidence comes
across<00:02:57.440> in<00:02:57.650> your<00:02:57.740> teaching<00:02:58.190> and<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.340> think<00:02:58.370> that

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
across in your teaching and I think that

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.760 
across in your teaching and I think that
inevitably<00:02:59.720> has<00:02:59.930> an<00:03:00.020> effect<00:03:00.290> on<00:03:00.470> on<00:03:00.650> your

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
inevitably has an effect on on your

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.710 
inevitably has an effect on on your
wider<00:03:00.980> life<00:03:01.250> as<00:03:01.430> well<00:03:01.550> you<00:03:01.760> feel<00:03:01.790> better<00:03:02.420> at

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
wider life as well you feel better at

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.300 
wider life as well you feel better at
your<00:03:02.840> job<00:03:03.020> if<00:03:03.200> you<00:03:03.290> like<00:03:03.320> and<00:03:03.740> that's<00:03:03.860> you<00:03:04.190> know

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
your job if you like and that's you know

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.650 
your job if you like and that's you know
that<00:03:04.430> can<00:03:04.580> only<00:03:04.700> be<00:03:04.850> a<00:03:04.880> very<00:03:05.090> good<00:03:05.270> thing

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
that can only be a very good thing

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.410 
that can only be a very good thing
and<00:03:05.750> it<00:03:06.380> certainly<00:03:07.010> has<00:03:07.610> helped<00:03:08.060> my<00:03:08.270> own

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
and it certainly has helped my own

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.780 
and it certainly has helped my own
career<00:03:08.780> development<00:03:08.840> I've<00:03:09.830> been<00:03:10.430> able<00:03:10.550> to

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
career development I've been able to

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.010 
career development I've been able to
develop<00:03:11.120> with<00:03:11.150> a<00:03:11.330> QA<00:03:11.600> but<00:03:11.660> I've<00:03:11.840> also

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
develop with a QA but I've also

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.900 
develop with a QA but I've also
developed<00:03:12.860> through<00:03:13.190> the<00:03:13.280> school<00:03:13.520> and<00:03:13.550> that's

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
developed through the school and that's

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.820 
developed through the school and that's
happened<00:03:14.270> in<00:03:14.390> line<00:03:14.600> with<00:03:14.840> with<00:03:15.110> the<00:03:15.530> work<00:03:15.680> that

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
happened in line with with the work that

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.470 
happened in line with with the work that
I've<00:03:15.920> done<00:03:15.950> for<00:03:16.220> a<00:03:16.280> QA<00:03:16.520> so<00:03:16.580> I<00:03:16.700> do<00:03:16.820> I<00:03:17.030> do<00:03:17.150> think

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
I've done for a QA so I do I do think

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.000 
I've done for a QA so I do I do think
that<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.660> to<00:03:17.840> have<00:03:18.140> had<00:03:18.560> that<00:03:18.740> sort<00:03:18.890> of

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
that the to have had that sort of

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.820 
that the to have had that sort of
organic<00:03:19.400> effect<00:03:19.700> on<00:03:19.910> each<00:03:20.060> other<00:03:20.300> I<00:03:20.570> really<00:03:21.230> do

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
organic effect on each other I really do

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.460
