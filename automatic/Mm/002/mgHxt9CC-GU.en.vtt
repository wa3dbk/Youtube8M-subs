washing<00:05:06.639> into<00:05:06.790> my<00:05:07.060> motor<00:05:08.280> looking<00:05:09.280> a<00:05:09.370> little

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
washing into my motor looking a little

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.780 
washing into my motor looking a little
closer<00:05:09.820> you<00:05:10.120> can<00:05:10.240> see<00:05:10.419> right<00:05:10.630> there<00:05:10.690> or<00:05:11.110> a

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
closer you can see right there or a

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.129 
closer you can see right there or a
connecting<00:05:12.790> rod<00:05:12.820> was<00:05:13.300> swinging<00:05:13.570> where<00:05:13.960> it

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
connecting rod was swinging where it

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:16.980 
connecting rod was swinging where it
wasn't<00:05:14.290> supposed<00:05:14.560> to<00:05:14.860> be<00:05:15.479> boat<00:05:16.479> put<00:05:16.720> a<00:05:16.750> hole<00:05:16.960> in

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
wasn't supposed to be boat put a hole in

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.290 
wasn't supposed to be boat put a hole in
it<00:05:17.350> there<00:05:17.500> I<00:05:19.979> think<00:05:20.979> maybe<00:05:21.220> we'll<00:05:21.669> set<00:05:22.060> this

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
it there I think maybe we'll set this

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.830 
it there I think maybe we'll set this
one<00:05:22.510> to<00:05:22.570> the<00:05:22.900> side<00:05:23.970> maybe<00:05:24.970> a<00:05:25.090> good<00:05:25.389> core<00:05:25.690> to

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
one to the side maybe a good core to

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.310 
one to the side maybe a good core to
make<00:05:25.870> a<00:05:26.169> custom<00:05:26.620> wheel<00:05:26.770> paying<00:05:27.100> someday<00:05:28.320> we've

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
make a custom wheel paying someday we've

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.320 
make a custom wheel paying someday we've
got<00:05:29.440> a<00:05:29.470> strikeout<00:05:30.010> number<00:05:30.430> two<00:05:30.669> on<00:05:30.970> the<00:05:31.120> oil

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
got a strikeout number two on the oil

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:37.159 
got a strikeout number two on the oil
pan<00:05:34.199> we<00:05:35.199> can<00:05:35.380> see<00:05:35.590> daylight<00:05:36.100> through<00:05:36.160> it

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
pan we can see daylight through it

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.490 
pan we can see daylight through it
that's<00:05:38.169> not<00:05:38.380> cool<00:05:38.440> I<00:05:39.570> think<00:05:40.570> I<00:05:40.690> got<00:05:40.840> one<00:05:41.139> more

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
that's not cool I think I got one more

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.800 
that's not cool I think I got one more
up<00:05:41.710> and<00:05:42.040> down<00:05:42.280> there<00:05:42.760> I'll<00:05:43.419> have<00:05:43.660> to

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
up and down there I'll have to

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.830 
up and down there I'll have to
investigate<00:05:44.410> that<00:05:44.620> one
