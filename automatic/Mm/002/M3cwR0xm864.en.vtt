00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.600
Industrial controller ATR121
Main features and functionalities

00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:14.000
In this video we show the Pixsys 32x74 mm PID control. ATR121.

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:16.409
The packaging

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:17.446
includes

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:19.400
in addition to the device

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.800
The nylon latching for the counter-panel assembly

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:30.500
with the relative screws

00:00:34.085 --> 00:00:40.000
and the English/Italian instruction manual.

00:00:45.015 --> 00:00:48.000
Regarding the device features

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
by the rear 12 pin terminal

00:00:52.048 --> 00:00:55.500
you see the power supply section

00:00:56.022 --> 00:01:05.000
(in this case the ATR121-B requires 220 V tension, as reported in the user manual)

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:14.000
then the outputs section with two relays for external SSR

00:01:15.076 --> 00:01:21.500
and eventually the section for connecting the process sensor.

00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:27.054
In particular the ATR121 allows different types of thermocouples,

00:01:27.054 --> 00:01:33.109
different types of thermoresistances such as the PT100 and MI100 probes, PTC and NTC

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.600
as well as PT1000

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.000
and linear signals both 4..20 mA and 0..10 V.

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:46.092
For example, we connect and setup

00:01:46.092 --> 00:01:48.400
a PT100 resistor.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.900
First we connect the PT100 sensor

00:01:53.075 --> 00:01:58.001
by following the instructions reported on the label

00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:03.000
of the 10, 11, 12 pins.

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.220
With the wire compensation technique

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:19.800
we connect the power supply to the 1 and 2 pins

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.800
220 volts.

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:30.717
Once the wiring is complete

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:33.700
we turn on the device

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:38.000
the display shows the software version

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and performs a short auto tuning

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:48.000
then the regulator measures the temperature detected by the PT100 sensor.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Naturally if the sensor is not configured yet

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.700
the temperature value is wrong,

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.800
so it is necessary to enter the configuration menu

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.000
with the "function" key

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:01.557
after a few seconds

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:07.719
the password is required, which can be defined with the arrow keys and "set" key

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:10.800
(the password is "123",

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.000
to confirm press the "set" key)

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:21.258
hence we enter the parameters configuration list

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.600
(the arrow keys permit to scroll the parameters),

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.059
we select the SEn (sensor) parameter

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:34.124
so to see what sensor is configured we press again the "set" key.

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.781
The default value

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:40.471
corresponds to the thermocouple K,

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.858
by holding the "set" key we select

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:47.778
"PT" (PT100)

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:52.045
we release both keys and we press the "fnc" key

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.500
to exit the configuration mode.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.100
Now the display shows the correct ambient temperature

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.500
detected by the industrial probe connected.

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.500
For what concerns the output sources

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:16.084
the ATR121 is composed of two relays and one logic output

00:04:16.084 --> 00:04:18.700
for the static relays control

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:22.783
which normally are connected with power actuators

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.000
such as the classic contactor

00:04:28.043 --> 00:04:31.892
the static relay

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.700
(zero crossing, in this case)

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.776
or the servo motors with open/close logic.

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:44.308
With the servo motor the two relays operate combined

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.069
the first relay

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:47.800
for the "open" action

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.500
the second relay for the "close" action.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.800
Once the contactor is connected

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:07.000
to make the system work simply set the temperature setpoint

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.900
just press the arrow keys

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and set the main temperature, for example 35 CÂ°

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
related to the output with the flashing led.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.400
If you want to use both available outputs

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
just press another time the "set" key

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
to  setup the temperature alarm as well.
