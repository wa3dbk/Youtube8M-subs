it's a 400 watt max cabinet it's going
to<00:01:51.789> be<00:01:51.880> 200<00:01:52.060> watts<00:01:52.479> in<00:01:52.719> stereo<00:01:53.340> 200<00:01:54.340> watts<00:01:54.459> of

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:54.609 
to be 200 watts in stereo 200 watts of

to be 200 watts in stereo 200 watts of
channel<00:01:54.939> if<00:01:55.119> you're<00:01:55.389> running<00:01:55.569> stereo<00:01:56.049> you<00:01:56.469> do

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
channel if you're running stereo you do

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.889 
channel if you're running stereo you do
have<00:01:56.770> a<00:01:56.799> mono<00:01:57.159> or<00:01:57.520> stereo<00:01:57.549> switch<00:01:58.329> here<00:01:58.599> so<00:01:58.779> you

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
have a mono or stereo switch here so you

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:00.269 
have a mono or stereo switch here so you
can<00:01:59.049> switch<00:01:59.349> it<00:01:59.499> between<00:01:59.740> the<00:01:59.919> two<00:01:59.950> different

00:02:00.269 --> 00:02:00.279 
can switch it between the two different

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:03.899 
can switch it between the two different
modes<00:02:00.749> so<00:02:01.749> you<00:02:01.810> have<00:02:02.020> a<00:02:02.079> single<00:02:02.529> 4<00:02:02.889> ohm<00:02:03.099> input<00:02:03.459> a

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
modes so you have a single 4 ohm input a

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.169 
modes so you have a single 4 ohm input a
single<00:02:04.630> 16<00:02:05.200> ohm<00:02:05.380> input<00:02:05.709> or<00:02:06.189> you'll<00:02:06.609> have<00:02:06.819> it<00:02:07.149> in

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
single 16 ohm input or you'll have it in

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:09.809 
single 16 ohm input or you'll have it in
8<00:02:07.569> ohm<00:02:07.749> inputs<00:02:08.229> you<00:02:08.979> can<00:02:09.099> use<00:02:09.220> either<00:02:09.369> one<00:02:09.459> for

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
8 ohm inputs you can use either one for

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.699 
8 ohm inputs you can use either one for
the<00:02:09.880> 8<00:02:10.060> ohm<00:02:10.209> input<00:02:10.390> if<00:02:10.810> you're<00:02:10.929> running<00:02:11.110> it

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
the 8 ohm input if you're running it

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.429 
the 8 ohm input if you're running it
or<00:02:12.219> you<00:02:12.310> could<00:02:12.430> run<00:02:12.579> in<00:02:12.730> stereo<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:13.569> real

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:14.439 
or you could run in stereo and real

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:16.740 
or you could run in stereo and real
simple<00:02:14.829> connections<00:02:15.340> real<00:02:15.939> great<00:02:16.209> quality

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
simple connections real great quality

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.559 
simple connections real great quality
connectors<00:02:17.530> here<00:02:17.799> and<00:02:18.060> again<00:02:19.060> a<00:02:19.090> really<00:02:19.420> nice
