00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
my audio and that was with my Aston 990

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.719 
my audio and that was with my Aston 990
microphone<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.869> at<00:01:34.799> first<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.340> thought<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.610> was

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
microphone and at first I thought it was

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.240 
microphone and at first I thought it was
the<00:01:36.210> microphone<00:01:36.720> but<00:01:36.990> as<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.170> did<00:01:37.470> research<00:01:37.680> I

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
the microphone but as I did research I

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.810 
the microphone but as I did research I
found<00:01:38.670> out<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.360> was<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.750> AGC<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:41.189> auto<00:01:41.430> gain

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
found out it was the AGC the auto gain

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.840 
found out it was the AGC the auto gain

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.640 
problem but they don't have that for the
7d<00:02:11.370> or<00:02:11.400> TTYL<00:02:12.000> yet<00:02:12.270> or<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.989> t1i

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
7d or TTYL yet or the t1i

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.940 
7d or TTYL yet or the t1i
and<00:02:14.640> actually<00:02:15.629> t1i<00:02:16.200> doesn't<00:02:16.530> have<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.650> high<00:02:16.799> yo

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.500 
and actually t1i doesn't have a high yo
jack<00:02:17.189> so<00:02:17.430> he<00:02:18.390> has<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.569> step<00:02:18.900> with<00:02:19.110> onboard<00:02:19.319> but<00:02:20.280> a

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
jack so he has a step with onboard but a

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.960 
jack so he has a step with onboard but a
the<00:02:21.510> solution<00:02:22.140> I<00:02:22.409> guess<00:02:23.280> where<00:02:23.519> people<00:02:23.849> are

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
the solution I guess where people are

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.319 
the solution I guess where people are
getting<00:02:24.409> those<00:02:25.409> of<00:02:25.680> zooms<00:02:26.450> z4<00:02:27.450> ends<00:02:27.629> and<00:02:27.959> then

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
getting those of zooms z4 ends and then

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.960 
getting those of zooms z4 ends and then
sinking<00:02:30.329> the<00:02:30.480> audio<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:30.900> post<00:02:31.379> and<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:32.790> me

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
sinking the audio and post and to me

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.699 
sinking the audio and post and to me
it's<00:02:33.420> like<00:02:33.599> I<00:02:33.810> don't<00:02:33.870> want<00:02:34.079> to<00:02:34.170> spend<00:02:34.409> any<00:02:34.530> more

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
it's like I don't want to spend any more

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.000 
it's like I don't want to spend any more
money<00:02:34.769> than<00:02:35.159> I<00:02:35.250> have<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.459> and<00:02:36.290> I<00:02:37.290> don't<00:02:37.739> want

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
money than I have to and I don't want

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.660 
money than I have to and I don't want
the<00:02:38.579> extra<00:02:39.090> step<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.629> sinking<00:02:40.500> because<00:02:41.459> that's

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
the extra step of sinking because that's

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.330 
the extra step of sinking because that's
just<00:02:41.879> more<00:02:42.090> time<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:43.260> I<00:02:43.290> did<00:02:43.560> some<00:02:43.739> searching

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
just more time so I did some searching

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.910 
just more time so I did some searching
on<00:02:44.549> the<00:02:44.609> net<00:02:44.939> and<00:02:45.480> i<00:02:45.959> found<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.379> software

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
on the net and i found a software

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.020 
on the net and i found a software
solution<00:02:47.099> and<00:02:49.010> action<00:02:50.010> i'm<00:02:50.099> probably<00:02:50.760> going

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
solution and action i'm probably going

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.379 
solution and action i'm probably going

about audacity pretty cool software does

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.819 
about audacity pretty cool software does
quite<00:03:37.709> a<00:03:37.769> bit<00:03:38.010> more<00:03:38.040> than<00:03:38.280> just<00:03:38.549> filtering<00:03:39.299> but

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
quite a bit more than just filtering but

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.670 
quite a bit more than just filtering but
that's<00:03:40.829> all<00:03:41.010> I<00:03:41.040> use<00:03:41.370> it<00:03:41.579> for<00:03:41.609> and<00:03:42.530> what<00:03:43.530> you

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
that's all I use it for and what you

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:54.039 
that's all I use it for and what you
want<00:03:43.859> to<00:03:43.949> do<00:03:44.069> is<00:03:44.370> click<00:03:45.120> on<00:03:45.269> file<00:03:46.849> import<00:03:47.849> audio

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.059 

there<00:03:55.049> you<00:03:55.109> go<00:03:55.229> and<00:03:55.500> then<00:03:55.530> you're<00:03:55.829> going<00:03:55.979> to

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
there you go and then you're going to

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.140 
there you go and then you're going to
want<00:03:56.220> to<00:03:56.340> zoom<00:03:56.639> in<00:03:56.909> on<00:03:57.680> an<00:03:58.680> empty<00:03:59.040> space<00:03:59.879> so

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
want to zoom in on an empty space so

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.789 
want to zoom in on an empty space so
like<00:04:00.540> it<00:04:00.780> because<00:04:01.049> you<00:04:01.229> got<00:04:01.349> to<00:04:01.500> give<00:04:01.620> the

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
like it because you got to give the

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.129 
like it because you got to give the
software<00:04:02.220> sample<00:04:02.760> of<00:04:02.849> the<00:04:02.940> ambient<00:04:03.419> noise<00:04:03.599> so

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
software sample of the ambient noise so

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.219 
software sample of the ambient noise so
I<00:04:04.169> can<00:04:04.379> filter<00:04:04.709> it<00:04:04.739> out<00:04:04.949> so<00:04:05.729> what<00:04:05.879> you<00:04:06.000> do<00:04:06.150> is

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:06.229 
I can filter it out so what you do is

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:10.580 
I can filter it out so what you do is
take<00:04:07.229> a<00:04:08.389> take<00:04:09.389> a<00:04:09.419> section<00:04:09.780> of<00:04:09.989> ambient<00:04:10.409> noise

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
take a take a section of ambient noise

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:17.539 
take a take a section of ambient noise

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
go ahead and filter it then after it's

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.740 
go ahead and filter it then after it's
