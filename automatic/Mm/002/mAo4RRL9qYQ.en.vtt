00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:08.490
 dear friends we have today in the studio 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.780
 my old friend Alexey Colleges 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.110
 Yuryevich Sokolov 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.170
 candidate of biological sciences who 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.810
 exploring the snakes of childhood itself knows them 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.480
 wrote a thesis a lot and snakes 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.779
 visited Cambodia and some others 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.480
 countries of Southeast Asia and knows from 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.529
 there snakes as much as needed 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.920
 know anyone who visits these countries and i 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.489
 I think it will be very useful 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.670
 guide guide for those who are going there 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.980
 go here in your hands here is this snake 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.890
 notice you in my arms and now i have 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.980
 hands here please catch a tourist 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.379
 such a snake is the so-called radiant 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.600
 the snake very often this snake shows 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.239
 aggression inflate it vertically not 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.550
 horizontally like a cobra 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.079
 and here it is necessary so vertically it 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.539
 happens due to the fact that 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.100
 ribs goes into such pain 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.320
 straightened perpendicular 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.340
 spine axis of the spine position 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.830
 and 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.619
 This posture is very effective, often such 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.200
 snakes are used in shows in thailand as 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.420
 here are very poisonous for onlookers entertainment 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.030
 meanwhile, venomous snakes can really 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.799
 list on fingers this different 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.110
 king cobra cobra which 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.220
 representatives of another kind and krayts 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.710
 possessing 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.409
 perhaps the most powerful and more dangerous 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.259
 poison is 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.860
 these are such specialized serpents 1 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.490
 asps 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.860
 and moreover 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:43.840
 some species such as bun urban 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.700
 status in instinctive daily behavior 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.100
 no defense provided by 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.530
 bites are therefore very often seen 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.750
 the people who keep them keep them in 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:58.060
 hands but there is no guarantee that you can 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.520
 run into the belly of a different population 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.960
 where wounds or sooner or later in 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.030
 resulting in sooner or later you can 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.619
 get a bite and 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.289
 most likely to see 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.850
 ancestors of this kind of snake this 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.650
 hunters of seals 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:17.110
 they are not spectacular from this position but 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.660
 are an order of magnitude more dangerous it 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.300
 Malay shchitomordnik multiplied to say 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.590
 author almost 90 percent of the bites and 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.530
 on the territory of Cambodia 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:32.830
 it is very common in indochina 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:34.840
 snake here get up to very poisonous otherwise 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.100
 we would have long been holding the truth 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.650
 yes to sit like that with love snakes 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.900
 even where we open the lid so here's how 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:48.540
 once and then I don't make it start 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:51.940
 weapons there is no need to touch 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.769
 I'll run away with nine dp take nikolai 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.670
 Nikolaevich but now here she sits 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:59.680
 enough snakes rush once and day 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.420
 there was no need for you here these teeth 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.489
 which are such 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.370
 curved gold syringe they can 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.989
 slip through even they slip and after 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.470
 This causes multiple internal 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.269
 hemorrhages such bubbles filled 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.540
 on full of nuggets here's the product 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.040
 the breakdown of tissues is often these neglected 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.260
 cases just lead to death 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.110
 limbs a large number of colleagues 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.060
 which is positioned as a victim of mines in 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.400
 cambodia is actually a victim here 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.820
 Here are the bites so I want to tell people 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:34.660
 who are going to attend these 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:37.120
 areas before this snake mouse appears often 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.390
 appear on the roads after entering 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.120
 suns that is over the day period when 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.370
 it's very hot when everything is alive 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.160
 hiding from this excess sun 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.090
 you can hardly see but when 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.130
 the sun goes down 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.620
 a large amount of heat remains 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.320
 stones of heated open areas here 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.820
 It is this period that time is such 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.140
 snakes 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.810
 use to get 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.120
 necessary portion of heat and 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.560
 here to appear on the roads without a lantern 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:10.200
 when tourists go up to the bungalow up 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.470
 in the house at dusk for a walk until after 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:16.200
 sunset without a lantern very much 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.630
 lantern is very dangerous to notice that you 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.150
 said about the snake speed throw 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.419
 this snake and almost 10 times more 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.790
 what is the speed of throwing to baron someone video 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:29.639
 give it to you to do like this and dismiss 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.000
 so relax how yes this is here stretched 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.240
 a hand 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.020
 already not even seen yet already moving 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.960
 two holes 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.669
 Well, now it means you are already a check 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.060
 experienced in my opinion even going 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:44.100
 visit these places true you they are very 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.800
 attracts because here it is billy 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.380
 Is the snake that you're not big it 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.810
 will be more than 1 meter sarko centimeter in 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.060
 one and a half meters and I still meter then 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.250
 There is still photo times more she 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.860
 noisy she can sizzle tom novy 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:02.070
 swell but by the way bites on too 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:05.310
 Yes, of course, even wondered why it 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:08.040
 about the way the hour is aggressive towards 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.130
