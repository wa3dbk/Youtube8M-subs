00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.589
 it is there all delighted to find on 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.170
 direct race provoked this program 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.120
 Sunday 27 October the quinté will have 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.309
 for frame the racecourse of longchamp 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.049
 last Sunday meeting of the year 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.969
 on the racecourse of the Bois de Boulogne 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.820
 with a quinté plus the price of 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.560
 the orangery here is my selection for 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.960
 this handicap competition 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.670
 knowing that in my eyes the solution seems 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.890
 to be at the top of the table at the placed game 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.680
 at the top of my prognosis the local 3 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.570
 lover a foal driven by the very in 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.369
 henri form alex pantall the horse remains 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.130
 on two places of 2nd in handicaps 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.930
 same invoice including one obtained on this 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.180
 drawn this a priori a good point of support 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.680
 for this event that I will ask number 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.360
 2 Vasilyev who will have for him his 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.399
 experience the horse already has six 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.039
 places in 16 attempts in the quintés 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.840
 plus he finished fourth of a 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.010
 handicap cap and lately on 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.550
 the hippodrome of houses laffitte it was 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.890
 October 8 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.510
 he should be able to confirm a fortiori 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.510
 with the monte of christophe soumillon 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.340
 then the one harass presented by a 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.260
 German entourage the circus horse must 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.730
 wear the top-weight but he has the 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.189
 quality remember he had 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.260
 finished platonic third of a quinté 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.000
 + mansonnian in front of vasilyev before 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.760
 to be downgraded to 7th place it takes 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.979
 so redeem it with confidence the number 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.360
 7 in this event it is and loire to 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.369
 a 3 year old filly presented by 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.720
 freddy she is regular she already has 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.460
 shown quality it starts here 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.060
 in disabilities with serious 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.340
 claims 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.689
 the number 6 and pistachios is still 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.640
 Presented wisely by Dominic 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.140
 with us noted that this hatchet track 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.790
 particularly likes this 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.280
 course of 14 100 m since it counts 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.110
 two wins in as many attempts 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.880
 from 100% success for her to the 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.950
 victory on this course 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.290
 it is better to keep it in good order 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.479
 and do not forget the number 8 was 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.150
 boaters presented by myriam bollack 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.440
 badel that remain safe 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.060
 a success proof of his good form 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.220
 it was in a handicap played at 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.890
 longchamp lately the least in the beginning 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.140
 of months the number 10 a soulman and the 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.940
 5-1 danone rose are hardly 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.320
 dissociable with paper since they 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.480
 come respectively to rank 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.760
 third first of a race 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.680
 disputed at saint cloud on October 10th 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.000
 proof of their good form and their 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.970
 mission and if every month for 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.560
 numbered places for this quinté 3 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:14.870
 2 haas 7-6 8 10 and 5 the highlight of 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.660
 this meeting will be the royal-oak the 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.730
 last group played this year 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.770
 the slopes of Longchamp in this 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.720
 3000m long event we find 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.130
 departure the 507 the beaufs which is not other 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.180
 that the titleholder and who appreciate 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.070
 the heavy ground so it will take 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.660
 monitor the state of the ground his dolphin 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.310
 second of this race last 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.030
 it's the 5 th their suitcases will be 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.410
 also of the party 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.150
 so we take the same and we start again 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.320
 but the opposition looks great and 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.290
 especially that led by the 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.209
 visitors I think in particular the 501 tac 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.130
 of woodtron he held he is hard at 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.230
 the effort he will have his land is a 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.400
 candidate for success as much as he has 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.780
 finished second in the price of the dial 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.080
 lately we feel the weekend of 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.120
 bow 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.970
 it was the wind that day by 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.800
 that by the 504,1 tanoh which so has 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.739
 reported that executives and who resort 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.440
 this royal oak award so a nice match in 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.000
 perspective between these laureates and 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.940
 the protagonists of the previous 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.220
 edition of 507 the beaufs the 505 catfish 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.410
 vanilla face the price protagonists 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.050
 royal price of the dial lately 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.120
 longchamp the 501 tac of boistron of 504 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.660
 stop at our preference in his 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.150
 evidence the 1 the 7 the 4 and the 5 small 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.860
 words about argenton in this competition 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.150
 in this meeting sorry patrice 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.010
 quinton is so confident the first 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.959
 is only 104 to the Balearic Islands supplemented 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.370
 for the occasion the horse stays on a 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.470
 third place on the same track 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.970
 so a form and an aptitude to 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.520
 course that will be worth it 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.890
 logical supporters in the stable 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.140
 we are quite optimistic in the 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.820
 sixth with the batteries ps the 608 view 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.340
 the here and the 6 years of Beauchêne vacuum 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.960
 the lot is not extraordinary and c2 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.090
 recover seems able to very well 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.370
 hold their party but want the 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.520
 include in your games even if according to voice 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.740
 the opposition remains difficult to locate 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.360
 better be wary quinton patrice 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.890
 also in the 8th seems to have a 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.880
 luck in any case in the stable one is 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.880
 confident enough to be in the know 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.050
 with the 806 pink lady royal who finds 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.209
 an adversity in his strings 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.250
 she dances have claimed she should 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.950
 finish on the podium with 806 eyes 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.020
 prize clélie royal however it will be 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.350
 difficult to get the 820 soli 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.090
 made 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.060
 former boarder of guy cherel who 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.790
 just joined eric's boxes 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.410
 leray 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.840
 stay on a good easy win 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.580
 with the year the opposition is a 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.380
 once again launched card is in my opinion 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.880
 that his shroud he does remains the 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.710
 horse to beat in this race to 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.620
 claim course this him argentan 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.570
 first 6th and 8th very good game to all 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.720
