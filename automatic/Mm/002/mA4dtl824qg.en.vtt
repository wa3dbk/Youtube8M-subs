00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.660 
I'm actually think that's a name for a
festival<00:01:08.500> rocking<00:01:08.890> Rio<00:01:09.070> that<00:01:09.130> sounds<00:01:09.520> like

something<00:01:10.180> that<00:01:10.210> happened<00:01:10.719> some<00:01:10.960> time<00:01:11.170> at

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
something that happened some time at

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.260 
something that happened some time at
some<00:01:11.890> point<00:01:12.130> look<00:01:12.670> that<00:01:12.880> we<00:01:13.420> are<00:01:13.630> surfing<00:01:14.500> or

pretty<00:01:27.520> it's<00:01:27.759> pretty<00:01:27.820> straightforward<00:01:28.270> it's

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
pretty it's pretty straightforward it's

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.330 
pretty it's pretty straightforward it's
pretty<00:01:28.840> it's<00:01:29.049> pretty<00:01:29.170> easy<00:01:29.530> since<00:01:29.979> it's<00:01:30.189> only

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
pretty it's pretty easy since it's only

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.249 
pretty it's pretty easy since it's only
three<00:01:30.729> letters<00:01:30.759> row<00:01:31.240> long<00:01:31.479> they<00:01:31.990> could<00:01:32.049> have

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
three letters row long they could have

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.859 
three letters row long they could have
done<00:01:32.469> the<00:01:32.530> whole<00:01:32.859> name<00:01:33.130> like<00:01:33.759> Rio<00:01:34.000> de<00:01:34.270> Janeiro

done the whole name like Rio de Janeiro

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.020 
done the whole name like Rio de Janeiro
that's<00:01:35.170> actually<00:01:35.680> pretty<00:01:35.829> long<00:01:36.070> I<00:01:36.460> think<00:01:36.880> that

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
that's actually pretty long I think that

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.399 
that's actually pretty long I think that
would<00:01:37.149> be<00:01:37.329> would<00:01:37.810> have<00:01:37.840> been<00:01:38.049> more<00:01:38.259> of<00:01:38.350> a

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
would be would have been more of a

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:39.899 
would be would have been more of a
challenge<00:01:38.799> but<00:01:38.920> you<00:01:39.039> know<00:01:39.159> what<00:01:39.369> they<00:01:39.579> they

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
challenge but you know what they they

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.310 
challenge but you know what they they
settle<00:01:40.240> with<00:01:40.359> real<00:01:40.539> you<00:01:40.780> know<00:01:40.869> they<00:01:41.049> probably

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
settle with real you know they probably

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.499 
settle with real you know they probably
thought<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:42.130> complete<00:01:42.729> name<00:01:42.939> was<00:01:43.180> too<00:01:43.329> long

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
thought the complete name was too long

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.719 
thought the complete name was too long
and<00:01:43.810> they<00:01:44.560> were<00:01:44.619> probably<00:01:44.950> right<00:01:45.280> look<00:01:45.640> at

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
and they were probably right look at

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.760 
and they were probably right look at

different<00:02:02.229> sceneries<00:02:02.770> I<00:02:02.859> like<00:02:03.039> it<00:02:03.219> I<00:02:03.310> like<00:02:03.460> it

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
different sceneries I like it I like it

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.639 
different sceneries I like it I like it
has<00:02:04.299> this<00:02:04.479> been<00:02:04.689> an<00:02:04.810> optic<00:02:05.109> before<00:02:05.380> I<00:02:05.409> feel

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
has this been an optic before I feel

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.499 
has this been an optic before I feel
like<00:02:05.799> I<00:02:05.950> haven't<00:02:06.159> played<00:02:06.429> through<00:02:06.759> Rio<00:02:06.999> before

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509
