00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.509
 hi guys what about episode 10 of rock 

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:09.810
 to glory there we go with this team of 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.820
 silver that I'm really enjoying and 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:15.500
 Well, as you can see, I'm going to go in there 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.450
 I'm looking for players 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.810
 regularly to see if I find that way 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:23.180
 some bargain and you know I'm missing a 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.270
 mediocentro that I am between sea ​​and what 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.740
 I said to that or what this game is called 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.580
 that you see now on screen that has 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.590
 pace 76 kilos 71 pass 70 defenses 73 and 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.920
 headbutton 74 percent of the statistics 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.530
 in the seventies and in addition the read by 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.220
 there in fuguet that has pretty good 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.180
 far shot so good I think that 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.590
 would shoot for that player to see if he 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.750
 I can find cheap because they are 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.180
 4000 or 5000 coins although in funge pone 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.750
 than 2,500 but then we go the price of 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.800
 market is not that respect to the defense 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.219
 central 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.140
 I am very obsessed with this other with 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.110
 soul back because the other option is here 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.659
 no but it's a little more expensive and I do not think 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.249
 what 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.499
 it's good that I'm going to need it 

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:11.380
 I do not think that with this one I'm going 

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:13.899
 to conform here I do not know what is very good 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.689
 but this does not have rhythm 82 has 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:19.840
 defenses 34 I think that can come 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:21.909
 very well it's also from the same team what 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.640
 that this other that dong my other defense 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.280
 central and then with by substitute then 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.229
 well I think I can supply it and 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.670
 well let's go with another party 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:36.520
 touches against a team of silver and a 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.700
 bronze and it's there good so you have 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.790
 seen he had Scottish is one of Wales 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.590
 English too 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.330
 and well here I'm going to start 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.280
 piss off in this episode because in the 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.040
 12 minute without putting even a single 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.650
 goal of opportunities or anything there is me 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.420
 for the game you see that the 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.090
 little circle that starts to spin 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.110
 and I thought he was going to him but he does not take me out 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.750
 of the servers of a 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:06.820
 and in the end I fall I add a defeat 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:08.500
 and I shit on everything because I do not know what happens 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.190
 sometimes with the points served from to 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.440
 but the truth is that it takes you to join you 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.590
 well a defeat of the pull as it fucks me 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.600
 pretty and good anyway let's buy 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.700
 an envelope let's play more games in 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.950
 this envelope good I buy basically 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.220
 because I need form and 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.260
 and contracts and it's up to me if any player 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.050
 that maybe I can sell for 200 coins and 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.670
 recover some of the money from the envelope 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.320
 that always comes good , you know that 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.850
 advised to buy 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.330
 if you have bronze plays even from 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.040
 Silver advised buying bronze envelopes 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.110
 because the contracts the minimum that 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.540
 you can buy them at 150 and the envelope 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.180
 costs 400 they come three contracts and 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.910
 three generally three contracts and one 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.680
 in shape usually come and well we are going to 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.270
 enter there is another game there game against 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.740
 a team of Spaniards as you have seen 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.660
 all bronze players has to 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.230
 cristian t from above in mediapunta then 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.810
 has negredo too 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.180
 has two golds in particular and 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.060
 then another through the midfield I believe in 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.580
 principle a difficult team is a good 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.960
 rival but good that is the minute 37 we 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.450
 advance and in the match 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.330
 here at 9 minute blondel you see how I 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.720
 goes the area do with jerks and such 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:25.110
 in my turn of blondel there is a good shot 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.540
 with quality adjusted to the stick 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.920
 here negredo remains alone I do not know why 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.950
 what reason my defenses was very 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.380
 up and clear it cost them to go down a lot 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.900
 there was a huge hole 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.480
 well nothing got in there to plug in the 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.160
 with the left a good pass here for 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.040
 tchité on top that stands out and is 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.720
 it is practically only to stick it and 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.720
 hard as he knows 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.720
 minute 21 31 suárez here good 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:58.280
 moves the paste but very focused 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:00.890
 goalkeeper and there the ball falls to him he wins 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.560
 so at the first touch he puts it inside and 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.570
 Ojito to this goal that I plugged tremendous 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.520
 Alonso is there with his finger very well very 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.810
 very good goal yes sir 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.390
 I also did not expect it at all 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.150
 because it did not take almost run 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:19.389
 there is a new good writes dribling skill 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:22.030
 de de tchité here is going to come another like that in 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:24.280
 in parallel very good there to get me 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:28.270
 inwards and stick with quality and 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:31.120
 a-62 ends this game that in the end 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:35.199
 good it thought it was not so difficult 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.810
 connection rival respect and not 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:39.419
 fell though 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.449
 there were indications that he was going to tighten but 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.759
 the end stand 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:46.939
 same here my already as I get to sign 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:49.639
 to soul back and in a bid that was 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:51.589
 about the starting price at two thousand 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.779
 coins so good I put two thousand 

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:56.479
 coins because I think it's pretty 

00:04:53.779 --> 00:05:00.560
 well among all I have seen them between two 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:02.510
 thousand three thousand and even more expensive 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.960
 and well I think it's a price that I 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:09.830
 I can afford it, I have five thousand left 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.660
 two hundred coins and did not win the bid to 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.150
 see how to see how it is with this 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.060
 defending 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.689
 I've never tried and I wanted to 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:21.210
 do what 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:24.360
 we are going to sign, I also believe here 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:28.350
 to the goalkeeper I will look for the goalkeepers to 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:31.560
 see who I had already noticed there in 1 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:34.289
 specifically that it was called proto that 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.050
 it's also Belgian, so maybe it's 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:39.960
 I can use when I make my team 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.689
 Belgian gold and you see him with 82 of stretched 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.619
 and 81 position 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:48.809
 and well you see how I have the team 

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:51.629
 almost complete in the absence of that midfielder 

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:55.139
 and we're not going to get into another party 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:56.350
 this guy with attack 76 and has a team 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:59.380
 d 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:02.410
 the line I think is the league calix and 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.670
 has there are several of my players from the 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.860
 players who had already signed those 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.690
 bronzes then you have silver you have the 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:11.170
 montero that is pretty good up 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:15.540
 he has three golds I think he has a child 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:19.150
 who is a Brazilian who runs a lot 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:22.810
 and good a priori pretty good team 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:25.780
 in minute 10, Suarez advances and 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:28.389
 with a good movement within the area 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.520
 and here I will get a good goal and 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:33.160
 getting ahead of the goalkeeper's exit 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:36.810
 no longer big I do not know who is but good 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:39.700
 it looked like it was pretty good and here already 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.770
 I cited a good dribling skill again 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.620
 start working with the goal with the 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.820
 left but it is still working 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:50.019
 separates completely I get the 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:52.159
 yellow circle and again as 

00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:54.769
 you will understand, I will leave the 

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:56.419
 I'm going to get angry I'm going to throw the 

00:06:54.769 --> 00:06:59.149
 command to take the ass and I'll stop 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:01.819
 play because the truth that other 

00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:03.949
 disconnection and another defeat that added are 

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:06.349
 two defeats and so in this episode the 

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:09.110
 same day and well I want to leave the 

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:10.669
 episode here and good and start from scratch 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.279
 another day to see if the connection was better 

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:15.199
 or the servers with better or whatever 

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:16.819
 and nothing guys I hope that person is me 

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:18.979
 that the episode is not longer but 

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:22.009
 you understand that I did not want to keep adding up 

00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:23.329
 defeats for that reason so nothing 

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:25.909
 we see in following videos I hope that it 

00:07:23.329 --> 00:07:28.089
 is liking the series and nothing else until 

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:28.089
 then
