00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.490
 today I 'm going to practice another 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.349
 time about probably what is the 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.450
 theme of the decade and maybe even the 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:25.289
 mars century theme and probe 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:27.990
 curiosity because right now it's again 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.230
 theme this zone is that this probe this 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.899
 robot is delivering such information and 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.000
 give here such amount of information that 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.160
 is unique and that only the first 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.379
 three days of information received by 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.020
 this probe surpassed all the information 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.180
 that already had on Mars in history 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.610
 that this planet has been investigated 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.770
 so imagine all the information 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.230
 that was coming right now 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.570
 confirms how good the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.290
 window to time a window of time 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.750
 to the past, not why, because good 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.840
 confirms that the crater that already 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:08.520
 he calculated that it was full that he had a 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.130
 great a lot of ice has 180 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.869
 kilometers in diameter and it 's ice 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.509
 who will be speaking to us will give us 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.770
 information of centuries and perhaps thousands 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.920
 of years 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.789
 of how it was constituted in the past 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.950
 Mars 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:26.070
 everything is frozen there they will be 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.950
 simply making small holes for 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.409
 to be able to get the information and know what 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.569
 is what happened if there was life what kind 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.399
 of life and good surely will be 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:38.189
 delivering information to us dropper 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:41.069
 but I'm sure that if they are going to divulge 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.069
 important information because the nasa 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:45.689
 you need resources and you need millions and 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:47.549
 thousands of millions of resources to 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.709
 take humans to Mars and 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.869
 to be able to investigate and good of some 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:54.390
 way its all that they will try to take out 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.630
 obviously benefit to all this 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.979
 information and someday then to Mars 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:05.069
 done there is already a mission attempt and 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.380
 in the coming years towards Mars and in the 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:09.720
 which would be only one-way ticket osea 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.030
 the astronauts that guide Mars no longer 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.190
 they would have and could not come back anymore 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.319
 still the technology to be able 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.319
 return them so it would be then of some 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.329
 way a suicide mission and right now 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.340
 the fields have criticized him 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:25.080
 mission the nasa actually says that they 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.900
 I will not be in still in agreement because 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.750
 not aesthetic send someone to death 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.129
 but there are obviously many astronauts and 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.069
 scientists have raised in the hand and 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:37.019
 have said we want to go then 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.030
 have been seeing what would be the 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.160
 more ethical possibility to send 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.620
 astronauts to the future some have 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.730
 proposed that they be astronauts of 55 or 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.890
 60 years if women are astronauts 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.470
 that they do not have the possibility of staying 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.780
 pregnant by the fact that good and 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.410
 what would happen to that baby if born in 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.660
 Mars and the possibility that they 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:05.250
 can live for many years is not much 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.769
 but it exists as filtering possible water 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.690
 what's on Mars and probably also 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.629
 bringing enough food to live 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.879
 many years enough to 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.220
 to be able to live until they have a death 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:20.310
 natural there are many possibilities and now 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.540
 same as at least there are several 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.209
 who have raised their hands between 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.880
 scientific engineers and former astronauts 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.250
 from the nasa 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.320
 glad to be able to take where they can 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.630
 be the first human beings to step on 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.730
 Mars at least the numbers beings 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.560
 known humans not because there is out there 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.050
 some crazy theories that 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.140
 then I tell them but surely 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.390
 Well, they will be interested in the 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.980
 Nasa will be as I tell you by giving us 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.770
 information dropper and here 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.680
 we will be talking about what are the 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.990
 connotations and probably towards 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.710
 where is the information that we 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:00.150
 Nasa reports, we see that a large part of 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.510
 the information that is coming will be 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.300
 secret a long time but we hope that 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.540
 there is some league said some leakage of 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.610
 information or some kind wikileaks for 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.930
 to come and get information 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.760
 least to force every few 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.160
 interesting theories and to comment on them 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.800
 here surely something is happening 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.500
 soon but good for now we see ourselves in 

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.420
 twitter on the route br and good 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.130
 also there be attentive when we do 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.900
 the hangouts but soon we're going to 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.400
 be for the end on some topics 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.410
 that you have suggested to me and that I 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.310
 I think more than a video blog would be 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.930
 more interesting 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.790
 to be able to comment on them and that you yourselves 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.390
 they are also interacting there good 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.390
 see you later
