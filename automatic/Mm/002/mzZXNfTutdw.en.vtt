00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.250 

this<00:00:00.299> will<00:00:00.480> become<00:00:00.599> one<00:00:00.900> of<00:00:00.930> the<00:00:01.050> great

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:01.260 
this will become one of the great

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.139 
this will become one of the great
experiences<00:00:01.860> that<00:00:02.010> we<00:00:02.100> all<00:00:02.250> have<00:00:02.280> all<00:00:02.760> of<00:00:03.030> us

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
experiences that we all have all of us

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.480 
experiences that we all have all of us
and<00:00:03.330> and<00:00:04.110> we<00:00:04.319> want<00:00:04.500> you<00:00:04.560> guys<00:00:04.740> to<00:00:04.920> buy<00:00:05.040> it<00:00:05.100> and<00:00:05.430> I

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
and and we want you guys to buy it and I

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.530 
and and we want you guys to buy it and I
think<00:00:05.580> that's<00:00:05.819> how<00:00:06.000> this<00:00:06.120> is<00:00:06.270> going<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.450> work

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
think that's how this is going to work

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.750 
think that's how this is going to work
and<00:00:06.810> so<00:00:07.049> we<00:00:07.200> want<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.500> try<00:00:07.680> and<00:00:07.710> relate<00:00:08.160> what

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
and so we want to try and relate what

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.700 
and so we want to try and relate what
the<00:00:08.910> chefs<00:00:09.179> have<00:00:09.389> to<00:00:09.450> say<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:10.320> some<00:00:10.500> of<00:00:10.620> the

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
the chefs have to say to some of the

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.740 
the chefs have to say to some of the
science<00:00:11.099> that<00:00:11.250> we<00:00:11.309> teach<00:00:11.670> in<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:11.969> class<00:00:12.240> in

the lab our students have made
measurements<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.690> measure<00:00:15.900> exactly<00:00:16.230> the

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
measurements to measure exactly the

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.769 
measurements to measure exactly the
temperature<00:00:17.220> at<00:00:17.340> which<00:00:17.369> eggs<00:00:17.820> cook<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.660> a

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
temperature at which eggs cook this is a

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.840 
temperature at which eggs cook this is a

way<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.910> demonstrate<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.720> this

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
way to demonstrate that this

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.720 
way to demonstrate that this

relationship between time and

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.849 
relationship between time and
temperature<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.420> even<00:00:30.689> more<00:00:30.810> precisely<00:00:31.320> what

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
temperature is even more precisely what

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.380 
temperature is even more precisely what
we<00:00:32.009> would<00:00:32.130> like<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.399> do<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.969> tell<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.300> the

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
we would like to do is to tell you the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.180 
we would like to do is to tell you the
essential<00:00:33.870> scientific<00:00:34.680> features<00:00:35.040> that

ferens creations is that that he is able
to<00:00:42.540> make<00:00:42.719> them<00:00:42.989> by<00:00:43.469> understanding<00:00:44.370> the

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
to make them by understanding the

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.580 
to make them by understanding the
science<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.120> underlies<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:46.079> materials

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
types of fancy cooking that we will see

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.220 
types of fancy cooking that we will see
from<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.640> shaft<00:00:59.910> as<00:01:00.199> inspiration<00:01:01.199> to

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
from the shaft as inspiration to

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.540 
from the shaft as inspiration to
convince<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:01.890> it's<00:01:02.129> really<00:01:02.309> worth

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
convince you that it's really worth

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.149 
convince you that it's really worth
learning<00:01:02.789> science<00:01:03.409> if<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.559> look<00:01:04.769> at<00:01:04.890> any<00:01:05.040> of

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
learning science if you look at any of

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.320 
learning science if you look at any of
these<00:01:05.339> problems<00:01:05.580> from<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.939> point<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.180> view<00:01:06.240> of

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
these problems from the point of view of

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.719 
these problems from the point of view of
a<00:01:06.420> scientist<00:01:06.960> these<00:01:07.470> are<00:01:07.619> materials<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.549> as

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
a scientist these are materials and as

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.550 
a scientist these are materials and as
materials<00:01:09.299> when<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.600> cook<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.960> manipulate

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
materials when you cook you manipulate

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.020 
materials when you cook you manipulate
them<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.920> if<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.340> understand<00:01:11.760> what<00:01:11.909> is

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
them and if you understand what is

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.200 
them and if you understand what is
happening<00:01:12.170> then<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.290> can<00:01:13.439> do<00:01:13.560> much<00:01:13.710> better

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
happening then you can do much better

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.190 
happening then you can do much better
and<00:01:15.210> one<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.479> things<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.840> we<00:01:15.930> would<00:01:16.049> like

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
and one of the things that we would like

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.440 
and one of the things that we would like
to<00:01:16.380> accomplish<00:01:16.590> here<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.670> get<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.970> guys<00:01:18.180> to

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
to accomplish here is to get you guys to

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.570 
to accomplish here is to get you guys to
learn<00:01:18.600> how<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.840> ask<00:01:18.960> science<00:01:19.409> questions<00:01:19.830> it's

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
learn how to ask science questions it's

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.219 
learn how to ask science questions it's
as<00:01:20.670> much<00:01:20.790> about<00:01:20.850> asking<00:01:21.450> questions<00:01:21.869> as<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.140> is

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
as much about asking questions as it is

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.260 
as much about asking questions as it is
about<00:01:22.350> knowing<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.799> answers<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.250> mean<00:01:23.400> most<00:01:24.090> of

about knowing the answers I mean most of
life<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.630> about<00:01:24.780> asking<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.200> right<00:01:25.290> questions

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.060 
really have to understand to be able to
use<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.119> understand<00:01:36.509> why<00:01:37.070> materials

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
use this is to understand why materials

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.980 
use this is to understand why materials
have<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.340> phases<00:01:38.670> goes<00:01:38.850> here<00:01:39.000> what<00:01:39.840> he's

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
have the phases goes here what he's

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.870 
have the phases goes here what he's
trying<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.320> do<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.619> make<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.830> solid<00:01:41.430> other<00:01:41.610> two
