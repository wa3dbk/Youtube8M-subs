00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
during the day and I make sure how it

during the day and I make sure how it
really<00:00:52.949> shiny<00:00:58.070> it<00:00:59.070> smells<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.520> bit<00:00:59.670> weird<00:00:59.879> it's

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
really shiny it smells a bit weird it's

moisture cover this is great if you have

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.220 
moisture cover this is great if you have
any<00:02:09.850> spots<00:02:10.210> you<00:02:10.420> just<00:02:10.600> pinpoint<00:02:10.840> them

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
any spots you just pinpoint them

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.130 
any spots you just pinpoint them
anything<00:02:11.590> I'm<00:02:11.770> not<00:02:11.890> too<00:02:12.040> keen<00:02:12.220> on<00:02:12.370> is<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:13.960> way

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
anything I'm not too keen on is the way

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.750 
anything I'm not too keen on is the way
you<00:02:14.200> apply<00:02:14.650> it<00:02:14.680> I<00:02:15.010> think<00:02:15.400> this<00:02:15.460> is<00:02:15.520> a<00:02:15.640> bit

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
you apply it I think this is a bit

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.990 
you apply it I think this is a bit
unhygienic<00:02:17.160> so<00:02:18.160> I<00:02:18.190> usually<00:02:18.460> just<00:02:18.520> tend<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:18.880> put

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
unhygienic so I usually just tend to put

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.090 
unhygienic so I usually just tend to put
on<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.150> back<00:02:19.300> my<00:02:19.420> hand<00:02:19.600> and<00:02:19.840> then<00:02:19.960> get<00:02:20.860> a<00:02:20.890> brush

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
on the back my hand and then get a brush

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.400 
on the back my hand and then get a brush
and<00:02:21.160> pinpoint<00:02:21.970> all<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.180> spots<00:02:22.480> that<00:02:22.630> I<00:02:22.750> need

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
and pinpoint all the spots that I need

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.380 
and pinpoint all the spots that I need
covering<00:02:23.740> up<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.100> it<00:02:24.850> has<00:02:25.000> great<00:02:25.210> coverage

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
covering up and it has great coverage

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.350 
covering up and it has great coverage
and<00:02:25.900> it's<00:02:26.050> quite<00:02:26.230> creamy<00:02:26.500> so<00:02:27.160> like<00:02:28.150> I<00:02:28.300> said

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
and it's quite creamy so like I said

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.240 
and it's quite creamy so like I said
I've<00:02:28.660> got<00:02:28.690> combination<00:02:29.320> skin<00:02:29.620> so<00:02:29.890> it<00:02:29.920> doesn't

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
I've got combination skin so it doesn't

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.250 
I've got combination skin so it doesn't
really<00:02:30.460> stick<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.210> flaky<00:02:31.630> bits<00:02:31.810> but<00:02:32.140> it

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
really stick to the flaky bits but it

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.380 
really stick to the flaky bits but it
just<00:02:32.530> gives<00:02:32.770> me<00:02:32.860> that<00:02:32.980> coverage<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:33.880> it<00:02:34.030> stays

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
just gives me that coverage and it stays

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.870 
just gives me that coverage and it stays
on<00:02:34.600> this<00:02:35.350> is<00:02:35.620> a<00:02:35.650> bit<00:02:35.980> on<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.220> pricey<00:02:36.370> side<00:02:36.640> i

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
on this is a bit on the pricey side i

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.930 
on this is a bit on the pricey side i
think<00:02:37.270> it<00:02:37.390> was<00:02:37.510> 15<00:02:38.350> pounds<00:02:38.770> and<00:02:39.550> so<00:02:39.700> if<00:02:39.820> you're

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
think it was 15 pounds and so if you're

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.630 
think it was 15 pounds and so if you're
looking<00:02:40.030> for<00:02:40.209> something<00:02:40.480> more<00:02:41.400> affordable<00:02:42.400> i

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
looking for something more affordable i

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.480 
looking for something more affordable i
would<00:02:42.970> recommend<00:02:43.060> natural<00:02:43.450> collection

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
would recommend natural collection

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.650 
would recommend natural collection
concealer<00:02:45.490> it<00:02:45.700> still<00:02:45.910> just<00:02:45.940> a<00:02:46.120> job<00:02:46.330> although<00:02:46.630> I

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
concealer it still just a job although I

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.390 
concealer it still just a job although I
find<00:02:46.990> that<00:02:47.200> you<00:02:47.500> have<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:47.830> blend<00:02:48.040> it<00:02:48.250> quite

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
find that you have to blend it quite

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.910 
find that you have to blend it quite
quickly<00:02:48.520> because<00:02:49.030> it<00:02:49.150> dries<00:02:49.360> up<00:02:49.570> fast<00:02:49.920> but

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
quickly because it dries up fast but

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.199 
quickly because it dries up fast but
yeah<00:02:51.100> I've<00:02:51.220> been<00:02:51.400> really<00:02:51.730> enjoying<00:02:51.850> both

skin the only thing I would say about

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.250 
skin the only thing I would say about

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
this is that when you use a brush I

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.330 
this is that when you use a brush I
would<00:03:05.440> recommend<00:03:05.680> putting<00:03:05.890> on<00:03:06.070> the<00:03:06.190> back<00:03:06.310> of

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340

your<00:03:06.550> hand<00:03:06.760> first<00:03:06.940> and<00:03:07.180> then<00:03:07.330> onto<00:03:07.480> your<00:03:07.660> face

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
your hand first and then onto your face

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.300 
your hand first and then onto your face

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
because the boys it comes out quite

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.610 
because the boys it comes out quite
streaky<00:03:09.940> but<00:03:10.810> other<00:03:10.930> than<00:03:11.019> that<00:03:11.080> it<00:03:11.320> lasts<00:03:11.560> a
