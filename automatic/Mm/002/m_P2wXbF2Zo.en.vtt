the<00:00:19.170> cheapest<00:00:19.470> one<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.859> eight<00:00:20.160> dollars<00:00:20.520> and

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
the cheapest one is eight dollars and

the cheapest one is eight dollars and
most<00:00:21.090> expensive<00:00:21.359> one<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.920> 2495<00:00:22.920> with<00:00:23.519> this

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
most expensive one is 2495 with this

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.820 
most expensive one is 2495 with this
program<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.060> can<00:00:24.210> get<00:00:24.330> them<00:00:24.420> for<00:00:24.570> free<00:00:24.830> so

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
program you can get them for free so

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.339 
program you can get them for free so
after<00:00:25.949> even<00:00:26.250> download<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.000> program<00:00:27.359> you<00:00:28.109> open

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
after even download the program you open

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.650 
after even download the program you open
it<00:00:28.410> up<00:00:28.939> and<00:00:29.939> you'll<00:00:30.060> get<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.240> screen<00:00:30.539> like<00:00:30.570> this

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
it up and you'll get a screen like this

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.360 
it up and you'll get a screen like this
you<00:00:33.660> will<00:00:33.840> browse<00:00:34.079> for<00:00:34.380> your<00:00:34.410> rsbot<00:00:34.980> folder

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
you will browse for your rsbot folder

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.459 
you will browse for your rsbot folder
which<00:00:35.520> should<00:00:35.790> be<00:00:35.940> named<00:00:36.180> bot<00:00:36.690> client<00:00:37.260> and

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
which should be named bot client and

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.990 
which should be named bot client and
then<00:00:37.980> hit<00:00:38.129> OK<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.460> you'll<00:00:39.329> hit<00:00:39.809> patch<00:00:40.140> client

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
then hit OK and you'll hit patch client

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.290 
then hit OK and you'll hit patch client
now<00:00:42.000> it's<00:00:42.649> patching<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.850> client<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.120> does

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
now it's patching the client so it does

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.970 
now it's patching the client so it does
it<00:00:46.460> like<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.489> link<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.750> our<00:00:48.780> spots<00:00:49.320> net<00:00:49.770> to

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
it like a link to our spots net to

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.209 
it like a link to our spots net to
verify<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.840> authorization<00:00:51.840> code<00:00:52.219> so

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
verify the authorization code so

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.250 
verify the authorization code so
therefore<00:00:53.430> any<00:00:54.030> authorization<00:00:54.930> code<00:00:55.110> it

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
therefore any authorization code it

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.849 
therefore any authorization code it
generates<00:00:55.680> will<00:00:56.160> work<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:57.469> it'll<00:00:58.469> take<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.800> a

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
generates will work and it'll take it a

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.490 
generates will work and it'll take it a
second<00:00:59.219> then<00:00:59.340> it'll<00:00:59.520> pop<00:00:59.670> back<00:00:59.879> up<00:01:00.230> then<00:01:01.230> after

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
second then it'll pop back up then after

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.910 
second then it'll pop back up then after
that<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.770> will<00:01:02.030> unlock<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.539> drop-down<00:01:04.500> box

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
that it will unlock this drop-down box

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.100 
that it will unlock this drop-down box
you<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:05.460> pick<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.909> bot<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.840> want<00:01:07.020> a

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
using this program there for the fake

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.450 
using this program there for the fake
mine<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.549> second<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.090> pop<00:01:30.270> up<00:01:31.280> so<00:01:32.280> we'll<00:01:32.430> just

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460
