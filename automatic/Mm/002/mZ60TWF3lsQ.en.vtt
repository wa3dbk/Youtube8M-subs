00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.589
 very good consoleros build 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.540
 will appear here to show you a model 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.809
 East of the fire there are two 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:17.590
 1 although silly 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:19.390
 but in truth this is the proven author 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.119
 to do it if it does not come out yet I think that 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.980
 part the list or something in order here had 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:28.300
 polarization high points and so on 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.910
 in twine so they would not take me 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.180
 well I know that they are going to not be me 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.160
 bad 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.250
 and nothing and the top is the sinking 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.500
 of data to everyone each fall and we 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.500
 let's go and we join and more 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.140
 it is very easy the truth 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.420
 of against and so on we are going to count the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.969
 first simple tomorrow is fine where 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.449
 I was already in addition you have to spend there 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.449
 let's go 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.100
 with the things you're beautiful is a 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.100
 monitor detail 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.840
 I believe that this game will have more 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:13.710
 still what happens that of course is so 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.740
 big and white is walking 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.910
 quietly oblivious to what is 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.910
 point to happen 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.930
 now we're going here for the cabin of the 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.930
 captain 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:34.549
 I sweat sharks and we have to 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:36.640
 the poor octopus colleague bring you for a 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.500
 window life 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.770
 until we are waiting for the 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.170
 pull these we can cut command I know that 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.570
 they do not do manuela while we are 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.600
 cubatas but hurry because my 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.540
 family look 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.320
 the coso more beautiful details 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.370
 the clearly followed a walker and 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.880
 says a crack 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:03.300
 It seems like a crack and it's not over 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:07.490
 today the subject but we are going nothing and that is 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.490
 all social until next time
