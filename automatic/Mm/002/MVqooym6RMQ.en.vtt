00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
little sundial stationary engine I did

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.189 
little sundial stationary engine I did
buy<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.949> brand<00:00:29.340> new<00:00:29.490> old<00:00:30.029> stock<00:00:30.210> gear<00:00:30.660> off<00:00:30.810> eBay

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
buy a brand new old stock gear off eBay

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.250 
buy a brand new old stock gear off eBay
for<00:00:31.260> like<00:00:31.590> 30<00:00:32.099> bucks<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:32.940> not<00:00:33.899> particularly

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
for like 30 bucks so not particularly

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.500 
for like 30 bucks so not particularly
expensive<00:00:34.680> but<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.579> does<00:00:35.790> look<00:00:35.969> like<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.300> same

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
expensive but it does look like the same

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.770 
expensive but it does look like the same
gear<00:00:37.760> I'll<00:00:38.760> have<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.090> take<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.390> off<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.629> have<00:00:39.719> a

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
gear I'll have to take it off and have a

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.940 
gear I'll have to take it off and have a
look<00:00:39.989> but<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.230> looks<00:00:40.350> exactly<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.890> same<00:00:41.629> so

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
look but it looks exactly the same so

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.319 
look but it looks exactly the same so
I'm<00:00:43.950> guessing<00:00:44.370> this<00:00:44.460> came<00:00:44.670> off<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> sundial

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
I'm guessing this came off a sundial

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.959 
I'm guessing this came off a sundial
engine<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.410> one<00:00:46.590> didn't<00:00:47.010> but<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.850> was

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
engine this one didn't but I was

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.670 
engine this one didn't but I was
originally<00:00:48.420> going<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.629> fit<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.899> up<00:00:49.020> with<00:00:49.530> this

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
originally going to fit it up with this

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.830 
originally going to fit it up with this

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
drive gear that's a Bosch ze1 they're

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.260 
drive gear that's a Bosch ze1 they're
normally<00:00:55.620> about<00:00:55.820> two<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.969> three<00:00:57.000> hundred

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
normally about two to three hundred

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.380 
normally about two to three hundred
dollars<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:58.020> rebuilt<00:00:58.469> condition<00:00:59.129> not<00:00:59.969> much<00:01:00.180> in

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
dollars in rebuilt condition not much in

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.849 
dollars in rebuilt condition not much in
the<00:01:00.449> condition<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:01.109> in<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.350> do<00:01:01.530> get<00:01:01.829> a

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
the condition that it's in I do get a

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.860 
the condition that it's in I do get a
brilliant<00:01:02.430> spark<00:01:02.760> across<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.329> points<00:01:03.719> but

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
brilliant spark across the points but

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.929 
brilliant spark across the points but
nothing<00:01:04.229> else<00:01:04.409> nothing<00:01:05.339> coming<00:01:05.670> out<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
nothing else nothing coming out the

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.300 
nothing else nothing coming out the
high-tension<00:01:06.390> lead<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.770> I'm<00:01:07.890> thinking<00:01:08.250> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
high-tension lead so I'm thinking the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.219 
high-tension lead so I'm thinking the
condenser<00:01:08.880> or<00:01:09.090> something<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.540> failed<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:10.110> it

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
condenser or something is failed in it

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.020 
condenser or something is failed in it
and<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.710> just<00:01:10.890> haven't<00:01:11.040> had<00:01:11.159> time<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.610> rebuild

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
and I just haven't had time to rebuild

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.320 
and I just haven't had time to rebuild
it<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.250> still<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> good<00:01:14.760> still<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> good

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
it so it is still a good still a good

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.039 
it so it is still a good still a good
za1

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
za1

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.260 
za1
it<00:01:16.229> just<00:01:16.439> needs<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.680> bit<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.830> TLC<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.640> some<00:01:17.850> parts

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
it just needs a bit of TLC in some parts

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.300 
it just needs a bit of TLC in some parts
which<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.259> hard<00:01:19.470> part<00:01:19.710> because<00:01:20.009> no<00:01:20.159> one

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
which is the hard part because no one

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.859 
which is the hard part because no one
wants<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.610> sell<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.939> parts<00:01:21.299> they<00:01:21.420> want<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.750> to

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
wants to sell the parts they want you to

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.140 
wants to sell the parts they want you to
send<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.259> them<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.740> get<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:22.979> rebuilt<00:01:23.159> so

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
send it to them to get it rebuilt so

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.580 
send it to them to get it rebuilt so
they<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.420> make<00:01:24.570> extra<00:01:24.930> money<00:01:24.960> on<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.409> I

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
they can make extra money on it I

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.499 
they can make extra money on it I
haven't<00:01:26.400> been<00:01:26.490> out<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.640> find<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:27.000> rebuild<00:01:27.420> kit

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.819 
a problem and maybe not it's interesting
that's<00:02:00.090> they<00:02:00.299> are<00:02:00.329> an<00:02:00.570> angle<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.229> Mike<00:02:01.380> might

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
that's they are an angle and Mike might

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.510 
that's they are an angle and Mike might
not<00:02:01.979> be<00:02:02.100> an<00:02:02.219> issue<00:02:02.420> and<00:02:03.740> that's<00:02:04.740> advanced<00:02:05.369> and

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
not be an issue and that's advanced and

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.940 
not be an issue and that's advanced and
retard

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
retard

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.380 
retard
it<00:02:07.950> also<00:02:08.099> has<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.340> little<00:02:08.429> latch<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:09.060> lock<00:02:09.090> on

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
it also has a little latch to lock on

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.970 
it also has a little latch to lock on
there

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.560 

so<00:02:12.980> you<00:02:13.040> can<00:02:13.460> advance<00:02:13.850> and<00:02:14.120> retard<00:02:14.420> the

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
so you can advance and retard the

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:20.020 
so you can advance and retard the
ignition<00:02:15.110> timing<00:02:15.680> on<00:02:16.070> the<00:02:16.670> fly<00:02:16.910> so<00:02:18.520> yeah<00:02:19.520> let's

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
ignition timing on the fly so yeah let's

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.340 
ignition timing on the fly so yeah let's
have<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.210> quick<00:02:20.480> look<00:02:20.690> at<00:02:20.900> it

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
have a quick look at it

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.120 
have a quick look at it
open<00:02:22.160> up<00:02:22.280> clean<00:02:22.730> it<00:02:23.620> let's<00:02:24.620> clean<00:02:24.890> all<00:02:25.040> the

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
open up clean it let's clean all the

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.590 
open up clean it let's clean all the
crap<00:02:25.340> off<00:02:25.490> the<00:02:25.520> outside

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
crap off the outside

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.500 
crap off the outside
don't<00:02:27.230> take<00:02:27.470> this<00:02:27.620> extra<00:02:28.280> bracket<00:02:28.730> off<00:02:28.970> the

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
don't take this extra bracket off the

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.700 
don't take this extra bracket off the
bracket<00:02:29.750> doesn't<00:02:30.170> seem<00:02:30.350> to<00:02:30.470> be<00:02:30.560> necessary

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
bracket doesn't seem to be necessary

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.290 
bracket doesn't seem to be necessary
because<00:02:31.250> I've<00:02:31.490> already<00:02:31.580> got<00:02:31.850> one<00:02:31.880> on<00:02:32.090> the

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
because I've already got one on the

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.550 
because I've already got one on the
engine<00:02:34.750> yeah<00:02:35.750> it's<00:02:35.900> an<00:02:35.990> interesting<00:02:36.140> old

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
engine yeah it's an interesting old

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.150 
engine yeah it's an interesting old
magneto<00:02:37.690> this<00:02:38.690> essentially<00:02:39.200> replaces<00:02:39.830> a

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
magneto this essentially replaces a

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.420 
magneto this essentially replaces a
flywheel<00:02:41.060> magnet<00:02:41.630> and<00:02:41.870> a<00:02:41.930> coil<00:02:42.230> you<00:02:43.130> look<00:02:43.280> at<00:02:43.370> a

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
flywheel magnet and a coil you look at a

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.840 
flywheel magnet and a coil you look at a
modern<00:02:43.640> engine<00:02:44.920> that<00:02:45.920> has<00:02:46.130> magnets<00:02:46.700> embedded

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
modern engine that has magnets embedded

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.300 
modern engine that has magnets embedded
in<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.270> flywheel<00:02:47.810> and<00:02:48.020> a<00:02:48.500> coil<00:02:48.800> on<00:02:49.010> it

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
in the flywheel and a coil on it

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.490 
in the flywheel and a coil on it
this<00:02:49.730> essentially<00:02:50.270> replaces<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:50.900> same<00:02:51.140> thing

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
this essentially replaces the same thing

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.550 
this essentially replaces the same thing
that<00:02:52.040> has<00:02:52.250> points<00:02:52.790> condenser<00:02:53.420> coil<00:02:54.290> and

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
that has points condenser coil and

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.449 
that has points condenser coil and
magnet<00:02:54.620> all<00:02:55.280> in<00:02:55.490> one<00:02:55.760> it's<00:02:56.090> a<00:02:56.180> magneto<00:02:57.459> multi

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
magnet all in one it's a magneto multi

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.190 
magnet all in one it's a magneto multi
cylinder<00:02:58.790> engines<00:02:59.180> have<00:02:59.390> a<00:02:59.420> distributor<00:02:59.990> cap

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
cylinder engines have a distributor cap

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.500 
cylinder engines have a distributor cap
on<00:03:00.380> top<00:03:00.620> of<00:03:00.770> them<00:03:00.920> with<00:03:01.670> multiple<00:03:02.090> outputs

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
on top of them with multiple outputs

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.260 
on top of them with multiple outputs
this<00:03:02.720> is<00:03:02.870> a<00:03:02.900> single<00:03:03.380> cylinder<00:03:04.040> engine<00:03:04.160> coil<00:03:04.910> so

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
this is a single cylinder engine coil so

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.070 
this is a single cylinder engine coil so
or<00:03:05.810> magneto<00:03:06.290> so<00:03:06.740> that's<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.520> only<00:03:07.760> output

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
or magneto so that's the only output

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.600 
or magneto so that's the only output
it's<00:03:09.080> degraded<00:03:09.709> but<00:03:09.860> it's<00:03:09.980> still<00:03:10.160> intact

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
it's degraded but it's still intact

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.130 
it's degraded but it's still intact
enough<00:03:10.970> to<00:03:11.150> be<00:03:11.240> used<00:03:11.740> cleaned<00:03:12.740> up<00:03:12.950> and<00:03:13.100> used

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
enough to be used cleaned up and used

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.190 
enough to be used cleaned up and used
yeah<00:03:15.140> that's<00:03:15.920> a<00:03:16.010> horseshoe<00:03:16.340> magnet<00:03:17.050> same<00:03:18.050> with

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
yeah that's a horseshoe magnet same with

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.570 
yeah that's a horseshoe magnet same with
those<00:03:18.350> two<00:03:18.620> there<00:03:18.650> they're<00:03:19.100> horseshoe

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580

Tamara<00:04:21.490> when<00:04:21.730> Bosch<00:04:21.940> started<00:04:22.480> making

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
Tamara when Bosch started making

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.900 
Tamara when Bosch started making
Magneto's<00:04:23.860> but<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:26.160> trademark<00:04:27.160> symbol<00:04:27.700> the

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
Magneto's but the trademark symbol the

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.950 
Magneto's but the trademark symbol the
circle<00:04:28.450> with<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.690> two<00:04:29.040> poles<00:04:30.720> rotating<00:04:31.720> poles

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
circle with the two poles rotating poles

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.230 
circle with the two poles rotating poles
inside<00:04:32.440> it<00:04:32.650> is<00:04:32.980> based<00:04:33.850> on<00:04:34.030> a<00:04:34.060> magneto<00:04:36.240> yeah

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
inside it is based on a magneto yeah

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.630 
inside it is based on a magneto yeah
that<00:04:37.480> one<00:04:37.660> there<00:04:39.360> was<00:04:40.360> either<00:04:40.510> two<00:04:41.640> rotating

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
that one there was either two rotating

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.510 
that one there was either two rotating
poles<00:04:42.910> and<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:43.360> outer<00:04:43.570> casing<00:04:47.250> okay<00:04:48.250> well

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
poles and the outer casing okay well

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.490 
poles and the outer casing okay well
after<00:04:48.850> a<00:04:49.060> bit<00:04:49.180> of<00:04:49.210> a<00:04:49.330> cleanup<00:04:49.600> this<00:04:49.930> one<00:04:50.140> shows

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
after a bit of a cleanup this one shows

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.630 
after a bit of a cleanup this one shows
a<00:04:50.530> bit<00:04:50.800> more<00:04:50.980> promise<00:04:51.400> in<00:04:51.640> the<00:04:52.020> z1<00:04:53.020> I<00:04:53.640> am

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
a bit more promise in the z1 I am

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.110 
a bit more promise in the z1 I am
getting<00:04:54.940> a<00:04:54.970> spark<00:04:55.270> off<00:04:55.510> the<00:04:55.690> output<00:04:56.080> to<00:04:56.680> ground

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
getting a spark off the output to ground

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.570 
getting a spark off the output to ground
but<00:04:58.120> not<00:04:58.360> much<00:04:58.600> I<00:04:58.930> put<00:04:59.920> my<00:05:00.070> hand<00:05:00.250> across<00:05:00.370> the

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
but not much I put my hand across the

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.550 
but not much I put my hand across the
across<00:05:01.210> it<00:05:01.480> and<00:05:01.570> spun<00:05:01.840> it<00:05:01.960> over<00:05:02.260> and<00:05:02.410> it's

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
across it and spun it over and it's

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
across it and spun it over and it's
enough<00:05:02.770> to<00:05:02.860> give<00:05:03.010> you<00:05:03.100> a<00:05:03.190> little<00:05:03.310> bit<00:05:03.430> of<00:05:03.550> a

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
enough to give you a little bit of a

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.240 
enough to give you a little bit of a
tickle<00:05:04.210> but<00:05:04.390> that's<00:05:04.690> about<00:05:04.930> it<00:05:05.170> it's<00:05:06.010> not<00:05:06.190> very

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
tickle but that's about it it's not very

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.940 
tickle but that's about it it's not very
strong<00:05:06.840> we<00:05:07.840> get<00:05:07.990> a<00:05:08.020> nice<00:05:08.170> pop<00:05:08.470> across<00:05:08.800> the

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
strong we get a nice pop across the

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.040 
strong we get a nice pop across the
points<00:05:09.370> so<00:05:09.760> again<00:05:10.150> I'm<00:05:10.300> guessing<00:05:10.750> the

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
points so again I'm guessing the

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.740 
points so again I'm guessing the
condenser<00:05:11.860> might<00:05:12.010> be<00:05:12.160> bad<00:05:12.400> I'll<00:05:13.300> get<00:05:13.570> the

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
condenser might be bad I'll get the

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.010 
condenser might be bad I'll get the
points<00:05:14.140> out<00:05:14.320> bit<00:05:15.100> and<00:05:15.430> it<00:05:16.120> improved<00:05:16.570> things<00:05:16.780> a

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
points out bit and it improved things a

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.310 
points out bit and it improved things a
tiny<00:05:17.260> bit<00:05:17.500> but<00:05:18.660> overall<00:05:19.660> the<00:05:19.930> rest<00:05:20.110> of<00:05:20.230> it

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
tiny bit but overall the rest of it

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.660 
tiny bit but overall the rest of it
seems<00:05:20.530> pretty<00:05:20.710> all<00:05:20.860> right<00:05:21.040> I<00:05:21.070> just<00:05:21.400> haven't

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 
seems pretty all right I just haven't

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.410 
seems pretty all right I just haven't
torn<00:05:21.940> it<00:05:22.080> completely<00:05:23.080> apart<00:05:23.200> so<00:05:24.010> I'm<00:05:24.970> thinking

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
torn it completely apart so I'm thinking

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.910 
torn it completely apart so I'm thinking
that's<00:05:25.510> what<00:05:25.690> I<00:05:25.750> need<00:05:25.960> to<00:05:26.080> do<00:05:26.230> next<00:05:26.500> is

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:26.920 
that's what I need to do next is

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.970 
that's what I need to do next is
actually<00:05:27.990> strip<00:05:28.990> it<00:05:29.110> down<00:05:29.350> or<00:05:29.530> at<00:05:29.590> least<00:05:29.620> strip

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
actually strip it down or at least strip

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.700 
actually strip it down or at least strip
this<00:05:30.130> end<00:05:30.400> off<00:05:30.640> and<00:05:31.030> find<00:05:31.270> the<00:05:31.390> condenser<00:05:31.990> it's

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
this end off and find the condenser it's

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.820 
this end off and find the condenser it's
probably<00:05:33.130> an<00:05:33.250> old<00:05:33.400> mica<00:05:33.760> type<00:05:34.390> condenser<00:05:34.840> but

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
probably an old mica type condenser but

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:36.960 
probably an old mica type condenser but
I<00:05:35.860> might<00:05:36.070> be<00:05:36.100> able<00:05:36.340> to<00:05:36.400> replace<00:05:36.640> it<00:05:36.790> with<00:05:36.820> a

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
I might be able to replace it with a

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.360 
I might be able to replace it with a
point<00:05:37.210> four<00:05:37.450> seven<00:05:37.720> micro<00:05:38.170> farad<00:05:38.500> poly<00:05:39.070> film

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
point four seven micro farad poly film

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.330 
point four seven micro farad poly film
capacitor<00:05:40.530> which<00:05:41.530> is<00:05:41.680> what<00:05:41.830> I've<00:05:41.950> done<00:05:42.100> to<00:05:42.310> a

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
capacitor which is what I've done to a

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.890 
capacitor which is what I've done to a
couple<00:05:42.640> of<00:05:42.730> Magneto's<00:05:43.210> in<00:05:43.360> the<00:05:43.450> past<00:05:45.360> so<00:05:46.360> yeah

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
couple of Magneto's in the past so yeah

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:52.790 
couple of Magneto's in the past so yeah
it<00:05:47.260> will<00:05:47.440> work<00:05:48.150> its<00:05:49.150> advance<00:05:49.840> and<00:05:50.080> retard

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.020 

there's<00:05:53.800> supposed<00:05:54.010> to<00:05:54.070> be<00:05:54.130> a<00:05:54.220> dowel<00:05:54.490> pin<00:05:54.820> in

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030 
there's supposed to be a dowel pin in

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.840 
there's supposed to be a dowel pin in
there<00:05:55.240> but<00:05:55.450> it's<00:05:55.630> a<00:05:56.070> hasn't<00:05:57.070> broken<00:05:57.490> off<00:05:57.700> it

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850 
there but it's a hasn't broken off it

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.620 
there but it's a hasn't broken off it
seems<00:05:58.060> to<00:05:58.240> recede<00:05:58.690> atoms<00:05:59.050> of<00:05:59.230> the<00:06:00.630> housing

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630 
seems to recede atoms of the housing

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.730 
seems to recede atoms of the housing
here<00:06:03.120> you<00:06:04.120> know<00:06:04.270> that<00:06:04.390> pin<00:06:04.720> there's<00:06:05.080> receded

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
here you know that pin there's receded

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.940 
here you know that pin there's receded
in<00:06:05.860> almost<00:06:06.220> completely<00:06:06.910> so<00:06:07.560> it's<00:06:08.560> supposed<00:06:08.770> to

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:08.950 
in almost completely so it's supposed to

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:14.890 
in almost completely so it's supposed to
sit<00:06:09.130> in<00:06:09.250> that<00:06:09.280> groove<00:06:09.670> on<00:06:09.850> the<00:06:10.000> outside

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.520 

the<00:06:15.410> other<00:06:15.710> way<00:06:17.020> there<00:06:18.020> are<00:06:18.080> a<00:06:18.110> nice<00:06:18.229> bit<00:06:18.440> of

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.530 
the other way there are a nice bit of

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.379 
the other way there are a nice bit of
gear<00:06:18.740> it<00:06:19.040> just<00:06:19.100> needs<00:06:19.460> a<00:06:19.550> bit<00:06:19.639> of<00:06:19.699> tender

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:20.389 
gear it just needs a bit of tender

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:24.640 
gear it just needs a bit of tender
loving<00:06:20.660> care<00:06:21.100> I'll<00:06:22.389> open<00:06:23.389> it<00:06:23.509> up<00:06:23.630> and<00:06:23.870> see<00:06:24.470> what

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
loving care I'll open it up and see what

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:25.900 
loving care I'll open it up and see what
it's<00:06:24.770> got<00:06:24.919> in<00:06:25.009> the<00:06:25.100> way<00:06:25.220> of<00:06:25.370> a<00:06:25.430> condenser

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:25.910 
it's got in the way of a condenser

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.050 
it's got in the way of a condenser
whether<00:06:26.060> it's<00:06:26.240> a<00:06:26.300> micro<00:06:26.630> condenser<00:06:27.199> or

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060 
whether it's a micro condenser or

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.730 
whether it's a micro condenser or
electrolytic<00:06:29.590> again<00:06:30.590> I<00:06:30.620> can't<00:06:30.919> remove<00:06:31.220> the

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:32.740 
electrolytic again I can't remove the

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.350 
electrolytic again I can't remove the
output<00:06:33.740> post<00:06:34.070> without<00:06:34.729> drilling<00:06:35.150> these

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 
output post without drilling these

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.120 
output post without drilling these
screws<00:06:35.840> out<00:06:36.110> so<00:06:36.410> I'm<00:06:36.560> probably<00:06:36.740> gonna<00:06:36.949> have<00:06:37.070> to

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.130 
screws out so I'm probably gonna have to

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:42.580 
screws out so I'm probably gonna have to
do<00:06:37.280> that<00:06:37.460> as<00:06:37.610> well<00:06:38.470> cuz<00:06:40.180> yeah<00:06:41.199> I've<00:06:42.199> tried

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:42.590 
do that as well cuz yeah I've tried

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.590 
do that as well cuz yeah I've tried
removing<00:06:42.800> him<00:06:43.160> as<00:06:43.310> it<00:06:43.759> has<00:06:44.000> the<00:06:44.180> previous

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:44.600 
removing him as it has the previous

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.210 
removing him as it has the previous
owner<00:06:44.900> you<00:06:45.199> can<00:06:45.289> see<00:06:45.440> it's<00:06:45.590> all<00:06:45.710> chipped<00:06:46.039> and

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:46.220 
owner you can see it's all chipped and

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.540 
owner you can see it's all chipped and
blasted<00:06:46.850> away<00:06:46.970> by<00:06:47.800> hammering<00:06:48.800> screwdrivers

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.550 
blasted away by hammering screwdrivers

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.040 
blasted away by hammering screwdrivers
in<00:06:49.669> there<00:06:49.880> most<00:06:50.060> of<00:06:50.210> that<00:06:50.360> wasn't<00:06:50.660> even<00:06:50.750> mine

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.050 
in there most of that wasn't even mine

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.760 
in there most of that wasn't even mine
that<00:06:51.620> was<00:06:51.740> how<00:06:51.860> as<00:06:51.919> I<00:06:52.070> how<00:06:52.430> I<00:06:52.460> found<00:06:52.789> it

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:53.770 
that was how as I how I found it

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.080 
that was how as I how I found it
so<00:06:54.770> I'm<00:06:54.860> guessing<00:06:55.250> they<00:06:55.370> gave<00:06:55.550> up<00:06:55.760> trying<00:06:55.910> to

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:56.090 
so I'm guessing they gave up trying to

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.700 
so I'm guessing they gave up trying to
fix<00:06:56.300> it<00:06:56.510> because<00:06:56.600> I'm<00:06:57.050> guessing<00:06:57.260> either<00:06:57.530> the

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:57.710 
fix it because I'm guessing either the

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.340 
fix it because I'm guessing either the
condensers<00:06:58.190> part<00:06:58.460> of<00:06:58.580> the<00:06:58.669> output<00:06:58.850> post<00:06:59.350> which

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:00.350 
condensers part of the output post which

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.159 
condensers part of the output post which
doesn't<00:07:00.889> make<00:07:00.979> any<00:07:01.220> sense<00:07:01.430> or<00:07:01.930> the<00:07:02.930> actual

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:03.169 
doesn't make any sense or the actual

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:05.890 
doesn't make any sense or the actual
installations<00:07:03.860> breaking<00:07:04.280> down<00:07:04.900> because

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:05.900 
installations breaking down because

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.600 
installations breaking down because
sometimes<00:07:06.289> it<00:07:06.440> sparks<00:07:06.830> sometimes<00:07:07.250> it<00:07:07.400> doesn't

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:07.610 
sometimes it sparks sometimes it doesn't

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.400 
sometimes it sparks sometimes it doesn't
so<00:07:08.180> I'm<00:07:08.240> guessing<00:07:08.570> this<00:07:08.660> is<00:07:08.720> also<00:07:09.139> breaking

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:09.410 
so I'm guessing this is also breaking

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.200 
so I'm guessing this is also breaking
down<00:07:09.590> in<00:07:09.919> an<00:07:10.039> in<00:07:10.250> addition<00:07:10.669> to<00:07:10.789> a<00:07:10.820> condenser

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:11.210 
down in an in addition to a condenser

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:16.330 
down in an in addition to a condenser
issue<00:07:12.729> yeah<00:07:13.930> same<00:07:14.930> gear<00:07:15.229> that's<00:07:15.860> a<00:07:15.949> Sun<00:07:16.160> Dial

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:16.340 
issue yeah same gear that's a Sun Dial

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.790 
issue yeah same gear that's a Sun Dial
gear<00:07:16.789> so<00:07:17.419> this<00:07:17.660> should<00:07:17.840> bolt<00:07:18.050> straight<00:07:18.380> on<00:07:18.560> and

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800 
gear so this should bolt straight on and

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.730 
gear so this should bolt straight on and
I<00:07:19.340> could<00:07:19.639> even<00:07:19.970> feed<00:07:20.690> those<00:07:20.870> little<00:07:21.289> sundial

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:21.740 
I could even feed those little sundial

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.450 
I could even feed those little sundial
some<00:07:22.010> LPG<00:07:22.639> and<00:07:23.360> see<00:07:23.570> what<00:07:23.750> happens<00:07:24.460> anyway

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:25.460 
some LPG and see what happens anyway

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.389 
some LPG and see what happens anyway
thanks<00:07:26.000> for<00:07:26.030> watching
