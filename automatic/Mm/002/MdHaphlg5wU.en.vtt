hey folks Matt from our to the image
comm<00:00:02.700> just<00:00:03.330> going<00:00:03.570> over<00:00:03.689> the<00:00:03.840> new<00:00:04.170> Sony<00:00:05.509> nex-5n

00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:06.589 
comm just going over the new Sony nex-5n

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:09.100 
comm just going over the new Sony nex-5n
Sony<00:00:07.589> is<00:00:07.830> just<00:00:08.099> popping<00:00:08.610> out

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.110 
Sony is just popping out

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.120 
Sony is just popping out
boom-boom-boom-boom-boom<00:00:10.110> cameras<00:00:10.950> right

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
boom-boom-boom-boom-boom cameras right

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.950 
boom-boom-boom-boom-boom cameras right
now<00:00:11.570> this<00:00:12.799> nex-5n<00:00:13.849> looks<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:15.000> be<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.330> really

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
now this nex-5n looks to be a really

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.019 
now this nex-5n looks to be a really
cool<00:00:16.470> machine<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.430> think<00:00:17.760> maybe<00:00:18.539> this<00:00:18.930> might<00:00:19.199> be

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.029 
cool machine I think maybe this might be

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.730 
cool machine I think maybe this might be
the<00:00:21.029> best<00:00:21.330> small<00:00:22.490> camera<00:00:23.490> for<00:00:23.730> video<00:00:24.740> you

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
the best small camera for video you

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.529 
the best small camera for video you
could<00:00:25.830> say<00:00:26.039> an<00:00:26.130> evil<00:00:26.490> camera<00:00:26.910> typically<00:00:27.330> we

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
could say an evil camera typically we

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.240 
could say an evil camera typically we
think<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.869> four<00:00:28.439> thirds<00:00:28.710> with<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:28.980> Evo

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
think of four thirds with the Evo

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.980 
think of four thirds with the Evo
cameras<00:00:29.640> like<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.939> Olympus<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.630> panties

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
cameras like the Olympus and the panties

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.819 
cameras like the Olympus and the panties
but<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:31.920> has<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.520> full<00:00:32.969> aps-c<00:00:33.809> sensor<00:00:34.530> in<00:00:34.680> it

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
but this has a full aps-c sensor in it

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.100 
but this has a full aps-c sensor in it
so<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.040> have<00:00:35.219> better<00:00:35.430> image<00:00:35.910> quality<00:00:36.210> yet

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
so you have better image quality yet

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.319 
so you have better image quality yet
you're<00:00:37.469> getting<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.829> camera<00:00:38.129> that's<00:00:38.550> pretty

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
you're getting a camera that's pretty

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.720 
you're getting a camera that's pretty
much<00:00:40.100> the<00:00:41.100> smallest<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.790> batch<00:00:42.050> so<00:00:43.730> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
much the smallest in the batch so the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.819 
much the smallest in the batch so the
big<00:00:44.910> differences<00:00:45.360> between<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.780> 5n<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
big differences between the 5n and the

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.810 
big differences between the 5n and the
previous<00:00:47.370> five<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.899> it's<00:00:49.110> gone<00:00:49.320> from

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
previous five is that it's gone from

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.220 
previous five is that it's gone from
14.2<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.149> 5<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.989> 16.1<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.340> 5n<00:00:54.230> it's

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
14.2 in the 5 to 16.1 in the 5n it's

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.650 
14.2 in the 5 to 16.1 in the 5n it's
added<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.860> top<00:00:56.160> plate<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.520> magnesium<00:00:57.210> Ali<00:00:57.420> so

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
added a top plate of magnesium Ali so

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.260 
added a top plate of magnesium Ali so
there's<00:00:57.870> more<00:00:58.500> magnesium<00:00:59.010> alloy<00:00:59.550> in<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.000> body

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
there's more magnesium alloy in the body

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.709 
there's more magnesium alloy in the body
on<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.660> 5<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.140> 10<00:01:02.070> frames<00:01:02.789> per<00:01:02.910> second<00:01:03.510> on<00:01:03.600> the

on the 5 and 10 frames per second on the

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.590 
on the 5 and 10 frames per second on the
new<00:01:03.840> 5<00:01:04.110> n<00:01:04.350> versus<00:01:04.830> 7<00:01:05.640> frames<00:01:05.820> per<00:01:06.150> second<00:01:06.540> on

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
new 5 n versus 7 frames per second on

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.000 
new 5 n versus 7 frames per second on
the<00:01:06.689> older<00:01:06.960> 5<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:08.270> we've<00:01:09.270> added<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:10.049> electronic

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
the older 5 and we've added a electronic

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.359 
the older 5 and we've added a electronic
viewfinder<00:01:11.700> via<00:01:11.909> optional<00:01:12.450> accessory<00:01:13.369> LCD

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369

touchscreen lens aberration control and
a<00:01:18.240> biggie<00:01:18.509> here<00:01:18.869> for<00:01:19.110> video<00:01:19.290> we've<00:01:19.770> got<00:01:19.799> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
a biggie here for video we've got the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.300 
a biggie here for video we've got the
1080<00:01:20.670> HD<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:21.600> 60<00:01:22.140> P<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.619> 60<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.900> fantastic<00:01:24.900> there

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
1080 HD in 60 P and 60 I fantastic there

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.100 
1080 HD in 60 P and 60 I fantastic there
we've<00:01:26.310> also<00:01:26.490> got<00:01:26.759> ISO<00:01:27.119> sensitivity<00:01:27.360> up<00:01:27.960> to

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
we've also got ISO sensitivity up to

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.530 
we've also got ISO sensitivity up to
25,000<00:01:29.100> 600<00:01:29.909> now<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.680> has<00:01:32.540> electronic

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
25,000 600 now so it has electronic

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.590 
25,000 600 now so it has electronic
first<00:01:33.810> curtain<00:01:34.079> shutter<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:36.060> sensor<00:01:36.570> is

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
first curtain shutter so this sensor is

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.899 
first curtain shutter so this sensor is
by<00:01:37.530> all<00:01:37.680> intensive<00:01:38.130> purposes<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.610> sensor

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
by all intensive purposes in the sensor

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.929 
by all intensive purposes in the sensor
that's<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.270> d7000<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.229> D<00:01:40.380> 5100<00:01:41.340> the

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
that's in the d7000 the D 5100 the

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.440 
that's in the d7000 the D 5100 the
Pentax<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.259> few<00:01:43.439> other<00:01:43.560> cameras<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
Pentax and a few other cameras so the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.020 
Pentax and a few other cameras so the
sweet<00:01:45.810> spot<00:01:46.259> basically<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:47.399> 16<00:01:47.850> megapixel

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
sweet spot basically the 16 megapixel

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.760 
sweet spot basically the 16 megapixel
sensor<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:49.009> aps-c<00:01:50.780> for<00:01:51.780> both<00:01:51.960> resolution<00:01:52.649> in

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
sensor in aps-c for both resolution in

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.310 
sensor in aps-c for both resolution in
high<00:01:52.920> ISO<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.759> get<00:01:53.960> quite<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:54.990> bit<00:01:55.200> of

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
high ISO you get quite a bit of

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.260 
high ISO you get quite a bit of
resolution<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.100> you're<00:01:56.820> still<00:01:57.119> maintaining

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
resolution and you're still maintaining

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.109 
resolution and you're still maintaining
really<00:01:58.049> good<00:01:58.229> high<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.729> sensor

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
really good high so this is this sensor

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.719 
really good high so this is this sensor
here<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:00.689> going<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.560> be<00:02:01.829> cleaner<00:02:02.280> at<00:02:02.520> high<00:02:02.670> as

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
here is going to be cleaner at high as

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.380 
here is going to be cleaner at high as
so<00:02:03.180> than<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.600> new<00:02:03.750> Sony<00:02:04.020> a7<00:02:04.619> t7<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.130> 65<00:02:05.820> or<00:02:05.850> even

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
so than the new Sony a7 t7 a 65 or even

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.490 
so than the new Sony a7 t7 a 65 or even
the<00:02:06.479> NEX<00:02:06.810> 7<00:02:07.409> 24<00:02:08.399> megapixel<00:02:08.970> sensor<00:02:09.330> now<00:02:09.989> Nikon

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
the NEX 7 24 megapixel sensor now Nikon

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.530 
the NEX 7 24 megapixel sensor now Nikon
that's<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.979> twist<00:02:11.220> there<00:02:11.489> Nikon<00:02:11.910> may<00:02:12.120> take<00:02:12.330> this

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
that's a twist there Nikon may take this

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.530 
that's a twist there Nikon may take this

these<00:02:19.930> sensors<00:02:20.860> better<00:02:21.610> than<00:02:21.910> Sony<00:02:22.209> can<00:02:22.569> so

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
these sensors better than Sony can so

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.350 
these sensors better than Sony can so
that<00:02:23.290> that'll<00:02:23.739> be<00:02:23.830> interesting<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.310> see

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
that that'll be interesting to see

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.680 
that that'll be interesting to see
but<00:02:26.290> this<00:02:26.410> nex-5<00:02:27.129> it<00:02:27.459> has<00:02:27.610> this<00:02:27.819> sweet<00:02:28.000> sensor

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
but this nex-5 it has this sweet sensor

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.789 
but this nex-5 it has this sweet sensor
it's<00:02:29.170> got<00:02:29.500> phase<00:02:30.489> detection<00:02:31.000> AF<00:02:31.440> available<00:02:32.440> by

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
it's got phase detection AF available by

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.780 
it's got phase detection AF available by
using<00:02:33.129> an<00:02:33.400> adapter<00:02:34.000> so<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:35.890> get<00:02:36.099> the<00:02:36.310> the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
using an adapter so you get the the

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.380 
using an adapter so you get the the
better<00:02:37.030> auto<00:02:37.510> focusing<00:02:38.459> and<00:02:39.459> I'm<00:02:39.670> hoping<00:02:40.209> that

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
better auto focusing and I'm hoping that

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.600 
better auto focusing and I'm hoping that
you'll<00:02:40.540> be<00:02:40.660> able<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:40.959> use<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.610> phase

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
you'll be able to use the phase

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.150 
you'll be able to use the phase
detection<00:02:42.970> AF<00:02:43.150> for<00:02:43.480> video<00:02:43.810> like<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.230> a<00:02:44.260> 77<00:02:45.040> and

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
detection AF for video like the a 77 and

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.870 
detection AF for video like the a 77 and
a<00:02:45.220> 65<00:02:45.940> offer<00:02:46.239> that<00:02:46.930> would<00:02:47.290> be<00:02:47.410> killer

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
a 65 offer that would be killer

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.819 
a 65 offer that would be killer
so<00:02:49.480> you<00:02:49.540> got<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.840> more<00:02:50.049> mag<00:02:50.230> alloy<00:02:50.500> in<00:02:50.739> the

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
so you got the more mag alloy in the

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.520 
so you got the more mag alloy in the
body<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:52.060> shooting<00:02:52.450> speed<00:02:52.750> of<00:02:52.959> 10<00:02:53.170> frames<00:02:53.440> per

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
body the shooting speed of 10 frames per

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.509 
body the shooting speed of 10 frames per
second<00:02:54.130> you<00:02:54.310> got<00:02:54.970> a<00:02:55.000> 25<00:02:55.510> point<00:02:55.690> autofocus<00:02:56.519> and

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
second you got a 25 point autofocus and

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.960 
second you got a 25 point autofocus and
you<00:02:58.299> got<00:02:58.480> object<00:02:59.200> tracking<00:02:59.760> autofocus<00:03:00.760> via

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
you got object tracking autofocus via

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.180 
you got object tracking autofocus via
the<00:03:01.120> touch<00:03:01.360> LCD<00:03:01.599> this<00:03:02.049> is<00:03:02.230> really<00:03:02.590> neat<00:03:02.829> check

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
the touch LCD this is really neat check

the nex-5n so these are all really cool
things<00:03:21.250> that<00:03:22.060> I<00:03:22.450> really<00:03:22.810> like<00:03:22.989> about<00:03:23.019> the<00:03:23.319> 5n

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
things that I really like about the 5n

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.140 
things that I really like about the 5n
I'm<00:03:23.889> actually<00:03:24.069> thinking<00:03:24.400> about<00:03:24.670> picking<00:03:24.880> one

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
I'm actually thinking about picking one

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.420 
I'm actually thinking about picking one
up<00:03:25.269> I've<00:03:25.450> been<00:03:25.600> on<00:03:25.959> the<00:03:26.470> fence<00:03:26.739> about<00:03:26.980> grabbing

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
up I've been on the fence about grabbing

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.759 
up I've been on the fence about grabbing
one<00:03:27.790> of<00:03:27.880> these<00:03:27.970> small<00:03:28.359> evil<00:03:28.840> type<00:03:29.079> cameras<00:03:29.560> for

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
one of these small evil type cameras for

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.080 
one of these small evil type cameras for
a<00:03:29.829> while<00:03:29.980> now<00:03:30.220> and<00:03:30.250> I'm<00:03:30.489> kind<00:03:30.700> of<00:03:30.730> glad<00:03:30.849> I've

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
a while now and I'm kind of glad I've

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.030 
a while now and I'm kind of glad I've
waited<00:03:31.389> because<00:03:31.840> especially<00:03:32.500> if<00:03:32.739> I<00:03:32.799> can<00:03:32.920> get<00:03:33.010> a

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
waited because especially if I can get a

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.890 
waited because especially if I can get a
good<00:03:33.250> deal<00:03:33.310> on<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:33.940> nex-5n

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
good deal on the nex-5n

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.440 
good deal on the nex-5n
this<00:03:35.380> looks<00:03:35.680> to<00:03:35.889> me<00:03:35.920> like<00:03:36.069> it<00:03:36.519> it<00:03:37.090> could<00:03:37.329> be<00:03:37.359> the

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
this looks to me like it it could be the

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.900 
this looks to me like it it could be the
perfect<00:03:37.840> small<00:03:38.380> camera<00:03:38.980> I'm<00:03:39.459> also<00:03:39.670> interested

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
perfect small camera I'm also interested

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.640 
perfect small camera I'm also interested
in<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.209> NEX<00:03:40.510> 7<00:03:41.019> we'll<00:03:41.170> go<00:03:41.290> over<00:03:41.410> that<00:03:41.500> in

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
in the NEX 7 we'll go over that in

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.089 
in the NEX 7 we'll go over that in
another<00:03:41.680> video<00:03:42.190> but<00:03:42.669> I<00:03:42.790> think<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.150> nex-5n<00:03:44.099> may

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
another video but I think the nex-5n may

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.190 
another video but I think the nex-5n may
be<00:03:45.160> better<00:03:45.459> for<00:03:45.579> my<00:03:46.359> needs<00:03:46.599> in<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:46.840> sense<00:03:47.079> of

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
be better for my needs in the sense of

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.319 
be better for my needs in the sense of
the<00:03:47.349> 16<00:03:47.709> megapixel<00:03:47.889> sensors<00:03:48.639> probably<00:03:49.060> of

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
the 16 megapixel sensors probably of

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.039 
the 16 megapixel sensors probably of
more<00:03:49.510> interest<00:03:49.780> to<00:03:49.930> me<00:03:50.109> in<00:03:50.349> the<00:03:50.889> small<00:03:51.250> camera

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
more interest to me in the small camera

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.629 
more interest to me in the small camera
because<00:03:53.049> of<00:03:53.139> the<00:03:53.200> high<00:03:53.319> ISO<00:03:53.769> being<00:03:54.310> being

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
because of the high ISO being being

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.849 
because of the high ISO being being
better<00:03:54.930> so<00:03:55.930> that's<00:03:56.139> what<00:03:56.380> we<00:03:56.500> have<00:03:56.680> here

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
better so that's what we have here

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:59.220 
better so that's what we have here
that's<00:03:56.980> one<00:03:57.250> two<00:03:57.549> three<00:03:57.579> four<00:03:58.060> five<00:03:58.630> six<00:03:58.959> seven

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
that's one two three four five six seven
