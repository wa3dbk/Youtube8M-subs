00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:09.200
 the space today we will have a review 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:15.710
 again on a series of gladiators from the company 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:18.859
 charge article beetle 0 8008 79 this set 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.439
 in the original lego exo force was called 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:23.960
 sonic phantom it is even here by 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:28.039
 nakleechki can see abbreviated sp 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.199
 sonic phantom is very there as I said in 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.750
 past video more accurately showed 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.329
 part of this set today's review 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.980
 will be dedicated to him 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:41.690
 let's start with the box 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:43.370
 beautiful so big devastator 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.780
 that is, destroyers instruction in 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:52.089
 as always they like to write 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:55.460
 here we have part of the comic sonic fountain 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:58.670
 samson no phantom on the back side 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.460
 boxes we can see the portrait of the very 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.549
 this is up to you the main figure trader 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.090
 hero then there are two oro 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:10.579
 given set what he can do he 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.460
 can reincarnate in the tank but really 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:15.110
 it's not 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.549
 transformation and just a separate model 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.020
 which can make the details of a given 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:24.890
 interceptor itself is all by 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.259
 box proceed to the instructions in contrast 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.810
 from the previous set here is the instruction 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.829
 more is already underway 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.210
 collect by the way about the instructions 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:38.030
 right here you can see that she 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.060
 quite complex as colors 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.670
 it is not very bright and difficult to understand 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.189
 what to put but I'm already with my 10 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.700
 years can not be said experience in principle 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:51.950
 I know where to insert but I mean 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:56.090
 I already understand these instructions 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.200
 and collected that set enough without much 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.180
 problems and just 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.480
 for the future so you know how here 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.420
 and what to expect from this instruction on 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.490
 the back side we see 600 pages 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:14.010
 and shows where all the stickers 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:17.530
 stick and don't shoot yourself in the eyes 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.230
 vodka minifigure designs which in 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.530
 This time I was pleased to give state or 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.390
 here we have our devastator this time 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.390
 I was pleased though he should be 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.150
 transparent lime body like a 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.740
 the original here we have the original as 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.220
 you can see his torso 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.650
 transparent lime and I will give you about and 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.470
 given and the model is just opaque 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.510
 is red but at least not white as 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.870
 last set 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.090
 Well take a look at the unit itself most 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.480
 you and quite extensive though not 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.430
 overloaded with details of this kit 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.340
 small amount of detail but it 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:01.989
 you can even be seen because we 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:04.420
 see full turbine data but they themselves 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.370
 the design is good enough since you 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.440
 if you do not look like this or something 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.840
 differently 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:15.580
 notes that there's nothing in it 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:18.190
 just shields but still this thing 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.200
 there is so mention it about her 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.440
 it was impossible wings 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:27.220
 they are mobile 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:30.190
 locking such turbine parts spinning 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.230
 also spinning guns 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.410
 note that this model is armed 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:40.780
 from head to toe as both a way to just 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:42.459
 Here such laser batteries to such yes 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.280
 Here is the gun 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.260
 by the way works and shoots 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.620
 she is jamming on a mechanism 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.440
 pistols take in hand here we can 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.959
 see where you need to press and 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:00.130
 here rezinochka she will automatically 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:02.980
 shoot what one could notice 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.650
 everything works as in the original all 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.860
 great done 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.550
 the gun is pretty cool working 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.110
 Also here you can see these stickers. 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.930
 which were also attached 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.000
 but unfortunately they glue very long and 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.960
 tedious well, okay if you want 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:27.070
 so that the model looked to the top that is 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.860
 well completed please glue 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.530
 some stickers i did these unfortunately 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.710
 tubes from trying the rest is already 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:41.410
 my personal nagging here we sit down 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:44.530
 of our 20 sput and here we have such not 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:47.200
 I know it can actually be used 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.390
 like blasters so we can say that 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.900
 it is his 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:56.260
 pair weapons pair blasters 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:58.780
 places with his face here as well when you 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.270
 you must shoot this 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.670
 go down and then yes here is this detail 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:07.080
 should be but why not put so 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:10.720
 This is because she constantly crashes and 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.550
 does not work need battery sat 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.100
 This design when you shoot 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.380
 should ignite and supposedly here 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.320
 laser gun shoots enough 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.930
 cool idea but it is a pity that she is from here 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:26.650
 sometimes when you play with them she 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:29.380
 crashes as you can see in principle on this 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.680
 all about sonic fantas see you soon and 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.680
 good luck
