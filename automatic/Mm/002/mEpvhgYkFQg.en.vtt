00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello ladies and gentlemen with you again fox 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.899
 bregman 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.010
 and today a little bit about the printer xerox 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.080
 phaser 3140 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:16.650
 turn on waiting for the launch problem in 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.400
 Next, as if not to flash 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.439
 device to ensure that cartridges 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.220
 it was possible to refuel here 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:29.730
 such here cartridges now could not resist here 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:34.320
 It turns out several manipulations that we 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:37.140
 we can do this 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.440
 it is lit in red 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.780
 I can show you can try to stick 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.360
 this one is the extreme left 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.850
 the far right will be big it if 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.059
 like that 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.210
 contact glue in my case this 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.309
 manipulation did not help in my case 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.770
 another manipulation that is helped 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.609
 Now I will explain here 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:06.330
 the cartridge is lit red ie tournament 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:10.680
 I will show you what's wrong with printing. 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:14.250
 do so here you can do 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.229
 printout find out then there is how much toner 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.680
 left when the light bulb will be green 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:23.930
 quickly blink quickly then already 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.930
 let go all went print 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:32.790
 well here on print and we see something here 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:35.970
 no, 0 percent, respectively, that we 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.190
 do in this case how would the number method 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.450
 two 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.700
 interesting such a way that is soup on 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:52.350
 I have already made this cartridge 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:55.680
 I will show you the procedure now 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:05.840
 gently remove the chip I'm already here 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:09.929
 a little sneaky she here we have the chip itself and 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:13.019
 to make the device not to handle 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.080
 more cartridge that is and check it 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:19.040
 chip there how much toner is needed 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:23.549
 do the following need to unsolder 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.950
 several smd items from this chip 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:30.150
 there will need to be unsoldered two 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:33.150
 capacitor c4 and c5 here it is probably 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:37.620
 rather bad it will certainly be seen here as 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:42.090
 once the traces of soldering here here to show 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:46.920
 This is how it turned out here. 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:51.600
 once capacitors c4 c5 and here stood 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:54.930
 r3 resistor them neatly unsolder 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.030
 break off don't break anything just 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.480
 we dispense neatly with these three 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.120
 places heat up rosin kin as seen in 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:09.680
 my case is what happens after 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:13.820
 This will often show insert the chip 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:17.730
 insert the plastic latch in place 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:20.620
 here is the next 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.700
 interesting such a feature 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.840
 that is, the printer will be fully working 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.349
 you can refuel without problems 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.970
 cartridge here we have a cartridge with that chip 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.090
 with which you need to be too 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:37.150
 insert the same manipulation 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:42.680
 here is this card where two capacitors and 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:44.599
 TPA resistor and so look 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.319
 the device immediately switched to 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:52.510
 the green light bulb tells us that 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:57.140
 that everything is all right all the warming up occurred 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:04:00.109
 press the button if you release now 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.409
 there will be a test itself xerox tom what 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:06.530
 firmware version is all that is not 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:10.609
 worked with when finished toner by 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:16.609
 Chip now we will do another 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:17.959
 printout on this printout we already 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.989
 see this interesting feature 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.669
 toner now support one support it now 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.130
 support that is not supported 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.770
 he simply does not see him but at the same time 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.289
 printer is working 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.030
 accordingly so the way 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:34.940
 pretty good to everyone who can 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:39.770
 solder tips or go somewhere 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:41.110
 to those people who know how to solder so 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.680
 use 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:47.990
 xerox phaser 3140 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:51.320
 further already if someone does not help then 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:54.460
 just flashing everything all thanks to you 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.460
 Fox was crazy
