00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
over here we've got the actual training

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.790 
over here we've got the actual training
which<00:00:42.059> as<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.570> can<00:00:42.600> see<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:43.170> delivered<00:00:43.649> by

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
which as you can see is delivered by

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.860 
which as you can see is delivered by
video<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.789> it's<00:00:44.969> broken<00:00:45.239> down<00:00:45.570> into

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
video and it's broken down into

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.440 
video and it's broken down into
different<00:00:46.469> steps<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.280> as<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.850> can<00:00:48.030> see<00:00:48.059> there

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
different steps and as you can see there

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.020 
different steps and as you can see there
is<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> total<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.289> six<00:00:49.680> different<00:00:50.309> steps<00:00:50.670> and

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
is a total of six different steps and

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.959 
is a total of six different steps and
step<00:00:51.600> 6<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.440> actually<00:00:52.590> log<00:00:53.129> into<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.760> auto

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
step 6 is to actually log into the auto

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.310 
step 6 is to actually log into the auto
mobile<00:00:54.510> code<00:00:55.399> software<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.840> great<00:00:57.840> thing<00:00:58.079> about

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
mobile code software a great thing about

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.979 
mobile code software a great thing about
auto<00:00:58.800> mobile<00:00:59.340> code<00:00:59.820> is<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.149> there<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.690> no

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
auto mobile code is that there is no

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.709 
auto mobile code is that there is no
hosting<00:01:01.559> required<00:01:02.059> it's<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.239> web-based

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
hosting required it's a web-based

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.929 
hosting required it's a web-based
software<00:01:04.309> application<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.460> don't<00:01:05.640> need<00:01:05.790> to

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
software application you don't need to

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.480 
software application you don't need to
download<00:01:06.180> anything<00:01:07.040> everything's<00:01:08.040> hosted

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
download anything everything's hosted

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.969 
download anything everything's hosted
for<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.630> once<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.960> purchase<00:01:10.200> you've<00:01:10.799> got

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
included in the price so now if I give

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.070 
included in the price so now if I give
you<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.650> quick<00:01:17.070> breakdown<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.850> step<00:01:18.689> two

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
you a quick breakdown of the step two

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.109 
you a quick breakdown of the step two
which<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.320> going<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.740> explain<00:01:20.340> everything

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
which is going to explain everything

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.060 
which is going to explain everything
that<00:01:21.720> you're<00:01:21.840> going<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.080> want<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.320> know<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.770> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
that you're going to want to know in the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.640 
that you're going to want to know in the
training<00:01:23.430> video<00:01:25.820> we<00:01:26.820> just<00:01:27.030> skip<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.360> in<00:01:27.630> as<00:01:27.900> you

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
training video we just skip it in as you

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.289 
training video we just skip it in as you
can<00:01:28.829> see<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.610> actual<00:01:29.759> software

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
can see this is the actual software

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.990 
can see this is the actual software
itself<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.320> it's<00:01:31.979> basically<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.640> same<00:01:32.939> as

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
itself and it's basically the same as

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.319 
itself and it's basically the same as
aweber<00:01:33.869> or<00:01:33.990> get<00:01:34.380> response<00:01:34.950> what<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.880> do<00:01:36.090> is

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
aweber or get response what you do is

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.870 
aweber or get response what you do is
you<00:01:36.540> create<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.990> list<00:01:37.439> using<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.159> software<00:01:38.400> and

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
you create a list using the software and

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.090 
you create a list using the software and
the<00:01:39.049> difference<00:01:40.049> being<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.619> you're<00:01:40.799> going<00:01:40.950> to

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
the difference being is you're going to

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.670 
the difference being is you're going to
collect<00:01:41.579> mobile<00:01:42.090> numbers<00:01:42.659> instead<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.290> email

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
collect mobile numbers instead of email

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.560 
collect mobile numbers instead of email
addresses<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.490> then<00:01:45.030> you're<00:01:45.149> going<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.329> use

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
addresses and then you're going to use

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.530 
addresses and then you're going to use
the<00:01:45.780> software<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.560> send<00:01:46.829> out<00:01:47.009> SMS<00:01:47.240> blasts<00:01:48.240> to

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
the software to send out SMS blasts to

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.420 
the software to send out SMS blasts to
the<00:01:48.750> users<00:01:49.110> have<00:01:49.320> opted<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:49.890> with<00:01:50.159> their

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
the users have opted in with their

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.330 
the users have opted in with their

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
we're using the actual build itself to

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.459 
we're using the actual build itself to
write<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.820> message<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:57.899> similar<00:01:58.229> to
