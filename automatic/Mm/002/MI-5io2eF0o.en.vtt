00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:10.130
 the staff then I introduced first 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.809
 next to me not only pay here in 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.259
 massachusetts in the vicinity of 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:18.080
 boston in cities around here and 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:20.600
 answering some doubts of some 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.490
 friends and students that will explain a 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.060
 little summed up as the works 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.600
 digital machine how adsl works 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.140
 huh 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.540
 cell phone can say that the graph 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.000
 here is very simplified but it is only for 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.339
 you have an idea then 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.649
 basically it would be here 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:42.440
 depended a camera is on the side is 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.539
 the good it would be here as lens 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.809
 works like the machine 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:50.179
 image that today we no longer use 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.890
 movie is used as we use a machine 

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:55.670
 using the memory card and how to 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:59.300
 Does this style of recording work? 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.469
 ok here works the object is in front 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.559
 of the correct lens 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.850
 the lens has various elements such 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.250
 elements of how much more elements 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.469
 relatively better will be the quality of 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.530
 image because these foods to say 

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:16.479
 sonny cheer only then how does the 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.479
 principle the image passes to milk 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.729
 all these elements certainly we 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.700
 we have the diaphragm is known as the ex 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.700
 top or 1 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.729
 then the last wave is that little eye 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:35.090
 opening and closing is something that opens and closes 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:39.740
 closes known as the stop bar ok f 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.549
 2.8 x 22 goes to internet with up to 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.619
 32 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.180
 this doll made for what happens 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.929
 amount of light that will pass here 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.810
 so he's going to be here between the camera 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:52.100
 and the object is the diaphragm that goes 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.469
 control the amount of light that goes 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.619
 get on camera how it works when 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:59.420
 spent enjoy the image will hit the 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.740
 camera mirror 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.450
 here we have a mirror and the sensor 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.009
 stands behind the mirror as we have seen 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.030
 this image through but how am I 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.830
 looking around 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.930
 the image is down here like I do 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.690
 see her because she comes to her brave 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.640
 she hits the mirror she reflects 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.160
 the mirror here on top of the camera in that 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.100
 another mirror it reflects another 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.190
 mirror and bangs banging until the 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.830
 transmitting through a display that they could 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.020
 Failing is fine, so here is our 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.300
 My eye is good 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.220
 It's around here so we got the 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.260
 image because the image 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.270
 mirrors is this way that the image 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.640
 transmit to see a fairy 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.070
 but how does it record the image which is 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.440
 the wheel presses the shutter that 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.390
 Flame boots in the camera this mirror here 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.300
 lift up 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.710
 He comes here. The image does not rebound. But 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.410
 That's why while you're looking 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:57.100
 the viewer and you hit the photo you see through 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.050
 one-thousandth of a second is the black image 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.130
 black the start and up you do not see 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.920
 but nothing is not reflecting 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:07.730
 mainly the display and the image is 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.640
 recorded on the camera 's 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.170
 movie that no longer exists the movie will 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.240
 give an explanation that quickly to 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.240
 you show how it works in the camera 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:24.650
 if you can then warned here is a 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.950
 mirror is in here is the mirror of 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.480
 camera and I'm using the bat here 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.060
 between the control when I opened the 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.709
 When did you go to the party because otherwise? 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.520
 vehicle as quickly as possible. 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.860
 our eyes 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.160
 so I'll put pressure on what happens 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.870
 Lift the sensor there and now I downloaded it. 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.360
 please do not do this at home're it 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.360
 a in the stadium never leave the spu the viewer 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.190
 exposed so the dust is fine is 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.630
 always good it's closed but it was 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.540
 quickly only to demonstrate more 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.070
 once the image was having a mirror 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.140
 reflecting and I can see through the script 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.880
 failure in this case when I press here 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.980
 I do not see anything else I decided to record a 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:06.010
 Image good and when I loose it closed well 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.150
 main here is just what I explain 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.769
 even more videos explaining some tips 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.260
 cool here on our new channel that 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:14.360
 We did to answer friends' tips and 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.440

 So far ahead we will have several 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.940
 videos speaking of videos tips to show 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.870
 or even some of the work we've done 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.890
 Good, I hope you like it. 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.479
