00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:05.700
 the one that stayed on slopes and one that I found quite interesting 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.220
 a caller in relation to the subject of him 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.689
 of the ten 

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:11.859
 and the posture the following 

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:15.839
 which at times may have been difficult 10 mar economically and 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:16.960
 he asks 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.960
 if the time he can devote to a work 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.560
 the considered 10 sea 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:26.909
 I think that here 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:29.140
 the matter of 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.300
 For time 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.640
 p in Christian stewardship 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.670
 efe stewardship greece has the great virtue 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.339
 of cre-art in the experience and in the life of every man and woman 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:41.490
 Christian 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.430
 a clear conscience 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.640
 of what kim applies for stewardship 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.350
 And of course 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.250
 for when we talk about our time to the work of God 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.139
 we're 

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:55.550
 p working in the area of ​​time stewardship 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.969
 in when 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.359
 percent we give our talents 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.739
 to now the lord loan under that 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.880
 framework not of the stewardship of our talents 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.240
 p but when 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.100
 we talk about the tithe experience of what we are talking about is the 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.230
 stewardship of our economic resources 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.240
 and they are different things 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.260
 p 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.280
 yes 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.920
 from that point of view then 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.909
 obviously the experience of the Christian faith those communities of faith that 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:24.720
 postulate 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.990
 and that sustains the tithe experience 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.479
 then they see that the one responsible for the tithe this falls on the ap 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:33.679
 stewardship 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:36.790
 of finance on the stewardship of the economic 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.980
 Of course this does not mean 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.190
 this does not mean that the p function of a believer 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.420
 p is 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.549
 March 10 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.460
 percent if you can not 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.980
 percent I think there are situations 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.560
 and there are circumstances in the life of any believer what in a moment 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.440
 given it looks private 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.140
 of power t 10ma 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.850
 what happens on the other side in the following samuel is that p when 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.550
 we talk about stewardship 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.950
 we are not talking simply and simply about the virtue of giving to the work of the Lord 

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:15.169
 when we talk about Christian stewardship in the area of ​​bail 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:17.719
 Of capacity 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:21.489
 we are talking about the ability that every man and every Christian woman should 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:22.639
 to have 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:24.569
 aqmi minister maple 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:25.840
 administer 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.710
 p in such a way as 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.430
 p as the jibaro says our not to learn 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.969
 to stretch the foot 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:36.669
 how far does the savannah go and I think one of the problems that many 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:37.570
 Sometimes we have 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.790
 in the aria of Christian stewardship 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.799
 is that we do not know how to administer 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.700
 when we do not manage personally well in the long run 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.160
 then we start 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.180
 to fail in those responsibilities that we have within the stewardship 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.789
 Christian 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:54.139
 but I go back and I tell you 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:03:00.419
 t that a believer for some reason percent is prevented from giving his 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:01.189
 fiat no 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:04.790
 This does not mean that it is lost. This does not mean that it is not 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.719
 saves the tone to say no to me it seems that you have to pay born in 2015 and 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:11.010
 of the person who calls us 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.629
 people how the situation has been treated 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:17.579
 that he could not financially continue because if we analyze the question 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.979
 then he otherwise officials 

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:24.219
 then that person who can you sea 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:27.559
 I could pass that premise and cipa good stories in my time 

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:30.879
 I did not doubt it either and etc and the church so full of people 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.269
 that decimate and that also lends success 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.870
 if the time to Mr. José said what is important in that process 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.779
 this is open to you dear brother 

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:46.969
 they do not necessarily have to substitute percent and time stewardship 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:50.770
 not given the work of the Lord thinking that with it is fulfilling no no no 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.919
 in time to mr 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.559
 yes at this time for some reason 

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:58.449
 percent you can not 10th 

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:01.139
 by the way you can not love 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:06.870
 There is another piece of information that is important to me, and this is where we enter 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.390
 percent because if it is true and stewardship of the time of stewardship of 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.799
 finance and stewardship 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.429
 there stewardship of goodness 

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:15.769
 and of virtue 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:21.049
 I believe that the good stewardship of goodness and virtue the church should 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.029
 Play an important role 

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:24.249
 if they had a hand 

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:26.849
 if a brother says I can not 10 mar 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:29.849
 in case the reason why he could not decimate that I'm out of work 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:32.999
 and as a result of being out of work 

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:35.469
 I can not support my family 

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:37.030
 I can not make the purchase 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.169
 It seems to me that whoever is obligated at that moment 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.169
 financially help the human being is the church 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.580
 that church percent and llop I think that 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.860
 this is something that 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.840
 we need morally and spiritually to know it 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.160
 because sometimes it's just 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.160
 efe of the Our Father what we like is the 20 years 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:03.409
 per cent we always tell people that qt has to 10 markota have to 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:07.479
 filing if you do not well anything you are not a good Christian we could pitch 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:11.889
 as the injury member continued saying yes yes that may be why 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:15.919
 joseph also seems to continue I believe in the responsibility in fact I 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:16.950
 personally 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.210
 een that my personal character I saw is not intimidated inn 10th 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.139
 percent e 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:25.139
 yes but hadi something that is important to us 

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:30.270
 l not only the church is to receive the 10th 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.810
 the church is also 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.460
 to be supportive of what within that community of faith they can 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.550
 have some difficulty in knowing and that at a given moment 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.740
 and the church then 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.030
 At least you should ignore flint rose and we can serve tea in something 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.190
 here we are to be
