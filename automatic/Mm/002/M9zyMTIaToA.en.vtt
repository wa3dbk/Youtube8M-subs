00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
on the blade they didn't really do that

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.280 
on the blade they didn't really do that
with<00:03:24.250> this<00:03:24.280> knife<00:03:24.609> and<00:03:24.879> I<00:03:25.419> don't<00:03:25.959> know<00:03:26.109> why

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
with this knife and I don't know why

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.539 
with this knife and I don't know why
they<00:03:26.440> didn't<00:03:26.769> because<00:03:27.099> it<00:03:27.129> would<00:03:27.340> have<00:03:27.430> made

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
they didn't because it would have made

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.449 
they didn't because it would have made
the<00:03:27.699> knife<00:03:27.849> a<00:03:28.000> lot<00:03:28.180> a<00:03:28.389> lot<00:03:28.510> better<00:03:29.280> so<00:03:30.280> the

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
the knife a lot a lot better so the

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.909 
the knife a lot a lot better so the
knife<00:03:30.639> it's<00:03:31.269> pretty<00:03:31.840> slick<00:03:32.199> especially<00:03:32.799> with

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:32.919 
knife it's pretty slick especially with

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:38.520 
knife it's pretty slick especially with
gloves<00:03:34.079> and<00:03:35.160> you<00:03:36.160> know<00:03:36.280> it's<00:03:37.199> like<00:03:38.199> I<00:03:38.379> already

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
gloves and you know it's like I already

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.439 
gloves and you know it's like I already
said<00:03:38.680> that<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.190> ergonomics<00:03:39.760> are<00:03:39.879> not<00:03:40.299> the

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:40.449 
said that the ergonomics are not the

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:43.979 
said that the ergonomics are not the
best<00:03:40.829> still<00:03:41.829> it's<00:03:42.160> it's<00:03:42.760> pretty<00:03:43.359> fits<00:03:43.840> pretty

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
best still it's it's pretty fits pretty

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.680 
best still it's it's pretty fits pretty
comfortably<00:03:44.500> in<00:03:44.769> your<00:03:44.829> hand<00:03:45.340> and<00:03:46.000> that's

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
comfortably in your hand and that's

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.990 
comfortably in your hand and that's
thanks<00:03:47.019> to<00:03:47.139> the<00:03:47.440> through<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.489> curvature<00:03:48.970> that

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
thanks to the through the curvature that

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.189 
thanks to the through the curvature that
it<00:03:49.180> has<00:03:49.299> throughout<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.720> blade<00:03:49.930> and<00:03:50.169> the

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:50.199 
it has throughout the blade and the

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:53.460 
it has throughout the blade and the
reason<00:03:51.010> for<00:03:51.040> that<00:03:51.190> is<00:03:51.629> Bob<00:03:52.629> LOM<00:03:52.900> designed<00:03:53.349> this

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
reason for that is Bob LOM designed this

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.449 
reason for that is Bob LOM designed this
knife<00:03:54.269> like<00:03:55.269> a<00:03:55.299> Chinese<00:03:55.870> leaf<00:03:56.290> and<00:03:56.620> if<00:03:57.340> you

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
ever seen the Chinese leaf it's kind of

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:04.349 
ever seen the Chinese leaf it's kind of
a<00:03:59.440> thin<00:04:00.090> curved<00:04:01.090> leaf<00:04:01.690> and<00:04:02.079> it<00:04:03.060> it<00:04:04.060> kind<00:04:04.299> of

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
a thin curved leaf and it it kind of

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.960 
a thin curved leaf and it it kind of
does<00:04:04.540> look<00:04:04.569> like<00:04:05.280> kind<00:04:06.280> of<00:04:06.310> does<00:04:06.489> look<00:04:06.519> like<00:04:06.819> it

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
does look like kind of does look like it

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
have it and that's also good because

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.339 
have it and that's also good because
you're<00:05:15.330> not<00:05:15.509> going<00:05:15.630> to<00:05:15.720> have<00:05:15.810> a<00:05:15.840> big<00:05:16.020> portion

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:16.349

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
basically about that much up so that's

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.939 
basically about that much up so that's
not<00:05:25.860> bad<00:05:26.070> that's<00:05:26.310> that's<00:05:27.120> pretty<00:05:27.389> good<00:05:27.949> now
