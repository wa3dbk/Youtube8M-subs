this when you have this unselected your
Express<00:01:22.080> will<00:01:22.950> copy<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.549> will<00:01:23.700> create<00:01:23.909> an

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
Express will copy it will create an

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.450 
Express will copy it will create an
image<00:01:24.270> file<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:24.960> your<00:01:25.259> hard<00:01:25.320> drive<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.159> then

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
image file on your hard drive and then

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.459 
image file on your hard drive and then
copy<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.390> destination<00:01:27.600> drive

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:34.139 

now<00:01:33.039> the<00:01:33.100> benefit<00:01:33.579> of<00:01:33.670> having<00:01:33.850> never

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
now the benefit of having never

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.899 
now the benefit of having never
expressed<00:01:34.749> first<00:01:35.740> copy<00:01:36.069> an<00:01:36.310> image<00:01:36.579> to<00:01:36.759> your

expressed first copy an image to your

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:38.789 
expressed first copy an image to your
hard<00:01:37.090> drive<00:01:37.420> is<00:01:37.689> that<00:01:37.899> if<00:01:38.020> you<00:01:38.140> have<00:01:38.289> any<00:01:38.499> read

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
hard drive is that if you have any read

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.069 
hard drive is that if you have any read
average<00:01:39.159> you<00:01:39.850> won't<00:01:40.060> basically<00:01:40.539> wasted<00:01:40.929> this

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
average you won't basically wasted this

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.399 
average you won't basically wasted this
but<00:01:41.890> I<00:01:41.920> always<00:01:42.189> just<00:01:42.579> roll<00:01:42.789> the<00:01:42.939> dice<00:01:43.289> so<00:01:44.289> I'm

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
but I always just roll the dice so I'm

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.639 
but I always just roll the dice so I'm
going<00:01:44.679> to<00:01:44.740> select<00:01:44.920> quick<00:01:45.250> copy<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:47.049> also<00:01:47.439> here

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
going to select quick copy and also here

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.449 
going to select quick copy and also here
verify<00:01:48.280> data<00:01:48.549> when<00:01:49.390> this<00:01:49.630> after<00:01:50.020> burning<00:01:50.459> that

00:01:51.449 --> 00:01:51.459 
verify data when this after burning that

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:53.669 
verify data when this after burning that
up<00:01:51.670> will<00:01:51.939> allow<00:01:52.060> narrow<00:01:52.630> Express<00:01:53.109> to<00:01:53.259> run<00:01:53.439> some

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
up will allow narrow Express to run some

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:55.669 
up will allow narrow Express to run some
tests<00:01:53.920> to<00:01:54.009> make<00:01:54.219> sure<00:01:54.280> everything<00:01:54.880> went<00:01:55.119> well

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
tests to make sure everything went well

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.469 
tests to make sure everything went well
you<00:01:56.679> can<00:01:56.859> leave<00:01:57.009> that<00:01:57.039> selected<00:01:57.450> then<00:01:58.450> you

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
you can leave that selected then you

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.410 
you can leave that selected then you
have<00:01:58.719> the<00:01:58.869> writing<00:01:59.259> speed<00:01:59.640> which<00:02:00.640> is<00:02:00.819> always<00:02:01.000> 8

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
have the writing speed which is always 8

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.349 
have the writing speed which is always 8
X<00:02:01.890> we<00:02:02.890> have<00:02:03.009> a<00:02:03.039> lot<00:02:03.310> of<00:02:03.340> DVD<00:02:03.789> burners<00:02:04.209> out

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:04.359 
X we have a lot of DVD burners out

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:07.740 
X we have a lot of DVD burners out
nowadays<00:02:04.899> that<00:02:05.200> burns<00:02:05.530> at<00:02:05.799> 12<00:02:06.189> 16<00:02:06.909> or<00:02:07.090> even<00:02:07.119> 18

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
nowadays that burns at 12 16 or even 18

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.539 
nowadays that burns at 12 16 or even 18
X<00:02:07.989> so<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:10.060> allows<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:11.079> copy<00:02:11.319> faster<00:02:12.040> so

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:12.549 
X so it allows the copy faster so

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.119 
X so it allows the copy faster so
whenever<00:02:12.819> you're<00:02:13.030> copying<00:02:13.299> videos<00:02:13.989> if<00:02:14.349> you
