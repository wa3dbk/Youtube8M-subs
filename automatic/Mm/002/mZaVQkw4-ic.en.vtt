because you have too much radiation get
at<00:02:57.780> least<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:58.050> lethal<00:02:58.500> dose<00:02:58.530> you'll<00:02:59.010> start

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
at least a lethal dose you'll start

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.280 
at least a lethal dose you'll start
losing<00:02:59.580> health<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.239> up<00:03:00.480> that's<00:03:00.959> pretty<00:03:01.230> much

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
losing health and up that's pretty much

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.050 
losing health and up that's pretty much
the<00:03:01.350> base<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.799> the<00:03:01.890> game<00:03:02.070> and<00:03:02.310> it's<00:03:02.579> a<00:03:02.670> very<00:03:02.700> own

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
the base of the game and it's a very own

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.240 
the base of the game and it's a very own
survival<00:03:03.360> game<00:03:03.600> it's<00:03:04.200> kind<00:03:04.470> of<00:03:04.500> a<00:03:04.590> little

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
survival game it's kind of a little

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.860 
survival game it's kind of a little
harder<00:03:05.579> than<00:03:05.760> minecraft<00:03:06.120> digital<00:03:06.510> touch<00:03:06.720> to

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
harder than minecraft digital touch to

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.960 
harder than minecraft digital touch to
focus<00:03:07.019> on<00:03:07.320> finding<00:03:07.620> items<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.430> keep<00:03:08.790> yourself

alive and just not dying in general it's

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:12.560 
alive and just not dying in general it's
kind<00:03:11.700> of<00:03:11.730> like<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:11.910> hunger<00:03:12.180> system<00:03:12.480> in

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
kind of like the hunger system in

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.819 
kind of like the hunger system in
Minecraft<00:03:12.900> but<00:03:12.989> just<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.290> little<00:03:13.410> different

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
Minecraft but just a little different

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.620

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
yourself be pretty much dead for this

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.319 
yourself be pretty much dead for this
game<00:03:22.380> I'm<00:03:22.620> giving<00:03:23.100> it<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.310> 9<00:03:23.640> out<00:03:23.790> of<00:03:23.820> 10<00:03:24.030> for<00:03:24.239> the

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
game I'm giving it a 9 out of 10 for the

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.670 
game I'm giving it a 9 out of 10 for the
reason<00:03:24.630> being<00:03:24.750> is<00:03:24.989> that<00:03:25.019> when<00:03:25.410> you<00:03:25.470> first

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
reason being is that when you first

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.350 
reason being is that when you first
start<00:03:25.980> off<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.400> Union<00:03:26.730> don't<00:03:26.940> really<00:03:27.180> get<00:03:27.299> it

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
start off the Union don't really get it

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.270 
start off the Union don't really get it
good<00:03:27.600> they<00:03:28.320> don't<00:03:28.470> really<00:03:28.530> guide<00:03:28.860> you<00:03:29.040> through

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
good they don't really guide you through

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.740 
good they don't really guide you through
the<00:03:29.400> game<00:03:29.579> enough<00:03:29.880> and<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.180> can<00:03:30.329> kind<00:03:30.540> of<00:03:30.660> have

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
the game enough and you can kind of have

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.030 
the game enough and you can kind of have
to<00:03:30.870> figure<00:03:31.019> things<00:03:31.230> out<00:03:31.410> on<00:03:31.470> your<00:03:31.620> own<00:03:31.739> and

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
to figure things out on your own and

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.199 
to figure things out on your own and
there<00:03:32.190> isn't<00:03:32.579> really<00:03:32.700> a<00:03:32.850> good<00:03:33.030> set<00:03:33.180> of

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
there isn't really a good set of

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.520 
there isn't really a good set of
instructions<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.870> figure<00:03:34.079> out<00:03:34.170> what<00:03:34.350> does

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
instructions to figure out what does

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
what there was a basic set of

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.789 
what there was a basic set of
instructions<00:03:36.269> from<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.660> computer<00:03:37.140> AI<00:03:37.320> but

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
instructions from the computer AI but

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.710 
instructions from the computer AI but
everything<00:03:38.670> else<00:03:38.850> is<00:03:38.970> kind<00:03:39.150> of<00:03:39.239> glitched<00:03:39.480> out
