00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.000 

so<00:00:09.580> this<00:00:09.910> is<00:00:10.090> the<00:00:10.330> mini<00:00:10.840> fast<00:00:11.260> draw<00:00:11.530> it's<00:00:11.770> a<00:00:11.860> new

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.010 
so this is the mini fast draw it's a new

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.920 
so this is the mini fast draw it's a new
knife<00:00:12.160> I<00:00:12.370> just<00:00:12.580> got<00:00:12.760> and<00:00:13.030> I<00:00:13.389> honestly<00:00:13.540> haven't

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:13.930 
knife I just got and I honestly haven't

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.960 
knife I just got and I honestly haven't
used<00:00:14.230> it<00:00:14.410> because<00:00:14.770> I<00:00:14.799> don't<00:00:15.190> really<00:00:15.460> like<00:00:15.700> some

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:15.970 
used it because I don't really like some

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.019 
used it because I don't really like some
of<00:00:16.059> the<00:00:16.119> features<00:00:16.560> that<00:00:17.560> it<00:00:17.710> has

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029 
of the features that it has

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.760 
of the features that it has
it<00:00:19.840> is<00:00:20.200> a<00:00:20.529> nice<00:00:21.430> sharp<00:00:21.820> knife<00:00:21.880> it's<00:00:22.390> got<00:00:22.570> the

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770 
it is a nice sharp knife it's got the

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.910 
it is a nice sharp knife it's got the
option<00:00:23.770> of<00:00:23.920> either<00:00:24.070> half<00:00:24.520> serrated<00:00:24.940> or<00:00:25.359> fully

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
option of either half serrated or fully

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.470 
option of either half serrated or fully
not<00:00:26.920> serrated<00:00:27.490> you<00:00:28.300> can<00:00:28.449> buy<00:00:28.600> either<00:00:28.840> one<00:00:29.140> and

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
not serrated you can buy either one and

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.330 
not serrated you can buy either one and
what<00:00:31.480> I<00:00:31.510> didn't<00:00:31.750> like<00:00:31.779> about<00:00:31.900> it<00:00:32.199> was<00:00:32.379> that<00:00:33.100> it

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
what I didn't like about it was that it

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.070 
what I didn't like about it was that it
had<00:00:33.730> a<00:00:34.180> manual<00:00:35.140> safety<00:00:36.330> on/off

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.080 
had a manual safety on/off

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.290 
had a manual safety on/off
that's<00:00:38.440> not<00:00:38.710> a<00:00:38.920> liner<00:00:39.190> lock<00:00:39.489> so<00:00:40.030> it<00:00:40.120> doesn't

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
that's not a liner lock so it doesn't

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.290 
that's not a liner lock so it doesn't
have<00:00:40.390> a<00:00:40.450> liner<00:00:40.630> lock<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:42.460> so<00:00:42.850> you<00:00:42.910> can

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
have a liner lock and so you can

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.660 
have a liner lock and so you can
accidentally<00:00:44.110> or<00:00:44.380> forget<00:00:44.980> that<00:00:45.399> it's<00:00:45.550> on

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
accidentally or forget that it's on

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.889 
accidentally or forget that it's on
safety<00:00:46.120> and<00:00:46.149> then<00:00:46.329> you<00:00:46.390> won't<00:00:46.510> be<00:00:46.660> able<00:00:46.780> to

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
safety and then you won't be able to

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:48.479 
safety and then you won't be able to
close<00:00:47.110> it<00:00:47.170> you<00:00:47.350> won't<00:00:47.530> be<00:00:47.710> able<00:00:47.829> to<00:00:47.920> open<00:00:48.280> it<00:00:48.340> if

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
close it you won't be able to open it if

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.049 
close it you won't be able to open it if
it's<00:00:48.640> on<00:00:48.790> safety<00:00:50.340> which<00:00:51.340> might<00:00:51.520> be<00:00:51.670> good<00:00:51.879> if

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
it's on safety which might be good if

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.319 
it's on safety which might be good if
it's<00:00:52.270> you<00:00:52.510> know<00:00:53.640> something<00:00:54.640> you<00:00:54.730> put<00:00:54.879> in<00:00:54.940> a<00:00:55.090> bag

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
it's you know something you put in a bag

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:56.729 
it's you know something you put in a bag
and<00:00:55.690> you're<00:00:55.840> worried<00:00:56.050> about<00:00:56.110> it<00:00:56.320> opening<00:00:56.620> up

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
and you're worried about it opening up

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.990 
and you're worried about it opening up
on<00:00:56.890> accident<00:00:58.440> but<00:00:59.440> I<00:00:59.770> I<00:00:59.949> don't<00:01:00.340> really<00:01:00.910> think

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
on accident but I I don't really think

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.970 
on accident but I I don't really think
that<00:01:01.449> that's<00:01:01.539> much<00:01:01.780> of<00:01:01.840> a<00:01:02.020> problem<00:01:02.260> with<00:01:02.620> most

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
that that's much of a problem with most

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.600 
that that's much of a problem with most
of<00:01:03.129> the<00:01:03.250> knives<00:01:03.460> that<00:01:03.550> I<00:01:03.640> have<00:01:04.410> and<00:01:05.410> then<00:01:05.979> where

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
of the knives that I have and then where

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.190 
of the knives that I have and then where
it's<00:01:06.759> placed<00:01:07.060> here<00:01:07.240> you<00:01:07.390> have<00:01:07.479> to<00:01:07.600> hold<00:01:07.840> it<00:01:08.020> up

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
it's placed here you have to hold it up

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.700 
it's placed here you have to hold it up
you<00:01:08.590> can't<00:01:08.830> just<00:01:09.009> put<00:01:09.190> it<00:01:09.280> into<00:01:10.320> like<00:01:11.320> closed

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
you can't just put it into like closed

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.530 
you can't just put it into like closed
mode<00:01:12.070> and<00:01:12.369> it<00:01:12.490> stays<00:01:12.729> there<00:01:12.939> you<00:01:13.060> have<00:01:13.180> to<00:01:13.299> hold

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
mode and it stays there you have to hold

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.240 
mode and it stays there you have to hold
that<00:01:13.810> and<00:01:14.080> then<00:01:14.380> you<00:01:14.470> have<00:01:14.590> to<00:01:14.710> close<00:01:14.979> it<00:01:15.220> so

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
that and then you have to close it so

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.590 
that and then you have to close it so
it's<00:01:15.490> not<00:01:15.580> really<00:01:15.880> easy<00:01:16.030> to<00:01:16.210> close<00:01:16.390> with<00:01:16.570> one

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
it's not really easy to close with one

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.800 
it's not really easy to close with one
hand<00:01:17.100> whereas<00:01:18.100> you<00:01:18.310> know<00:01:18.430> a<00:01:18.460> normal<00:01:18.810> liner

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
hand whereas you know a normal liner

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.100 
hand whereas you know a normal liner
lock<00:01:20.020> is<00:01:20.200> gonna<00:01:20.380> be<00:01:20.500> really<00:01:20.650> easy<00:01:20.740> to<00:01:21.010> close<00:01:21.790> up

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
lock is gonna be really easy to close up

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.370 
lock is gonna be really easy to close up
so<00:01:23.110> it's<00:01:23.799> not<00:01:23.979> easy<00:01:24.189> to<00:01:24.369> close<00:01:25.020> it's<00:01:26.020> it's

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
so it's not easy to close it's it's

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.320 
so it's not easy to close it's it's
super<00:01:26.710> easy<00:01:26.740> to<00:01:26.979> open<00:01:27.130> obviously<00:01:27.759> if<00:01:27.880> it's<00:01:28.119> not

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
super easy to open obviously if it's not

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.690 
super easy to open obviously if it's not
on<00:01:28.509> safety<00:01:29.040> because<00:01:30.040> it's<00:01:30.220> got<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.490> spring

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
on safety because it's got the spring

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.210 
on safety because it's got the spring
assist<00:01:31.270> which<00:01:32.259> I<00:01:32.409> thought<00:01:32.619> was<00:01:32.770> cool<00:01:32.979> that<00:01:33.040> was

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
assist which I thought was cool that was

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.469 
assist which I thought was cool that was
pretty<00:01:33.520> much<00:01:33.700> one<00:01:33.880> of<00:01:33.909> the<00:01:34.030> main<00:01:34.180> reasons

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
pretty much one of the main reasons

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:35.550 
pretty much one of the main reasons
where<00:01:34.600> I<00:01:34.659> bought<00:01:34.810> it<00:01:34.869> other<00:01:35.200> than<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.530> fact

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
where I bought it other than the fact

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.380 
where I bought it other than the fact
that<00:01:35.799> it's<00:01:35.979> really<00:01:36.189> small<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:37.659> wanted<00:01:38.500> it<00:01:38.590> for<00:01:38.650> a

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
that it's really small I wanted it for a

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.300 
that it's really small I wanted it for a
you<00:01:40.390> know<00:01:40.420> a<00:01:40.540> work<00:01:40.840> knife<00:01:41.560> that<00:01:41.860> I<00:01:41.890> could<00:01:42.070> open

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
you know a work knife that I could open

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.800 
you know a work knife that I could open
up<00:01:42.369> boxes<00:01:42.820> with<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.790> so<00:01:46.000> I<00:01:46.060> didn't<00:01:46.240> like<00:01:46.360> that

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
up boxes with and so I didn't like that

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.690 
up boxes with and so I didn't like that
that's<00:01:47.170> kind<00:01:47.500> of<00:01:47.560> like<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:47.950> weird<00:01:48.189> thing<00:01:48.549> and

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
that's kind of like the weird thing and

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.310 
that's kind of like the weird thing and
I<00:01:48.790> knew<00:01:49.150> it<00:01:49.270> had<00:01:49.420> that<00:01:49.689> but<00:01:49.869> I<00:01:49.899> didn't<00:01:50.140> think<00:01:50.200> it

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
I knew it had that but I didn't think it

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.590 
I knew it had that but I didn't think it
was<00:01:50.380> gonna<00:01:50.500> be<00:01:50.590> that<00:01:50.799> bothersome<00:01:51.280> so<00:01:51.600> that's

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
was gonna be that bothersome so that's

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.130 
was gonna be that bothersome so that's
my<00:01:52.840> fault<00:01:52.899> the<00:01:53.860> other<00:01:54.040> thing<00:01:54.369> is<00:01:54.579> that<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:55.140> the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
my fault the other thing is that the the

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.440 
my fault the other thing is that the the
thumb<00:01:56.680> studs<00:01:57.040> actually<00:01:57.909> they're<00:01:58.090> on<00:01:58.240> both

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
thumb studs actually they're on both

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.569 
thumb studs actually they're on both
sides<00:01:58.750> which<00:01:58.960> is<00:01:59.110> cool<00:01:59.350> but<00:01:59.979> on<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.189> side<00:02:00.399> with

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
sides which is cool but on the side with

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.810 
sides which is cool but on the side with
the<00:02:00.670> clip<00:02:00.850> here<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:02.680> actually<00:02:02.920> protrudes<00:02:03.700> past

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
the clip here it actually protrudes past

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.859 
the clip here it actually protrudes past
the<00:02:04.299> handle<00:02:04.780> and<00:02:04.990> so<00:02:05.850> it'll<00:02:06.850> get<00:02:06.969> caught<00:02:07.329> up<00:02:07.600> on

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
the handle and so it'll get caught up on

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.069 
the handle and so it'll get caught up on
your<00:02:08.619> jeans<00:02:09.130> or<00:02:09.670> your<00:02:09.910> your<00:02:10.329> pants<00:02:10.869> whenever

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:11.079 
your jeans or your your pants whenever

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:13.080 
your jeans or your your pants whenever
you<00:02:11.290> try<00:02:11.500> to<00:02:11.530> put<00:02:11.799> it<00:02:11.890> in<00:02:12.010> your<00:02:12.130> pocket<00:02:12.340> because

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
you try to put it in your pocket because

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.890 
you try to put it in your pocket because
it'll<00:02:13.480> it'll<00:02:13.930> snag<00:02:14.530> right<00:02:15.459> on<00:02:15.730> that<00:02:16.300> as<00:02:16.569> you're

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
it'll it'll snag right on that as you're

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.110 
it'll it'll snag right on that as you're
trying<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.379> you<00:02:17.680> know<00:02:17.709> put<00:02:18.099> it<00:02:18.730> in<00:02:18.849> your<00:02:18.940> pocket

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
trying to you know put it in your pocket

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.610 
trying to you know put it in your pocket
so<00:02:19.390> you<00:02:19.450> actually<00:02:19.599> have<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:20.110> look<00:02:20.349> at

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
so you actually have to look at

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.839 
so you actually have to look at
what<00:02:20.709> you're<00:02:20.890> doing<00:02:21.129> make<00:02:21.280> sure<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.549> pants

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
what you're doing make sure the pants

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.000 
what you're doing make sure the pants
get<00:02:22.000> you<00:02:22.209> know<00:02:22.299> past<00:02:22.599> the<00:02:22.840> stud<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.530> then<00:02:23.920> you

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
get you know past the stud and then you

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.460 
get you know past the stud and then you
can<00:02:24.159> put<00:02:24.310> in<00:02:24.400> your<00:02:24.489> pocket<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.290> night<00:02:26.440> the

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
can put in your pocket and the night the

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.910 
can put in your pocket and the night the
the<00:02:27.129> clip<00:02:28.090> is<00:02:28.269> so<00:02:28.569> strong<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:29.200> rigid<00:02:29.590> that<00:02:29.860> I

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
the clip is so strong and rigid that I

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.190 
the clip is so strong and rigid that I
had<00:02:30.129> a<00:02:30.159> hard<00:02:30.430> time<00:02:30.549> because<00:02:31.540> it<00:02:31.659> doesn't<00:02:31.930> it

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
had a hard time because it doesn't it

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.850 
had a hard time because it doesn't it
doesn't<00:02:32.440> come<00:02:32.680> out<00:02:32.709> very<00:02:32.860> much<00:02:33.159> right<00:02:33.700> here

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
doesn't come out very much right here

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.229 
doesn't come out very much right here
which<00:02:35.860> I<00:02:35.980> like<00:02:36.310> that<00:02:36.340> it's<00:02:36.640> really<00:02:36.909> really

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
which I like that it's really really

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.839 
which I like that it's really really
thin<00:02:37.599> but<00:02:38.319> when<00:02:38.560> these<00:02:39.010> stick<00:02:39.310> out<00:02:39.459> farther

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
thin but when these stick out farther

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.520 
thin but when these stick out farther
than<00:02:40.060> that<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.569> this<00:02:40.780> doesn't<00:02:41.049> stick<00:02:41.349> up

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
than that and this doesn't stick up

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.949 
than that and this doesn't stick up
enough<00:02:42.129> it's<00:02:42.819> really<00:02:43.209> hard<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.510> get<00:02:43.629> in<00:02:43.780> and

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
enough it's really hard to get in and

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.440 
enough it's really hard to get in and
out<00:02:44.019> of<00:02:44.170> your<00:02:44.260> pocket<00:02:44.650> so<00:02:45.400> ultimately<00:02:46.120> I<00:02:46.360> think

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
out of your pocket so ultimately I think

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.100 
out of your pocket so ultimately I think
it's<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:46.840> good<00:02:47.049> knife<00:02:47.260> for<00:02:48.150> like<00:02:49.150> a<00:02:49.180> super

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
it's a good knife for like a super

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.130 
it's a good knife for like a super
backup<00:02:50.590> like<00:02:50.829> just<00:02:51.069> something<00:02:52.060> you<00:02:52.299> you<00:02:52.690> just

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
backup like just something you you just

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.369 
backup like just something you you just
have<00:02:53.349> available<00:02:54.190> as<00:02:54.459> an<00:02:54.640> extra<00:02:55.060> knife<00:02:55.290> put<00:02:56.290> it

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 
have available as an extra knife put it

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.039 
have available as an extra knife put it
in<00:02:56.470> your<00:02:56.590> bag<00:02:56.799> or<00:02:57.069> something<00:02:57.690> it's<00:02:58.690> super

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
in your bag or something it's super

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.650 
in your bag or something it's super
small<00:02:59.349> but<00:02:59.829> it's<00:03:00.129> it's<00:03:00.489> you<00:03:00.970> know<00:03:01.000> I<00:03:01.120> think

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
small but it's it's you know I think

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.900 
small but it's it's you know I think
there<00:03:01.780> are<00:03:01.810> certain<00:03:02.170> rules<00:03:02.410> about<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.980> spring

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
there are certain rules about the spring

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.300 
there are certain rules about the spring
safety<00:03:04.390> so<00:03:04.569> it's<00:03:04.690> small<00:03:04.930> size<00:03:05.140> you<00:03:05.590> know<00:03:05.709> it

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
safety so it's small size you know it

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.890 
safety so it's small size you know it
doesn't<00:03:06.549> necessarily<00:03:07.150> make<00:03:07.269> it<00:03:07.329> easier<00:03:07.750> to

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
doesn't necessarily make it easier to

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.780 
doesn't necessarily make it easier to
bring<00:03:08.049> around<00:03:08.200> if<00:03:08.620> you're<00:03:08.769> bringing<00:03:09.010> it<00:03:09.310> you

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
bring around if you're bringing it you

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.860 
bring around if you're bringing it you
know<00:03:09.909> for<00:03:10.120> travel<00:03:10.569> or<00:03:10.659> whatever<00:03:12.540> like<00:03:13.540> I<00:03:13.659> said

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
know for travel or whatever like I said

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.020 
know for travel or whatever like I said
you<00:03:14.079> know<00:03:14.200> kind<00:03:14.470> of<00:03:14.530> hard<00:03:14.709> to<00:03:14.769> open<00:03:15.609> and<00:03:15.879> close

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
you know kind of hard to open and close

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.140 
you know kind of hard to open and close
with<00:03:16.209> one<00:03:16.450> hand<00:03:17.519> because<00:03:18.519> of<00:03:18.940> this

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
with one hand because of this

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.039 
with one hand because of this
positioning<00:03:20.140> you<00:03:20.260> have<00:03:20.440> to<00:03:20.560> hold<00:03:20.739> it<00:03:20.920> up<00:03:21.450> so<00:03:22.450> I

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
positioning you have to hold it up so I

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.670 
positioning you have to hold it up so I
think<00:03:23.470> you<00:03:24.099> know<00:03:24.220> for<00:03:24.489> $30.00<00:03:25.209> I<00:03:25.239> don't<00:03:26.049> really

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
think you know for $30.00 I don't really

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.949 
think you know for $30.00 I don't really
like<00:03:27.099> the<00:03:27.310> design<00:03:27.669> I<00:03:28.120> probably<00:03:28.450> shouldn't

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
like the design I probably shouldn't

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.550 
like the design I probably shouldn't
have<00:03:29.019> bought<00:03:29.200> it<00:03:29.790> but<00:03:30.790> I<00:03:31.000> you<00:03:31.630> know<00:03:31.750> wanted<00:03:32.410> to

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
have bought it but I you know wanted to

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.280 
have bought it but I you know wanted to
get<00:03:32.950> a<00:03:32.980> new<00:03:33.220> knife<00:03:33.669> and<00:03:34.030> I<00:03:34.150> like<00:03:34.599> Gerber<00:03:34.989> so<00:03:35.260> I

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
get a new knife and I like Gerber so I

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.839 
get a new knife and I like Gerber so I
wanted<00:03:35.650> to<00:03:35.739> try<00:03:35.919> one<00:03:36.040> of<00:03:36.129> their<00:03:36.220> knives<00:03:36.430> and

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.180 

ultimately<00:03:39.849> I'll<00:03:40.030> probably<00:03:40.269> give<00:03:40.629> it<00:03:40.660> away<00:03:40.810> or

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
ultimately I'll probably give it away or

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.470 
ultimately I'll probably give it away or
shove<00:03:42.190> it<00:03:42.280> in<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.459> bag<00:03:42.609> and<00:03:42.849> never<00:03:42.940> see<00:03:43.180> it<00:03:43.299> for

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
shove it in the bag and never see it for

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.030 
shove it in the bag and never see it for
a<00:03:43.510> while<00:03:43.690> because<00:03:44.440> it's<00:03:44.590> just<00:03:44.859> not<00:03:45.010> very

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
a while because it's just not very

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.300 
a while because it's just not very
convenient<00:03:45.669> not<00:03:45.910> very<00:03:46.150> practical<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:47.310> it

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
convenient not very practical and it

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.409 
convenient not very practical and it
doesn't<00:03:48.519> really<00:03:48.639> hold<00:03:48.849> up<00:03:49.060> to<00:03:49.209> the<00:03:49.299> other

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419 
doesn't really hold up to the other

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:52.830 
doesn't really hold up to the other
knives<00:03:49.660> I<00:03:49.840> have<00:03:51.090> so<00:03:52.090> I<00:03:52.120> just<00:03:52.540> wanted<00:03:52.750> to

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
knives I have so I just wanted to

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.819 
knives I have so I just wanted to
highlight<00:03:53.079> some<00:03:53.230> of<00:03:53.470> those<00:03:53.530> negative

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
highlight some of those negative

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.300 
highlight some of those negative
features<00:03:54.930> just<00:03:55.930> in<00:03:56.079> case<00:03:56.290> you're<00:03:56.590> out<00:03:56.650> looking
