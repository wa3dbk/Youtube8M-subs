00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.580
 do not 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.309
 very good guys and girls I hope that 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.289
 are you brutally well used as 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.969
 islands not good let's go what we 're going 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:14.559
 clear that one of the most 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.570
 important influence when 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.580
 clean if a game we like it or not 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.710
 are its protagonists it does not matter if they are 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.169
 worms great kings or travelers 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.939
 temporary and since we're going to spend a lot 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.949
 hours in your company the best thing is that 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.960
 be charismatic, but it is not 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.419
 some that directly have nothing 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.300
 of meaning or very little or a lot of sense 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.710
 but really weird seriously what kind of toad 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.449
 had sucked to get to the 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.309
 conclusion of creating some of these 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:41.649
 zombies is first on our list 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.969
 because we are a little nostalgic a child 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:44.800
 with hair I do not know what wears a 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:46.480
 shorts and has the mission of 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.570
 retrieve the gold bracelet that you 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.280
 his grandfather gave away until there we go well the 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.140
 island where he has lived has been 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.780
 transformed because of the power that 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.250
 The evil ones are the devils 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.050
 very cool guys to be caught 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.329
 of the neck and enclose inside bags 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.330
 magical should you take this theme 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.340
 very seriously because it is no laughing matter 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.930
 Think about thinking about what a dead child 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.570
 he is throwing the fucking pig that 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.290
 someone help you please remember 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.570
 village 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.760
 a cheerful place where the 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.710
 Professor or who precisely smells 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.810
 much to singe an old man 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.150
 always surrounded by children who are 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.190
 gives gifts the difference between children and 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.980

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.350
 the pop you waltz to make us take a 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.420
 decision hey hey we were talking 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.130

 squeeze you have a very dirty mind 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.240
 we have to recognize that he has 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.130
 surprised the robot doctor ning in 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.920
 reality is nothing but a misunderstood 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.770
 a tesla a visionary ahead of his 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.350
 time since small and bo robot nor if it 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.330
 called ivo always dreamed of being a 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.180
 great scientist like his grandfather the doctor 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.280
 gerald robotnik when ivo grew up he had 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.860
 the robotics doctorate applied yes 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.020
 this one has a PhD is not like the rest 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.300
 of bad guys who call themselves doctors 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.500
 but gralia are bad without more I think that 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.500
 refers to you sir 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.420
 and he built the supermotivated matic 2000 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.370
 decided to show her the rest of the 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.040
 scientific community and a little more if you 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.319
 they laugh at his face but he did not give up and 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.390
 he ended up creating tomatoes with intelligence 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.700
 artificial that he intended to mass produce 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.500
 but the other scientists rejected him 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.560
 because they considered that he was creating 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.989
 an army of slaves at the end it 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.180
 It was planned that with these we are not 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.310
 we like my inventions because they give you 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.930
 to everyone and decided that he was going to command and 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.900
 who did not agree then to 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.069

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.390
 his mustache 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.390
