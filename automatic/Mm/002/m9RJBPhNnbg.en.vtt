you rely on these all the time show you
a<00:00:23.699> little<00:00:23.880> trick<00:00:24.980> it's<00:00:25.980> not<00:00:26.010> even<00:00:26.279> really<00:00:26.400> a

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
a little trick it's not even really a

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.750 
a little trick it's not even really a
trick<00:00:26.670> it's<00:00:26.820> just<00:00:27.769> you<00:00:28.769> can<00:00:28.920> upgrade<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.490> size

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
trick it's just you can upgrade the size

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.049 
trick it's just you can upgrade the size
of<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.119> windshield<00:00:30.480> wipers<00:00:30.920> I<00:00:31.920> think<00:00:32.910> from

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
of the windshield wipers I think from

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.990 
of the windshield wipers I think from
the<00:00:33.469> factory<00:00:34.469> they<00:00:34.649> recommend<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.250> twenty<00:00:35.579> or<00:00:35.610> I

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
the factory they recommend a twenty or I

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.280 
the factory they recommend a twenty or I
think<00:00:36.210> it's<00:00:36.300> probably<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> twenty<00:00:36.870> inch<00:00:36.899> maybe

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
think it's probably a twenty inch maybe

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.049 
think it's probably a twenty inch maybe
smaller<00:00:37.739> than<00:00:37.950> that

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
smaller than that

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.850 
smaller than that
you<00:00:39.360> can<00:00:39.510> put<00:00:39.660> up<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.899> twenty<00:00:40.200> six<00:00:40.469> inch<00:00:40.649> on

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
you can put up to a twenty six inch on

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.130 
you can put up to a twenty six inch on
these<00:00:41.040> trucks<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.879> not<00:00:42.510> have<00:00:42.719> any<00:00:42.899> problems

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.840 

it's<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.260> pretty<00:00:46.500> straightforward<00:00:47.280> process

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.229 

I'm<00:00:50.850> using<00:00:51.680> the<00:00:52.680> rain-x<00:00:53.070> latitude<00:00:53.219> blades<00:00:53.910> you

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
I'm using the rain-x latitude blades you

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.260 
I'm using the rain-x latitude blades you
can<00:00:54.300> see<00:00:54.510> right<00:00:54.660> here<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.930> says<00:00:55.050> 26<00:00:55.559> inches

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
can see right here it says 26 inches

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.250 
can see right here it says 26 inches
I<00:00:57.329> like<00:00:58.230> these<00:00:58.410> blades<00:00:58.739> because<00:00:59.399> uh<00:01:00.020> they<00:01:01.020> just

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
I like these blades because uh they just

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.570 
I like these blades because uh they just
always<00:01:01.620> work<00:01:01.890> well<00:01:02.070> for<00:01:02.219> me<00:01:02.340> my<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.579> fact<00:01:02.609> my

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
windshield wiper fluid is also rain-x

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.620 
windshield wiper fluid is also rain-x
and<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:08.280> does<00:01:08.490> what<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.760> says<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:09.090> beads

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
the difference between the two wipers

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.530 
the difference between the two wipers
this<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.520> old<00:01:17.700> blade<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.360> new

there it does come up a little bit off

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.459 
there it does come up a little bit off
the<00:01:54.390> edge<00:01:54.570> but<00:01:55.159> as<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.549> cycles<00:01:56.969> through<00:01:57.600> that

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
the edge but as it cycles through that

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.260 
the edge but as it cycles through that
won't<00:01:58.649> be<00:01:58.770> an<00:01:58.860> issue<00:01:58.979> because<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.790> won't<00:02:00.060> be<00:02:00.180> on

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
won't be an issue because it won't be on

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.060 
won't be an issue because it won't be on
a<00:02:00.299> curve<00:02:00.570> anymore<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.649> that's<00:02:01.799> not<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.920> big

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
a curve anymore so that's not a big

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:16.140 
a curve anymore so that's not a big
issue

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150
