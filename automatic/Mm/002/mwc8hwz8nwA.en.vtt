00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 to win it has the same times three 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.370
 defeats put in succession and in 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.020
 sum makes table space 19 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.139
 Welcome to the relegation zone 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.389
 the opponent today has hansa rostock 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.040
 just a point more on the 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.500
 account so not very famous 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.510
 lukas schönmüller will tell you something now 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.910
 Trainer schmidt thinks about it 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.369
 The three important points in Regensburg 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.019
 to leave 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.029
 the new job is really fun 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.070
 years old coach definitely not 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.599
 for alexander schmidt clearly 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.140
 more pleasure in changes in the 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.630
 list 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.820
 stephan loboué last against dortmund 2 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.770
 performance conditionally allowed out today 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.329
 between the post cheery goalkeeper 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.219
 change you play at the 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.870
 in Regensburg the guest from Rostock in 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.910
 blue from left to right puts the 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.450
 suppressed years ago and that shows 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.539
 effect 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:53.129
 weak defense heavyweight except 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.440
 benny and louis first exclamation mark 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.949
 from the hanse and an even thicker one from 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.719
 the old new number 1 only where it shows 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.100
 why he is one of the best for many 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.100
 goalkeeper of the third the ghosts 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.630
 the first ten minutes belonged completely 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.360
 clear hansa rostock regensburg with big 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.480
 problems as well as in interaction with 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:22.390
 perzl everything looks harmless but then 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:24.940
 comes wilfully in the end has louis the 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.540
 ball sure but there was a lot of dusel with 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.430
 it willich from over 30 meters to the 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.200
 post 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.900
 that would be a special gift for the 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.330
 old colleagues have been because I'm in front of two 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.920
 still years even for the year market the 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.660
 criticism of schmidt is a bit louder 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.840
 these days the more important today of the day 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.180
 win for him and for the team 15 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.250
 minutes played save Bach at his 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.090
 collective spectator mode no one goes 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.010
 but the post is in the way 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.840
 strong start of trattenbach and 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.870
 the first big chance for the 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.890
 Homeland team, however, it remains one 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:05.290
 exception seems three minutes later 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.100
 but everything is not quite harmless 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:11.729
 shortly loses the ball four bed room 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.729
 101 rostock 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.310
 the management is completely in order 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.440
 but what does regensburgs do? 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.680
 defender of the short despite 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.370
 long-term employment in deep sleep 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:29.120
 sherbini and room dry like it 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.120
 not dry 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.590
 50 third league goal in the career of 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:40.269
 Marcel Ziemer could be one of those years 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.269
 definitely good too 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.249
 and of course your defense chief 0 too 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:48.709
 1 at half-time Sebastian Semester of the 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:49.389
 injured captain becomes painfully 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.439
 missing 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:53.030
 alexander schmidt reacted 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.950
 beginning of the second half a fresh one 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.900
 striker and thomas tesla seems 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.700
 really fresh will catch up shortly after 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.700
 re- whistle the same time 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:12.370
 apple brings her short she uses 49 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.270
 minutes of the years with the compensation 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:19.530
 thomas kurz makes the hit and his 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.530
 thick patches good again 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.209
 the hansa defensive loses him out of the 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.520
 eyes short former striker at Wacker 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.030
 burghausen compensates if the 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.540
 Regensburger back in this game 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.540
 it works 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:49.430
 the ssv now as changed step 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.430
 and in the middle 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.080
 the German-Syrian artistically but without 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:04:00.420
 the necessary pressure nevertheless a correct 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:02.640
 good possibility it is now strike 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:06.510
 on strike Regensburg necessarily wants the 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.620
 management 56 minute Trettenbach as always 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:15.030
 tireless on his right side 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:16.230
 steininger schlussmann stephan loboué in 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.480
 the first half in the middle of it 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.040
 now only amazed to 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.989
 watch 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:25.500
 but it does not stay four minutes 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.830
 later corner hansa arc lamp and 21 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.830
 back 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.460
 Again, it is marcel ziemer second 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.670
 hit for the attacker 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:39.390
 second residue for the saffron years 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:43.320
 brings the ball to the center and room 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.320
 jumps higher than lean 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:54.080
 but this residue does not last 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:58.520
 especially long 66 minute grove up 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:01.270
 highway and this time he makes him 22 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.270
 regensburg 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.320
 oliver hein with the clever pass on man 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.590
 one failed from a short distance 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.950
 Now he stays cool for years 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.950
 the compensation 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:23.880
 third hit in the fifth game for as 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.320
 From such a man you have to prefer that 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.660
 Game continues to develop 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.880
 highlight machine minutes later again 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.890
 who looks and rescues that 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.570
 aluminum 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:37.820
 the margin goes over it 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.820
 hardly more time to breathe 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.510
 hansa coach peter vollmann has one 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.340
 predicted a stress game and both 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.990
 Coaches look like they are right 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.060
 could have 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:53.010
 especially because the game even more ride 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:57.890
 takes still meet Trettenbach 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.890
 was stretch 32 regensburg 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:09.889
 what is going on here 73 minute of the 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:13.940
 jahn turns the game fabian trettenbach 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:13.940
 3 to 2 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:21.010
 Round years still has on the tank 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.850
 out of man passing the chair falls down 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.850
 no matter 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:38.880
 romas dressler 429 minutes before the end 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:41.340
 Substitute romas dressler in 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:46.090
 midfielder Manner dusted off and 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:49.290
 makes a preliminary decision just think 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:52.650
 three minutes later corner hansa blocked 

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:55.110
 pull female with the second attempt 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:57.910
 Traumtor back for it 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:59.530
 a side-puller still brings rostock 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:02.740
 get there and at the same time the goal is 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:06.760
 what third hit today but not 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:08.440
 its last 88 minutes of last 

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:13.630
 minute compensation for the hansa cog 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:16.900
 four to four marcel ziemer meets the 

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:22.260
 her subject to a year's anyway 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:22.260
 positive what this roller coaster conclusion 

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:30.220
 we can start from scratch or 

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.050
 so we have to pull out the positive 

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.460
 Of course, turn off the errors as to 

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.380
 example the individual errors of 

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:37.000
 to the 10th 

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:39.850
 the positive with pulling sixth game 

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.230
 and then snatches the winner piece a 

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:43.360
 won third on Wednesday in stuttgart 

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:45.400
 The soul of the year definitely do good 

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.110
 despite two goals lead playful 

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:50.050
 Regensburg the three believed safe 

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:52.660
 15 also just five 

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:56.130
 Games are a scary statistic of it 

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.130
 So there is clearly still need for speech
