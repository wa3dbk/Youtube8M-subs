words or quickly changing one word to
another<00:00:44.719> it's<00:00:45.719> such<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.960> good<00:00:46.410> way<00:00:47.039> to

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
another it's such a good way to

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.389 
another it's such a good way to
demonstrate<00:00:48.270> how<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.480> works<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.920> cut<00:00:50.190> and

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
demonstrate how that works the cut and

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.459 
demonstrate how that works the cut and
the<00:00:50.610> paste<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.660> word<00:00:51.870> processing<00:00:52.289> program

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
the paste in a word processing program

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.490 
the paste in a word processing program
is<00:00:53.329> similar<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.539> an<00:00:54.629> idea<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> young

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
is similar to an idea that a young

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.160 
is similar to an idea that a young
writer<00:00:56.039> would<00:00:56.399> have<00:00:56.550> used<00:00:56.760> using<00:00:57.719> scissors
