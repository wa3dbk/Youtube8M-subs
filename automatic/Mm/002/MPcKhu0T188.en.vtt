you<00:00:51.090> look<00:00:51.270> at<00:00:51.420> apple<00:00:51.870> today<00:00:52.050> apples<00:00:52.649> barely

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
you look at apple today apples barely

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.799 
you look at apple today apples barely
positive<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.879> day<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.149> fact<00:00:54.390> Apple's

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
positive on the day in fact Apple's

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.779 
positive on the day in fact Apple's
making<00:00:55.140> an<00:00:55.230> in<00:00:55.410> spirit<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.949> bearish<00:00:56.370> pattern

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
making an in spirit of bearish pattern

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.790 
making an in spirit of bearish pattern
here<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.510> that's<00:00:57.690> number<00:00:57.840> one<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.680> other

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
here so that's number one the other

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.260 
here so that's number one the other
factor<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.219> makes<00:00:59.460> me<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.670> little<00:00:59.969> bit<00:01:00.149> of

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
factor that makes me a little bit of

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.819 
factor that makes me a little bit of
concerned<00:01:00.719> about<00:01:01.050> what<00:01:01.260> could<00:01:01.410> happen<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
concerned about what could happen in the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.799 
concerned about what could happen in the
next<00:01:01.949> couple<00:01:02.219> days<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.390> fact<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.719> the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
next couple days is the fact that the

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.800 
next couple days is the fact that the
VXX<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.860> up<00:01:05.189> on<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.670> day<00:01:05.790> now<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:05.970> VXX<00:01:06.479> mirrors

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
VXX is up on the day now the VXX mirrors

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.560 
VXX is up on the day now the VXX mirrors

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
fact that the volatility index is

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.359 
fact that the volatility index is
actually<00:01:11.880> up<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.840> usually<00:01:13.229> or<00:01:13.950> at<00:01:14.040> least<00:01:14.250> it

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
actually up it's usually or at least it

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.340 
actually up it's usually or at least it
normally<00:01:14.850> would<00:01:14.970> be<00:01:15.119> down<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:15.420> an<00:01:15.780> update<00:01:16.140> it's

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
normally would be down on an update it's

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.590 
normally would be down on an update it's
usually<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.860> verse<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.369> markets<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.390> this

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
usually in verse to the markets so this

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.969 
usually in verse to the markets so this
is<00:01:18.750> telling<00:01:18.900> us<00:01:19.110> there's<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.500> little<00:01:19.740> bit<00:01:19.920> of

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
is telling us there's a little bit of

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.710 
is telling us there's a little bit of
fear<00:01:20.280> brewing<00:01:20.670> here<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.090> there's<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.509> little

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
fear brewing here and there's a little

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.870 
fear brewing here and there's a little
bit<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:21.930> protection<00:01:22.110> being<00:01:22.590> taken<00:01:23.070> my<00:01:23.580> guess

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
bit of protection being taken my guess

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.630 
bit of protection being taken my guess
is<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.360> has<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.780> do<00:01:24.960> with<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.890> markets

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
is it has to do with the markets

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.550 
is it has to do with the markets
expecting<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.420> European<00:01:28.049> summit<00:01:28.320> tomorrow

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
expecting this European summit tomorrow

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.620 
expecting this European summit tomorrow
and<00:01:29.009> some<00:01:29.159> factors<00:01:29.640> involving<00:01:30.150> around<00:01:30.420> that

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
and some factors involving around that

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.120 
and some factors involving around that
but<00:01:31.140> at<00:01:31.259> least<00:01:31.350> that's<00:01:31.619> what<00:01:31.799> I'm<00:01:31.890> seeing

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
but at least that's what I'm seeing

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.100 
but at least that's what I'm seeing
right<00:01:32.250> now<00:01:32.600> alright<00:01:33.600> we'll<00:01:33.720> continue<00:01:33.869> to

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
right now alright we'll continue to

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.539 
right now alright we'll continue to
really<00:01:34.350> monitor<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:34.979> see<00:01:35.250> how<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.460> all

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
really monitor that and see how it all

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.219 
really monitor that and see how it all
plays<00:01:35.610> out<00:01:36.000> but<00:01:36.180> right<00:01:36.299> now<00:01:36.509> that's<00:01:36.930> my

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
plays out but right now that's my

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.990 
plays out but right now that's my
estimation<00:01:37.770> either<00:01:38.009> way<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.430> tells<00:01:38.670> us<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.909> be

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
estimation either way it tells us to be

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.850 
estimation either way it tells us to be
cautious<00:01:39.299> going<00:01:39.659> into<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.079> next<00:01:40.380> day<00:01:40.500> or<00:01:40.680> so

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
cautious going into the next day or so

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.960 
cautious going into the next day or so
into<00:01:41.280> tomorrow<00:01:41.970> because<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:43.020> these<00:01:43.140> factors

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970
