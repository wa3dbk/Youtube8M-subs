00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:10.290
 hi I'm marco sonohra the teacher of 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.889
 thesis the fi instructor I want a 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:17.820
 course to advanced and the course in progress 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.970
 that for beginners and advanced is a 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.330
 course for everyone taxi is an art 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.230
 martial is an act and martial and like 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.570
 such is a tool for working on 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.000
 themselves is a job that is done 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.239
 on the outside to improve 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.829
 inside so it's something 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:42.329
 through our body it gives us one 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.980
 different perception of the world is a 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.750
 path that we do inside 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:51.989
 of our body and we are moving towards 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.079
 something we discover with our hands 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.020
 so it is not a goal that 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.149
 we set ourselves from the beginning but it is 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.040
 simply a trend is towards a 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.850
 change ea 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.850
 the event the terror 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.010
 we could say that the tie improves 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.950
 our ability to concentrate e 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.020
 improves our ability to move 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:21.770
 improves our relationship with 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.840
 with others also because of what 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.670
 it's a 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.280
 greater awareness is not greater 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:32.679
 its centering and balance on us 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:35.259
 themselves with we enter this room e 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:38.469
 let's try first of all let it 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:41.709
 out everything that does not belong 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:45.569
 to the practice in taxi or better we hope 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:48.909
 to take away from us a burden of 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:50.380
 concerns of busy schedules 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.439
 who accompanied us throughout the 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.360
 day and therefore are liberating exercises 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:57.069
 in a full glass I can't 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.439
 enter another year I have to 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:03.340
 emptying and then making a space for dell 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:06.610
 clean empty water first of all 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:10.660
 body from thoughts etc. through a 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.870
 physical work also quite dynamic 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.620
 then 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:20.099
 you can trust you can yes you can do 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.620
 fatigue muscularly and then get ready 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:26.790
 to a second job that is a job that 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.459
 it is called cigo umberto dolci tour that is 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.519
 a work on energy is a job that 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.040
 we do through gods 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:48.120
 exercises that leads us to an improvement 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:51.150
 of our inexistence new in the third 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.120
 part we proceed to the study of the form 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.569
 and therefore fits into one 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:03.569
 container both the previous exercises 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:05.579
 that you care or you are in practice 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.739
 of form there is always attention 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:12.810
 constant to what is ours 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:16.200
 culture to the development of intention so 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.530
 hence the ability to create to do 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.530
 something 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.590
 practicing taxis each of us starts at 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.480
 speak peak your body or 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.980
 better to listen to it 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.560
 you start listening to your own 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.340
 body then you start to understand if 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.709
 some postures not only 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:42.370
 adequate if I'm really doing it 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.650
 something that is good for me is 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.810
 something that each one of us carries 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.540
 at home doing as much of one's life 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:53.409
 and for what I said that times yes 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:57.040
 it is something that changes and that is 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:04:00.760
 comparable to a street is a street because 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:04.750
 we begin to put on a road of 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.849
 an inner change through a 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.220
 exercise of the body an exercise that 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:13.299
 it is done by the practice of a form 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:16.709
 which is codified and through which 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:19.620
 all develop a little 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:33.449
 characteristics of this martial art 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:33.449
 every movement and we come 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.990
 eden is focused on that 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:44.099
 you try to 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:45.990
 work on your space work on 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:47.759
 own space means to occupy it 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.800
 space around 1 means 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:52.020
 override the space in someone else 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.699
 but simply to be aware and 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.310
 awareness of all that is 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:58.139
 within our living space the 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.970
 management of our living space 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:02.810
 it also improves relationships with others 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.680
 people because of one 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.270
 luck an awareness of limits 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.970
 reciprocal in the interaction between 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.370
 people practice from pieces to helps 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:16.150
 psychophysical centering precisely because 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.880
 puts ourselves at 100 in our world 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:25.830
 it is not a selfish view of the del 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:29.820
 world is a vision that brings you 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:31.980
 a personal well-being to be pure 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.760
 the fact that we work on ours 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.849
 body to tend to improvement is 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.590
 also one 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:42.250
 an improvement that happens in ours 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.250
 spirit
