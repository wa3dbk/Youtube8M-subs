anyway
see<00:04:30.630> how<00:04:30.780> it<00:04:30.900> does<00:04:31.080> plug<00:04:31.320> it<00:04:31.410> in<00:04:31.530> there<00:04:32.930> bring

see how it does plug it in there bring
you<00:04:33.990> back<00:04:34.170> here<00:04:34.380> in<00:04:34.470> the<00:04:34.560> back<00:04:36.350> you<00:04:37.350> can<00:04:37.470> see

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
you back here in the back you can see

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.370 
you back here in the back you can see
from<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:37.920> inside<00:04:38.040> here<00:04:38.580> but<00:04:39.510> it<00:04:39.840> goes<00:04:40.020> down<00:04:40.230> to

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
from the inside here but it goes down to

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.410 
from the inside here but it goes down to
the<00:04:40.470> ground<00:04:40.620> so<00:04:41.040> if<00:04:41.130> you<00:04:41.220> had<00:04:41.430> a<00:04:41.460> flash<00:04:42.180> flood

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
the ground so if you had a flash flood

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.510 
the ground so if you had a flash flood
or<00:04:42.690> something<00:04:42.900> like<00:04:43.080> that<00:04:43.140> come<00:04:43.560> through<00:04:43.740> it

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
or something like that come through it

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.460 
or something like that come through it
would<00:04:44.700> make<00:04:44.910> it<00:04:45.030> under<00:04:45.330> but<00:04:45.870> you're<00:04:46.110> kind<00:04:46.350> of

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
would make it under but you're kind of

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.960 
would make it under but you're kind of
up<00:04:46.620> on<00:04:46.740> a<00:04:46.800> tub<00:04:48.170> I'd<00:04:49.170> say<00:04:49.380> about<00:04:49.760> three<00:04:50.760> inches

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
up on a tub I'd say about three inches

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.530 
up on a tub I'd say about three inches
high<00:04:51.180> so<00:04:52.490> you<00:04:53.490> could<00:04:53.700> get<00:04:53.850> water<00:04:54.030> in<00:04:54.210> there<00:04:54.390> if

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
high so you could get water in there if

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.320 
high so you could get water in there if
it<00:04:54.690> come<00:04:55.050> up<00:04:55.170> over<00:04:55.410> that<00:04:55.500> look<00:04:55.730> so<00:04:56.730> flooding

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
it come up over that look so flooding

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.120 
it come up over that look so flooding
would<00:04:57.420> be<00:04:57.510> a<00:04:57.540> problem<00:04:57.960> if<00:04:58.140> you<00:04:58.170> were<00:04:58.470> in<00:04:58.680> a

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
would be a problem if you were in a

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.670 
would be a problem if you were in a
flooded<00:04:59.400> area<00:04:59.520> with<00:04:59.730> this<00:05:01.280> anyway

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
flooded area with this anyway

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.930 
flooded area with this anyway
clearance<00:05:04.680> as<00:05:04.770> far<00:05:04.980> as<00:05:05.070> Headroom<00:05:05.490> things<00:05:05.790> like

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
clearance as far as Headroom things like

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.490 
clearance as far as Headroom things like
that<00:05:06.090> is<00:05:06.270> fine<00:05:06.480> it's<00:05:06.720> not<00:05:06.840> really<00:05:07.050> meant<00:05:07.260> to<00:05:07.320> be

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
that is fine it's not really meant to be

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.950 
that is fine it's not really meant to be
a<00:05:07.640> hangout<00:05:08.640> in<00:05:08.850> shelter<00:05:09.300> and<00:05:09.600> it's<00:05:09.750> more<00:05:09.930> of

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
a hangout in shelter and it's more of

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.690 
a hangout in shelter and it's more of
just<00:05:10.110> a<00:05:10.230> sleep<00:05:10.470> shelter<00:05:11.600> and<00:05:13.370> we'll<00:05:14.370> see<00:05:14.520> how

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
just a sleep shelter and we'll see how

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.330 
just a sleep shelter and we'll see how
it<00:05:14.820> does<00:05:14.970> tonight<00:05:15.470> but<00:05:16.470> I'll<00:05:16.950> make<00:05:17.130> another

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
it does tonight but I'll make another

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.240 
it does tonight but I'll make another
video<00:05:17.490> for<00:05:17.850> that<00:05:18.030> and<00:05:18.860> let<00:05:19.860> me<00:05:19.890> know<00:05:19.980> what<00:05:20.160> you
