00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.430
 Sportfreunde today is about the 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:09.090
 different tools areas at 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.990
 run and come pedaling while cycling 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:18.150
 Cycling to me with tests so new 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:22.830
 I have cycling in the 560 and a 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.410
 52 at europe swell course then watch 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.779
 me a bit and then I wonder 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.489
 why is it and then they say yes 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.020
 because he said that is normal 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.820
 I can not quite accept 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.570
 I want to vote with this course today 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.570
 explain my point of view padding point 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.190
 it is deeper in the rat form europa 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.530
 faster pulse is deeper than when 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.079
 run and that means yours for me 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.739
 Technology is not as good as it is 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.309
 is clearly the weight is allowed to run 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.870
 it has to wear it 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.180
 you have to weight that over the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.550
 bring distance and automatically goes the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.189
 to have a high pulse when cycling 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.439
 said relaxation is comfortable reminder 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.270
 stretched or companies very high and you 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.210
 drive through the area that is 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.049
 Of course, it's clear that the depot is one 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:20.640
 is a little bit deeper because you than 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:24.360
 athlete is not yet an optimal i say 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.909
 now an optimal technique on the 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.640
 rad implement can basically can 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.610
 I can do the same in every sport 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.270
 have at europe threshold pumps 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.030
 provided the technology of 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.250
 So perfect when you live 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.259
 come so different then I say 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.829
 not just okay I pretend you have to 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.740
 hold g1 is when running so g1 is at 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.170
 Driver drive away so explorer I say 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.049
 Okay, let's start with your technique first 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.689
 So working with me that was how it is 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.119
 is the fast pulse when cycling 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.130
 higher than when running so I had to 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.380
 the running technology work a bit 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.509
 usually it is 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.910
 Let's work on the technique first 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:15.569
 if you look a bit more closely 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.120
 Cyclist password sends up with the 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.030
 Use like printed and poor and stuff 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.090
 He would have to be at least a minimum 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.690
 I can realize more poses and 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.260
 certainly much more woman and two 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.110
 can transport 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.970
 from a runner of relative to the 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.040
 legs running and eyes just not 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.380
 so it tastes like that is mine 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.670
 consideration 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.930
 let's go back what can you do 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.099
 can do five things if you 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.620
 you are interested in your pulse 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:49.170
 to match and out of it, too 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.280
 better statistics and on these 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.049
 online platforms in which areas 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.390
 have effectively trained out 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.340
 So you want that too, the very first 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:04.079
 Exercise is you will just times 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:07.200
 basically aware of pressure phases when 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:10.709
 drive many times into many drivers 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.230
 drivers sit on the bike and are 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:17.609
 somewhere just a lot of times 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:20.160
 Pressure to retreat makes you feel easy 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:22.019
 just start with a relatively deep 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.700
 Cadence I say it now around the 60th 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.829
 around you really that 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.780
 but I can understand now 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:31.319
 in the pressure phase punchy rock ago 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:37.500
 sentence the pressure phase search phase ok 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:39.299
 Become aware of each second as you 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.600
 can do is driver in each 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.639
 Training very little bit of resistance 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.280
 means athlete with a knife or 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:51.560
 Other whether measuring device one bicycles 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:56.489
 continue around 50 watts and now try the 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:04:00.660
 360 Â° pedal turn to really feel 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:03.450
 So that means 50 words to press and 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:09.450
 no demolition here 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:12.240
 50 50 50 right leg 50 50 50 left 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.820
 leg sensitized 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:18.090
 this 50's if you ever had that 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.920
 constant is pretty pretty good 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.530
 then, thirdly, what you can do 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.690
 just increase the cadence it is 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.810
 quite clear that the athletes with rather 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:32.020
 driving lower cadences long distances 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:35.080
 just need to increase the cadence 110 times 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:38.230
 around the 1520 plus and then you will 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.690
 notice how you actually monkeys on the 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.120
 pedestal, I say, now rides and 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.710
 not sitting anymore that's the indiz 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.350
 if you watch the cyclists 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.800
 or france what the company super nice 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.960
 high cadence have provided lookout tower 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.350
 that 's the goal, that's how it's done 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.240
 means that means that the pressure 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:02.500
 at home simply into each other 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:07.090
 fourth thing you can do is flow 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:09.190
 you come with about four main professionals 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.860
 So four kilos of private consumption certainly 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.919
 continue against a deep cut 145 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:19.930
 because to press times just really 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:21.250
 the big length around realizes that means 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.370
 because exposing press 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:27.040
 in her press then thinks too 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.919
 thus parallel crosses over the thoughts 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.590
 and be here when press with bikini 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.630
 wear if here and move back if here 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.520
 So that's what we realize 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.510
 two legs actually together 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.610
 talk 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:43.510
 usually drives the driver in front of me 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:46.630
 the risk that know so drive around but 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.810
 takes that time was deliberately 45 cadence 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.540
 to push over the cross 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.340
 press pull and here is no victim 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:57.000
 is that if from here 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:06:00.210
 Pressure phase in the train journey is already 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.400
 that other left leg and pushes him in 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.050
 lend the pressure phase and then it is 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.940
 a beautiful interplay i 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.130
 could not imagine how should 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:13.320
 a threshold is not exactly where the in 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:15.510
 is about the same as the last run 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.970
 of the five exercises is of course the 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:20.820
 Classics that I once exercise 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:23.310
 additional hometrainer 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:26.100
 just once away two minutes long with 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.780
 right leg 70's cadence fairest 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.570
 team but how tall you are with that 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:34.380
 Pulse, it will come to be you 

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:35.850
 muscle pain previously get before 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.770
 go somewhere during the break and 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:41.250
 bad sign so that with 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:43.010
 a wine should come to the threshold 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.850
 I now theoretically we can do that 

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:47.280
 disabled athletes too with a far 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.510
 years ago, the threshold around there 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.250
 do you see your own? 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.380
 Disabilities that make you feel that way 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:55.770
 have crept over the ears of you 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:58.620
 others believe that the ok I take over 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:04.919
 Although also positive for cycling 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:07.500
 is not so important that that 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:09.270
 Knowing this hamlet nothing is easy 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.310
 so in life but one may ask 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.530
 ask to practice there 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:15.900
 I think if you have these five exercises 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:19.440
 Over three months with each training 

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:21.210
 a few minutes one did will all her 

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.979
 that's going to be different on the bike 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:25.919
 you will notice saddle bit height 

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:28.860
 maybe deep to the front back 

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:31.169
 it will all flow for 

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:34.620
 cycling driver to flow through 

00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:38.870
 such simple banal exercise tastes 

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.870
 it even goes me a feedback thank you
