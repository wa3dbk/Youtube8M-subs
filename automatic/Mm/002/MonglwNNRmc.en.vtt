I MIDI attack and today I want to talk
to<00:00:05.819> you<00:00:05.970> about<00:00:06.029> console<00:00:06.870> ports<00:00:07.170> essentially

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
to you about console ports essentially

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.350 
to you about console ports essentially
and<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.250> reason<00:00:08.490> I'm<00:00:08.580> discussing<00:00:08.910> this<00:00:09.150> this

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
and the reason I'm discussing this this

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.820 
and the reason I'm discussing this this
week<00:00:09.540> is<00:00:09.719> because<00:00:10.019> last<00:00:10.200> week<00:00:10.320> we<00:00:10.559> had<00:00:10.590> the

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
week is because last week we had the

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.780 
week is because last week we had the
horrible<00:00:11.190> batman<00:00:11.550> arkham<00:00:12.000> knight<00:00:12.330> fiasco<00:00:13.019> and

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:13.790 
horrible batman arkham knight fiasco and

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.790 
horrible batman arkham knight fiasco and
disaster<00:00:14.790> so<00:00:15.269> i<00:00:15.299> thought<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:16.199> was<00:00:16.350> fitting<00:00:16.560> to

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
disaster so i thought it was fitting to

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.349 
disaster so i thought it was fitting to
discuss<00:00:17.160> maybe<00:00:17.730> some<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.090> potential

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
discuss maybe some of the potential

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.000 
discuss maybe some of the potential
reasons<00:00:18.660> behind<00:00:18.990> why<00:00:19.199> these<00:00:19.380> things<00:00:19.560> keep

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
reasons behind why these things keep

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.320 
reasons behind why these things keep
happening<00:00:20.039> time<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:20.880> time<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.029> time<00:00:21.210> again

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
happening time and time and time again

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.210 
happening time and time and time again
and<00:00:21.689> look<00:00:22.320> into<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.710> little<00:00:22.859> bit<00:00:23.039> deeper

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
and look into it a little bit deeper

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.710 
and look into it a little bit deeper
than<00:00:23.460> maybe<00:00:23.670> some<00:00:23.970> people<00:00:24.090> in<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.390> comments

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
than maybe some people in the comments

willing to do not to have a go at any of
you<00:00:27.840> guys<00:00:27.990> but<00:00:28.320> some<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.710> arguments

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
you guys but some of the arguments

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.439 
you guys but some of the arguments
people<00:00:29.400> were<00:00:29.460> making<00:00:29.580> were<00:00:29.880> ridiculous

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
people were making were ridiculous

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.450 
people were making were ridiculous
anyway<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.320> prevailing<00:00:31.769> argument<00:00:32.160> seems<00:00:32.309> to

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
anyway the prevailing argument seems to

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.930 
anyway the prevailing argument seems to
be<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.930> piracy<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.680> cause<00:00:34.890> right<00:00:35.250> piracy

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
be that piracy is the cause right piracy

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.760 
be that piracy is the cause right piracy
leads<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.390> reduced<00:00:36.660> income<00:00:36.960> on<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.469> pc

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
leads to reduced income on the pc

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.650 
leads to reduced income on the pc
platform<00:00:37.800> making<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.790> essentially<00:00:39.239> not<00:00:39.390> worth

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
platform making it essentially not worth

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.049

the<00:00:39.899> development<00:00:40.350> time<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.680> effort<00:00:40.950> which<00:00:41.579> i

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
the development time and effort which i

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.600 
the development time and effort which i
don't<00:00:42.690> know<00:00:42.750> if<00:00:42.989> that's<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.350> case<00:00:43.620> right<00:00:44.129> then

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
don't know if that's the case right then

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.779 
don't know if that's the case right then

now because we have that system and also
it's<00:01:03.180> going<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.449> hurt<00:01:03.539> any<00:01:03.750> good<00:01:03.989> will<00:01:04.229> the

it's going to hurt any good will the

customer might have had towards the
studio<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.210> doesn't<00:01:06.240> seem<00:01:06.570> like<00:01:06.600> very<00:01:06.869> smart

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
studio it doesn't seem like very smart

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.070 
studio it doesn't seem like very smart
business<00:01:08.070> sense<00:01:08.280> right<00:01:08.520> why<00:01:09.299> go<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.570> if<00:01:09.960> it's

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
business sense right why go in if it's

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.840 
business sense right why go in if it's
that<00:01:10.260> bad<00:01:10.500> that's<00:01:10.890> essentially<00:01:11.610> what<00:01:11.729> i'm

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
that bad that's essentially what i'm

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.660 
that bad that's essentially what i'm
saying<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.780> other<00:01:12.930> claim<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.670> pc

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
saying and the other claim is that pc

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.160 
saying and the other claim is that pc
games<00:01:14.850> don't<00:01:15.090> make<00:01:15.210> enough<00:01:15.450> money<00:01:15.600> i<00:01:15.869> don't

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
games don't make enough money i don't

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.600 
games don't make enough money i don't
think<00:01:16.320> that's<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.530> very<00:01:16.650> reasonable<00:01:17.070> argument

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
think that's a very reasonable argument

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.890 
think that's a very reasonable argument
to<00:01:17.670> be<00:01:17.759> honest<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.090> mean<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.299> just<00:01:18.509> have<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.689> point

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
to be honest I mean I just have to point

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.660 
to be honest I mean I just have to point
to<00:01:19.110> grand<00:01:19.350> theft<00:01:19.409> auto<00:01:19.650> 5<00:01:19.979> or<00:01:20.310> The<00:01:20.400> Witcher<00:01:20.640> 3

prove<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.390> theory<00:01:24.840> wrong<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.229> mean<00:01:25.380> it's

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
prove that theory wrong I mean it's

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.710 
prove that theory wrong I mean it's
ridiculous<00:01:26.009> now<00:01:26.430> they<00:01:26.820> may<00:01:26.970> not<00:01:27.090> make<00:01:27.150> as<00:01:27.390> much

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
ridiculous now they may not make as much

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.510 
ridiculous now they may not make as much
money<00:01:27.780> as<00:01:28.170> consoles<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.159> does<00:01:29.340> explain

money as consoles and that does explain

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.219 
money as consoles and that does explain
why<00:01:29.759> developers<00:01:30.060> choose<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.630> focus<00:01:30.750> more<00:01:31.200> on

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
why developers choose to focus more on

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.289 
why developers choose to focus more on
the<00:01:31.500> console<00:01:31.890> market<00:01:32.040> however<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.000> say<00:01:33.150> that

I<00:01:54.570> mean<00:01:54.810> that's<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.560> ridiculous<00:01:55.799> right<00:01:56.670> it

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
I mean that's it's ridiculous right it

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.060 
I mean that's it's ridiculous right it
doesn't<00:01:57.240> explain<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.930> at<00:01:58.049> all<00:01:58.170> especially

doesn't explain that at all especially

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.530 
doesn't explain that at all especially
when<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.250> consider<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.640> they<00:01:59.880> also<00:02:00.060> really

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
when you consider that they also really

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
well on PC for the most part as far as I

can remember now in my mind the reason

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.020 
can remember now in my mind the reason
this<00:02:07.799> keeps<00:02:08.069> happening<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.670> because<00:02:08.700> the

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
this keeps happening is because the

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.880 
this keeps happening is because the

all this year and that's because every

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
now don't get me wrong here developments

extremely hard and I'm not attacking
developers<00:02:27.060> necessarily<00:02:27.630> but<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:28.380> know<00:02:28.470> if

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
developers necessarily but you know if

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.500 
developers necessarily but you know if
you<00:02:28.740> don't<00:02:28.920> hit<00:02:29.070> your<00:02:29.220> targets<00:02:29.730> it's<00:02:30.270> going<00:02:30.450> to

you don't hit your targets it's going to

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.060 
you don't hit your targets it's going to
cost<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.810> publisher<00:02:31.200> more<00:02:31.380> money<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:31.800> keep

cost the publisher more money to keep
you<00:02:32.250> in<00:02:32.370> business<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:33.030> eventually<00:02:33.510> the

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
you in business and eventually the

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.050 
you in business and eventually the
publisher<00:02:35.070> is<00:02:35.130> going<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.370> say<00:02:35.490> okay<00:02:35.730> enough<00:02:35.970> is

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
publisher is going to say okay enough is

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.250 
publisher is going to say okay enough is
enough<00:02:36.360> right<00:02:36.750> they're<00:02:36.930> going<00:02:37.020> to<00:02:37.110> start

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
enough right they're going to start

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.450 
enough right they're going to start
putting<00:02:37.350> pressure<00:02:37.620> on<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:37.950> developer<00:02:38.310> and

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
putting pressure on the developer and

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.490 
putting pressure on the developer and
eventually<00:02:38.940> in<00:02:39.090> some<00:02:39.300> cases<00:02:39.510> pull<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.320> plug

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
eventually in some cases pull the plug

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.800 
eventually in some cases pull the plug
entirely<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.250> release<00:02:41.910> broken<00:02:42.330> games<00:02:42.540> and

entirely and release broken games and

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.120 
entirely and release broken games and
this<00:02:43.230> is<00:02:43.350> where<00:02:43.500> I<00:02:43.530> think<00:02:43.620> we<00:02:43.770> run<00:02:44.010> into

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
this is where I think we run into

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.550 
this is where I think we run into
problems<00:02:44.310> as<00:02:45.210> we've<00:02:45.540> sort<00:02:45.840> of<00:02:45.870> established<00:02:45.960> or

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
problems as we've sort of established or

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.780 
problems as we've sort of established or
at<00:02:46.770> least<00:02:47.040> for<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.250> sake<00:02:47.400> of<00:02:47.430> this<00:02:47.640> video

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
at least for the sake of this video

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.030 
at least for the sake of this video
let's<00:02:48.210> just<00:02:48.390> say<00:02:48.540> that<00:02:48.720> this<00:02:48.840> is<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.110> case<00:02:49.290> the

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
let's just say that this is the case the

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.650 
let's just say that this is the case the
console<00:02:50.400> market<00:02:50.550> is<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.180> focus<00:02:51.510> of<00:02:51.570> many

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
console market is the focus of many

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.050 
console market is the focus of many
developers<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.410> they<00:02:53.400> do<00:02:53.460> make<00:02:53.760> more<00:02:53.940> money

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
developers and they do make more money

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.730 
developers and they do make more money
from<00:02:54.240> that<00:02:54.390> market<00:02:54.750> that's<00:02:55.080> arguable<00:02:55.590> but

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
from that market that's arguable but

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.170 
from that market that's arguable but
let's<00:02:55.920> just<00:02:56.100> say<00:02:56.220> for<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.400> sake<00:02:56.910> of<00:02:56.970> this

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
let's just say for the sake of this

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.640 
let's just say for the sake of this
video<00:02:57.330> that<00:02:57.630> they<00:02:57.750> do<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.260> that's<00:02:58.440> where

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
video that they do and that's where

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.920 
video that they do and that's where
their<00:02:58.770> focuses<00:02:59.220> so<00:02:59.520> you<00:03:00.390> would<00:03:00.540> say<00:03:00.720> this

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
their focuses so you would say this

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
focus is justified if those facts if

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.850 
focus is justified if those facts if

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
those things are in fact true however

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.310 
those things are in fact true however
when<00:03:05.250> a<00:03:05.280> product<00:03:05.640> is<00:03:05.730> shipped<00:03:05.930> before<00:03:06.930> it's

when a product is shipped before it's

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.710 
when a product is shipped before it's
finished<00:03:07.560> that<00:03:08.490> also<00:03:08.670> means<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.210> areas<00:03:09.600> of

the game that received the least
attention<00:03:11.160> during<00:03:11.610> development<00:03:11.880> are<00:03:12.210> going

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
attention during development are going

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.600 
attention during development are going
to<00:03:12.420> suffer<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:12.930> if<00:03:13.710> they<00:03:13.860> are<00:03:14.010> focusing<00:03:14.490> on

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
to suffer and if they are focusing on

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.100 
to suffer and if they are focusing on
the<00:03:14.880> console<00:03:15.210> market<00:03:15.390> more<00:03:15.690> that<00:03:15.840> means<00:03:16.020> the

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
the console market more that means the

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.390 
the console market more that means the
PC<00:03:16.410> version<00:03:16.440> of<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:16.920> game<00:03:16.980> is<00:03:17.190> going<00:03:17.340> to

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
PC version of the game is going to

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.770 
PC version of the game is going to
suffer<00:03:17.610> so<00:03:18.390> this<00:03:19.140> is<00:03:19.350> why<00:03:19.709> i<00:03:19.739> think<00:03:19.950> that

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
suffer so this is why i think that

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.850 
suffer so this is why i think that
warner<00:03:21.780> brothers<00:03:21.900> are<00:03:22.200> Rocksteady<00:03:22.709> or

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
warner brothers are Rocksteady or

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.640 
warner brothers are Rocksteady or
whoever<00:03:23.310> it<00:03:23.580> was<00:03:23.730> gave<00:03:24.480> this<00:03:24.780> iron<00:03:25.380> galaxy

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
whoever it was gave this iron galaxy

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.250 
whoever it was gave this iron galaxy
studio<00:03:26.250> of<00:03:26.700> 12<00:03:27.150> people<00:03:27.360> eight<00:03:27.720> weeks<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:28.050> put

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
studio of 12 people eight weeks to put

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.800 
studio of 12 people eight weeks to put
the<00:03:28.350> game<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.530> pc<00:03:28.950> because<00:03:29.640> they'd<00:03:30.239> overrun

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
the game to pc because they'd overrun

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.500 
the game to pc because they'd overrun
their<00:03:31.320> budget<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:31.800> their<00:03:32.160> deadline<00:03:32.550> by<00:03:33.090> a<00:03:33.120> lot

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
their budget and their deadline by a lot

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.180 
their budget and their deadline by a lot
right<00:03:33.959> i<00:03:33.989> mean<00:03:34.110> we<00:03:34.320> all<00:03:34.440> know<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.860> game<00:03:35.010> was

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
right i mean we all know the game was

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.530 
right i mean we all know the game was
pushed<00:03:35.430> back<00:03:35.580> i<00:03:35.640> think<00:03:35.820> it<00:03:36.030> was<00:03:36.090> eight<00:03:36.300> months

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
pushed back i think it was eight months

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.660 
pushed back i think it was eight months
so<00:03:37.410> it's<00:03:37.530> clear<00:03:37.770> that<00:03:37.800> they<00:03:38.070> weren't<00:03:38.280> meeting

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
so it's clear that they weren't meeting

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.370 
so it's clear that they weren't meeting
their<00:03:39.030> deadlines<00:03:39.420> in<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.690> first<00:03:39.870> place<00:03:40.080> right

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
their deadlines in the first place right

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.900 
their deadlines in the first place right
and<00:03:40.650> so<00:03:40.830> eventually<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.430> publisher<00:03:41.760> just

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
and so eventually the publisher just

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.130 
and so eventually the publisher just
gets<00:03:42.090> look<00:03:42.270> I'm<00:03:42.420> not<00:03:42.510> going<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.720> keep<00:03:42.870> paying

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
gets look I'm not going to keep paying

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.530 
gets look I'm not going to keep paying
you<00:03:43.350> money<00:03:43.500> give<00:03:44.430> me<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:44.880> product<00:03:45.209> I<00:03:45.390> am

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
you money give me the product I am

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.240 
you money give me the product I am
paying<00:03:45.750> you<00:03:45.870> for<00:03:46.140> just<00:03:46.530> give<00:03:46.739> it<00:03:46.860> to<00:03:46.980> me<00:03:47.010> I

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
paying you for just give it to me I

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.500 
paying you for just give it to me I
don't<00:03:47.489> care<00:03:47.550> what<00:03:47.760> it's<00:03:47.940> like<00:03:48.060> i'll<00:03:48.209> try<00:03:48.420> and

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
don't care what it's like i'll try and

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.690 
don't care what it's like i'll try and
recoup<00:03:48.750> some<00:03:48.810> costs<00:03:49.410> and<00:03:49.709> that's<00:03:50.459> just<00:03:50.580> the

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
recoup some costs and that's just the

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.130 
recoup some costs and that's just the
unfortunate<00:03:51.239> nature<00:03:51.510> of<00:03:51.600> business<00:03:51.989> and

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
unfortunate nature of business and

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.860 
unfortunate nature of business and
because<00:03:52.500> you<00:03:53.160> know<00:03:53.310> piracy<00:03:54.060> does<00:03:54.209> have<00:03:54.450> a<00:03:54.480> role

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
because you know piracy does have a role

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.630 
because you know piracy does have a role
okay<00:03:55.350> i<00:03:55.380> mean<00:03:55.560> it<00:03:55.650> does<00:03:55.860> we<00:03:56.160> can't<00:03:56.340> deny<00:03:56.610> that

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
okay i mean it does we can't deny that

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.820 
okay i mean it does we can't deny that
it<00:03:57.060> does<00:03:57.270> take<00:03:57.600> away<00:03:57.900> some<00:03:58.350> of<00:03:58.380> the<00:03:58.470> potential

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
it does take away some of the potential

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.430 
it does take away some of the potential
profits<00:03:59.370> I<00:03:59.550> don't<00:04:00.090> think<00:04:00.120> is<00:04:00.360> this<00:04:00.480> extreme<00:04:01.140> as

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
profits I don't think is this extreme as

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.500 
profits I don't think is this extreme as
publishers<00:04:02.160> maybe<00:04:02.340> think<00:04:02.610> that<00:04:02.790> it<00:04:02.910> is<00:04:02.940> but

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
publishers maybe think that it is but

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.449 
publishers maybe think that it is but
you<00:04:03.720> know<00:04:04.140> it<00:04:04.320> does<00:04:04.500> hurt<00:04:04.709> profits<00:04:05.130> to<00:04:05.280> some

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
you know it does hurt profits to some

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.010 
you know it does hurt profits to some
degree<00:04:05.610> especially<00:04:05.940> in<00:04:06.270> single-player<00:04:06.660> games

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
degree especially in single-player games

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.710 
degree especially in single-player games
right<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:07.830> the<00:04:07.950> market<00:04:08.280> isn't<00:04:08.910> as<00:04:09.300> big<00:04:09.570> I

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
right and the market isn't as big I

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.380 
right and the market isn't as big I
guess<00:04:09.750> for<00:04:10.739> these<00:04:10.890> types<00:04:11.160> of<00:04:11.340> games<00:04:11.400> but

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
guess for these types of games but

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.540 
guess for these types of games but
honestly<00:04:13.170> I<00:04:13.290> think<00:04:13.440> really<00:04:13.890> the<00:04:14.100> core<00:04:14.340> issue

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
honestly I think really the core issue

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.479 
honestly I think really the core issue
here<00:04:14.940> is<00:04:15.060> that<00:04:15.769> expectations<00:04:16.769> from<00:04:17.250> both

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
here is that expectations from both

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.789 
here is that expectations from both
gamers<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.060> publishers<00:04:18.600> and<00:04:18.810> studios<00:04:19.440> and

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
gamers and publishers and studios and

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.039 
gamers and publishers and studios and
what<00:04:20.459> game<00:04:20.700> should<00:04:20.940> be<00:04:21.000> these<00:04:21.480> days<00:04:21.510> you<00:04:21.960> know

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
what game should be these days you know

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.930 
what game should be these days you know

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.760 
leads to broken and unfinished games
being<00:04:39.419> released<00:04:39.509> consistently<00:04:40.410> and<00:04:40.590> we<00:04:40.650> keep

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
being released consistently and we keep

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.320 
being released consistently and we keep
seeing<00:04:41.039> that<00:04:41.130> now<00:04:41.190> even<00:04:41.460> on<00:04:41.669> consoles<00:04:42.120> games

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
seeing that now even on consoles games

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.430 
seeing that now even on consoles games
are<00:04:42.479> coming<00:04:42.539> out<00:04:42.780> that<00:04:42.930> don't<00:04:43.080> work<00:04:43.259> and

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
are coming out that don't work and

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.070 
are coming out that don't work and
that's<00:04:43.889> uncommon<00:04:44.370> so<00:04:44.849> I<00:04:44.880> think<00:04:45.180> overall<00:04:45.750> it's

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
that's uncommon so I think overall it's

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.650 
that's uncommon so I think overall it's
an<00:04:46.199> issue<00:04:46.380> with<00:04:46.650> the<00:04:46.740> industry<00:04:47.250> as<00:04:47.340> a<00:04:47.370> whole

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
an issue with the industry as a whole

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.749 
an issue with the industry as a whole
more<00:04:48.660> than<00:04:48.900> it<00:04:49.050> is<00:04:49.199> well<00:04:49.470> pc<00:04:49.830> game<00:04:50.009> do<00:04:50.520> this

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 
more than it is well pc game do this

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:52.969 
more than it is well pc game do this
piracy<00:04:51.090> or<00:04:51.449> the<00:04:52.050> pc<00:04:52.289> games<00:04:52.530> just<00:04:52.710> don't<00:04:52.860> make

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
piracy or the pc games just don't make

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:54.080 
piracy or the pc games just don't make
enough<00:04:53.190> money<00:04:53.340> i<00:04:53.460> don't<00:04:53.580> think<00:04:53.849> that's<00:04:53.940> the

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
enough money i don't think that's the

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.760 
enough money i don't think that's the
issue<00:04:54.210> i<00:04:54.539> think<00:04:55.020> i<00:04:55.110> think<00:04:55.199> it's<00:04:55.470> a<00:04:55.530> bigger

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
issue i think i think it's a bigger

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.260 
issue i think i think it's a bigger
issue<00:04:55.860> to<00:04:56.250> do<00:04:56.340> with<00:04:56.460> the<00:04:56.550> triple-a<00:04:56.880> industry

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
issue to do with the triple-a industry

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.990 
issue to do with the triple-a industry
as<00:04:57.419> a<00:04:57.479> whole<00:04:57.930> and<00:04:58.470> how<00:04:58.949> it's<00:04:59.099> not<00:04:59.250> really<00:04:59.310> very

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
as a whole and how it's not really very

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.029 
as a whole and how it's not really very
sustainable<00:05:00.599> at<00:05:00.960> this<00:05:01.110> point<00:05:01.349> you<00:05:01.500> know<00:05:01.530> we're

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
sustainable at this point you know we're

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:03.170 
sustainable at this point you know we're
looking<00:05:02.280> at<00:05:02.400> budgets<00:05:02.789> for<00:05:02.910> things<00:05:03.090> like

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
looking at budgets for things like

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.300 
looking at budgets for things like
destiny<00:05:03.750> at<00:05:03.900> five<00:05:04.289> hundred<00:05:04.680> million<00:05:05.130> dollars

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
destiny at five hundred million dollars

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.300 
destiny at five hundred million dollars
okay<00:05:06.120> that's<00:05:06.330> an<00:05:06.449> extremely<00:05:07.199> large<00:05:07.740> budget

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
okay that's an extremely large budget

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.129 
okay that's an extremely large budget
and<00:05:08.460> it's<00:05:09.000> not<00:05:09.120> reasonable<00:05:09.330> and<00:05:09.810> if

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
and it's not reasonable and if

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.110 
and it's not reasonable and if
expectations<00:05:10.500> keep<00:05:11.099> going<00:05:11.430> up<00:05:11.550> and<00:05:11.699> up<00:05:11.789> with

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
expectations keep going up and up with

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.450 
expectations keep going up and up with
every<00:05:12.360> console<00:05:12.720> generation<00:05:13.349> then<00:05:14.039> inevitably

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
every console generation then inevitably

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.400 
every console generation then inevitably
I<00:05:14.789> think<00:05:15.090> the<00:05:15.180> triple-a<00:05:15.539> industry<00:05:15.960> is<00:05:16.050> kind<00:05:16.320> of

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
I think the triple-a industry is kind of

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.719 
I think the triple-a industry is kind of
in<00:05:16.500> trouble<00:05:16.889> and<00:05:17.009> I<00:05:17.160> don't<00:05:17.370> think<00:05:17.580> they<00:05:17.669> can

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:17.729 
in trouble and I don't think they can

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:20.540 
in trouble and I don't think they can
remotely<00:05:18.360> meet<00:05:19.139> expectations<00:05:19.560> I<00:05:20.099> mean<00:05:20.250> the

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
remotely meet expectations I mean the

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.040 
remotely meet expectations I mean the
number<00:05:20.669> of<00:05:20.909> people<00:05:21.090> these<00:05:21.330> days<00:05:21.389> saying<00:05:21.870> oh

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
number of people these days saying oh

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.350 
number of people these days saying oh
well<00:05:22.229> you<00:05:22.770> know<00:05:22.800> this<00:05:23.460> console<00:05:23.849> game<00:05:24.000> isn't

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
well you know this console game isn't

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.059 
well you know this console game isn't
doesn't<00:05:24.479> feel<00:05:24.810> next-gen<00:05:25.409> it's<00:05:25.590> because<00:05:25.830> like

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:26.069 
doesn't feel next-gen it's because like

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:27.890 
doesn't feel next-gen it's because like
we<00:05:26.250> can't<00:05:26.520> they<00:05:26.759> can't<00:05:26.970> do<00:05:27.300> anything<00:05:27.330> more

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
we can't they can't do anything more

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.230 
we can't they can't do anything more
right<00:05:28.349> without<00:05:29.069> it<00:05:29.280> there's<00:05:29.880> a<00:05:29.940> thing<00:05:30.210> called

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
right without it there's a thing called

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.749 
right without it there's a thing called
diminishing<00:05:30.930> returns<00:05:31.320> right<00:05:31.650> and<00:05:31.919> we've

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 
diminishing returns right and we've

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:34.760 
diminishing returns right and we've
seriously<00:05:33.360> hit<00:05:33.630> that<00:05:33.780> wall<00:05:33.990> now<00:05:34.199> in<00:05:34.409> triple-a

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
seriously hit that wall now in triple-a

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.350 
seriously hit that wall now in triple-a
development<00:05:35.250> and<00:05:35.370> I<00:05:35.550> think<00:05:35.940> it's<00:05:36.060> just<00:05:36.120> a

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
development and I think it's just a

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.050 
development and I think it's just a
matter<00:05:36.479> of<00:05:36.599> overblown<00:05:37.139> budgets<00:05:37.800> and

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
matter of overblown budgets and

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.640 
matter of overblown budgets and
mismanagement<00:05:39.060> and<00:05:39.360> because<00:05:39.900> pc<00:05:40.289> isn't<00:05:40.560> the

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
mismanagement and because pc isn't the

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.379 
mismanagement and because pc isn't the
focus<00:05:41.099> because<00:05:41.460> it<00:05:41.550> doesn't<00:05:41.820> make<00:05:41.970> quite<00:05:42.240> as

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
focus because it doesn't make quite as

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:44.270 
focus because it doesn't make quite as
much<00:05:42.570> money<00:05:42.870> you<00:05:43.469> know<00:05:43.560> it's<00:05:43.740> the<00:05:43.860> first<00:05:44.099> thing

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
much money you know it's the first thing

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.950 
much money you know it's the first thing
to<00:05:44.400> go<00:05:44.430> when<00:05:44.909> it<00:05:45.000> comes<00:05:45.210> to<00:05:45.389> you<00:05:45.570> know<00:05:45.599> things

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
to go when it comes to you know things

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.100 
to go when it comes to you know things
breaking<00:05:46.289> essentially<00:05:47.280> so<00:05:47.990> hopefully<00:05:48.990> in

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
breaking essentially so hopefully in

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.959 
breaking essentially so hopefully in
future<00:05:49.289> developers<00:05:50.009> can<00:05:50.190> maybe<00:05:50.310> lower<00:05:50.669> their

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:50.969 
future developers can maybe lower their

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:53.390 
future developers can maybe lower their
you<00:05:51.659> no<00:05:51.750> scope<00:05:52.320> for<00:05:52.590> these<00:05:52.949> these

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
you no scope for these these

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.430 
you no scope for these these
ridiculously<00:05:54.090> massive<00:05:54.599> triple-a<00:05:54.960> games<00:05:55.199> and

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
ridiculously massive triple-a games and

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.899 
ridiculously massive triple-a games and
maybe<00:05:55.590> bring<00:05:56.009> out<00:05:56.219> games<00:05:56.430> that<00:05:56.610> work<00:05:56.729> and

00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:56.909 
maybe bring out games that work and

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:58.430 
maybe bring out games that work and
thankfully<00:05:57.330> we<00:05:57.419> do<00:05:57.539> have<00:05:57.690> a<00:05:57.719> refund<00:05:58.139> system

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
thankfully we do have a refund system

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.200 
thankfully we do have a refund system
now<00:05:58.590> so<00:05:58.830> we<00:05:59.280> can<00:05:59.310> actually<00:05:59.940> say<00:06:00.180> something

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
now so we can actually say something

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.420 
now so we can actually say something
back<00:06:00.870> when<00:06:01.169> they<00:06:01.320> do<00:06:01.380> try<00:06:01.770> and<00:06:01.800> sell<00:06:02.099> as<00:06:02.250> these

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
back when they do try and sell as these

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.820 
back when they do try and sell as these
broken<00:06:02.699> games<00:06:03.060> but<00:06:03.810> I<00:06:03.990> think<00:06:04.440> it's<00:06:04.560> a<00:06:04.650> lot<00:06:04.800> more

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
broken games but I think it's a lot more

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.140 
broken games but I think it's a lot more
complicated<00:06:05.280> than<00:06:05.550> people<00:06:05.669> give<00:06:06.000> it<00:06:06.060> credit

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
complicated than people give it credit

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.560 
complicated than people give it credit
for<00:06:06.449> I<00:06:06.810> think<00:06:07.020> it's<00:06:07.469> an<00:06:07.650> issue<00:06:07.800> that<00:06:08.190> is<00:06:08.639> mostly

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
for I think it's an issue that is mostly

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:10.879 
for I think it's an issue that is mostly
centered<00:06:09.990> around<00:06:10.080> budgets<00:06:10.680> and

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:10.889 
centered around budgets and

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:13.240 
centered around budgets and
mismanagement<00:06:11.880> of<00:06:12.090> projects<00:06:12.599> and

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
mismanagement of projects and
