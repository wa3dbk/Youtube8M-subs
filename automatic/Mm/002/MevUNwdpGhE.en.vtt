00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.560
 the reality 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:14.970
 and the afternoons as if they were from here 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:18.030
 speculate that anticipate the pixar much 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.960
 before publishing and then they have returned 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.960
 viral in social networks 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.300
 I never expected 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.520
 Well, notice that he has always 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.330
 called as that attention in everything 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.260
 visual 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.260
 with stockings 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.290
 and I show my state 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.290
 from my cellphone 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.720
 and had the the 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.640
 how do you say the function of folding 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.640
 then fold as you speak 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.839
 then I was at my house and I tried like 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.220
 to be recorded as to simulate the voice of 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:08.820
 here a lot to click and face 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.050
 then leave it and a measure of 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.910
 that because I always made videos 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.420
 people on trips but always to my 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.240
 friends one called chela corvera from 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.740
 that go up 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.659
 overcoming 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.120
 for the same insecurity that going to 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.090
 say people never climbed it 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:31.190
 and so I uploaded the response from the people 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.190
 it was very good can complain about anything 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:40.620
 more tributes the sultan 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.620
 and this is the first chapter 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.670
 but let's go 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.670
 as the chosen one 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.040
 I had already made the 22 chapters videos 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.190
 previous 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.160
 being the interview of this magazine 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.550
 it is reported where it came out showing the 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.550
 60 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.570
 says another one of a conversation as of 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.390
 Gemini and so it was too viral that 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.090
 facebook pages 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.790
 we did the servers they shared 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.959
 and many more 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.510
 then from there it was like we have 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.220
 to get something bad 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.500
 and then like I said I'm going to grab a 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.390
 chapter I will do as a chapter of 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.300
 those that have already imported the chapter of 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.700
 the fight for a chapter 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.610
 and believe in the story after which 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.470
 the 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.470
 and above has one of the gypsies key 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.129
 and it was more or less like that I'm going to talk 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.989
 of the things that are being lived 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:41.000
 now in culiacán I never thought that 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.150
 this was going to leave my ranch 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.650
 culiacán 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.150
 lagarde current things that are happening 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.010
 4 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.260
 so you are inspired by what 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:57.420
 is going through the carrer 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.420
 encouraged be real of the types 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.830
 up our 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.690
 for sanz and mati goes 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.670
 only when I do not know if it was totally 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.720
 spontaneous afterwards they always ask me 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.720
 that where greeting for doing 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:17.040
 up do it 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:19.379
 the heart and yes with an anecdote 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.299
 real and the social truth that gave us 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:23.129
 a lot of laughter to me giving me andalusia 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:28.430
 which is that we turned to christen the 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:30.530
 mom with the other one another friend 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.150
 of the videos 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.129
 this anecdote because because in a 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.750
 at the party years we do not see we were with 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:39.750
 family members of relatives 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.569
 if we 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:49.500
 a lady if she is super tough 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:55.599
 and the female goes and the one that came with him 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:58.000
 we looked for us and I knew then 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.240
 with the guests intersection up 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.650
 us 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.780
 that is, the guests imagine 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.500
 and the light and we're hiding in the 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:10.170
 Jumper dies of laughter that always 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.629
 it stayed with us, then , that for 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.569
 for all of us we finish this sentence but 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:17.370
 it seems like it happened to us and recording 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.970
 the videos as well as it came out of nowhere 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.299
 and we did it and that's where the 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.299
 sentence 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.800
 the woods have explained
