00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.330
 what waves 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.340
 today who is in their meals because 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.530
 Many people have told me how it does 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.440
 the rates and because we were the remaining 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:32.140
 and all that then I want to teach them 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.390
 how do I do them are super mega 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.110
 easy sets eat fast are 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.540
 healthy and they are well rich then 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.790
 if you like, keep watching the video and if 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.470
 they want more I have a good recipe you 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.870
 can you smile and I ran out of battery 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.090
 but the first recipe to do is in 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.870
 your oat rankings what you need 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:56.019
 it's a banana two eggs and a third of 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.949
 cup of oatmeal I'm going to mix them all and 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:58.949
 I will liquefy them 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.240
 I did not want to use the egg yolks 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.610
 because I'm trying to lose weight 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.210
 then I am separating the yolks from 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.100
 the whites and that's how I do it 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.560
 If you have never tried coconut oil 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.990
 you have to do it is more healthy with 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.450
 which you can cook and is delicious 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.780
 since I have the mixture I'm going to put it in 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.450
 the hot pan and let it cook 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.670
 until I already like the consistency 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.430
 I'm going to put the pipes because I 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.530
 Like how you know and I'll turn it to me 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.020
 I like golden brown almost 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.659
 damn but you can leave more 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.369
 white as you like and I put them here 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.880
 I put berries and strawberries and then I 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:51.869
 I'm going to put a little bit of natural honey 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:54.649
 100% tastes super delicious and that's how 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.649
 I present 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.280
 for this breakfast you will need 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:07.430
 egg peppers I will also separate 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.430
 the whites of the yolks and spinach 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.129
 you put everything in the pan and that's how 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.350
 is if you like salty in the 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.720
 breakfast 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.720
 this is one of my favorite foods what 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.440
 what you need to make it is sweet potato 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:38.200
 turkey breast and spinach also 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.720
 I put peppers I'm going to put everything in 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.490
 the pan with garlic because I love the 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.280
 flavor that he gives and I'm going to cook 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.280
 Sweet potato I turn it since it is well golden 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.200
 and I put a cover so it's 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.270
 very juicy when I'm going to serve 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.670
 like the peppers in the other pan 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:58.300
 together with the asparagus and afterwards 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.720
 the heroes super mega easy and very rich 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.720
 really 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.180
 yes 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.099
 ah 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.709
 that's how I serve it the juice that left 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:19.019
 I'm going to put the breast in the end 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.799
 I added nothing and is ready to 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.799
 eat up 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.790
 for this recipe you will start stinging 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.610
 the peppers in strips are juliana 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.470
 whatever you want to call it and then I'll go 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.620
 to put in the pan here I am doing 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.930
 the salad I'm going to put the lemon 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.030
 because I do not put any other dressing and 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:50.739
 then I put pieces of mangoes 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:53.709
 cranberry cherries and you can put it what 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:56.610
 that is so much that really and then the 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.610
 I will serve well 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.870
 if you want a much fresher meal 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.350
 that the previous one I recommend this 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.060
 salad with chicken is a salad almost 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.130
 same as we did before 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.820
 but instead of turkey we are going to put 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:25.810
 Chicken pieces up and it's much more 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.810
 light and also tastes equally rich 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.480
 Do not forget to send them two years 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.840

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:43.710
 to make this movie of berries and mango me 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.570
 I do it with frozen berries strawberries and 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.180
 mango pieces I put everything in the 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:52.620
 blender with milk and lycos 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.600
 super good and really is great 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.790
 when you're dying of heat or 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.240
 just when you want something sweet in 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.240
