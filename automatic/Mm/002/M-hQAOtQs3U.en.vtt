 example the version for pc running at 1080p 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.420
 and with the charts in the ceni and showed 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.179
 also the versions of xbox the year and the 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.180
 xbox 360 which is the latest off 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.159
 seriously for the very 370 version 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.599
 I enjoyed the graphics there is clear 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:17.400
 which does not compare with other two 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.040
 platforms but it seems that the game it 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.109
 wheel and right wheel peaceful and bad 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.930
 news now for those who like to buy 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:26.939
 digital games in 360 and is in order to 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.280
 picking up the concrete is missing its own and hey 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:32.250
 announced that the game will not be sold 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.859
 digitally because according to them it 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.810
 does not represent the experience of the game 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:38.609
 represents the experience of the game a 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.230
 digital version I did not understand that 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:42.000
 It happens because that has a spin 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.280
 installation if the digital version could 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.530
 disclosed understands but was the 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.200
 that he says not then the version for 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.870
 playstation 4 of the game the last breakthrough 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.730
 won a trailer kaka is almost almost a 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.349
 teaser and not three women shows one 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.090
 little of the graphics there 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:00.389
 and speaking in graphics the game will rotate 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.250
 in 1080p and also 60 frames per second 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:03.810
 second and it is not enough because it goes 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.909
 improve not guy's own personality 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.810
 commented that the sound is also very 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.159
 best 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.200
 we'll have a sound illustration 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.719
 well-suited not for the use of 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.489
 step for use of sheets and such is more 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:16.590
 and more dialogues. 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.109
 complete with more options we do not 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.699
 saw in the version of playstation 3 and 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.500
 mary dota's own manager and guy 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:24.269
 said that the version for playstation 3 already 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.579
 it was so absurd that it was so absurd 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.799
 great are the graphics that the 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.540
 changes should not be so radical 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.069
 the Playstation 4 version as well as the staff 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.349
 Wait, I'm waiting for a chart. 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.090
 what a mockery of destruction compared to 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.220
 Playstation 3 version if calm down 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.260
 because the game was very beautiful it's almost the 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:44.310
 double of pec 4 not of the new generation of 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.870
 gta tire online is an expensive total success 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.030
 rockstar commented that they are 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.060
 very happy there with the performance of the 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.340
 version is coming along with gta5 second 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.849
 they 70 percent of the people who play 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.319
 gta5 also plays online gta looks only 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.120
 how nice they commented that they 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.849
 finally are realizing a dream there 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.129
 to continue profiting from the same games 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.439
 after launch before 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.609
 to launch a game of i sold well he 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:09.449
 then I had to start the next 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.400
 project 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:12.750
 now with micro transactions with a 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.579
 them requires a lot of things to 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.440
 happen are for free in most 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.940
 I came with the micro transactions they 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.700
 They can keep making money there. 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.680
 gta online is a big present not only to 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.910
 him but also for the players going 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.620
 keep investing 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.270
 the game, for example, in a little while 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.340
 people will receive a capture scheme 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.050
 and proceed to the verification of matches 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.570
 own ct online plus much more 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.570
 It should be news then the game then 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.790
 leÃ³n and that's it people let's go now 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.830
 for our reading of comments I will 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.410
 read here the best comment of the edition 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.530
 past checkpoint who sent it was 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.810
 alan nunes he said the following is 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.210
 It is unfortunate to see a 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.580
 since many of these 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.920
 producers began their lives of 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.870
 games playing on a console of this 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.210
 company is talking about the issue that 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.400
 detonated the last nintendo check 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.110
 continent commented that the staff of dap 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.480
 although here and spoke badly 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.850
 it is fundamental to respect the opinion of 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.040
 each one but we can not miss with 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.860
 respect to a company which started the 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.900
 game life of many people without saying 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.420
 that without competition that prevents us from being 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:22.590
 new games there she muniz really expensive 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:24.360

 I wrote the story of the 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.440
 nintendo that was here at bjc then 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.720
 There's no denying denying the Nintendo 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.980
 childhood of many people is the heart of 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.840
 so I can not 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:37.200
