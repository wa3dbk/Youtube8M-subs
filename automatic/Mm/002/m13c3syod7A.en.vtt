Airport it's a little shorter only about
65<00:00:31.949> miles<00:00:32.430> but<00:00:32.759> still<00:00:33.090> just<00:00:33.329> about<00:00:33.600> two<00:00:33.870> hours

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
65 miles but still just about two hours

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.430 
65 miles but still just about two hours
now<00:00:35.610> when<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.880> look<00:00:36.000> at<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.270> distance<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.870> 65

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
now when you look at the distance of 65

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.280 
now when you look at the distance of 65
miles<00:00:37.710> or<00:00:38.129> 80<00:00:38.670> 85<00:00:39.239> miles<00:00:39.570> if<00:00:39.840> you're<00:00:39.989> up<00:00:40.140> by

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
miles or 80 85 miles if you're up by

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.290 
miles or 80 85 miles if you're up by
waikoloa<00:00:40.950> village<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.640> probably<00:00:41.940> think<00:00:42.180> well

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
waikoloa village you probably think well

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.779 
waikoloa village you probably think well
I<00:00:42.329> could<00:00:42.510> do<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.750> in<00:00:43.020> an<00:00:43.500> hour<00:00:43.680> but<00:00:44.070> once<00:00:44.340> you

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
I could do that in an hour but once you

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.639 
I could do that in an hour but once you
get<00:00:44.910> into<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.270> town<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.719> Kona<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.320> then

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
get into the town of Kona and then

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.440 
get into the town of Kona and then
through<00:00:47.070> some<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.520> other<00:00:47.670> smaller<00:00:48.090> towns

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
through some of the other smaller towns

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.150 
through some of the other smaller towns
certainly<00:00:49.020> gets<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.350> little<00:00:49.559> bit<00:00:49.770> slower

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
certainly gets a little bit slower

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.020 
certainly gets a little bit slower
especially<00:00:50.399> if<00:00:51.000> there's<00:00:51.180> traffic<00:00:52.850> the<00:00:53.850> main

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
especially if there's traffic the main

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.139 
especially if there's traffic the main
highway<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.809> Queen<00:00:55.050> Kay<00:00:55.379> or<00:00:55.770> highway<00:00:56.550> 11

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
highway is the Queen Kay or highway 11

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
why that is you notice that that second

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.920 
why that is you notice that that second

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
green circle on the right green sand

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.920 
green circle on the right green sand
beach<00:02:13.050> is<00:02:13.379> actually

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
beach is actually

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.080 
beach is actually
west<00:02:14.620> of<00:02:14.829> there<00:02:15.099> that's<00:02:15.430> going<00:02:15.579> to<00:02:15.640> be<00:02:15.760> on<00:02:15.939> the

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
west of there that's going to be on the

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.809 
west of there that's going to be on the
rights<00:02:16.450> if<00:02:16.750> you're<00:02:16.930> looking<00:02:17.230> at<00:02:17.379> that<00:02:17.819> that

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
rights if you're looking at that that

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.729 
rights if you're looking at that that
circle<00:02:19.329> and<00:02:19.450> so<00:02:19.659> especially<00:02:20.290> if<00:02:20.560> we're<00:02:20.650> going

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
circle and so especially if we're going

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.789 
circle and so especially if we're going
to<00:02:20.829> be<00:02:20.950> walking<00:02:21.780> even<00:02:22.780> from<00:02:23.140> that<00:02:23.170> second

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
to be walking even from that second

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:24.899 
to be walking even from that second
circle<00:02:24.129> on<00:02:24.189> the<00:02:24.280> right<00:02:24.430> it's<00:02:24.609> still<00:02:24.730> going<00:02:24.879> to

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
circle on the right it's still going to

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:28.530 
circle on the right it's still going to
be<00:02:25.000> about<00:02:25.239> a<00:02:25.269> two<00:02:25.659> and<00:02:26.109> a<00:02:26.230> half<00:02:26.439> mile<00:02:26.799> hike<00:02:27.540> so

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
be about a two and a half mile hike so

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.410 
be about a two and a half mile hike so
it's<00:02:29.230> better<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:29.620> park<00:02:30.069> over<00:02:30.370> there<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:31.180> what

which is outlined in the top right hand

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.030 
which is outlined in the top right hand
corner<00:03:14.760> that's<00:03:15.760> where<00:03:16.060> green<00:03:16.299> sand<00:03:16.599> beaches

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
half mile hike each way so let's just

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.089 
half mile hike each way so let's just
call<00:03:22.389> it<00:03:22.419> round<00:03:22.720> trip<00:03:23.079> approximately<00:03:23.829> five

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
call it round trip approximately five

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.629 
call it round trip approximately five
miles<00:03:24.569> it<00:03:25.569> could<00:03:25.870> be<00:03:25.989> hot<00:03:26.229> it<00:03:26.919> could<00:03:27.069> be<00:03:27.220> windy

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
miles it could be hot it could be windy

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.699 
miles it could be hot it could be windy
it's<00:03:28.449> going<00:03:28.599> to<00:03:28.659> be<00:03:28.780> dusty<00:03:29.229> you<00:03:29.349> want<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.590> make

it's going to be dusty you want to make

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.000 
it's going to be dusty you want to make
sure<00:03:29.889> you<00:03:30.040> have<00:03:30.220> good<00:03:30.430> hiking<00:03:31.120> shoes<00:03:31.569> and

essentially you're walking along the
ocean<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.829> oceans<00:03:36.159> are<00:03:36.280> always<00:03:36.459> going<00:03:36.549> to<00:03:36.609> be

ocean the oceans are always going to be
on<00:03:36.909> the<00:03:37.000> right<00:03:37.209> so<00:03:37.599> it's<00:03:38.019> not<00:03:38.139> like<00:03:38.319> you're

going to get lost amongst these rutted

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.659 
going to get lost amongst these rutted
Jeep<00:03:42.220> trails<00:03:42.549> and<00:03:43.379> the<00:03:44.379> Jeep<00:03:44.560> trails<00:03:44.859> can<00:03:45.519> be

Jeep trails and the Jeep trails can be

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:48.390

sort of deep at times a little bit
jagged<00:03:48.729> so<00:03:49.120> you<00:03:49.180> got<00:03:49.359> to<00:03:49.449> watch<00:03:49.599> the<00:03:49.840> footing

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.280 
jagged so you got to watch the footing
but<00:03:51.280> the<00:03:51.370> idea<00:03:51.639> is<00:03:51.699> to<00:03:51.879> walk<00:03:52.180> along<00:03:52.599> that<00:03:52.629> path

but the idea is to walk along that path
all<00:03:53.650> the<00:03:53.709> way<00:03:54.250> until<00:03:54.879> you<00:03:54.939> get<00:03:55.329> to<00:03:55.659> the<00:03:56.620> green
