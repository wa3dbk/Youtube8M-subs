with<00:00:20.279> your<00:00:20.310> DVD<00:00:21.199> if<00:00:22.199> we<00:00:22.289> look<00:00:22.439> at<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.590> original

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
with your DVD if we look at the original

with your DVD if we look at the original
played<00:00:23.220> shot<00:00:23.490> here<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:23.910> hvx<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:25.250> we're

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
played shot here it is hvx and we're

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.450 
played shot here it is hvx and we're
gonna<00:00:26.400> play<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.760> through<00:00:27.000> pretty<00:00:27.900> simple

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
gonna play it through pretty simple

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.279 
gonna play it through pretty simple
and<00:00:29.460> then<00:00:29.820> we<00:00:29.970> see<00:00:30.179> ground<00:00:30.480> reflection<00:00:30.869> paths

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
and then we see ground reflection paths

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.229 
and then we see ground reflection paths
that<00:00:31.529> we<00:00:31.650> rendered<00:00:32.009> here's<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.790> guardrail

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
that we rendered here's the guardrail

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.139 
that we rendered here's the guardrail
right<00:00:33.660> here

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
right here

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.940 
right here
there's<00:00:36.149> multiply<00:00:36.870> ground<00:00:37.290> occlusion<00:00:37.770> pass

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
there's multiply ground occlusion pass

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.160 
there's multiply ground occlusion pass
this<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.579> course<00:00:38.910> Alfred<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:39.660> it's<00:00:39.960> just<00:00:40.079> gonna

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
this is course Alfred so it's just gonna

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.729 
this is course Alfred so it's just gonna
go<00:00:40.350> straight<00:00:40.530> through<00:00:42.050> then<00:00:43.050> we<00:00:43.170> got<00:00:43.320> water

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
go straight through then we got water

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.889 
go straight through then we got water

nice shadow from that occluding piece of
geometry<00:01:00.840> we<00:01:01.379> added<00:01:02.000> and<00:01:03.000> we<00:01:03.449> haven't<00:01:03.629> really

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
geometry we added and we haven't really

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.600 
geometry we added and we haven't really
color<00:01:04.019> corrected<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.619> yet<00:01:04.769> but<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.369> know<00:01:05.460> it's

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
color corrected it yet but you know it's

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.179 
color corrected it yet but you know it's
it's<00:01:06.000> good<00:01:06.450> for<00:01:06.630> now<00:01:06.720> not<00:01:07.290> bad<00:01:07.530> for<00:01:07.740> just<00:01:07.770> one

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189

here<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> truck<00:01:13.320> occlusion<00:01:13.830> pass<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.659> the

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
here a truck occlusion pass and the

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.210 
here a truck occlusion pass and the
tires<00:01:15.900> are<00:01:16.170> getting<00:01:16.259> eaten<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.799> there<00:01:17.009> and

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
tires are getting eaten in there and

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.550 
tires are getting eaten in there and
which<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.430> really<00:01:17.670> awesome<00:01:18.080> and<00:01:19.080> then<00:01:19.320> we<00:01:19.409> got

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
which is really awesome and then we got

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.070 
which is really awesome and then we got
our<00:01:19.970> spec<00:01:20.970> kick<00:01:21.330> which<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.689> showed<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:21.960> guys

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
our spec kick which I showed you guys

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.749 
our spec kick which I showed you guys
how<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.320> do<00:01:22.500> earlier<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.840> a<00:01:24.840> reflective<00:01:25.409> kick

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
how to do earlier and a reflective kick

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.880 
how to do earlier and a reflective kick
and<00:01:27.049> our<00:01:28.049> truck<00:01:28.320> dirt<00:01:28.560> paths

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.340 

here's<00:01:32.280> our<00:01:32.429> velocity<00:01:32.969> render<00:01:33.299> as<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.259> can

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
here's our velocity render as you can

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.080 
here's our velocity render as you can
see<00:01:34.530> as<00:01:34.710> we<00:01:34.890> start<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.310> not<00:01:35.490> really<00:01:35.759> constant

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
see as we start to not really constant

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.580 
see as we start to not really constant
you<00:01:36.299> know<00:01:36.359> there's<00:01:36.539> not<00:01:36.630> two<00:01:36.780> motion<00:01:37.200> going<00:01:37.380> on

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
you know there's not two motion going on

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.709 
you know there's not two motion going on
because<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.219> camera<00:01:38.640> following<00:01:39.539> the

pale crappy puke ish yellow and as we
pass<00:01:47.459> we<00:01:47.670> get<00:01:47.819> a<00:01:47.850> nice<00:01:48.030> bright<00:01:48.719> orange<00:01:48.780> meaning

we<00:01:58.500> usually<00:01:58.619> invert<00:01:59.099> this<00:01:59.310> image<00:02:03.200> so<00:02:04.200> here<00:02:04.409> are

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
we usually invert this image so here are

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.999 
we usually invert this image so here are
we<00:02:04.619> comp<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.009> everything<00:02:05.310> together<00:02:09.890> as<00:02:10.890> you

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
we comp and everything together as you

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.740 
we comp and everything together as you
can<00:02:11.099> see<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.430> kind<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.670> added<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.209> occlusion

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
can see it kind of added to occlusion

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.580 
can see it kind of added to occlusion
passes<00:02:13.260> there<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:13.790> one<00:02:14.790> is<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.120> blurred

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
passes there and one is the blurred

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.280 
passes there and one is the blurred
ground<00:02:16.590> occlusion<00:02:17.720> just<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.780> little<00:02:19.019> bit<00:02:19.140> more

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
ground occlusion just a little bit more

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.979 
ground occlusion just a little bit more
so<00:02:19.410> I<00:02:19.470> got<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.620> little<00:02:19.890> bit<00:02:19.980> more<00:02:20.160> darkness

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
so I got a little bit more darkness

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.449 
so I got a little bit more darkness
added<00:02:21.989> to<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.410> just<00:02:22.470> add<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:22.920> sometimes<00:02:23.370> you

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
added to and just add that sometimes you

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.009 
added to and just add that sometimes you
want<00:02:23.609> to<00:02:23.640> double<00:02:23.910> up<00:02:23.970> your<00:02:24.180> occlusion<00:02:24.450> passes

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
want to double up your occlusion passes

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.380 
want to double up your occlusion passes
especially<00:02:25.109> your<00:02:25.560> ground<00:02:25.849> depending<00:02:26.849> on<00:02:27.239> your

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
especially your ground depending on your

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.650 
especially your ground depending on your
scene<00:02:31.430> so<00:02:32.430> there's<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.760> motion<00:02:33.120> blur<00:02:33.209> added

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
scene so there's the motion blur added

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.750 
scene so there's the motion blur added
motion<00:02:34.319> blur<00:02:34.500> really<00:02:35.010> makes<00:02:35.190> things<00:02:35.370> come<00:02:35.670> to

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
motion blur really makes things come to

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.089 
motion blur really makes things come to
life<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:37.160> can't<00:02:38.160> really<00:02:38.609> I<00:02:39.500> can't<00:02:40.500> really<00:02:40.769> push

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
life I can't really I can't really push

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.009 
life I can't really I can't really push
that<00:02:41.310> anymore<00:02:41.579> now<00:02:41.940> you'll<00:02:42.599> notice<00:02:42.810> in<00:02:42.930> the

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
that anymore now you'll notice in the

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.750 
that anymore now you'll notice in the
final<00:02:43.319> comp<00:02:43.590> it's<00:02:44.160> looking<00:02:44.459> pretty<00:02:44.609> good

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
final comp it's looking pretty good

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.339 
final comp it's looking pretty good
except<00:02:45.180> looks<00:02:45.299> like<00:02:45.420> somebody<00:02:45.720> got<00:02:45.780> shot<00:02:45.900> up

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
except looks like somebody got shot up

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.470 
except looks like somebody got shot up
against<00:02:46.650> this<00:02:46.799> thing<00:02:47.150> probably<00:02:48.150> little

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
against this thing probably little

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.289 
against this thing probably little
overkill<00:02:48.870> on<00:02:49.049> the<00:02:49.139> dirt<00:02:49.370> but<00:02:50.370> as<00:02:50.849> you<00:02:51.060> can<00:02:51.239> see

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
overkill on the dirt but as you can see

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.960 
overkill on the dirt but as you can see
it<00:02:51.870> really<00:02:52.260> looks<00:02:52.590> awesome<00:02:52.829> but<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.489> starts<00:02:53.849> to

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
it really looks awesome but it starts to

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.610 
it really looks awesome but it starts to
give<00:02:54.120> itself<00:02:54.450> away<00:02:54.599> a<00:02:54.810> little<00:02:54.989> bit<00:02:55.230> at<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.590> end

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
give itself away a little bit at the end

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.909 
give itself away a little bit at the end
here<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.780> that's<00:02:57.780> because<00:02:58.079> the<00:02:58.650> lighting

00:02:58.909 --> 00:02:58.919 
here and that's because the lighting

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:02.050 
here and that's because the lighting
doesn't<00:02:59.310> make<00:02:59.609> sense<00:03:00.090> for<00:03:00.359> this<00:03:00.510> side<00:03:00.780> of<00:03:01.019> the

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
doesn't make sense for this side of the

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.250 
doesn't make sense for this side of the
vehicle<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.269> see<00:03:03.450> right<00:03:03.630> here<00:03:03.660> this<00:03:04.019> you<00:03:04.169> know

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
vehicle you see right here this you know

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.690 
vehicle you see right here this you know
the<00:03:04.380> lighting<00:03:04.620> should<00:03:04.889> be<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.069> same<00:03:05.280> here<00:03:05.549> as

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
the lighting should be the same here as

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.550 
the lighting should be the same here as
it<00:03:05.849> is<00:03:05.940> here<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.389> it's<00:03:06.480> dark<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.049> that's

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
it is here and it's dark and that's

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.110 
it is here and it's dark and that's
something<00:03:07.919> you<00:03:07.980> can<00:03:08.130> tweak<00:03:08.400> out<00:03:08.609> but<00:03:08.790> I<00:03:08.819> left

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
something you can tweak out but I left

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.970 
something you can tweak out but I left
that<00:03:09.450> discrepancy<00:03:10.049> in<00:03:10.470> there<00:03:10.620> just<00:03:10.799> so<00:03:10.889> you

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
that discrepancy in there just so you

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.729 
that discrepancy in there just so you
can<00:03:11.280> get<00:03:11.400> an<00:03:11.519> idea<00:03:11.790> of<00:03:11.849> how<00:03:12.000> easily<00:03:12.900> people<00:03:13.410> can

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
can get an idea of how easily people can

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.640 
can get an idea of how easily people can
pick<00:03:14.040> up<00:03:14.280> on<00:03:14.489> your<00:03:14.519> mistakes<00:03:15.239> of<00:03:15.599> lighting<00:03:16.079> so

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
pick up on your mistakes of lighting so

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.740 
pick up on your mistakes of lighting so
a<00:03:16.680> good<00:03:17.099> remedy<00:03:17.579> for<00:03:17.790> this<00:03:18.030> is<00:03:18.269> to<00:03:18.389> add<00:03:18.540> maybe

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
a good remedy for this is to add maybe

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.330 
a good remedy for this is to add maybe
another<00:03:19.200> point<00:03:19.680> light<00:03:19.889> here<00:03:20.099> with<00:03:20.310> a

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
another point light here with a

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.460 
another point light here with a
quadratic<00:03:20.609> fall-off<00:03:21.329> and<00:03:21.630> fill<00:03:22.260> in<00:03:22.440> that

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
quadratic fall-off and fill in that

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.309 
quadratic fall-off and fill in that
light<00:03:22.950> and<00:03:23.280> just<00:03:24.030> get<00:03:24.180> this<00:03:24.359> whole<00:03:24.569> area<00:03:24.840> more

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
light and just get this whole area more

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.210 
light and just get this whole area more
less<00:03:26.099> sharp<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.609> more<00:03:26.760> diffuse<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:28.190> lot<00:03:29.190> of

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
less sharp and more diffuse and a lot of

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.069 
less sharp and more diffuse and a lot of
what<00:03:29.790> you<00:03:29.879> don't<00:03:30.060> see<00:03:30.239> here<00:03:30.450> is<00:03:30.510> some<00:03:30.900> of<00:03:30.930> the

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
what you don't see here is some of the

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.369 
what you don't see here is some of the
color<00:03:31.290> correction<00:03:31.680> we<00:03:31.950> did<00:03:32.190> in<00:03:32.519> post<00:03:33.139> so<00:03:34.139> we're

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
color correction we did in post so we're

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:35.980 
color correction we did in post so we're
going<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.530> go<00:03:34.680> over<00:03:34.950> that

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
going to go over that

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:44.620 
going to go over that
now

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.690
