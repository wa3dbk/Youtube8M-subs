that's from really a cucumber beetle and
it's<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.409> striped<00:01:19.710> beetle<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.369> what

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
it's a striped beetle and this is what

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.090 
it's a striped beetle and this is what
it<00:01:20.580> looks<00:01:20.759> like<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.150> captured<00:01:21.600> these<00:01:22.100> actually

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
it looks like I captured these actually

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.760 
it looks like I captured these actually
one<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.240> morning<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.869> one<00:01:25.170> last<00:01:25.409> night<00:01:25.619> so

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
they're still around and hopefully you

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.899 
they're still around and hopefully you
can<00:01:28.530> see<00:01:28.799> they<00:01:29.250> have<00:01:29.340> black<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.820> yellow

stripes and that's what they look like

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.560 
stripes and that's what they look like
if<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.890> see<00:01:35.310> those<00:01:35.549> on<00:01:35.729> your<00:01:35.880> plants<00:01:36.360> it's

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
if you see those on your plants it's

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.780 
if you see those on your plants it's
really<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.960> sign<00:01:37.560> one<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.189> need<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.460> treat<00:01:38.640> it

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
the beetles are starting to come out the

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.240 
the beetles are starting to come out the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
squash bugs the stink bugs and when you

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.219 
squash bugs the stink bugs and when you
see<00:01:47.520> them<00:01:47.729> one<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.450> course<00:01:48.689> treat<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.140> I'm

see them one of course treat it I'm
going<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.409> be<00:01:49.470> doing<00:01:49.590> some<00:01:49.829> videos<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.250> how<00:01:50.369> to

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
going to be doing some videos on how to

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.249 
going to be doing some videos on how to
do<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.790> but<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.390> really<00:01:51.659> wanted<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.990> show<00:01:52.200> you

do that but I really wanted to show you
start<00:01:52.710> checking<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.250> underside<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.759> your

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
start checking the underside of your

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.810 
start checking the underside of your
leaves<00:01:54.560> because<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.680> can<00:01:55.890> see<00:01:56.130> egg<00:01:56.460> masses

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
leaves because you can see egg masses

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.300 
leaves because you can see egg masses
right<00:01:57.810> there<00:01:58.110> there's<00:01:58.409> two<00:01:58.590> masses<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.100> eggs

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
right there there's two masses of eggs

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.219 
right there there's two masses of eggs
they<00:02:00.000> are<00:02:00.030> not<00:02:00.360> from<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.659> striped<00:02:01.020> cucumber

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
they are not from the striped cucumber

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.410 
they are not from the striped cucumber
beetle<00:02:01.860> they<00:02:02.310> tend<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.640> lay<00:02:02.790> their<00:02:03.000> eggs<00:02:03.030> down

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
beetle they tend to lay their eggs down

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.539 
beetle they tend to lay their eggs down
at<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.689> base<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.170> stem<00:02:04.469> but

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
at the base of the stem but

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.790 
at the base of the stem but
when<00:02:07.090> you<00:02:07.210> see<00:02:07.420> beetles<00:02:07.689> that<00:02:07.960> usually<00:02:08.560> means

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
when you see beetles that usually means

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.070 
when you see beetles that usually means
here's<00:02:09.160> another<00:02:09.429> clump<00:02:09.729> of<00:02:09.879> eggs<00:02:10.090> right<00:02:10.929> in

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
here's another clump of eggs right in

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.259 
here's another clump of eggs right in
there<00:02:11.290> that<00:02:12.220> usually<00:02:12.580> means<00:02:12.790> you<00:02:13.120> got

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
there that usually means you got

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.390 
there that usually means you got
different<00:02:13.660> kinds<00:02:13.780> of<00:02:13.989> bugs<00:02:14.200> beetles<00:02:14.920> crawling

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
different kinds of bugs beetles crawling

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.470 
different kinds of bugs beetles crawling
around<00:02:15.489> in<00:02:15.730> your<00:02:15.819> garden<00:02:16.180> and<00:02:16.360> they're

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
around in your garden and they're

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.479 
around in your garden and they're
starting<00:02:16.720> to<00:02:16.870> lay<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.830> eggs<00:02:18.069> on<00:02:18.400> the

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
starting to lay the eggs on the

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.809 
starting to lay the eggs on the
underside<00:02:19.000> of<00:02:19.030> your<00:02:19.239> cucumber<00:02:19.810> plants<00:02:20.819> that

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
underside of your cucumber plants that

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.610 
underside of your cucumber plants that
might<00:02:22.030> be<00:02:22.150> another<00:02:22.360> clump<00:02:22.720> right<00:02:23.019> there<00:02:23.410> too

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
might be another clump right there too

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.009 
might be another clump right there too
so<00:02:23.830> there's<00:02:24.010> three<00:02:24.280> under<00:02:25.269> the<00:02:25.629> underside<00:02:25.989> of

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
so there's three under the underside of

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.420 
so there's three under the underside of
the<00:02:26.110> leaves<00:02:26.290> of<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.500> cucumber<00:02:26.950> plants<00:02:27.310> the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
the leaves of the cucumber plants the

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.140 
the leaves of the cucumber plants the
squash<00:02:27.730> plants<00:02:28.209> the<00:02:28.750> zucchini<00:02:29.200> plants<00:02:30.150> so

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
squash plants the zucchini plants so

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.130 
squash plants the zucchini plants so
again<00:02:31.450> here's<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.810> striped<00:02:32.260> cucumber<00:02:32.470> beetle

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
again here's the striped cucumber beetle

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.920 
again here's the striped cucumber beetle
that's<00:02:35.140> what<00:02:35.379> it<00:02:35.500> looks<00:02:35.709> like<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:37.120> when<00:02:37.840> you

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
that's what it looks like and when you

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.740 
that's what it looks like and when you
see<00:02:38.200> these<00:02:38.430> it's<00:02:39.430> really<00:02:39.579> a<00:02:39.819> sign<00:02:40.390> that<00:02:40.450> you

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
see these it's really a sign that you

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.360 
see these it's really a sign that you
need<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:40.989> start<00:02:41.230> checking<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.709> undersides<00:02:42.160> of

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
need to start checking the undersides of

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.120 
need to start checking the undersides of
your<00:02:42.970> leaves<00:02:43.180> because<00:02:43.720> you<00:02:43.870> will<00:02:44.079> have<00:02:44.319> eggs

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
your leaves because you will have eggs

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.920 
your leaves because you will have eggs
deposited<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:46.030> you<00:02:46.150> really<00:02:46.540> want<00:02:46.720> to<00:02:46.780> just

deposited and you really want to just
remove<00:02:47.230> those<00:02:47.410> you<00:02:47.620> can<00:02:47.769> treat<00:02:48.010> them<00:02:48.190> with<00:02:49.180> the

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
remove those you can treat them with the

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:50.789 
remove those you can treat them with the
spray<00:02:49.569> if<00:02:49.660> you<00:02:49.750> want<00:02:49.959> or<00:02:50.140> you<00:02:50.260> can<00:02:50.290> just<00:02:50.590> cut
