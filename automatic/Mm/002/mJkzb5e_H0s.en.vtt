00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 how's it going with you bratishki stop just 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.450
 over a year ago in one of their videos 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.049
 I wondered borka Russian 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.780
 butcher 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.240
 able to raise the skill today we are 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.990
 we learn further I just played the type 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.660
 dragged 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.240
 and the kind of thing that make your own conclusions but 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.670
 the question was never answered and now 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.590
 year I decided to make a video do the work 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.210
 try to make objective mistakes 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.789
 answer your own question 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.890
 let's start i think many will agree with 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.769
 so that the assembly of the Russian butcher is just 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.550
 awesome as visually beautiful 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.460
 interface 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.610
 bursting head from headshots so their 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.840
 technical assembly completely in Russian 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.750
 fully Russified 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.309
 and protected by hacking or by the way 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.210
 Of course, the Russian configuration itself 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.610
 butcher 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.370
 Does it help to raise the viewer's skill? 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.010
 config is carefully balanced configured 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.320
 he is very inconvenient to play this config 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.629
 Vx becomes still accept that I 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.430
 thought it was time to answer question a 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.949
 to help her build a Russian butcher 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.100
 raise skill if you put the question like this 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.290
 how is he standing then no but she is gone 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.110
 shooting a little more simple and enjoyable and 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.020
 convenient that in principle can improve 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.729
 shooting but not specifically skill what 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.159
 In short, and I think it will not be all 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.960
