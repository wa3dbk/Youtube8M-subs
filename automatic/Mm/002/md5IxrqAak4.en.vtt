00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
lift the heel on one foot you kind of

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.679 
lift the heel on one foot you kind of
have<00:01:18.049> to<00:01:18.229> push<00:01:19.159> the<00:01:19.520> hip<00:01:19.729> to<00:01:19.909> go<00:01:20.060> up<00:01:20.150> it's<00:01:20.540> not

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
requires a switch away from side to side

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.300 
requires a switch away from side to side
is<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:05.209> make<00:03:05.359> sure<00:03:05.389> actually<00:03:06.049> that<00:03:06.650> you<00:03:06.950> do<00:03:07.159> not

drop your head at all on both sides and
use<00:03:09.680> your<00:03:09.950> knees<00:03:10.250> instead<00:03:10.909> of<00:03:11.269> your<00:03:11.540> heel<00:03:11.930> to

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
use your knees instead of your heel to

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.129 
use your knees instead of your heel to
shift<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.489> weight<00:03:13.700> it's<00:03:14.030> not<00:03:14.180> just<00:03:14.389> like<00:03:14.540> okay

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:15.139

so<00:03:15.680> what<00:03:15.709> I<00:03:15.980> mean<00:03:16.129> by<00:03:16.189> that<00:03:16.519> is<00:03:16.760> doing

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
so what I mean by that is doing

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.479 
so what I mean by that is doing
something<00:03:17.269> like<00:03:17.689> this<00:03:17.900> out<00:03:18.109> of<00:03:18.260> me<00:03:18.430> show<00:03:19.430> you

something like this out of me show you

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.699 
something like this out of me show you
the<00:03:19.700> linear<00:03:20.480> motion<00:03:20.689> here<00:03:21.019> so<00:03:21.439> you<00:03:21.500> want<00:03:21.590> to

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
the linear motion here so you want to

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.440 
the linear motion here so you want to
start<00:03:21.919> with<00:03:22.250> in<00:03:22.400> this<00:03:22.519> position<00:03:23.000> right<00:03:23.180> here

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
start with in this position right here

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.539 
start with in this position right here
give<00:03:23.810> you<00:03:23.900> up<00:03:24.019> body<00:03:24.260> straight<00:03:24.650> you<00:03:25.159> know<00:03:25.280> just

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
give you up body straight you know just

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.300 
give you up body straight you know just
soften<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.090> knees<00:03:26.269> lift<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:27.079> heels<00:03:27.199> and<00:03:27.650> then

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
soften the knees lift the heels and then

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.210 
soften the knees lift the heels and then
what<00:03:28.459> you're<00:03:28.549> doing<00:03:28.579> is<00:03:28.819> a<00:03:28.879> pistol<00:03:29.389> drop<00:03:30.220> while

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
what you're doing is a pistol drop while

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.339 
what you're doing is a pistol drop while
you're<00:03:31.519> not<00:03:31.819> dropping<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.389> heel<00:03:32.629> at<00:03:32.810> all<00:03:32.989> you

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
you're not dropping the heel at all you

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.939 
you're not dropping the heel at all you
heels<00:03:33.620> will<00:03:33.829> never<00:03:34.010> go<00:03:34.220> down<00:03:35.650> it's<00:03:36.650> kind<00:03:36.919> of

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:36.949 
heels will never go down it's kind of

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:38.229 
heels will never go down it's kind of
hard<00:03:37.129> to<00:03:37.190> hold<00:03:37.430> for<00:03:37.609> a<00:03:37.639> long<00:03:37.760> time<00:03:37.970> because

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
hard to hold for a long time because

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.819 
hard to hold for a long time because
eventually<00:03:38.359> you<00:03:38.810> lose<00:03:39.049> balance<00:03:39.229> and<00:03:39.650> then<00:03:39.739> you

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
eventually you lose balance and then you

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.379 
eventually you lose balance and then you
want<00:03:39.979> to<00:03:40.040> drop<00:03:40.189> it<00:03:40.400> yeah<00:03:40.549> and<00:03:40.790> that's<00:03:41.090> fine

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
want to drop it yeah and that's fine

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.240 
want to drop it yeah and that's fine
when<00:03:42.319> you<00:03:42.409> practicing<00:03:42.919> when<00:03:43.040> you're<00:03:43.159> learning

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
when you practicing when you're learning

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.219 
when you practicing when you're learning
even<00:03:43.699> for<00:03:43.849> the<00:03:43.939> best<00:03:44.180> dancers<00:03:44.840> really<00:03:44.959> that

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:45.229 
even for the best dancers really that

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:47.559 
even for the best dancers really that
stuff<00:03:45.439> happens<00:03:45.739> all<00:03:45.889> the<00:03:45.919> time<00:03:46.040> so<00:03:46.609> just<00:03:46.909> stick
