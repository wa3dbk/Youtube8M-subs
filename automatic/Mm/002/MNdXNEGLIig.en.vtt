00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.230
 hi to all and rings i hope that 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.400
 you are finally found on 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.330
 episode 12 it's been a while 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.099
 we did not make videos 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.960
 transfer to fifa 16 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.520
 this is the opportunity to leave with 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.690
 heavy the first player is gareth 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.650
 it shows up on the screen as you 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.970
 have the news as always in 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.960
 writing I want me troyen because 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.939
 I know that very often people 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.570
 say yes and no it's wrong what you 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.010
 say stuff etc 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.750
 it's not me who invents the news 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.260
 are well in the description just 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.170
 to watch 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.420
 gareth bale for manchester united so 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.590
 the madrid real would require 122 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.770
 million euros then the news varies 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.420
 between the figaro sport24 goal.com the 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.670
 choice of these goal that speaks of 140 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.050
 million and the figaro talking about 122 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.940
 millions pass in any case it would 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.800
 a record transfer there for the little 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.200
 anecdote the batteries his own record 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.120
 so it would still be the most 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.750
 expensive if ever this transfer was to be 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.850
 make 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.809
 43 matches this year with the house 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.850
 white 15 goals 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.530
 so why it can be interesting 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.129
 you have my advantage 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.809
 exclusively the small drum card 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.880
 of 16 on your screen it's more the gap 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.439
 of 15 drums I put the quarters of 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.060
 finale 16 on the other hand that the skin legend 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.530
 so suddenly you have it go 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.670
 have all skis in the people here 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.350
 it's this card that you go 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.770
 to have on your refusal to seine at all 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.540
 brought 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.220
 why it is possible departure from di 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.250
 married for sixty million 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.689
 at psg so manchester released a 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.060
 place even though they are very very provided 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.369
 with the kidneys morning all had everything 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.320
 little world of pikes has signed too and 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.210
 I think in my opinion that manchester 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.310
 should recruit a central defender 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.540
 otamendi type deep ramos shit 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.270
 naturally it's a little bit 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.590
 complicated and the negotiations it's a 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.350
 little bit complicated since schedule 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.770
 between manchester united and the real de 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.360
 Madrid 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.399
 in any case a pass that has been released 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.320
 instead of di maria it's already two 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.909
 years manchester is interested since 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.899
 his departure from tottenham where he has 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.700
 by the way been a little bit 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.070
 he played a little parallel left a 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.350
 little left middle he played well 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.540
 before center left at tottenham and there he 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.360
 went naturally right side 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.640
 since ronald or block the way 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.470
 very very good player he is he still has 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.510
 still young people who had 26 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.790
 years it may be interesting to 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.950
 find in bpm me it's a transfer 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.900
 in any case who attracts me after 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.940
 see how the real behind could 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.650
 to overcome this departure is what like the 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.730
 picks art real sign of the blow the 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.740
 transfer he's dead is that they 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.930
 still feel an arrangement between 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.540
 you let go of garrett rehiring 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.370
 bay but it will take 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.660
 a lot a lot m bertrand but if so 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.940
 nothing should leave it will take 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.230
 replace see a lot of a lot of 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.580
 question marks in any case the 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.270
 muse and there we talk about it you say what 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.200
 you think about it in the comments 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.610
 as usual 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.730
 regarding his card I will not touch 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.310
 285 think it's not bad at all there 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.470
 could deserve 88 but but in all 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.910
 case i 'm coming 187 it's a very very good 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.280
 player here of opinion if he ever had to 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.360
 to leave in bpl manchester I will think 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.040
 in pole position 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.739
 do not forget to read the news in the 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.280
 description before telling me that the news 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:57.739
 and and all invented the 2nd jari is displayed 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.810
 on screen is the flop mario balotelli 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.820
 which is part of liverpool season 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.570
 last to overcome at the beginning of that 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.269
 stay at the barÃ§a 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.500
 it was a big big flop he did 28 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.090
 matches 4 goals he has often been 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.290
 substitute and then has never been very 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.880
 decisive no gnac 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.799
 we did not find the balloon to the offense 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.110
 of line ter or city when he 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.630
 finally returned the match there the 79th minute 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.799
 where he is and where he was decisive it was 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.140
 interesting even though it remained a 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.900
 substitute regarding his frozen card 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.190
 went down to 80 he was at 82 does a 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.620
 updated in December and moved to 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.780
 80 but basic and in short I'm 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.360
 to go down while announcing it on loan 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.769
 with option to buy the hard way of rome this 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.440
 which is quite possible since 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.730
 it's an Italian usually the series to 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.739
 he managed a little bit better than 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.750
 when he went to manchester city or 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.299
 in liverpool with the impression that it's 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.100
 not too much his thing it would be a loan 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.600
 with option to buy 10 8 million 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.160
 euros so we still stay for a 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.230
 player who has a big flop with a strong 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.540
 sum in my opinion is the only condition 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.670
 of this loan with call option would 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.110
 that lazio de rome qualifies for the 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.990
 league of champions who will pass the 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.060
 third round for qualifying 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:05.050
 this is balotelli it's a player who goes 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.580
 do one and 90 so it serves 25 years 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.560
 it is a player who could and who 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.500
 had potential when he was 21 22 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.760
 years we wanted to bet on him 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.890
 it's true we want to bet on him 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.300
 and there it is true that since two seasons 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.160
 are their guards to be honest we 

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.620
 almost look at him almost more is this 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.690
 that it would not be finally the club of 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.220
 revival for mario balotelli but at 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.600
 the less we wish him in any case the 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.680
 better but you have to get 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.780
 wake up he has to change a little 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.610
 little behavior he'll do he'll 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.720
 to be 25 years old I told you he remains 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.070
 a little too much grammar we are 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.720
 more in the training centers of 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.430
 more than one there he is in the big bath 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.450
 for two or three years already and that's right 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.500
 that they will be able to see absolutely nothing 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.210
 so that's a bit of a pity 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.500
 and of course you tell me what 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.510
 you think about it in the comments of 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.830
 years the last game harry appears at 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.870
 the screen is luis gustavo the 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.830
 recuperator of the German team of 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.170
 wolfsburg they did besides a 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.490
 very good season and we finish 2nd of the 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.720
 bundesliga they are not very seller 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.620
 by the way we saw it with kevin 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.850
 noisy which is quite logical 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.960
 since it makes it very very good 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.240
 season I hear why they would sell 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.490
 but the juventus would be very interested 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.550
 you know sami khedira coming from 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.020
 of the real got hurt on on the last 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.130
 match of the juventus for two months there 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.890
 will have to overcome this start here 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.300
 since they lost arturo vidal who 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.860
 went to bayern to make up for the 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.740
 leaving schweinsteiger machester 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.120
 united and and pogba clearly said 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.770
 that they wanted to play a notch higher 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.480
 for daddy playmaker anyway 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.340
 less this recuperator - this middle axis 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.620
 so luiz gustavo completely return 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.210
 in this plane where he would be more at the 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.520
 balloon recovery and recovery 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.580
 and okba would be more leader cheerleader 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.410
 orchestra of the juventus he said it 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.630
 that he felt able to score 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.310
 as many goals as arthur vidal since 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.630
 parties so you have to see me I 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.610
 find that his card is very interesting 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.930
 there is a little bit old now but 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.640
 he has a big note in physics these 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.180
 pickers that is fast going in 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.650
 the impact 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:49.080
 so it can be interesting 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.699
 to the juventus and seria to have a guy 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.800
 like like gustavo we have to see after 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:55.620
 what your bank can recruit if 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.210
 never if he ever had to leave we did not 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.310
 not the only one you still have there the 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.900
 link in the description of the news but 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.880
 we do not have any information knowing 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.550
 if it's a loan with an option to buy 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.410
 it is if it is a neighboring transfer 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.000
 the 10 15 20 million euros was 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.830
 past not specified in the bubble so 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.840
 see here we will wait a little bit and 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.070
 we'll see what's going on here are the friends 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.509
 in any case three enough news 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.370
 interesting I think with the big it's 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:18.600
 Gareth Bale Balotelli and Luiz Gustavo 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.560
 you tell me what you think about it in 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.180
 comments it's been a while
