00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.270 
thinking about okay what's going on
outside<00:04:02.269> what's<00:04:02.840> here<00:04:03.080> what's<00:04:03.110> there<00:04:03.500> let's

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
outside what's here what's there let's

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.520 
outside what's here what's there let's
go<00:04:04.519> see<00:04:04.730> if<00:04:04.790> we<00:04:04.880> can<00:04:05.090> find<00:04:05.390> it<00:04:05.660> in<00:04:05.900> in

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
go see if we can find it in in

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.949 
go see if we can find it in in
development<00:04:07.190> and<00:04:07.340> I<00:04:07.760> get<00:04:08.180> so<00:04:08.420> excited<00:04:08.690> about

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
development and I get so excited about

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.110 
development and I get so excited about
that<00:04:09.319> because<00:04:09.500> it<00:04:09.680> really<00:04:10.069> is<00:04:10.310> in<00:04:10.640> the<00:04:10.819> hands

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
that because it really is in the hands

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.660 
that because it really is in the hands
of<00:04:11.209> the<00:04:11.390> user<00:04:12.130> what<00:04:13.130> are<00:04:13.220> some<00:04:13.370> similarities

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
of the user what are some similarities

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.790 
of the user what are some similarities
between<00:04:13.970> the<00:04:14.269> way<00:04:14.300> game<00:04:14.900> dough<00:04:15.050> of<00:04:15.230> developers

parallels that are of what they do for

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.680 
parallels that are of what they do for

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
like a video game compared to what we do

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.810 
like a video game compared to what we do

at Pixar and the Walt Disney Animation
Studios<00:04:41.210> in<00:04:41.780> developing<00:04:42.520> story<00:04:43.520> we<00:04:44.300> all<00:04:44.330> have

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
Studios in developing story we all have

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.210 
Studios in developing story we all have
to<00:04:45.050> kind<00:04:45.229> of<00:04:45.350> develop<00:04:46.750> the<00:04:47.750> characters<00:04:48.289> you

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
to kind of develop the characters you

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.010 
to kind of develop the characters you
know<00:04:49.370> the<00:04:49.520> personality<00:04:50.330> of<00:04:50.360> the<00:04:50.479> characters

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
know the personality of the characters

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.380 
know the personality of the characters
how<00:04:51.440> they<00:04:51.740> look<00:04:52.130> how<00:04:52.340> they're<00:04:52.490> gonna<00:04:52.640> move<00:04:53.000> and

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
how they look how they're gonna move and

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.630 
how they look how they're gonna move and
so<00:04:53.600> on<00:04:53.750> we<00:04:54.350> developed<00:04:54.710> the<00:04:54.800> world<00:04:55.100> as<00:04:55.460> to

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
so on we developed the world as to

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.700 
so on we developed the world as to
what's<00:04:55.910> around<00:04:56.210> every<00:04:56.479> corner<00:04:56.780> we<00:04:57.530> also

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
what's around every corner we also

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.880 
what's around every corner we also
develop<00:04:58.430> the<00:04:58.580> story<00:04:59.410> you<00:05:00.410> know<00:05:00.530> and<00:05:00.560> the<00:05:00.830> story

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
develop the story you know and the story

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:07.180 
develop the story you know and the story
is<00:05:01.780> is<00:05:02.780> really<00:05:03.200> what<00:05:03.440> happens<00:05:03.950> next<00:05:04.310> and<00:05:05.950> it<00:05:06.950> is

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
is is really what happens next and it is

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.730 
is is really what happens next and it is
very<00:05:07.700> much<00:05:08.000> the<00:05:08.210> same<00:05:08.240> but<00:05:08.690> ours<00:05:09.229> is<00:05:09.380> a<00:05:09.410> real

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
very much the same but ours is a real

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.550 
very much the same but ours is a real
linear<00:05:10.070> storytelling<00:05:10.750> where<00:05:11.750> we<00:05:12.289> are<00:05:12.440> in

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
linear storytelling where we are in

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.880 
linear storytelling where we are in
control<00:05:13.010> of<00:05:13.160> where<00:05:13.340> the<00:05:13.370> story<00:05:13.729> goes<00:05:14.020> but<00:05:15.020> in

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890 
control of where the story goes but in

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.550 
control of where the story goes but in
their<00:05:16.669> world<00:05:17.000> it's<00:05:17.450> really<00:05:17.780> the<00:05:17.930> user<00:05:18.140> that's

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
their world it's really the user that's

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.060 
their world it's really the user that's
in

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
in

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.650 
in
control<00:05:19.460> over<00:05:19.490> where<00:05:19.790> the<00:05:19.880> story<00:05:20.120> goes<00:05:20.390> so

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
control over where the story goes so

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.870 
control over where the story goes so
that's<00:05:20.870> where<00:05:21.200> it<00:05:21.350> differentiates<00:05:21.860> and<00:05:22.730> they

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
that's where it differentiates and they

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.540 
that's where it differentiates and they
have<00:05:23.120> to<00:05:23.330> kind<00:05:23.840> of<00:05:23.990> deal<00:05:24.320> with<00:05:24.350> this<00:05:24.920> big<00:05:25.190> world

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
have to kind of deal with this big world

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.700 
have to kind of deal with this big world
that's<00:05:26.090> with<00:05:26.420> with<00:05:26.690> a<00:05:26.720> branching<00:05:27.260> structure

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
that's with with a branching structure

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.010 
that's with with a branching structure
of<00:05:27.800> the<00:05:27.890> story<00:05:28.180> and<00:05:29.180> I<00:05:29.270> think<00:05:29.330> that's<00:05:29.660> that's

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
of the story and I think that's that's

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.360 
of the story and I think that's that's
where<00:05:30.290> it's<00:05:30.410> different<00:05:30.590> but<00:05:30.800> everything<00:05:31.100> else

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
where it's different but everything else

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.820 
where it's different but everything else
before<00:05:31.610> that<00:05:32.000> is<00:05:32.210> very<00:05:32.510> I<00:05:32.990> was<00:05:33.200> surprised<00:05:33.620> at

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
before that is very I was surprised at

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.660 
before that is very I was surprised at
how<00:05:33.860> similar<00:05:34.340> it<00:05:34.670> really<00:05:34.940> is<00:05:35.770> how<00:05:36.770> did<00:05:37.400> you<00:05:37.430> see

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:37.670 
how similar it really is how did you see

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.010 
how similar it really is how did you see
these<00:05:37.820> similarities<00:05:38.330> were<00:05:38.510> on<00:05:38.750> the<00:05:38.840> big

those types of environments and that

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.110 
those types of environments and that
that<00:06:55.940> type<00:06:56.210> of<00:06:56.240> game<00:06:56.660> play<00:06:56.990> unique<00:06:57.860> and<00:06:58.220> sort

how<00:07:06.840> would<00:07:06.990> they<00:07:07.110> be<00:07:07.850> and<00:07:08.850> that's<00:07:09.030> where<00:07:09.210> a<00:07:09.240> lot

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:09.420 
how would they be and that's where a lot

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.990 
how would they be and that's where a lot
of<00:07:09.450> the<00:07:09.600> inspiration<00:07:10.200> for<00:07:10.590> for<00:07:11.550> a<00:07:11.580> record

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.000
