00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:08.010
 Hello, everybody, I want to have a video talk with 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:13.250
 you about the criteria that you need 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:16.170
 consider when choosing a knife 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.410
 Jacques is chosen is the situation with which 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.100
 sooner or later and perhaps later 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:27.810
 often have to face beginners 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:31.560
 Nozhemany if he asks a person 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:35.190
 having experience in this matter like that 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.629
 help advice then answers can be 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:45.360
 a great many someone will say 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:46.520
 buy a famous brand someone will say 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.250
 buy 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:54.930
 less famous brand but cheaper 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:58.050
 for starters, someone will say buy one 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.920
 knife because it is very cool here but 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.320
 imagine the situation you decided 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.689
 buy a car did not ask 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.049
 car owners with great experience that you 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:15.270
 choose it tells us to buy 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:22.830
 passat or mercedes or bmw five or 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:26.990
 Audit 6 machine is ergonomics cost 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:31.200
 operating dynamics fuel consumption 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.930
 comfort and so on and so on a bunch 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.180
 parameters that each defines for 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.840
 yourself priority order 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.869
 about the same thing happens with knives 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:46.470
 someone can say again about the tasks 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.689
 depending on what tasks you will be 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.509
 repel but we are already about the task 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.880
 spoke in the previous video and we consider 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.270
 that this question is closed 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.759
 we already know 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.909
 where we will use the knife for what 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:04.149
 goals and we already need more specifics 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.700
 someone can say take it all 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.069
 what you like is possible and so 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.090
 do but how to please and 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.780
 won't like it 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.910
 and it happens that comes off 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.049
 pretty quickly and because I bought and 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.360
 man knife or on the advice of another 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:24.849
 person or looking at the picture before 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.150
 the received was like for a while 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:35.200
 used there there in principle got 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:38.140
 frustration this questions here may even 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.380
 be such an option that advanced 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:45.519
 pushed reads a whole lecture on super 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:48.849
 handles materials textolite and 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:54.459
 modern elite super steels 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:57.519
 knife period is something here from this 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.730
 let's say class cheap there simple 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:03.209
 there son bikini take belle good too 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:07.630
 It may be an option but a 30 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.760
 killing such a knife can get 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:14.500
 certain issues later on 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:17.290
 exploiting general advice options 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.709
 there will be a great many they all have 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:24.519
 the right to life because they display 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.200
 let's say one side of the problem i would 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.140
 I wanted to talk 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.680
 on those things that will allow a person 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:36.129
 do not just the choice of a knife choice 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.920
 conscious that will allow him 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:41.440
 pick cutting tools for yourself 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.380
 probably as close as possible 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.459
 the same can be practiced until during 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.610
 living there in the development of attraction 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.769
 possibly 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:55.120
 man sooner or later this will have to 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:58.540
 possible but if there is a possibility already in 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:03.459
 the beginning of the way to do something proactive 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:05.590
 steps and probably choose yourself something from 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.810
 more suitable things but it doesn't seem 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:12.579
 probably more correct 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:15.670
 correctly so let's talk now about 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:16.989
 criteria to consider 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.630
 when choosing a knife 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.459
 that's how I see it, they themselves 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:26.139
 absolutely true natural 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:29.310
 but what you need is what I say 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:33.100
 usually guided by what I usually 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.990
 but provides some assistance in my 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.710
 choosing the first thing I want to talk about 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.780
 it's about size you can of course sitting in 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.930
 office open envelopes such here 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.780
 knife or carry out some small 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:50.470
 work outside the city like that 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:53.650
 There are no particular problems with this, but 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:56.130
 probably more appropriate if you are 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:02.860
 apply for these purposes 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:04.740
 small captivity because there are a number 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.419
 pros 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.820
 let's say so for this use 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.130
 a small blade is easier controlled by him 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.360
 easier to manage a small blade she 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.479
 less worth a small blade he 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.320
 more compact 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:22.110
 well and so on we will think in round moment 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:26.080
 which I would like to pay attention 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:28.450
 this blade geometry cuts all the same not 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:33.039
 they began to cut these knife geometries 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:37.449
 so when choosing a knife for certain 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:39.919
 goals we need to focus on 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:43.930
 such primary attention 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:43.930
 determine the size of the determined 

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:50.479
 let's say so with the geometry of the blade 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:51.139
 The next factor I would like 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:53.389
 to consider 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:55.849
 but such as compound year this 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:59.779
 knife design and ergonomics 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:01.759
 that is, it includes amenities here includes 

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:06.499
 manufacturing materials 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:09.139
 this includes the installation of the blade itself well 

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:13.669
 in detail about each of these factors we 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:17.840
 talk in the next video now on 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:19.520
 the main thing is that the base to give something to 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.310
 pay attention first 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.370
 Well, the last moment that is necessary 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:27.289
 consider when choosing a knife it became 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:29.629
 film material i need here 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:33.460
 bother so much let's say 

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:36.379
 some super Stalin is quite 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.029
 adequate line let's say so workers 

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:42.500
 become 

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:46.389
 which builds on 99 percent 99 all 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:48.919
 users well, if 

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:52.099
 holiday probably repeat what I 

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:56.089
 now voiced criteria when choosing a knife 

00:06:52.099 --> 00:07:02.050
 on which we pay attention it 

00:06:56.089 --> 00:07:09.909
 knife size second wedge geometry 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:13.330
 third knife design and ergonomics and 4 

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:16.580
 steel blade but that's all 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:20.020
 probably on this issue, thank you all 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.020
 for your attention, bye
