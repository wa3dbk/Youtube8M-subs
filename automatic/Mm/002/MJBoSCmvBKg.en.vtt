00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:07.500
 how are you I hope you are very well I 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.240
 I'm very embarrassed because I was 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.830
 checking my videos and I have three 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.830
 months of not showing up here 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.619
 it was not because I did not want to but really 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:21.020
 I do not know what happened to me lately 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:23.770
 I do not organize myself and I can not do anything and 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:27.590
 to neglect the truth channel 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:30.900
 forgive me a thousand apologies but I'm 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:35.760
 back and 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:39.210
 this time I come with a nail tutorial and 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.920
 it's about some fingernails and singing and 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.250
 I hope you like the video 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.040
 I very much miss you much more and the 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.210
 I leave with the tutorial of adapting a 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:57.680
 red enamel layer and now we're going to 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:01:01.350
 start with a black glaze if you 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.540
 you have these enamels 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.820
 that have a pincelito and a tip of 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.640
 metal is going to work for you and we do 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.820
 what will be the face of the ladybird 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.600
 for this we are going to do as a means a 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.600
 half circle 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.700
 it does not matter that you do not stay so 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.700
 so perfect 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.290
 Maybe you have a better pulse than me 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.590
 because right now I'm half mara 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.590
 what was it 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.409
 there is 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.290
 let's make this line here in between 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.120
 that will be like the wings then 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.750
 let's start 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:54.150
 well with a line and start already when 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.070
 let's go down we're going towards 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:00.290
 a side 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.740
 and then we just do the other one 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.840
 patita 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.580
 it's going to be like a vee as if they were 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.700
 some antennas of 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:13.450
 of a butterfly there you can see them here 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.390
 let's do the little dots 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.400
 would be the spots of the ladybug 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.400
 then nothing else we do dots 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.380
 It depends on you how many dots you want 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.200
 put and also depends on the length of 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.500
 tñaña then even with this same 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.480
 you can do here the 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.480
 the division and it will be better for you 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.890
 how dry 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.689
 with the white enamel we are going to make the 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.689
 little eyes we're just going to press 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.440
 and make two balls 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.010
 ensures that you do not leave you half view 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.010
 you catarina 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.349
 and we are going to put 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:18.659
 transparent enamel a protective layer 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:21.299
 top coat it is very important that you leave 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:23.430
 dry the design very well so you do not 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.459
 I will combine you do not go to 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.980
 combine the ones since we have our layer 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:33.930
 we already exposed our enamel so we 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:36.890
 the design is katharine and you're 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.890
 coquettish 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:49.090
 and that 's how the fingernails are 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.870
 qatar and half I hope they are here 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.390
 I really hope you liked it 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.329
 rock and wants to say goodbye to 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.430
 let's follow a month and thousands goodbye 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:02.470
 We hope you liked the 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.470
 we want a lot there are daily
