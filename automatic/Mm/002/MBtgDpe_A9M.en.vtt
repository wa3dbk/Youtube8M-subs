it to the H point to 64 I don't know why
that<00:03:16.299> makes<00:03:16.660> it<00:03:16.810> work<00:03:16.989> but<00:03:17.350> it<00:03:17.500> does<00:03:17.530> I<00:03:17.950> don't

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
that makes it work but it does I don't

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.250 
that makes it work but it does I don't
think<00:03:18.579> it's<00:03:18.790> a<00:03:18.819> big<00:03:19.209> of<00:03:19.329> a<00:03:19.390> deal<00:03:19.569> I<00:03:19.720> can<00:03:20.019> still

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
think it's a big of a deal I can still

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.750 
think it's a big of a deal I can still
record<00:03:20.530> really<00:03:20.829> good<00:03:20.950> quality<00:03:21.370> as<00:03:21.459> you<00:03:21.640> can

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
record really good quality as you can

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.140 
record really good quality as you can
see<00:03:21.989> you<00:03:23.280> can<00:03:24.280> actually<00:03:24.639> change<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:24.910> quality

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
see you can actually change the quality

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.509 
see you can actually change the quality
of<00:03:25.329> recording<00:03:25.840> which<00:03:26.440> you<00:03:26.650> know<00:03:26.739> in<00:03:27.130> return

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
of recording which you know in return

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.650 
of recording which you know in return
will<00:03:27.639> change<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:28.000> size<00:03:28.239> of<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:28.750> file<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:30.660> you

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
will change the size of the file and you

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.420 
will change the size of the file and you
can<00:03:31.690> actually<00:03:31.930> change<00:03:32.230> what<00:03:32.590> orientation<00:03:33.130> you

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
can actually change what orientation you

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.629 
can actually change what orientation you
want<00:03:33.579> to<00:03:33.639> record<00:03:33.910> into<00:03:35.010> so<00:03:36.010> I<00:03:36.040> have<00:03:36.250> mine<00:03:36.430> set

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:36.639 
want to record into so I have mine set

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:37.710 
want to record into so I have mine set
to<00:03:36.730> landscape<00:03:37.150> right<00:03:37.269> now<00:03:37.420> because<00:03:37.600> we're

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
to landscape right now because we're

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.479 
to landscape right now because we're
recording<00:03:37.900> landscape<00:03:38.560> if<00:03:39.010> you<00:03:39.130> don't<00:03:39.280> change

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
recording landscape if you don't change

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:40.920 
recording landscape if you don't change
it<00:03:39.730> to<00:03:39.819> look<00:03:40.060> retarded<00:03:40.239> when<00:03:40.630> you<00:03:40.720> upload

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
it to look retarded when you upload

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.129 
it to look retarded when you upload
unless<00:03:41.470> you<00:03:41.620> know<00:03:41.769> how<00:03:41.799> to<00:03:42.600> rotate<00:03:43.600> the<00:03:43.870> video

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
unless you know how to rotate the video

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:45.780 
unless you know how to rotate the video
and<00:03:44.500> then<00:03:44.799> you<00:03:44.920> can<00:03:45.069> also<00:03:45.190> adjust<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.639> frame

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
and then you can also adjust the frame

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.640 
and then you can also adjust the frame
rate<00:03:46.030> I<00:03:46.239> just<00:03:46.930> keep<00:03:47.109> it<00:03:47.230> all<00:03:47.350> the<00:03:47.380> way<00:03:47.530> up

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
rate I just keep it all the way up

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.510 
rate I just keep it all the way up
because<00:03:48.040> why<00:03:48.609> not

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
because why not

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.500 
because why not
another<00:03:50.520> nice<00:03:50.700> thing<00:03:50.730> is<00:03:50.970> you<00:03:51.000> can<00:03:51.120> set<00:03:51.420> your

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
another nice thing is you can set your

another nice thing is you can set your
activation<00:03:51.930> methods<00:03:52.410> so<00:03:53.220> for<00:03:54.000> mine<00:03:54.180> I<00:03:54.209> have

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
activation methods so for mine I have

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.880 
activation methods so for mine I have
mine<00:03:54.630> set<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:54.989> wear<00:03:55.110> and<00:03:55.200> I<00:03:55.230> hold<00:03:55.440> on<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.650> time

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
mine set to wear and I hold on the time

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.339 
mine set to wear and I hold on the time
a<00:03:56.220> little<00:03:57.120> pop-up<00:03:57.390> comes<00:03:57.599> up<00:03:57.810> and<00:03:57.959> says<00:03:58.140> would
