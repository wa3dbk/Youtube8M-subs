00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.420
 the eighth day of the european championships 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.740
 Here in Schwechat started with a 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.960
 pretty big surprise 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.790
 sara ramirez and jenny from beginners 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.130
 Spain beat the officiating 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.290
 European champion Elizabeta Samara and 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.700
 daniela dodean with 321 in the second 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.340
 Round in soest a big surprise 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.630
 as the dorian samara the last years 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.399
 really very very dominant in the 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.200
 were double competition and it is one 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.470
 huge success for the spanish 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.470
 doubles 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.040
 Pacino free that has a very complete 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.950
 difficult situation to survive 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.820
 They had to go pretty fast 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.560
 1-defeats occur 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.930
 but ultimately retreated on their own 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.869
 jump out of the swamp and could 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:47.030
 papageorgiou and gomez with 3 to 1 for sure 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.030
 defeat and stand in tomorrow's 5 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.160
 in the ladies' singles , sara ramirez met 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.170
 and viktoria pawlowitsch today in the 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.270
 second round and viktoria pawlowitsch 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.880
 underscored her ambitions to one 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.009
 successful title defense at 4 2 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.920
 1 victory you could already feel that they 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.739
 slowly but surely in the final 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.750
 mode would play and from my point of view 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.519
 she is a very hot favorite 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.000
 also this year on the title in 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.000
 ladies 1 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.790
 robert gardos against the hornets 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:29.249
 another very interesting match on 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.989
 tonight and robert gardos is 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:33.299
 actually very good for it 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.519
 defensive play and gion is on is 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.290
 this tournament is known here for against 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.939
 the so-called defense specialists 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.439
 He was able to win regularly 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:42.689
 already against vladimir samsonov in the team 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:44.370
 win competition and this time was 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:44.700
 is just the next on his 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.829
 list 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.900
 after robert gardos already 31 and 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:51.419
 had matchball for itself contagion is 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.219
 turn the match again at the end of the 4th 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:55.219
 3-win for johannes and the 1 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.370
 Let's come to the favorites dying on 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.780
 today's first favorite is the one 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.500
 today in one of the first rounds 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.110
 Caught 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.730
 montero against his good friend 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.560
 michael butschek from Italy with 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.390
 Schicker is known for that very well 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.980
 against left-handed play and against 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.450
 his really very good friend 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.670
 train together the werner hit 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.440
 academy he could do that once more 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.440
 put under proof and beat him four 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.610
 to one the next favorite of the 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.920
 certainly today presented differently 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.380
 had been markus Reifers against the 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.910
 ukrainian coal marcos freitas has 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.950
 really needed very long before he 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.930
 ever in the game took place after 0 to 3 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.820
 But he started better and better 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.890
 to find it in at 9 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.480
 4-lead in the sixth set already then 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.420
 out again into a seventh set 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.740
 would come before colleague more like 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.260
 he's in control of this game 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.410
 took over 11 to 9 under the cheers of 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.210
 some traveled ukrainian 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.550
 sluggers moved so cool in the 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.020
 next round a andrej gacina at the 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.580
 next favorite of today really 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.230
 had to let feathers against konetschny 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.500
 Surprisingly, it has to be shorter 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.390
 pull big with 912 in the seventh set 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.770
 success for concha but of course whole 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.020
 China has been around the whole season so far 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.180
 had been very consistent 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.159
 is 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.370
 retired far too early for him and 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:20.380
 certainly the last one disappoints 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.600
 leftover austrians in the gentleman 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.340
 single competition stefan fegerl out 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.380
 Romanian view, of course, a big one 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.020
 surprise that adrian crisan against 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.490
 Stefan Fegerl pulled the shorter with 2 4 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.990
 from Austrian point of view the last one 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:36.300
 Austrian hope in the individual 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.300
 and a great success for Stefan Fegerl
