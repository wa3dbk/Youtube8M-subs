you just have to go to to find it by

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.060 
you just have to go to to find it by
coincident<00:05:00.450> and<00:05:01.290> all<00:05:01.470> guessing<00:05:01.830> hard<00:05:02.310> and

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
coincident and all guessing hard and

coincident and all guessing hard and
interface<00:05:05.070> of<00:05:05.370> smartphone<00:05:07.010> supposed<00:05:08.010> to<00:05:08.190> be

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
interface of smartphone supposed to be

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.080 
interface of smartphone supposed to be
that<00:05:08.670> small<00:05:09.090> so<00:05:09.480> if<00:05:09.600> you<00:05:09.720> press<00:05:10.020> here<00:05:10.380> then
