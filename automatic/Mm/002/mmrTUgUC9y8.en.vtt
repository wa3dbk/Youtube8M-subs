hey<00:00:02.750> guys<00:00:02.929> I'm<00:00:03.230> Tesla<00:00:03.650> and<00:00:03.860> in<00:00:04.220> this<00:00:04.310> tutorial

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:04.850 
hey guys I'm Tesla and in this tutorial

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:05.920 
hey guys I'm Tesla and in this tutorial
I'm<00:00:05.060> going<00:00:05.210> to<00:00:05.270> show<00:00:05.360> you<00:00:05.509> a<00:00:05.540> little<00:00:05.690> trick

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:05.930 
I'm going to show you a little trick

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.599 
I'm going to show you a little trick
that<00:00:06.020> I<00:00:06.259> use<00:00:06.529> to<00:00:06.770> get<00:00:06.890> the<00:00:07.040> player<00:00:07.279> looking

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:07.609 
that I use to get the player looking

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:10.360 
that I use to get the player looking
like<00:00:07.790> he's<00:00:07.970> being<00:00:08.149> damaged<00:00:08.570> by<00:00:08.750> fire<00:00:09.310> okay<00:00:10.310> so

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
like he's being damaged by fire okay so

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.190 
like he's being damaged by fire okay so
let's<00:00:10.640> start<00:00:10.880> by<00:00:11.120> opening<00:00:11.150> up<00:00:11.600> the<00:00:11.660> starts

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
let's start by opening up the starts

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.110 
let's start by opening up the starts
content<00:00:12.590> folder<00:00:12.890> and<00:00:12.980> then<00:00:13.550> the<00:00:13.580> blueprints

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.120 
content folder and then the blueprints

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.060 
content folder and then the blueprints
folder<00:00:14.270> and<00:00:14.600> inside<00:00:15.170> here<00:00:15.470> you'll<00:00:15.710> find<00:00:15.950> the

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
folder and inside here you'll find the

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.610 
folder and inside here you'll find the
blueprint<00:00:16.550> effect<00:00:16.880> fire<00:00:17.119> so<00:00:17.990> all<00:00:18.050> it<00:00:18.200> is<00:00:18.320> is<00:00:18.560> a

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:18.620 
blueprint effect fire so all it is is a

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.890 
blueprint effect fire so all it is is a
particle<00:00:19.160> system<00:00:19.370> with<00:00:19.670> some<00:00:19.850> audio<00:00:20.180> now

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
particle system with some audio now

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.330 
particle system with some audio now
let's<00:00:21.080> make<00:00:21.260> it<00:00:21.289> so<00:00:21.620> when<00:00:21.770> we<00:00:21.800> get<00:00:21.950> close<00:00:22.310> to

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
let's make it so when we get close to

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.680 
let's make it so when we get close to
this<00:00:22.640> fire<00:00:22.850> it's<00:00:23.060> going<00:00:23.210> to<00:00:23.270> look<00:00:23.390> like<00:00:23.510> it's

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:23.690 
this fire it's going to look like it's

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.020 
this fire it's going to look like it's
damaging<00:00:24.170> the<00:00:24.260> player<00:00:24.470> so<00:00:25.280> let's<00:00:25.310> crack<00:00:25.820> the

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:26.030 
damaging the player so let's crack the

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.550 
damaging the player so let's crack the
blueprint<00:00:26.360> open<00:00:26.690> and<00:00:26.900> come<00:00:27.320> to<00:00:27.470> the

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
blueprint open and come to the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.160 
blueprint open and come to the
components<00:00:28.130> tab<00:00:28.280> and<00:00:28.580> now<00:00:29.449> what<00:00:29.630> we<00:00:29.720> can<00:00:29.840> do<00:00:29.960> is

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
components tab and now what we can do is

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.450 
components tab and now what we can do is
add<00:00:30.410> in<00:00:30.770> a<00:00:31.010> post<00:00:31.310> process<00:00:31.820> component<00:00:33.460> just

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
add in a post process component just

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.419 
add in a post process component just
here<00:00:34.730> and<00:00:34.909> then<00:00:35.210> we<00:00:35.480> can<00:00:35.629> make<00:00:35.780> this<00:00:36.100> go<00:00:37.100> black

00:00:37.419 --> 00:00:37.429 
here and then we can make this go black

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:41.349 
here and then we can make this go black
and<00:00:37.640> white<00:00:37.850> so<00:00:38.329> we<00:00:38.449> can<00:00:38.569> grab<00:00:39.339> where<00:00:40.339> is<00:00:40.429> it<00:00:40.640> and

00:00:41.349 --> 00:00:41.359 
and white so we can grab where is it and

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:43.029 
and white so we can grab where is it and
grab<00:00:41.569> this<00:00:41.749> one<00:00:42.019> if<00:00:42.260> you<00:00:42.350> get<00:00:42.440> black<00:00:42.679> and<00:00:42.890> white

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:43.039 
grab this one if you get black and white

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:46.090 
grab this one if you get black and white
grab<00:00:43.760> the<00:00:43.879> fringe<00:00:44.179> intensity<00:00:44.929> turn<00:00:45.800> all<00:00:46.010> the

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
grab the fringe intensity turn all the

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.009 
grab the fringe intensity turn all the
way<00:00:46.129> up<00:00:46.399> so<00:00:46.429> gives<00:00:47.359> that<00:00:47.479> kind<00:00:47.600> of<00:00:47.749> blurry

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
way up so gives that kind of blurry

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:51.969 
way up so gives that kind of blurry
effect<00:00:48.199> and<00:00:49.089> yet<00:00:50.089> stick<00:00:50.449> with<00:00:50.600> that<00:00:50.809> now<00:00:51.409> this

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:51.979 
effect and yet stick with that now this

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:53.709 
effect and yet stick with that now this
is<00:00:52.100> actually<00:00:52.370> applied<00:00:52.639> globally<00:00:53.089> which<00:00:53.479> is

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
is actually applied globally which is

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.349 
is actually applied globally which is
not<00:00:53.929> what<00:00:54.109> we<00:00:54.229> really<00:00:54.559> want<00:00:54.799> so<00:00:55.789> what<00:00:56.149> we<00:00:56.239> can

00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:56.359 
not what we really want so what we can

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:57.579 
not what we really want so what we can
do<00:00:56.510> is<00:00:56.719> scroll<00:00:56.960> all<00:00:57.079> the<00:00:57.109> way<00:00:57.199> down<00:00:57.260> to<00:00:57.499> the

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
do is scroll all the way down to the

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:00.969 
do is scroll all the way down to the
bottom<00:00:57.710> and<00:00:58.039> uncheck<00:00:58.609> unbound<00:00:59.679> however<00:01:00.679> it's

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:00.979 
bottom and uncheck unbound however it's

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:04.570 
bottom and uncheck unbound however it's
still<00:01:01.159> applied<00:01:01.699> globally<00:01:02.589> so<00:01:03.589> to<00:01:04.220> fix<00:01:04.400> this

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
still applied globally so to fix this

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.170 
still applied globally so to fix this
what<00:01:05.150> we<00:01:05.239> can<00:01:05.360> do<00:01:05.510> is<00:01:05.720> add<00:01:06.079> in<00:01:06.590> a<00:01:06.890> shape<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:08.090> we

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
what we can do is add in a shape so we

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.679 
what we can do is add in a shape so we
could<00:01:08.299> add<00:01:08.450> in<00:01:08.719> a<00:01:08.899> sphere<00:01:09.170> and<00:01:10.329> let's<00:01:11.329> make<00:01:11.509> the

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
could add in a sphere and let's make the

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.639 
could add in a sphere and let's make the
radius<00:01:12.020> a<00:01:12.320> bit<00:01:13.280> larger<00:01:14.409> imagine<00:01:15.409> this<00:01:15.530> is

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
radius a bit larger imagine this is

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:17.050 
radius a bit larger imagine this is
where<00:01:15.799> the<00:01:16.009> player<00:01:16.310> is<00:01:16.460> going<00:01:16.610> to<00:01:16.670> collide

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
where the player is going to collide

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.779 
where the player is going to collide
with<00:01:17.090> it<00:01:17.359> and<00:01:17.539> apply<00:01:17.930> that<00:01:18.109> effect<00:01:18.229> so<00:01:18.829> with

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
with it and apply that effect so with

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.240 
with it and apply that effect so with
our<00:01:19.939> sphere<00:01:20.210> we<00:01:21.020> can<00:01:21.200> now<00:01:21.320> drag<00:01:21.680> and<00:01:21.859> drop<00:01:22.009> the

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
our sphere we can now drag and drop the

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.190 
our sphere we can now drag and drop the
post-process<00:01:23.000> volume<00:01:23.359> onto<00:01:23.719> it<00:01:23.810> and<00:01:23.960> make<00:01:24.079> it

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
post-process volume onto it and make it

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.980 
post-process volume onto it and make it
a<00:01:24.259> child<00:01:24.289> and<00:01:24.859> now<00:01:25.789> when<00:01:25.939> we<00:01:25.969> enter<00:01:26.509> the<00:01:26.539> sphere

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
a child and now when we enter the sphere

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.669 
a child and now when we enter the sphere
that<00:01:27.430> effect<00:01:28.430> now<00:01:28.670> gets<00:01:28.880> applied<00:01:29.469> but<00:01:30.469> we<00:01:30.560> can

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679 
that effect now gets applied but we can

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:33.029 
that effect now gets applied but we can
also<00:01:30.799> grab<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.310> post-process<00:01:32.030> volume<00:01:32.390> and

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
also grab the post-process volume and

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:36.669 
also grab the post-process volume and
turn<00:01:34.039> up<00:01:34.159> the<00:01:34.189> blend<00:01:34.429> radius<00:01:34.820> as<00:01:34.969> well<00:01:35.619> so<00:01:36.619> it

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
turn up the blend radius as well so it

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:38.230 
turn up the blend radius as well so it
will<00:01:36.740> start<00:01:37.009> blending<00:01:37.159> before<00:01:37.609> we<00:01:37.700> even<00:01:37.909> enter

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
will start blending before we even enter

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.419 
will start blending before we even enter
the<00:01:38.270> sphere<00:01:38.570> so<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.619> effect<00:01:39.979> will<00:01:40.250> be<00:01:40.280> applied

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
the sphere so the effect will be applied

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:44.679 
the sphere so the effect will be applied
gradually<00:01:41.179> and<00:01:42.670> then<00:01:43.670> also<00:01:43.850> in<00:01:44.119> the<00:01:44.149> graph<00:01:44.390> we

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
gradually and then also in the graph we

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.569 
gradually and then also in the graph we
could<00:01:44.780> grab<00:01:45.109> the<00:01:45.259> sphere<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:45.799> then

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
could grab the sphere and then

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.749 
could grab the sphere and then
right-click<00:01:46.820> add<00:01:47.359> an<00:01:47.689> event<00:01:47.929> for<00:01:48.109> a<00:01:48.170> collision

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
right-click add an event for a collision

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.109 
right-click add an event for a collision
begin<00:01:49.759> overlap<00:01:50.140> so<00:01:51.140> when<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.590> player<00:01:51.799> enters

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
begin overlap so when the player enters

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.489 
begin overlap so when the player enters
the<00:01:53.119> sphere<00:01:53.450> we<00:01:53.780> could<00:01:53.929> just<00:01:54.049> make<00:01:54.200> sure<00:01:54.350> it

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:54.499 
the sphere we could just make sure it

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:58.450 
the sphere we could just make sure it
will<00:01:54.560> be<00:01:54.710> the<00:01:54.829> player<00:01:55.009> by<00:01:55.189> casting<00:01:55.729> to<00:01:55.850> him<00:01:57.460> we

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
will be the player by casting to him we

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.020 
will be the player by casting to him we
could<00:01:58.640> then<00:01:58.850> apply<00:01:59.240> damage<00:02:00.819> which<00:02:01.819> could<00:02:01.969> then

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
could then apply damage which could then

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:09.620 
could then apply damage which could then
be<00:02:02.179> hooked<00:02:02.509> up<00:02:02.659> to<00:02:02.899> a<00:02:02.929> health<00:02:03.319> variable

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.100 

okay<00:02:10.630> so<00:02:10.770> let's<00:02:11.770> give<00:02:11.920> it<00:02:11.950> a<00:02:12.040> test<00:02:12.840> so<00:02:13.840> this<00:02:13.989> is

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
okay so let's give it a test so this is

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.570 
okay so let's give it a test so this is
all<00:02:14.230> looking<00:02:14.530> normal<00:02:14.770> and<00:02:15.040> then<00:02:15.160> if<00:02:15.280> we<00:02:15.370> jump

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
all looking normal and then if we jump

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.210 
all looking normal and then if we jump
it

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
it

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.260 
it
you<00:02:18.220> can<00:02:18.340> probably<00:02:18.489> bring<00:02:18.700> down<00:02:18.849> that<00:02:18.910> blend

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
you can probably bring down that blend

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.729 
you can probably bring down that blend
radius<00:02:19.630> but<00:02:19.780> we<00:02:19.870> can<00:02:19.989> see<00:02:20.230> that<00:02:20.260> we<00:02:20.500> get<00:02:20.620> that

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
radius but we can see that we get that

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.400 
radius but we can see that we get that
effect<00:02:21.099> happening<00:02:21.819> now<00:02:22.000> okay<00:02:22.840> guys<00:02:23.080> that's<00:02:23.230> it

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
effect happening now okay guys that's it

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.630
