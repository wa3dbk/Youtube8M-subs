third generation but let's go over some

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.850 
third generation but let's go over some
of<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.560> specs<00:00:31.940> so<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.149> processor<00:00:33.930> has<00:00:34.649> not

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
of the specs so the processor has not

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.030 
of the specs so the processor has not
been<00:00:35.070> confirmed<00:00:35.809> the<00:00:36.809> RAM<00:00:37.050> also<00:00:37.500> has<00:00:37.620> not<00:00:37.829> been

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
been confirmed the RAM also has not been

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.869 
been confirmed the RAM also has not been
confirmed<00:00:38.219> yet<00:00:38.610> but<00:00:38.809> it<00:00:39.809> will<00:00:40.879> probably

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
confirmed yet but it will probably

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.590 
confirmed yet but it will probably
remain<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.719> same<00:00:42.930> at<00:00:43.200> 256<00:00:43.860> megabytes<00:00:44.600> it'll

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
remain the same at 256 megabytes it'll

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.540 
remain the same at 256 megabytes it'll
also<00:00:45.930> have<00:00:46.170> retina<00:00:46.500> display<00:00:46.890> just<00:00:47.160> like<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
also have retina display just like the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.540 
also have retina display just like the
ipod<00:00:47.879> touch<00:00:48.090> 4th<00:00:48.450> generation<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:50.070> display

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
ipod touch 4th generation the display

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.580 
ipod touch 4th generation the display

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.790 
of you on the ipod touch 2nd generation
a<00:03:48.180> third<00:03:48.450> generation<00:03:48.660> i<00:03:49.230> would<00:03:49.350> probably

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
a third generation i would probably

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.100 
a third generation i would probably
consider<00:03:49.980> getting<00:03:50.520> it<00:03:50.840> yeah<00:03:51.840> i<00:03:51.870> would

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
consider getting it yeah i would

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.720 
consider getting it yeah i would
definitely<00:03:52.500> get<00:03:52.740> it<00:03:52.830> if<00:03:52.950> i<00:03:53.070> had<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.370> second<00:03:53.640> or

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
definitely get it if i had the second or

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.970 
definitely get it if i had the second or
third<00:03:53.760> generation<00:03:54.380> because<00:03:55.380> those<00:03:55.650> devices

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
third generation because those devices

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.270 
third generation because those devices
will<00:03:56.370> not<00:03:56.520> be<00:03:56.670> getting<00:03:56.790> iOS<00:03:57.060> 5<00:03:58.070> 3rd<00:03:59.070> generation
