the<00:01:09.720> defense<00:01:10.720> not<00:01:10.960> the<00:01:11.079> different<00:01:11.439> buildings

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
the defense not the different buildings

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.499 
the defense not the different buildings
but<00:01:11.920> all<00:01:12.219> the<00:01:12.369> other<00:01:12.490> buildings<00:01:12.939> are<00:01:13.030> outside

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
but all the other buildings are outside

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.080 
but all the other buildings are outside
and<00:01:13.749> it's<00:01:14.560> mortars<00:01:14.950> were<00:01:15.100> inside<00:01:15.520> and<00:01:15.700> also

and it's mortars were inside and also

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.700 
and it's mortars were inside and also
because<00:01:16.359> if<00:01:16.569> you<00:01:16.719> can<00:01:16.780> look<00:01:17.170> carefully<00:01:17.560> you

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
because if you can look carefully you

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.889 
because if you can look carefully you
can<00:01:17.740> see<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:18.399> Eagles<00:01:18.939> are<00:01:19.090> angled<00:01:19.569> so<00:01:19.719> I<00:01:19.749> know

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
can see the Eagles are angled so I know

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.760 
can see the Eagles are angled so I know
they<00:01:20.289> arranged<00:01:20.740> to<00:01:21.249> air<00:01:21.460> and<00:01:21.909> ground<00:01:22.119> so<00:01:22.539> their

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
they arranged to air and ground so their

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.160 
they arranged to air and ground so their
radius<00:01:23.770> range<00:01:24.009> wasn't<00:01:24.429> so<00:01:24.579> big<00:01:24.899> so<00:01:25.899> I<00:01:25.929> thought

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
radius range wasn't so big so I thought

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.410 
radius range wasn't so big so I thought
okay<00:01:26.499> I<00:01:26.679> can<00:01:26.889> do<00:01:27.069> this<00:01:27.100> then<00:01:27.520> I<00:01:27.670> revenge<00:01:28.149> him

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
okay I can do this then I revenge him

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.749 
okay I can do this then I revenge him
and<00:01:28.600> this<00:01:29.139> is<00:01:29.289> what<00:01:29.469> happened<00:01:29.859> of<00:01:29.979> course<00:01:30.009> if

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
and this is what happened of course if

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:33.300 
and this is what happened of course if
you're<00:01:31.389> gonna<00:01:31.509> do<00:01:31.780> an<00:01:32.020> attack<00:01:32.560> like<00:01:32.590> this<00:01:32.799> like

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310

done it this is a really not for the

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.669 
done it this is a really not for the
loop<00:01:49.270> so<00:01:49.479> yeah<00:01:49.719> of<00:01:49.840> course<00:01:50.139> it<00:01:50.350> would<00:01:50.499> have

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
loop so yeah of course it would have

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:53.609 
loop so yeah of course it would have
been<00:01:50.859> more<00:01:51.219> would<00:01:51.969> have<00:01:52.179> been<00:01:52.389> nice<00:01:52.749> if<00:01:53.319> you

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.550 
possible because those big boat expose
need<00:04:22.820> to<00:04:22.970> go<00:04:23.150> as<00:04:23.390> soon<00:04:23.930> as<00:04:24.110> possible<00:04:24.530> because

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
but still it isn't the easiest base to

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.000 
but still it isn't the easiest base to
do<00:04:44.180> with<00:04:44.510> those<00:04:44.660> letters<00:04:44.960> that<00:04:45.230> anybody<00:04:45.740> who

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
honestly my in my opinion supercell

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.450 
honestly my in my opinion supercell
needs<00:05:23.480> to<00:05:23.660> slow<00:05:23.990> down<00:05:24.020> a<00:05:24.320> bit<00:05:24.500> and<00:05:24.920> give<00:05:25.280> us

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
needs to slow down a bit and give us

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.670 
needs to slow down a bit and give us
some<00:05:25.490> breathing<00:05:26.270> time<00:05:26.510> so<00:05:27.020> we<00:05:27.200> can<00:05:27.230> catch<00:05:27.650> up

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
some breathing time so we can catch up

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.160 
some breathing time so we can catch up
cuz<00:05:28.130> like<00:05:28.790> this<00:05:29.030> you<00:05:29.210> do<00:05:29.390> it<00:05:29.660> isn't<00:05:30.020> working
