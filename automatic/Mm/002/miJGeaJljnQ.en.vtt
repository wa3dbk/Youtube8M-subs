00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.790
 ah 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.350
 i 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.350
 Y 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.440
 d 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.550
 i 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.110
 for me 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.820
 well here we have a piece of this 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.270
 magnificent Russian composer is a blues in 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.220
 It's very easy to play, you have to 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:15.470
 be careful mainly with the and 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.470
 cheeks let's see the first compass 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:26.170
 the bass we have 2 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.170
 and a melody that makes 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:39.650
 main position standard position of 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:43.330
 major to then move to fa 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.330
 with this blue note here 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:54.930
 we have to put a nut and accentuate 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.930
 the last note of that compass 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.190
 the next compass we have a do in the 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:09.810
 low 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:13.440
 in my world and change to sun 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.800
 and we touch one sun at a time 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.770
 in the number 2 fret and 0 fret to the air 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.950
 on the third string 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.430
 that is, we put the standard position of 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.430
 greater 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.750
 and then we put the 2 7a chord 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.350
 and continue the melody, look at the 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.340
 score that you have to keep the 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:50.400
 notes because we have two voices we have 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.730
 the voice that makes the chords and the voice 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.550
 principal 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.730
 what would do this remember to alternate in this 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:02.120
 hand to the index and middle fingers 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.620
 to return to a seed 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:11.580
 this time placing this the 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.580
 and with the blue note in E flat and the fuck 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.860
 see how these three fingers are 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.860
 pull the rope 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:27.970
 we went to re keeping the capo 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.970
 and we played two and two with the capo 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.320
 and network below is to say 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:49.599
 it repeats but we finish the sun 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:52.830
 and we do it again from what we have 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.830
 seen in the third measure 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.890
 Y 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:03.920
 Y 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:06.250
 we continue as you see if you look at this 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.250
 compass 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:15.220
 that gift or this one this is not what 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:19.280
 we remove we put the 2 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.269
 and we play at the end 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.810
 I repeat 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.810
 i 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:37.710
 then we put the sun and played with him 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.710
 if at the same time look at this hand 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.860
 all right 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.610
 ah 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.080
 ah 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.080
 ah 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.870
 Sun 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:59.050
 net 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:01.470
 about the bass play after capo 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.470
 again 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.510
 Y 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:13.830
 and we played that bass twice to stop 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.830
 nothing 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:20.169
 in me 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.169
 and we do this 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:26.680
 we go up to sun 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.340
 yes 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.340
 3 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:40.110
 to learn this piece the best is 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.110
 that you practice the main voice first 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:57.690
 and then when you have it you put the 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:59.720
 low to kill ta ta ta ta ta ta ta 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.720
 ta 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:30.940
 ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta and 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:33.050
 We go back to the beginning 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:37.100
 that's it if you have any doubt 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:41.890
