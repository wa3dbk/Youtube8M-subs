battery<00:00:46.039> which<00:00:47.039> pops<00:00:47.489> out<00:00:47.760> somehow<00:00:51.559> if<00:00:52.559> I

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
battery which pops out somehow if I

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.180 
battery which pops out somehow if I
remember<00:00:53.219> correctly<00:00:54.210> from<00:00:54.920> my<00:00:55.920> other<00:00:56.129> one

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
remember correctly from my other one

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.849 
remember correctly from my other one
there<00:00:59.190> we<00:00:59.309> go<00:01:00.140> now<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.440> either<00:01:01.590> leave

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
there we go now you can either leave

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.840 
there we go now you can either leave
that<00:01:02.100> out<00:01:02.309> or<00:01:03.090> put<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.539> back<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:04.640> think<00:01:05.640> I'm

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
that out or put it back in I think I'm

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.760 
that out or put it back in I think I'm
going<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.210> put<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.479> back<00:01:06.659> in

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.370 

quite<00:01:11.770> a<00:01:11.800> tight<00:01:12.100> fit<00:01:12.460> for<00:01:12.790> the<00:01:13.480> battery<00:01:13.780> there

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
quite a tight fit for the battery there

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:26.950 
quite a tight fit for the battery there
we<00:01:14.530> go<00:01:16.410> start<00:01:17.410> it<00:01:17.530> up<00:01:18.750> run<00:01:19.750> well<00:01:21.630> 2/3

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.640 

it's<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:27.710> first<00:01:27.950> time<00:01:28.220> I've<00:01:28.490> tried<00:01:28.970> it<00:01:29.650> I've

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
it's the first time I've tried it I've

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.910 
it's the first time I've tried it I've
had<00:01:30.890> it<00:01:31.040> sitting<00:01:31.250> inside<00:01:31.460> for<00:01:32.060> quite<00:01:32.480> a<00:01:32.660> while

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.220 

waiting<00:01:36.920> patiently<00:01:37.520> to<00:01:38.000> make<00:01:38.510> a<00:01:38.540> video<00:01:38.900> about

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 
waiting patiently to make a video about

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:53.250 
waiting patiently to make a video about
it<00:01:40.750> up<00:01:41.750> today's<00:01:42.170> a<00:01:42.200> day<00:01:47.800> get<00:01:48.800> it<00:01:48.830> back<00:01:49.070> together

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.370 

there<00:01:54.260> we<00:01:54.380> go<00:01:55.300> that<00:01:56.300> holds<00:01:56.690> it<00:01:56.780> in<00:01:56.869> nice<00:01:57.140> and

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
there we go that holds it in nice and

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.499 
there we go that holds it in nice and
tight<00:01:57.440> so<00:01:58.160> there's<00:01:58.460> no<00:01:58.640> chance<00:01:58.880> of<00:01:59.090> a<00:01:59.210> flying

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
tight so there's no chance of a flying

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.150 
tight so there's no chance of a flying
out<00:02:00.009> there's<00:02:01.009> quite<00:02:01.220> a<00:02:01.250> heavyweight<00:02:01.610> in<00:02:02.030> here

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
out there's quite a heavyweight in here

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.880 
out there's quite a heavyweight in here
at<00:02:04.160> the<00:02:04.310> top<00:02:04.550> I<00:02:05.200> suppose<00:02:06.200> if<00:02:06.380> I<00:02:06.530> remove<00:02:06.860> that

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
at the top I suppose if I remove that

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:14.260 
at the top I suppose if I remove that
weight<00:02:07.280> it<00:02:07.970> could<00:02:08.149> be<00:02:08.300> run<00:02:08.479> on<00:02:08.660> a<00:02:08.750> sea<00:02:09.020> size<00:02:13.270> but

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
weight it could be run on a sea size but

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.229 
weight it could be run on a sea size but
I'm<00:02:14.480> not<00:02:14.630> sure<00:02:14.930> because<00:02:15.140> it's<00:02:15.560> quite<00:02:15.890> narrow

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
I'm not sure because it's quite narrow

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.300 
I'm not sure because it's quite narrow
with<00:02:17.239> these<00:02:17.420> two<00:02:17.690> pins<00:02:18.140> on<00:02:18.560> there<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.190> one

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
with these two pins on there and one

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:28.090 
with these two pins on there and one
there<00:02:19.340> so<00:02:20.590> probably<00:02:21.590> not<00:02:26.590> pull<00:02:27.590> hop<00:02:27.800> today

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
there so probably not pull hop today

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:45.990 
there so probably not pull hop today
again<00:02:30.730> in<00:02:31.730> Melbourne<00:02:34.540> go<00:02:35.540> back<00:02:35.720> together

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.509 

the<00:02:47.000> fastest<00:02:47.629> train<00:02:47.900> in<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.200> world<00:02:48.349> I<00:02:51.519> believe

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
the fastest train in the world I believe

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.830 
the fastest train in the world I believe
it<00:02:53.030> went<00:02:53.209> over<00:02:53.390> 500<00:02:54.200> kilometers<00:02:54.650> an<00:02:54.769> hour

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
it went over 500 kilometers an hour

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.280 
it went over 500 kilometers an hour
which<00:02:56.840> is<00:02:56.870> just<00:02:57.290> insane

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.880 

hopefully<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.470> model<00:03:04.780> can<00:03:05.780> be<00:03:05.810> quite<00:03:06.230> fast<00:03:06.560> as

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
hopefully the model can be quite fast as

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.990 
hopefully the model can be quite fast as
well<00:03:08.260> so<00:03:09.260> let's<00:03:09.560> go<00:03:09.739> ahead<00:03:09.890> and<00:03:10.280> give<00:03:10.760> it<00:03:10.790> its

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
well so let's go ahead and give it its

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.910 
well so let's go ahead and give it its
first<00:03:11.180> run

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
first run

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.280 
first run
okay<00:03:12.920> so<00:03:12.980> battery<00:03:13.579> fitted<00:03:13.970> and<00:03:14.150> off<00:03:14.959> we<00:03:15.260> go

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
okay so battery fitted and off we go

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:35.069 
okay so battery fitted and off we go
first<00:03:15.739> run<00:03:16.010> TGV<00:03:16.760> mark<00:03:17.030> 2

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:39.160 

and<00:03:36.079> mix<00:03:36.469> it<00:03:36.650> up<00:03:36.739> without<00:03:37.219> a<00:03:37.280> gt3<00:03:37.909> mop<00:03:38.510> on<00:03:38.780> a<00:03:38.989> new

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
and mix it up without a gt3 mop on a new

00:03:39.170 --> 00:04:08.839 
and mix it up without a gt3 mop on a new
project

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.309 

looking<00:04:09.569> fantastic<00:04:09.870> together<00:04:12.019> the<00:04:13.019> orange

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
looking fantastic together the orange

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.410 
looking fantastic together the orange
one<00:04:13.560> does<00:04:13.799> seem<00:04:14.069> to<00:04:14.250> have<00:04:14.400> some<00:04:14.459> flipping

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
one does seem to have some flipping

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.129 
one does seem to have some flipping
problems<00:04:16.970> this<00:04:17.970> one<00:04:18.209> of<00:04:18.329> the<00:04:18.449> gears<00:04:18.690> I'm<00:04:18.989> going

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
problems this one of the gears I'm going

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:25.990 
problems this one of the gears I'm going
to<00:04:19.199> have<00:04:19.320> to<00:04:19.410> give<00:04:19.560> it<00:04:19.650> some<00:04:19.680> attention
