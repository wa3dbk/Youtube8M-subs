00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:10.849
 he feels very happy this 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.849
 but he taught that 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:17.090
 from boys as the needles all 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.470
 opposites 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.470
 nice that is obvious 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:29.820
 to celebrate your style 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.779
 yes yes experiences and they are instructed 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.779
 supporting from scratch 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.790
 goodbye I was by my side very happy 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.989
 of happy with 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.130
 with the commitment that contributes to the team as 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.670
 when he enters the court 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:01:00.690
 between nervous but I feel that the 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.690
 first 23 balls that is the confidence 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.730
 means this 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.280
 exactly if you keep following 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.430
 working because this habit has not been 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.800
 achieved nothing 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.100
 if it was already arrived that was the objective of 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.409
 vote but 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.740
 and as long as you're writing and 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.740
 growing 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.870
 this 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.700
 So far we have not verified it 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.240
 all the companions of all he me 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.240
 they gave their support 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:36.270
 not even working and I am 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.689
 you feel the action 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.579
 in fact I feel very beautiful when 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.040
 they started to say I'm going to that too 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:46.210
 reason 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.880
 When wanting to give a good performance 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.729
 when the time of that trust even 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.750
 in others a goal of the day mean others 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.290
 high points 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.810
 if you 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.280
 I did not think of it in the way of force 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.850
 obviously the objective of the game is 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.650
 put a goal and I turned around and pulled 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.350
 40 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.440
 what they want 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.979
 from here the mara team can not say 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.979
 that hercules gÃ³mez 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.120
 because he is a very good friend when he 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.370
 come to this right 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.900
 then later I went to ask for advice and 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.980
 from the first day that I arrived I 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.930
 I was very much 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.530
 two 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.530
 you are him 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.830
 I can I feel that if this thanks to 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.020
 God right now I am a position in the 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.800
 selection is in the holder and I feel that 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.800
 There is one more variety 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.010
 Thank you 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.450
