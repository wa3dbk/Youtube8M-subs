00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.870
 so is 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.730
 first place we have these plates of 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.059
 low confirmed that as you see puts 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:19.480
 vÃ­ctor reyes no 4 of 20 1913 that is the 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.550
 date of birth of Victor 31 and the 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.930
 blood group that is unknown this 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.250
 it also happens with the red badges 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.250
 as you can see here 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:37.310
 this is the house of woods the look so 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.410
 2025 as you see 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.270
 and on the other side we have the house of 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:47.650
 meche that are in this little hand and I do not 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.650
 like it so much that it has a stone 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.019
 in the second vision of the campaign if 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.780
 we go to the left nothing more 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:02.989
 landing of the flying suit we see this 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.250
 small cave and if we get in we see the 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.860
 hammer towers 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.120
 now I will teach you better the truth is 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.120
 that is very school to the cave and not 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.500
 can see well but there we see it 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.229
 truth is that this map is full of 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:21.020
 rays and it's like the rays that advanced 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.020
 you know and there you see it perfectly 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.790
 and I emphasize it a little 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.729
 during the introduction of the game the 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.670
 first mission of the campaign we can see 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.460
 this video and we found a channel 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.520
 youtube if this here this exists 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.390
 really and has a 5 second video 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.390
 and the subscribers and 2 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.759
 we are in the multiplayer and we can see 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.460
 this map and if we climb up here we see 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.560
 the workplace of homer with his 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.570
 donuts and with the pink frosting and all 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.920
 we also see that they have their 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.450
 reports that do not use the helmet and then the 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.819
 control panel that you should use and not 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:14.209
 they use 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.209
 as you can see it is indestructible but they are
