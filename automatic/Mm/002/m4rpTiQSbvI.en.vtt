00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
being a screw-on if I may say fun is

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.880 
being a screw-on if I may say fun is
learning<00:01:58.240> new<00:01:58.360> skills<00:01:58.560> trying<00:01:59.560> to<00:01:59.650> go<00:01:59.740> as<00:01:59.860> fast

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
learning new skills trying to go as fast

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.859 
learning new skills trying to go as fast
as<00:02:00.250> you<00:02:00.340> can<00:02:00.490> because<00:02:00.729> you<00:02:00.910> are<00:02:01.150> a<00:02:01.180> racer<00:02:01.570> and

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
as you can because you are a racer and

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.290 
as you can because you are a racer and
and<00:02:02.650> then<00:02:02.800> doing<00:02:03.009> well<00:02:03.250> from<00:02:03.759> a<00:02:03.850> psychological

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
and then doing well from a psychological

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.510 
and then doing well from a psychological
standpoint<00:02:04.869> I<00:02:05.470> guess<00:02:05.860> we<00:02:06.040> ask<00:02:06.220> them<00:02:06.369> their

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
standpoint I guess we ask them their

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.830 
standpoint I guess we ask them their
values<00:02:06.910> what<00:02:07.150> are<00:02:07.240> their<00:02:07.360> values<00:02:07.390> in<00:02:07.810> life

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
values what are their values in life

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.749

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
whether their values and skiing as soon

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.970 
whether their values and skiing as soon
as<00:02:09.820> we<00:02:09.970> know<00:02:10.119> their<00:02:10.330> values<00:02:10.750> then<00:02:11.440> we<00:02:11.620> can<00:02:11.800> help

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
as we know their values then we can help

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.250 
as we know their values then we can help
them<00:02:12.250> do<00:02:12.490> anything<00:02:12.940> that<00:02:13.120> they<00:02:13.150> want<00:02:13.420> right
