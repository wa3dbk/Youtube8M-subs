situation and the first test is to test

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:50.549 
situation and the first test is to test
that<00:00:47.199> what<00:00:48.070> is<00:00:48.280> this<00:00:48.690> alternators<00:00:49.690> here

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
that what is this alternators here

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.169 
that what is this alternators here
bearing<00:00:51.370> situation<00:00:52.300> and<00:00:52.510> it's<00:00:53.019> easy<00:00:53.409> to<00:00:53.859> do<00:00:54.850> so

00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:55.179 
bearing situation and it's easy to do so

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:58.439 
bearing situation and it's easy to do so
that<00:00:55.420> you'll<00:00:55.569> rotate<00:00:55.809> this<00:00:56.339> alternator<00:00:57.449> feel

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449

you<00:01:11.650> can<00:01:11.890> also<00:01:12.130> take<00:01:13.090> this<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:14.549> excel<00:01:15.549> and

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
you can also take this this excel and

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.450 
you can also take this this excel and
and<00:01:15.969> move<00:01:16.540> this<00:01:16.869> in<00:01:17.079> this<00:01:17.380> side<00:01:17.619> and<00:01:17.890> it<00:01:18.009> you

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
and move this in this side and it you

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.880 
and move this in this side and it you
don't<00:01:18.990> feel<00:01:19.990> any<00:01:20.290> club<00:01:20.649> or<00:01:21.090> holes<00:01:22.090> or<00:01:22.890> clunk

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.490 
dancers alternator idea is quite similar
Spencer<00:03:59.519> is<00:03:59.640> made<00:03:59.880> in<00:04:00.060> Japan<00:04:00.800> and<00:04:01.800> fourth<00:04:02.220> is

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
Spencer is made in Japan and fourth is

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:12.910 
Spencer is made in Japan and fourth is
German<00:04:04.500> German<00:04:05.310> front<00:04:09.500> now<00:04:10.500> I<00:04:10.940> believe<00:04:11.940> that

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
German German front now I believe that

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:19.940 
German German front now I believe that
this<00:04:15.560> screws<00:04:16.560> okay<00:04:17.720> and<00:04:18.720> now<00:04:18.959> we<00:04:19.410> can<00:04:19.650> take

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
this screws okay and now we can take

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.730 
this screws okay and now we can take
this<00:04:20.190> coil<00:04:20.549> part<00:04:20.940> away<00:04:21.299> and<00:04:22.079> here<00:04:22.290> is<00:04:22.500> this

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
this coil part away and here is this

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.840 
this coil part away and here is this
coils<00:04:23.220> and<00:04:23.900> what<00:04:24.900> you<00:04:25.229> need<00:04:25.800> to<00:04:25.860> check<00:04:26.280> that

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
coils and what you need to check that

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.680 
coils and what you need to check that
there<00:04:27.120> is<00:04:27.290> enough<00:04:28.290> this<00:04:28.590> amount<00:04:29.100> and<00:04:29.419> you<00:04:30.419> can

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
there is enough this amount and you can

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.520 
there is enough this amount and you can
move<00:04:30.930> those<00:04:31.350> in<00:04:31.830> here<00:04:32.700> I<00:04:32.940> think<00:04:33.870> that<00:04:34.080> this<00:04:34.260> the

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
move those in here I think that this the

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.150 
move those in here I think that this the
second<00:04:35.520> one<00:04:35.729> is<00:04:35.970> little<00:04:36.240> bit<00:04:36.600> the<00:04:36.720> shorter<00:04:37.169> and

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
second one is little bit the shorter and

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.740 
second one is little bit the shorter and
they<00:04:38.520> I<00:04:38.820> think<00:04:39.270> that<00:04:39.450> these<00:04:40.440> coils<00:04:40.830> are<00:04:41.750> quite

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
they I think that these coils are quite

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.120 
they I think that these coils are quite
soon<00:04:43.350> to<00:04:43.830> end<00:04:44.039> and<00:04:44.940> then<00:04:45.500> interesting<00:04:46.500> part<00:04:46.800> is

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
soon to end and then interesting part is

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.490 
soon to end and then interesting part is
is<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.640> check<00:04:47.910> that<00:04:48.180> that<00:04:48.840> what<00:04:49.050> is<00:04:49.289> this

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
is the check that that what is this

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.940 
is the check that that what is this
coils<00:04:50.360> course<00:04:51.360> this<00:04:51.750> and<00:04:52.080> copper<00:04:52.710> are<00:04:52.890> a

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
coils course this and copper are a

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.730 
coils course this and copper are a
situation<00:04:53.910> and<00:04:54.300> there<00:04:54.810> are<00:04:55.080> two<00:04:55.610> those<00:04:56.610> holes

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
situation and there are two those holes

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.610 
situation and there are two those holes
things<00:04:58.740> when<00:04:59.370> I<00:04:59.460> rotate<00:04:59.940> and<00:05:00.240> and<00:05:00.840> you<00:05:01.080> can<00:05:01.380> see

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
things when I rotate and and you can see

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.659 
things when I rotate and and you can see
that<00:05:01.860> there<00:05:02.130> are<00:05:02.160> some<00:05:02.669> holes<00:05:03.630> in<00:05:04.169> those

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
that there are some holes in those

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.840 
that there are some holes in those
copper<00:05:05.669> RS<00:05:06.090> and<00:05:06.450> it's<00:05:06.630> it's<00:05:07.200> bad<00:05:07.850> signal

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
copper RS and it's it's bad signal

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.940 
copper RS and it's it's bad signal
because<00:05:09.240> normally<00:05:09.720> those<00:05:11.840> copper<00:05:12.840> RS<00:05:13.320> must<00:05:13.680> be

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
because normally those copper RS must be

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.510 
because normally those copper RS must be
in<00:05:14.220> in<00:05:14.970> solid<00:05:15.510> that<00:05:15.900> there<00:05:16.140> is<00:05:16.260> no<00:05:16.500> any<00:05:16.770> holes

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
in in solid that there is no any holes

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.590 
in in solid that there is no any holes
and<00:05:17.880> I<00:05:18.690> think<00:05:18.990> that<00:05:19.169> this<00:05:19.320> alternator<00:05:19.950> is<00:05:20.310> not

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
and I think that this alternator is not

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.850 
and I think that this alternator is not
not<00:05:21.600> totally<00:05:22.260> and<00:05:22.410> but<00:05:22.800> it<00:05:23.789> is<00:05:24.030> not<00:05:24.240> very<00:05:24.860> cool

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
not totally and but it is not very cool

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.969 
not totally and but it is not very cool
constant<00:05:26.580> because<00:05:26.850> in<00:05:27.330> that<00:05:27.570> area<00:05:27.990> there<00:05:28.710> can

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
constant because in that area there can

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:33.050 
constant because in that area there can
happen<00:05:29.630> some<00:05:30.630> some<00:05:31.169> errors<00:05:31.650> and<00:05:31.950> you<00:05:32.580> can<00:05:32.850> of

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
happen some some errors and you can of

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.830 
happen some some errors and you can of
course<00:05:33.320> try<00:05:34.320> to<00:05:34.440> fix<00:05:34.919> those<00:05:35.310> you<00:05:36.030> if<00:05:36.419> you<00:05:36.600> have

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
course try to fix those you if you have

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.060 
course try to fix those you if you have
the<00:05:37.440> public<00:05:37.770> tools<00:05:38.100> you<00:05:38.880> can<00:05:39.180> polish<00:05:40.110> those<00:05:40.740> in

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
the public tools you can polish those in

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.190 
the public tools you can polish those in
same<00:05:41.370> level<00:05:41.789> you<00:05:42.000> need<00:05:42.390> to<00:05:42.450> of<00:05:42.690> course<00:05:42.990> a

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200 
same level you need to of course a

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.330 
same level you need to of course a
little<00:05:43.800> bit<00:05:43.950> more<00:05:44.220> this<00:05:44.669> awesome

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
little bit more this awesome

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.840 
little bit more this awesome
this<00:05:46.139> alternator<00:05:47.139> but<00:05:47.530> this<00:05:47.740> is<00:05:47.860> quick<00:05:48.490> check

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:48.850 
this alternator but this is quick check

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:52.560 
this alternator but this is quick check
and<00:05:49.000> and<00:05:49.780> in<00:05:50.080> these<00:05:50.550> cold<00:05:51.550> basements

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
and and in these cold basements

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:59.730 
and and in these cold basements
you<00:05:52.780> can<00:05:53.050> also<00:05:54.690> good<00:05:55.690> change<00:05:57.840> okay<00:05:58.870> but<00:05:59.380> in<00:05:59.560> in

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
you can also good change okay but in in

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.189 
you can also good change okay but in in
here<00:06:00.070> if<00:06:00.520> you<00:06:00.760> notice<00:06:01.180> that<00:06:01.210> here<00:06:01.570> is<00:06:01.720> no<00:06:01.930> any

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:02.199 
here if you notice that here is no any

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:08.990 
here if you notice that here is no any
coils<00:06:02.740> and<00:06:02.979> I<00:06:03.850> know<00:06:04.180> any<00:06:04.570> that<00:06:05.530> kind<00:06:05.860> of<00:06:06.479> this

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
coils and I know any that kind of this

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.980 
coils and I know any that kind of this
police<00:06:10.000> area<00:06:10.419> then<00:06:10.840> your<00:06:11.350> coils<00:06:12.280> are<00:06:12.990> totally

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
police area then your coils are totally

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.670 
police area then your coils are totally
and<00:06:14.520> but<00:06:15.520> in<00:06:15.669> here<00:06:15.910> this<00:06:16.270> alternator<00:06:17.080> is<00:06:17.350> still

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
and but in here this alternator is still

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.520 
and but in here this alternator is still
workable<00:06:18.520> and<00:06:19.000> we<00:06:19.270> can<00:06:20.250> we<00:06:21.250> can<00:06:22.290> awesome<00:06:23.290> pull

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
workable and we can we can awesome pull

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.300 
workable and we can we can awesome pull
this<00:06:24.040> back<00:06:24.490> and<00:06:24.760> and<00:06:25.360> use<00:06:25.840> that<00:06:26.229> so<00:06:26.710> long<00:06:26.979> then

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
this back and and use that so long then

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:33.300 
this back and and use that so long then
here<00:06:28.030> is<00:06:28.210> this<00:06:28.419> coil<00:06:29.820> net<00:06:30.820> and<00:06:31.260> and<00:06:32.260> also<00:06:32.680> in

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
here is this coil net and and also in

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.760 
here is this coil net and and also in
various<00:06:33.790> there<00:06:34.330> is<00:06:34.479> disc<00:06:34.690> copper<00:06:35.350> left

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:35.770 
various there is disc copper left

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.690 
various there is disc copper left
it's<00:06:36.669> normally<00:06:37.240> it<00:06:37.750> is<00:06:37.960> copper<00:06:38.410> or<00:06:38.650> at<00:06:39.400> least

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:39.700 
it's normally it is copper or at least

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.120 
it's normally it is copper or at least
firstly<00:06:40.240> this<00:06:40.389> coil<00:06:40.930> ends<00:06:41.260> and<00:06:41.680> you<00:06:41.770> need<00:06:42.010> to

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.130 
firstly this coil ends and you need to

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.909 
firstly this coil ends and you need to
chase<00:06:42.370> and<00:06:43.090> sometimes<00:06:43.690> there<00:06:44.410> are<00:06:44.650> those

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:44.919 
chase and sometimes there are those

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:48.600 
chase and sometimes there are those
bearings<00:06:45.750> problem<00:06:46.750> that<00:06:46.990> this<00:06:47.169> this<00:06:48.100> is<00:06:48.370> very

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:48.610 
bearings problem that this this is very

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.409 
bearings problem that this this is very
noisy<00:06:48.850> and<00:06:49.240> flat<00:06:49.660> clumsy<00:06:50.700> okay<00:06:51.700> and<00:06:52.000> then<00:06:52.240> we

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:52.419 
noisy and flat clumsy okay and then we

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:55.320 
noisy and flat clumsy okay and then we
we<00:06:52.780> a<00:06:52.960> simple<00:06:53.380> tip<00:06:53.560> these<00:06:54.010> things<00:06:54.340> and<00:06:54.669> this

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:55.330 
we a simple tip these things and this

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:00.540 
we a simple tip these things and this
was<00:06:55.570> alternator<00:06:56.320> Jack<00:06:57.100> and<00:06:58.860> and<00:06:59.860> this<00:07:00.370> was

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:00.550 
was alternator Jack and and this was
