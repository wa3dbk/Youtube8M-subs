XP<00:02:48.079> the<00:02:49.079> next<00:02:49.350> step<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:49.799> to<00:02:50.250> crack<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:51.329> hash

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
XP the next step is to crack the hash

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
XP the next step is to crack the hash
file<00:02:52.739> using<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.730> John<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.269> Ripper<00:02:54.390> tool<00:02:55.340> the

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.240 
file using the John the Ripper tool the
first<00:02:56.610> step<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.150> cracking<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:58.290> hash<00:02:58.590> file<00:02:58.920> is

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
first step to cracking the hash file is

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.150 
first step to cracking the hash file is
to<00:02:59.760> move<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.269> newly<00:03:01.019> dumped<00:03:01.350> file<00:03:01.560> from<00:03:02.100> the

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
to move the newly dumped file from the

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.729 
to move the newly dumped file from the
FG<00:03:02.610> dump<00:03:02.850> folder<00:03:03.269> to<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:03.900> John<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.620> Ripper

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.220 
FG dump folder to the John the Ripper
folder<00:03:05.280> you'll<00:03:06.150> do<00:03:06.299> this<00:03:06.480> by<00:03:06.690> using<00:03:06.989> your

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
you copy it you move to another folder

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.490 
you copy it you move to another folder
open<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:23.730> John<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.060> Ripper<00:03:24.209> folder<00:03:24.750> open<00:03:25.410> the

and yes you want to replace the existing
file<00:03:34.150> if<00:03:34.390> one<00:03:34.630> exists<00:03:39.390> okay<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.570> last<00:03:40.750> step<00:03:41.140> is

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
file if one exists okay the last step is

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.420 
file if one exists okay the last step is

to move to the John the Ripper folder

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.070 
to move to the John the Ripper folder
you<00:03:45.910> need<00:03:46.090> to<00:03:46.180> do<00:03:46.270> this<00:03:46.390> by<00:03:46.570> doing<00:03:46.720> change

you need to do this by doing change

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.550 
you need to do this by doing change
directory<00:03:47.560> dot<00:03:47.860> dot<00:03:48.160> which<00:03:49.090> makes<00:03:49.360> you<00:03:49.600> move
