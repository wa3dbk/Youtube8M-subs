00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.660
 however there is no one we do not 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.920
 we need to know how to need sns 300 if 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.530
 used the peak in guajará in English 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.200
 for advice on overthrowing the 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.940
 English is not a written language that 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.770
 they do not work here so let's go 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:56.010
 start by download store will be 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.300
 This is okay, I 'll start doing it. 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.230
 download 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.680
 I already have in mine and do not want to do the 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.119
 download or if it occurs we will give a 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.460
 so match 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.880
 but before that, let's make a 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:16.650
 thing just by the belt not certain programs 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:20.340
 1 is not imposed to have virus or give 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.970
 something for all this just here we 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:32.579
 we should create a history puts client 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:35.460
 write sims 3 and now you will create a 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.829
 stock very easy to say something 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.390
 we can simply 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:45.270
 fine the computer 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:48.990
 by the time he is now on top of 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.130
 always allow the computer to work 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.990
 state 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.250
 it's as if we had to go back in time 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.500
 even a normal thing and obviously 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.680
