00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
wrong now this right is artificial arm

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:58.039 
wrong now this right is artificial arm
yeah<00:00:54.269> it's<00:00:54.539> kind<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.750> like<00:00:55.640> just<00:00:56.839> has<00:00:57.839> more

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:58.049 
yeah it's kind of like just has more

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:01.490 
yeah it's kind of like just has more
protein<00:00:58.469> or<00:00:59.369> fat<00:00:59.930> they're<00:01:00.930> just<00:01:01.140> better

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
protein or fat they're just better

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.329

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
your I think it's probably been

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.880 
your I think it's probably been
equivalent<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:08.479> live<00:01:09.479> food<00:01:09.750> or<00:01:09.960> if<00:01:10.200> not<00:01:10.470> yet

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
equivalent to live food or if not yet

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.149 
equivalent to live food or if not yet
better<00:01:11.159> if<00:01:11.369> they<00:01:11.520> like<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.759> try<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.539> eat<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:13.159> and

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
better if they like it try to eat it and

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.430 
better if they like it try to eat it and
basically<00:01:14.429> how<00:01:14.940> I<00:01:14.970> get<00:01:15.240> my<00:01:15.569> fries<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.200> start

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
basically how I get my fries to start

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.609 
basically how I get my fries to start
eating<00:01:17.030> or<00:01:18.030> just<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.299> train<00:01:18.539> on<00:01:18.569> food<00:01:18.960> live<00:01:19.590> food

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
eating or just a train on food live food

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.050 
eating or just a train on food live food
instead<00:01:20.069> of<00:01:20.330> BBS<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:22.490> put<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.580> on<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.700> plate

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
instead of BBS is I put it on a plate

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.010 
instead of BBS is I put it on a plate
first<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:25.170> then<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.619> sprinkle<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.429> all<00:01:27.020> over

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
first and then I sprinkle it all over

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.889 
first and then I sprinkle it all over
the<00:01:28.740> surface<00:01:28.950> covering<00:01:29.789> all<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.179> surface<00:01:30.630> and

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
the surface covering all the surface and

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:33.559 
the surface covering all the surface and
it's<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.319> lot<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.560> food<00:01:31.770> but<00:01:32.179> the<00:01:33.179> first<00:01:33.420> couple

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
it's a lot of food but the first couple

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:36.050 
it's a lot of food but the first couple
of<00:01:33.750> two<00:01:34.049> feedings<00:01:34.490> you're<00:01:35.490> gonna<00:01:35.610> have<00:01:35.819> to<00:01:35.940> do

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
of two feedings you're gonna have to do

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.359 
of two feedings you're gonna have to do
that<00:01:36.270> just<00:01:36.330> to<00:01:36.690> train<00:01:36.959> them<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.830> make<00:01:38.250> sure

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
that just to train them to make sure

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.990 
that just to train them to make sure
that<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.610> cover<00:01:38.819> all<00:01:39.479> surface<00:01:40.350> area<00:01:41.000> then

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
that you cover all surface area then

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.910 
that you cover all surface area then
after<00:01:42.209> that<00:01:42.390> they'll<00:01:43.140> always<00:01:43.409> go<00:01:43.679> up<00:01:43.709> to<00:01:43.830> the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
after that they'll always go up to the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.789 
after that they'll always go up to the
surface<00:01:44.280> for<00:01:44.430> air<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:45.030> if<00:01:45.899> they're<00:01:46.079> live<00:01:46.350> not

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
surface for air so if they're live not

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.060 
surface for air so if they're live not
breathing<00:01:47.219> they're<00:01:47.789> gonna<00:01:47.880> go<00:01:48.060> up<00:01:48.090> and

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
breathing they're gonna go up and

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.050 
breathing they're gonna go up and
eventually<00:01:50.070> they'll<00:01:50.250> get<00:01:50.430> some<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.729> and

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
eventually they'll get some of that and

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.920 
eventually they'll get some of that and
Multan<00:01:51.390> don't<00:01:51.570> like<00:01:51.719> it<00:01:51.930> no<00:01:52.200> we'll<00:01:53.189> start<00:01:53.430> to

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
Multan don't like it no we'll start to

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.560 
Multan don't like it no we'll start to

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
just to train to eat that

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.930
