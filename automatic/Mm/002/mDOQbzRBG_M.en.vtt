00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.470
 messi is he definitely the best 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.819
 player of all time is waiting for you at 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.440
 32 let it start 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.700
 what do you think of two messi 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.219
 beats there we are under the influence of emotion 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.200
 of yesterday we want to answer yes and this 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.480
 that he does is amazing not just 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.800
 yesterday for so many seasons he 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.039
 missing a little thing no it is missing 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.519
 the national team he misses that messi 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.080
 led his team by being the leader 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.340
 up to a victory and even be it 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.289
 the leader of the argentine team this 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.760
 that he has never really been so that's 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.590
 the only small shadow on the board 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.820
 otherwise as a club player it's 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.360
 maybe the biggest club player 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.110
 Of the history 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.440
 and you johnny it's always 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.180
 difficult to compare messi with the 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.980
 great elders who were in the 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.270
 soccer 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.969
 personally I chose for example 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.890
 if they play who I 'm going to play or who 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.489
 I played that is to say maradona 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:57.090
 zidane platini ronaldo ronaldinho and 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.160
 zico are the scissors that I knew that 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.539
 I never could get to their 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.190
 level 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.390
 all stay they have characteristics 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.330
 who messi 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.710
 ah if you j if all chose the six but 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.659
 if he does everything before 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.540
 that is the ball-foot technique 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.869
 the elegance class is 10.6 yves 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.610
 but to say that it is outdated for 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.250
 is for me the east coast for the time 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.920
 she was world champion 58 and 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.210
 had it season he won 1.62 after 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.880
 even though he did not play much he was 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.130
 injured 70 at the end of the career was 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.170
 very decisive man donkey three small 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.430
 world champions over ten thousand 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.909
 goals well what was it another 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.130
 time 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.229
 I have eleven by whom I could consider 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.329
 that he passed pollet but I'm sure 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.159
 that is beside the Pelley is 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.350
 devoured other than I said he's in 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.810
 this dynasty he is in this line 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.430
 of these big ones because we put we can 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.170
 not be insensitive when you see game 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.360
 but if we can be admirers we 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.829
 can that dock but we can only 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.390
 ask what Tunisian bigger than 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.470
 every time you read it I say yes because 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.759
 that he does extraordinary things 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:02.130
 he's in a year in a show where 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.219
 it starts where we do not see it and then 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.320
 all of a sudden he'll take her out 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.640
 it's what he has in him ie 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.470
 something that makes others 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.370
 do not have something that makes 5h a 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.870
 little flat it is evolving at a 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.060
 oc where the great artists are more 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.110
 protected than at the time when you see it 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.569
 the police images that could 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.549
 pick up in an honest platini husband 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.049
 so gives the artists can a little 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.940
 more express myself so I find that there 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.269
 had a little more merit but at 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.409
 marne honor for the other side she is 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.690
 just for the other side it's true 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:33.420
 that they're a pop sound protect us 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.829
 but the Hungarian tanks reacted 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.890
 birthdays are beefier they 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.700
 are more an x is addict must reacted 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.799
 much faster 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.879
 yes so it's always difficult to 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.160
 compare times 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.410
 that there I can tell you one thing it 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.900
 is that it's been 4 5 years 6 years the 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.660
 golden balloons he takes them one by one they 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.569
 dominate he he eliminates he is he is 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.329
 easy and fast for the dead abutments 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.099
 stats stats at bus level ago 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:03.280
 there's no photo that we all agree 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.510
 I have 77 goals in the Champions League 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.739
 there is no picture but actually there 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.299
 it's equality on a lack 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.319
 he is obliged because all the others 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.879
 great players that we quoted for 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.530
 the moment they were able to 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:13.720
 transform an average team is from the 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.389
 save time at a time 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.840
 inevitably water regularly johnny 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:18.970
 still 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.639
 and that's not it's not 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.859
 really a small selection what a 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:25.389
 World Cup you come 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:27.940
 today it's different early 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:29.859
 a moment that you are so tired you 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.840
 prepared not just for the cup of 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:33.549
 world before you could prepare yourself 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.919
 just for the world cup it's 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.810
 true that they give it is the one who has 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:38.489
 given the title but last in large 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.329
 final 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.370
 maybe who if they do not mark the 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:45.160
 two goals that spoke not so much so so 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.690
 for me esteem so does the wii fit 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.760
 side of the champions league matches the 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.389
 final ladies he chained the 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.940
 performances 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:54.430
 is not another day that I saw a pack 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.810
 which is better than the policy erice 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.150
 not what you think when you take 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.760
 a messi selection is true 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.720
 wait for it we wait impatiently but 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.879
 obviously it's true that when he 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.510
 was playing at the barca he's playing in a 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:08.859
 collective in which he 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.120
 knows they perfectly 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:11.949
 know perfectly well and I have 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.549
 the impression when you quote me peeled 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:17.620
 zidane cruijff all and maradona 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:20.079
 they have always been in his selections 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.549
 hyper well the isolated company they are 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.990
 past he was in the good 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.720
 generations in the fighting years 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.830
 barefoot 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.720
 judgment is something a little 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.130
 unfair too to say but if messi messi 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.040
 because he marked the end why 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.780
 because barÃ§a used to bayer us and 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.860
 it's a match of such intensity that 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.090
 it's no coincidence that this is the last 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.800
 quarter of an hour that does not switch 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.360
 so it's not but if all alone even if 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.980
 they are exploits they benefit 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.600
 collective work but if another 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.870
 problem as well judged that Eric is going to be 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.310
 sensitive to this argument is messi we have 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.750
 the impression of a flat encephalogram 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.150
 that is, there is no roughness 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.780
 but if it's not a championship cari 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.370
 because so expensive materials with 200 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.840
 players in the story of the blow that's going me 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:02.420
 also miss him yes I think even 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.400
 if the bayer of course iso teoz is at the 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.140
 time not and turned a little balloon 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.690
 for me the match up to first goal the 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.040
 had discarded galls the bayer did 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:14.330
 a good match for me until the first 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:16.280
 goal but scoring the first goal that's 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.960
 not much is not easy that goal 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.150
 we think it's easy because we 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.550
 is used to watching he puts the 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.110
 ball just to the place that the keeper 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.610
 to be able to touch him one is 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:30.470
 completely we had been countered 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.370
 sigean a quick and 2003 yeah that's 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.780
 not his good foot 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.669
 yeah but in the second he does everything 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.470
 he has a way in the gestures in the 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.700
 technique in sedition ruiz in the 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.960
 united nations that I had the opportunity 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.979
 when I was betis coach 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.080
 to go to barcelona 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:43.340
 I put a right-handed man because he is 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.080
 in this last him how can we 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.930
 stop but if you luis has led you 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.360
 against him what he said to see the 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.470
 wake up game you can put any 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.750
 which system in place 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.380
 it's impossible to stop why 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.310
 because he's smart he's smart 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.190
 he knows how to move 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.960
 he knows how to flee the mark he knows 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.910
 help his partners exactly he 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.250
 happens to be in teeth in 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.470
 positions in islands happens 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.300
 always to surprise those waters where we 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.520
 do not expect him he is capable at the moment 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.500
 where he gets there he has a length 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.910
 advanced was not very talkative about this 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.320
 what did jean louis say me you i hear 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.050
 Cruijff has one will immediately 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.400
 I hear peeled there is an aura I hear 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.110
 even maradona boat a character 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.280
 amazing tempting but if you are 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:30.350
 admiring of what he does but you do 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:31.640
 you want to spend a day with 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.240
 but otherwise, but it's a joke 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.440
 just now said 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.090
 beautiful had the choice between 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.160
 meetings and neymar or touched ten thousand 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.599
 dollars she took naÃ¯ma they offered me 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.099
 to meet but if I do not know I 

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:42.090
 I'm not sure it's not a guy I have 

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:44.539
 really want to hang out is because 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:46.650
 that he's shy he's reserved I know 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:48.300
 he thinks that only one thing I 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.440
 think what he does to him what he 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.099
 love it's the game it's football 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.419
 it's getting together 

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:52.860
 that's where he wants to express
