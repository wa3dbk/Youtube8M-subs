well<00:00:31.170> one<00:00:31.500> change<00:00:31.890> that's<00:00:32.160> been<00:00:32.309> happening<00:00:32.579> in

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
well one change that's been happening in

well one change that's been happening in
our<00:00:33.120> world<00:00:33.180> over<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.899> last<00:00:33.930> few<00:00:34.380> years<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.920> the

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
our world over the last few years is the

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.660 
our world over the last few years is the
rise<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.790> 22<00:00:36.300> rimfire<00:00:36.750> competition<00:00:37.530> more<00:00:38.489> and

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
rise of 22 rimfire competition more and

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.639 
rise of 22 rimfire competition more and
more<00:00:38.850> competitions<00:00:39.510> like<00:00:39.570> Ruger<00:00:40.200> rimfire

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
more competitions like Ruger rimfire

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.130 
more competitions like Ruger rimfire
challenge<00:00:41.219> or<00:00:41.670> like<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.360> steel<00:00:42.629> challenge

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
challenge or like the steel challenge

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
challenge or like the steel challenge
with<00:00:43.350> 22s

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
with 22s

with 22s
all<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.030> sudden<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.480> really<00:00:45.930> taking<00:00:46.289> off

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
all of a sudden is really taking off

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.529 
all of a sudden is really taking off
part<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.160> because<00:00:47.309> ammunition<00:00:48.059> got

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
part of that is because ammunition got

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.319 
part of that is because ammunition got
really<00:00:49.200> expensive<00:00:49.649> but<00:00:50.489> part<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.180> was

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
really expensive but part of it was

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.380 
really expensive but part of it was
because<00:00:51.360> ranges<00:00:52.260> themselves<00:00:53.010> changed<00:00:53.640> we're

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
because ranges themselves changed we're

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.590 
because ranges themselves changed we're
used<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.750> big<00:00:55.079> ranges<00:00:55.680> long<00:00:56.370> distance<00:00:57.090> targets

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
used to big ranges long distance targets

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.479 
used to big ranges long distance targets
well<00:00:57.809> it's<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.079> lot<00:00:58.230> harder<00:00:58.590> for<00:00:58.800> us<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.100> find

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
well it's a lot harder for us to find

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.490 
well it's a lot harder for us to find
those<00:00:59.670> in<00:00:59.910> these<00:01:00.000> days<00:01:00.320> typically<00:01:01.320> we're

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
those in these days typically we're

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.399 
those in these days typically we're
finding<00:01:01.890> smaller<00:01:02.370> Bay's<00:01:02.850> shorter<00:01:03.809> distances

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
finding smaller Bay's shorter distances

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.550 
finding smaller Bay's shorter distances
which<00:01:05.040> are<00:01:05.280> perfect<00:01:05.970> for<00:01:06.390> 22<00:01:06.840> rimfire<00:01:07.320> and

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
which are perfect for 22 rimfire and

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.770 
which are perfect for 22 rimfire and
action<00:01:08.340> targets<00:01:08.820> managed<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.299> come<00:01:09.450> out<00:01:09.570> with

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
action targets managed to come out with

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.170 
action targets managed to come out with
a<00:01:09.810> great<00:01:10.290> line<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.950> targets<00:01:11.400> what<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:11.909> like

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
a great line of targets what I like

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.120 
a great line of targets what I like
about<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.630> line<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.020> targets<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.500> it's<00:01:13.680> very

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
about this line of targets is it's very

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.289 
about this line of targets is it's very
very<00:01:14.640> well<00:01:15.090> thought<00:01:15.540> out<00:01:15.799> for<00:01:16.799> example<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.549> 22

want to make it harder take three steps
back<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:56.009> believe<00:01:56.610> if<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.030> only<00:01:57.329> have<00:01:57.600> one

steel target a center mass headshot

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.609 
steel target a center mass headshot
target<00:02:02.070> those<00:02:02.490> are<00:02:02.820> great<00:02:03.299> targets<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.469> we've

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
target those are great targets and we've

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.429 
target those are great targets and we've
all<00:02:04.829> been<00:02:05.009> proponents<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:05.880> steel<00:02:06.119> targets<00:02:06.659> but

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
all been proponents of steel targets but

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.290 
all been proponents of steel targets but
once<00:02:07.710> again<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.190> problem<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.759> heavy<00:02:09.500> awkward

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
once again the problem is heavy awkward

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.140 
once again the problem is heavy awkward
and<00:02:11.420> expensive<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:12.830> line<00:02:13.070> of<00:02:13.340> action<00:02:13.700> targets

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
and expensive the line of action targets

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.890 
and expensive the line of action targets
22<00:02:14.630> targets<00:02:15.110> is<00:02:15.260> neither<00:02:15.530> heavy<00:02:16.520> awkward<00:02:16.970> nor

rimfire shooting and I think we're going
