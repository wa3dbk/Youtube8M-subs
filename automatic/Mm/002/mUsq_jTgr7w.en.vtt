00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:13.350
 [Music] 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.480
 if horse and rider the rods and 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.970
 kavala the exercises in step sovereign 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.910
 mastering the exercises is from the truck 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.529
 nothing more in the way for the exercises in the 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.619
 Trab wants the horse master of the economy 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.480
 kavala thies these consist of one 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.480
 stick it to an outer cross 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.579
 is fixed for trotting and gallop work 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.579
 I strongly recommend rods 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.079
 use that can not roll away 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.210
 somehow we have to speak to the 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.040
 be fixed on the side or just such 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.780
 cavaliers here do not slip 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.750
 then can the horse kick once 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.710
 Unfortunate are the rods 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.130
 roll away and it can become one 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.219
 come overstretching a soul 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.219
 [Music] 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.390
 ok steffi do you do such a thing completely 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.100
 let's just go over this one 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.900
 single cavalli rod 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.700
 the horse has the possibility of something 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.000
 See island it does not get under 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.970
 voltage should be as possible in the 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.260
 stay the same pace 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.240
 the rider is on top 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.480
 responsible for the way and for that 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.660
 pace and even now you stepped completely 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.819
 normal just keep it up 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.819
 [Music] 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.160
 the advantage now of these camels 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.170
 This is also that they are not on the 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.870
 lie bow but already slightly elevated 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.570
 that means the horse must have his 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:40.350
 Raise a little more leg muscles 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.960
 is activated back muscles will be in 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.080
 ideally stretched plug the whole 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.120
 Moving apparatus of the horse as soon as possible 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.220
 horse and rider the single rod 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.290
 can have overcome a clean 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.540
 more rod to be taken 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.210
 the distance in the trot should be there 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.650
 between 1 meter 20 and 1 meter 40 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.060
 lie 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.360
 for the beginning, the rods will open 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.280
 built up a straight line 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.830
 especially the coordination but also 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.570
 Concentration and persistence are added 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.410
 the exercises with several rods 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.410
 promoted 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.110
 [Music] 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.060
 And now Steffis is the ideal distance 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.040
 you can continue to progress 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.870
 this distance synonymous times enlarge if 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.260
 For example, you extend the third 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.090
 want to practice more now you can see 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.770
 already the shingle almost really good on 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.540
 another small step to 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.490
 make and then raise his feet height 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.730
 or even a little further 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.050
 access and then still on 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.400
 Reason for the bars is moderate 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.079
 to pass 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.000
 you realize that driving makes it all good 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.370
 then you do not have 20 yet 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.989
 feel full repetitions because you 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.670
 I would like the attention and the 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.930
 ability to concentrate the finished 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.650
 increase and do not have to 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.650
 unnecessary 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.470
