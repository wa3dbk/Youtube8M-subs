00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.880
 hello we're back 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.400
 in this block we'll know a little 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:20.070
 about entomology the science that studies 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:23.160
 the life of insects check out the entomology 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.369
 is the science that studies insects under 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.119
 all its aspects and relations with the 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.130
 man plants animal and environment 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.110
 a group of researchers from the institute 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.309
 National surveys of the Amazon inpa 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.500
 develop studies in the area of 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.710
 entomology and led by the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.960
 tán alcântara where they conduct research 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.200
 field in insect collection 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.510
 So we go to the field to collect 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.610
 the immature in the water and people 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.670
 collecting adults who are terrestrial have 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.379
 wings to fly in usually and we 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.219
 we have traps or with 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.110
 Entomological nets like the dragonflies 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.240
 jacinta you should know the 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.740
 adults are flying by the river 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.229
 while the larvae are 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.970
 developing into the water then into the 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.000
 our collections we have to do is 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.400
 show both inside and outside the water 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.420
 because the insects that with the wings that 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.060
 it's adults 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.790
 An example of winged insects is 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.790
 dragonflies are insects of 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.530
 medium to large size has movable head 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.659
 short antennas and cetaceans oral feasts 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:38.070
 large compound eye maskers 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:41.729
 lateral and 31 cellos the thorax is robust 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.970
 with two pairs of similar long ahvaz 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.869
 and narrow and with many ribs the 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.619
 abdomen is long and thin cylindrical or 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.619
 flat 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:02.510
 are odonata insects and can be 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.940
 found in rivers and streams and lakes 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.090
 deep water or not always 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.750
 associated with some type of substrate where 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.750
 is housed 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:20.230
 adults spend much of their time 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.970
 flying near the watercourse in the hours 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.670
 hottest day 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.690
 these foods and other insects in the 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.460
 brazil there are 14 families registered 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.880
 distributed in its worst software design 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:37.200
 the meager opera all families occurs 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.200
 in the state of Amazonas 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:47.410
 collecting and preserving insects is a 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.170
 excellent way to learn about it 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:53.260
 the habit is as varied as possible and 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.720
 can be found in several places 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.500
 after collection the collected material 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.630
 go to the laboratory where they are 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.740
 identified a chorus some people 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:08.080
 brings alive in the countryside here and creates in 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.300
 laboratory conditions because the 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.910
 Most insects are known to their 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.430
 adult stages to taxonomy né 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.190
 the sort process to identify 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.980
 and describing these insects is basically 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.560
 on male adults so much 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.630
 little is known about the larval 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.800
 others - immature living within the 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.850
 Water 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:34.959
 and for you to know what's in the water and 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.430
 to be able to assess biology or which 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.260
 identify which insects are 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.690
 important for an evaluation process 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.120
 environment, for example, we need 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.820
 to know the immature in which they are 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.340
 are in the water and good will be 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.380
 those who will suffer the impact that 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.310
 that will bind paper and good suffering 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.130
 huh 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.989
 the adults he already left so they 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.120
 can give a little more information but 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.760
 most of our studies focused on 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.920
 the insects that live off the water 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.290
 agents to create some immature in the 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.900
 laboratory to associate with adults 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.870
 identify adults and after 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.400
 identify these larvae and does not occupy 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.440
 What agent did you collect in the field? 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.040
 the laboratory is evaluated 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.049
 minute of each insect collected in 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.020
 laboratory have the whole process of you 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:26.130
 to assemble the animal is not to examine the 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:29.150
 mount on a blade or just pinch 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.660
 examine on the optical microscope or 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.000
 stereoscopic 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.210
 Dr. Tânia explains the phase 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.430
 the end of all this field research 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.520
 the end point of our publication of the 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.830
 Our job is to be published in 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.470
 form of scientific articles, the chapter 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.980
 of books or books in general the quality 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:53.400
 the water of a river or stream is defined as 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:55.710
 by the existence of insects in it or not 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.080
 many people arrive in the stream and she does not 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.130
 I know existed both within the animal 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.960
 Water, right? 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.790
 even some are scared I will not go any more 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.880
 drink this water because there are a lot of 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.980
 trash until we explain does not have this 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.500
 large number of insects because the 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:13.170
 water is good if it is not good, it's 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:17.000
 the insects would not be there then the 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:20.520
 perception of how the river is 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.280
 preserved or is not right because the changes 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.460
 from the moment he knows he's with 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.860
 the presence of these insects that have a 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:31.140
 a life that sustains the lives of 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.130
 fishes and humans that are in the 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.480
 your surroundings 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.180
 those do not give importance to the 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.950
 success also if they do not know me 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.710
 I did not know it's important 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.750
 the team's research activities 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.430
 are also carried out in other 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:48.300
 municipalities and states 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:50.790
 We work in Manaus and in 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.190
 municipalities in the vicinity né presidente 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:58.050
 human figueiredo that is pure black river 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:06:00.450
 do not forget to go to gabriel barcelos are gabriel 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.820
 of the waterfall is also very difficult 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.460
 work here in the Amazon because 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:09.000
 people do not have roads right 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.350
 and there is already the displacement by the river is very 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.500
 expensive for people 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:17.850
 the fuel and the eanes 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:19.800
 traveling by boat is 11 is very very expensive 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:22.230
 so it's hard to work on the 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.050
 places was very far from here but the 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:27.480
 people also act in roraima na amapá 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:29.070
 how is the national research institute 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:33.240
 of the amazon we work in several 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:35.580
 states of the Amazon and also the southern 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:39.780
 brazil in the west center where people 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:42.210
 Can you make a dish project? 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.950
 But most of all, the students are 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:48.590
 work more and here in this region of 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:48.590
 Manaus, and to the metropolitan area, right? 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.310
 in the next block we'll meet 

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.010
 some environmental education activities 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:09.720
 a group of the entomologist 

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:12.180
 national research institute 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:14.390
 Amazon does in the region but we 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.390
 already
