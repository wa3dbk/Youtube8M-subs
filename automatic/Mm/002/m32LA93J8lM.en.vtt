00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
missions for the single player that is I

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.380 
missions for the single player that is I
think<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.260> same<00:00:55.620> as<00:00:55.860> modern<00:00:56.250> warfare<00:00:56.520> two<00:00:57.059> and

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
think the same as modern warfare two and

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.349 
think the same as modern warfare two and
maybe<00:00:57.600> cod<00:00:57.930> 4<00:00:58.199> modern<00:00:58.559> warfare<00:00:58.649> 3<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.910> it's<00:01:00.270> a

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
maybe cod 4 modern warfare 3 this it's a

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.639 
maybe cod 4 modern warfare 3 this it's a
similar<00:01:00.719> amount<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:01.020> missions<00:01:01.289> anyway<00:01:01.590> so

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
similar amount of missions anyway so

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.439 
similar amount of missions anyway so
we're<00:01:01.800> looking<00:01:01.920> at<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.219> similar<00:01:02.550> kind<00:01:03.239> of

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
we're looking at a similar kind of

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.780 
we're looking at a similar kind of
length<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.229> storyline<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:04.949> around<00:01:05.580> I

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
length of the storyline so around I

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
started off in like a space station and

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.310 
started off in like a space station and
we<00:01:38.700> saw<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.909> Odin<00:01:39.270> strike<00:01:39.570> as<00:01:39.720> well<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.110> that

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
couple of achievements for that and the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.450 
couple of achievements for that and the
last<00:01:58.079> thing<00:01:58.320> really<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:59.070> was<00:01:59.250> going<00:01:59.369> to

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
last thing really that I was going to

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.830 
last thing really that I was going to
say<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.939> there's<00:02:00.090> one<00:02:00.240> for<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.540> game

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
say is that there's one for this game

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.719 
say is that there's one for this game
mode<00:02:01.079> called<00:02:01.110> safeguard<00:02:02.009> now<00:02:02.460> I've<00:02:02.579> already

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
mode called safeguard now I've already

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.370 
mode called safeguard now I've already
seen<00:02:03.030> previously<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.600> little<00:02:03.869> glimpse<00:02:04.079> of<00:02:04.229> what

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
seen previously a little glimpse of what

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.830 
seen previously a little glimpse of what
safeguard<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:04.950> likes<00:02:05.159> for<00:02:05.549> player<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.149> co-op

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
safeguard is likes for player and co-op

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.760 
safeguard is likes for player and co-op
wave<00:02:07.229> mode<00:02:07.649> thing<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.539> so<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.989> achievement

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
wave mode thing and so the achievement

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.440 
wave mode thing and so the achievement
for<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.099> get<00:02:11.280> around<00:02:11.520> 20<00:02:12.000> on<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.270> so

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
for that is to get around 20 on that so

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.400 
for that is to get around 20 on that so
maybe<00:02:12.660> that's<00:02:12.870> an<00:02:12.989> indication

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
maybe that's an indication

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.380 
maybe that's an indication
of<00:02:13.530> how<00:02:13.680> hard<00:02:14.610> or<00:02:14.790> easy<00:02:14.820> it's<00:02:15.120> going<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.300> be

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
of how hard or easy it's going to be

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.210 
of how hard or easy it's going to be
maybe<00:02:15.600> round<00:02:15.960> 20<00:02:16.440> is<00:02:16.500> pretty<00:02:16.680> difficult<00:02:16.920> to

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
maybe round 20 is pretty difficult to

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.250 
maybe round 20 is pretty difficult to
get<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.520> which<00:02:17.670> is<00:02:17.760> why<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.540> have<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.900> unlock

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
get to which is why you have to unlock

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.990 
get to which is why you have to unlock
that<00:02:19.500> achievement<00:02:19.860> or<00:02:20.250> why<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:20.730> get<00:02:20.910> an

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
that achievement or why you get an

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.340 
that achievement or why you get an
achievement<00:02:21.090> for<00:02:21.420> doing<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:21.960> I<00:02:22.050> don't<00:02:22.260> know

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
achievement for doing it I don't know

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.110 
achievement for doing it I don't know
and<00:02:22.710> as<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:22.920> said<00:02:22.980> not<00:02:23.280> massive<00:02:23.730> amount<00:02:24.000> it's

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
and as I said not massive amount it's
