I<00:00:44.930> mean<00:00:45.379> the<00:00:45.500> torque<00:00:45.800> in<00:00:46.040> this<00:00:46.190> thing<00:00:46.460> is<00:00:46.610> just

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
I mean the torque in this thing is just

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.010 
I mean the torque in this thing is just
unbelievable<00:00:48.010> and<00:00:49.010> but<00:00:50.000> before<00:00:50.540> I<00:00:50.570> talk<00:00:50.660> more

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
unbelievable and but before I talk more

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.290 
unbelievable and but before I talk more
about<00:00:51.079> Tesla<00:00:51.649> let<00:00:51.829> me<00:00:51.920> tell<00:00:52.129> you<00:00:52.309> why<00:00:52.579> an

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
about Tesla let me tell you why an

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.119 
about Tesla let me tell you why an
electric<00:00:54.140> vehicle<00:00:54.340> is<00:00:55.340> superior<00:00:56.800> all<00:00:57.800> else

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
electric vehicle is superior all else

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.500 
electric vehicle is superior all else
being<00:00:58.370> equal<00:00:58.460> to<00:00:59.440> a<00:01:00.440> gas<00:01:00.890> vehicle<00:01:01.399> an<00:01:01.969> internal

combustion engine vehicle

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.170 
combustion engine vehicle
it's<00:01:06.200> what<00:01:06.500> tech<00:01:07.340> folks<00:01:07.670> would<00:01:07.940> call

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
it's what tech folks would call

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.969 
it's what tech folks would call
disruptive<00:01:10.390> so<00:01:11.390> an<00:01:11.780> electric<00:01:12.320> vehicle<00:01:12.500> is

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
disruptive so an electric vehicle is

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.320 
disruptive so an electric vehicle is
five<00:01:13.970> times<00:01:14.479> more<00:01:14.720> energy<00:01:15.440> efficient<00:01:16.000> in<00:01:17.000> fact

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
five times more energy efficient in fact

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.800 
five times more energy efficient in fact
your<00:01:17.780> car<00:01:18.080> your<00:01:18.350> gasoline<00:01:18.860> car<00:01:19.390> only<00:01:20.390> burns

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
your car your gasoline car only burns

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.289 
your car your gasoline car only burns
only<00:01:21.650> turns<00:01:22.070> twenty<00:01:22.610> percent<00:01:23.000> of<00:01:23.180> the

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
only turns twenty percent of the

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.969 
only turns twenty percent of the
gasoline<00:01:23.720> energy<00:01:24.520> into<00:01:25.520> mechanical<00:01:25.750> power

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
gasoline energy into mechanical power

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.120 
gasoline energy into mechanical power
twenty<00:01:27.979> percent<00:01:28.340> so<00:01:28.520> 80<00:01:28.760> percent<00:01:29.150> is<00:01:29.479> wasted

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
twenty percent so 80 percent is wasted

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.960 
twenty percent so 80 percent is wasted
the<00:01:31.130> Evi

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
the Evi

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.050 
the Evi
flips<00:01:32.509> that<00:01:32.840> in<00:01:33.320> fact<00:01:34.280> an<00:01:34.520> electric<00:01:34.909> vehicle

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
flips that in fact an electric vehicle

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.280 
flips that in fact an electric vehicle
uses<00:01:36.340> 80<00:01:37.340> percent<00:01:37.759> of<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:37.939> energy<00:01:38.060> to<00:01:38.900> 88

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
uses 80 percent of the energy to 88

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.260 
uses 80 percent of the energy to 88
percent<00:01:39.470> the<00:01:39.830> Tesla<00:01:40.130> actually<00:01:40.490> uses<00:01:40.820> 88

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
percent the Tesla actually uses 88

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.859 
percent the Tesla actually uses 88
percent<00:01:41.659> so<00:01:42.350> it<00:01:42.470> only<00:01:42.770> wastes<00:01:43.729> 10<00:01:44.329> to<00:01:44.600> 20

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
percent so it only wastes 10 to 20

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.649 
percent so it only wastes 10 to 20
percent<00:01:45.100> so<00:01:46.100> it<00:01:46.220> flips<00:01:46.549> that<00:01:46.790> equation<00:01:47.270> that

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
percent so it flips that equation that

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.880 
percent so it flips that equation that
equation<00:01:48.040> it's<00:01:49.040> also<00:01:49.400> five<00:01:50.060> times<00:01:50.479> cheaper<00:01:50.930> to

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
equation it's also five times cheaper to

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.590 
equation it's also five times cheaper to
maintain<00:01:52.100> if<00:01:52.700> you<00:01:53.299> see<00:01:53.570> one<00:01:53.780> of<00:01:53.810> these<00:01:53.930> cars

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
maintain if you see one of these cars

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.130 
maintain if you see one of these cars
it's<00:01:56.600> it's<00:01:56.930> unbelievable<00:01:57.170> how<00:01:58.090> sparse<00:01:59.090> I<00:01:59.390> mean

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
it's it's unbelievable how sparse I mean

electric<00:02:54.230> vehicle<00:02:54.680> when<00:02:55.370> they<00:02:55.580> reach<00:02:55.850> about

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
electric vehicle when they reach about

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.150 
electric vehicle when they reach about
the<00:02:56.810> same<00:02:57.080> price<00:02:57.470> as<00:02:58.460> the<00:02:58.670> gasoline<00:02:59.060> car

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
the same price as the gasoline car

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.680 
the same price as the gasoline car
they're<00:03:01.160> gonna<00:03:01.280> take<00:03:01.580> over<00:03:01.760> there's<00:03:02.480> no<00:03:02.630> two

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
they're gonna take over there's no two

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.450 
they're gonna take over there's no two
ways<00:03:02.990> about<00:03:03.230> it<00:03:03.380> people<00:03:03.740> are<00:03:03.830> gonna<00:03:03.950> make<00:03:04.220> the

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
ways about it people are gonna make the

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.630 
ways about it people are gonna make the
right<00:03:04.670> financial<00:03:05.650> decision<00:03:06.650> which<00:03:06.920> is<00:03:07.160> to<00:03:07.400> buy

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
right financial decision which is to buy

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.050 
right financial decision which is to buy
an<00:03:08.150> electric<00:03:08.480> vehicle<00:03:09.190> but<00:03:10.190> here's<00:03:10.910> the

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
an electric vehicle but here's the

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.190 
an electric vehicle but here's the
problem<00:03:11.980> who<00:03:12.980> can<00:03:13.220> afford<00:03:13.990> they<00:03:14.990> wrote<00:03:15.170> that

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
problem who can afford they wrote that

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.130 
problem who can afford they wrote that
Tesla<00:03:15.890> the<00:03:16.580> Tesla<00:03:17.000> is<00:03:17.060> one<00:03:17.120> hundred<00:03:17.660> thousand

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.490 
dollars that's not my car by the way I'm
just<00:03:22.160> filling<00:03:22.610> it<00:03:22.790> up<00:03:25.930> let<00:03:26.930> me<00:03:26.960> introduce<00:03:27.230> you

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
just filling it up let me introduce you

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.270 
just filling it up let me introduce you
to<00:03:27.680> a<00:03:27.830> Chinese<00:03:28.280> car<00:03:28.670> company<00:03:29.120> called<00:03:29.420> byv

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
to a Chinese car company called byv

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.110 
to a Chinese car company called byv
which<00:03:31.280> has<00:03:31.610> announced<00:03:31.880> the<00:03:32.660> e6<00:03:33.580> which<00:03:34.580> has<00:03:35.090> a

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
which has announced the e6 which has a

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.050 
which has announced the e6 which has a
battery<00:03:35.810> that<00:03:36.110> is<00:03:36.710> just<00:03:37.220> about<00:03:37.460> the<00:03:37.610> same<00:03:37.820> size

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
battery that is just about the same size

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.010 
battery that is just about the same size
as<00:03:38.630> the<00:03:38.870> Tesla<00:03:39.370> so<00:03:40.370> 48<00:03:41.260> kilowatt<00:03:42.260> hour<00:03:42.460> range

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
as the Tesla so 48 kilowatt hour range

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.950 
as the Tesla so 48 kilowatt hour range
250<00:03:45.020> miles<00:03:45.290> which<00:03:46.160> is<00:03:46.310> pretty<00:03:46.550> good<00:03:46.820> you<00:03:47.750> can

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:47.960 
250 miles which is pretty good you can

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.790 
250 miles which is pretty good you can
power<00:03:48.290> it<00:03:48.620> at<00:03:48.800> home<00:03:49.250> so<00:03:50.210> if<00:03:50.450> you<00:03:50.660> have<00:03:50.960> a<00:03:51.320> washer

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
power it at home so if you have a washer

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.420 
power it at home so if you have a washer
and<00:03:52.040> a<00:03:52.310> dryer<00:03:52.340> which<00:03:53.120> is<00:03:53.300> 220<00:03:54.020> you<00:03:54.950> can<00:03:55.160> power

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
and a dryer which is 220 you can power

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.790 
and a dryer which is 220 you can power
this<00:03:55.640> thing<00:03:55.960> so<00:03:56.960> pretty<00:03:57.200> much<00:03:57.350> most<00:03:57.650> of

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
this thing so pretty much most of

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.630 
this thing so pretty much most of
Americans<00:03:58.430> can<00:03:59.050> and<00:04:00.050> you<00:04:00.410> can<00:04:00.590> charge<00:04:00.920> half<00:04:01.490> of

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
Americans can and you can charge half of

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.390 
Americans can and you can charge half of
it<00:04:01.790> 50%<00:04:02.300> of<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:02.810> battery<00:04:03.110> in<00:04:03.740> ten<00:04:04.370> minutes<00:04:04.640> so

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
it 50% of the battery in ten minutes so

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.000 
it 50% of the battery in ten minutes so
this<00:04:07.400> thing<00:04:07.730> about<00:04:08.000> it<00:04:08.540> taking<00:04:09.110> 12<00:04:09.320> hours<00:04:09.770> and

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
this thing about it taking 12 hours and

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.980 
this thing about it taking 12 hours and
what<00:04:10.130> not<00:04:10.310> in<00:04:10.580> 10<00:04:10.820> minutes<00:04:11.210> you<00:04:11.540> can<00:04:11.720> charge

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
what not in 10 minutes you can charge

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.620 
what not in 10 minutes you can charge
half<00:04:12.350> of<00:04:12.470> it<00:04:12.790> the<00:04:13.790> other<00:04:13.940> half<00:04:14.210> will<00:04:14.420> take

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
half of it the other half will take

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.690 
half of it the other half will take
hours<00:04:14.930> for<00:04:14.960> the<00:04:15.290> first<00:04:15.500> half<00:04:15.740> will<00:04:15.920> take<00:04:16.100> 10

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
hours for the first half will take 10

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:24.460 
hours for the first half will take 10
minutes<00:04:16.930> how<00:04:17.930> much<00:04:18.109> is<00:04:18.290> this<00:04:18.440> car<00:04:21.610> $40,000

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
minutes how much is this car $40,000

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:30.710 
minutes how much is this car $40,000
$40,000<00:04:27.110> hmm<00:04:28.190> exactly<00:04:29.190> right<00:04:29.820> it's<00:04:30.449> still<00:04:30.690> a

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
$40,000 hmm exactly right it's still a

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.860 
$40,000 hmm exactly right it's still a
little<00:04:31.020> expensive<00:04:31.320> but<00:04:32.120> you<00:04:33.120> know<00:04:33.150> it's<00:04:33.660> it's

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
little expensive but you know it's it's

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.730 
little expensive but you know it's it's
coming<00:04:34.860> down<00:04:35.040> in<00:04:35.220> price<00:04:35.250> very<00:04:35.850> very<00:04:36.210> quickly

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
coming down in price very very quickly

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.450 
coming down in price very very quickly
so<00:04:37.740> then<00:04:38.430> mass<00:04:38.760> migration<00:04:39.979> from<00:04:40.979> gasoline

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
so then mass migration from gasoline

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.570 
so then mass migration from gasoline
cars<00:04:42.240> from<00:04:42.810> internal<00:04:43.560> combustion<00:04:44.160> engine

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
cars from internal combustion engine

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.110 
cars from internal combustion engine
vehicles<00:04:44.960> to<00:04:45.960> electric<00:04:46.530> vehicles<00:04:46.560> is<00:04:47.370> going

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
vehicles to electric vehicles is going

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.320 
vehicles to electric vehicles is going
to<00:04:48.180> happen<00:04:48.660> when<00:04:49.410> the<00:04:50.070> cost<00:04:50.760> of<00:04:52.610> the<00:04:53.610> EVs

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
to happen when the cost of the EVs

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.510 
to happen when the cost of the EVs
go<00:04:54.479> down<00:04:54.690> by<00:04:54.870> 50<00:04:55.199> percent<00:04:55.560> so<00:04:56.220> we<00:04:56.340> need<00:04:56.490> a

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
go down by 50 percent so we need a

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.100 
go down by 50 percent so we need a
twenty<00:04:56.880> twenty<00:04:57.120> five<00:04:57.300> thousand<00:04:57.690> dollar<00:04:57.870> car

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
twenty twenty five thousand dollar car

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.030 
twenty twenty five thousand dollar car
yes

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
yes

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.270 
yes
so<00:05:02.040> the<00:05:02.639> problem<00:05:03.210> the<00:05:03.930> reason<00:05:04.380> that<00:05:04.530> EVs<00:05:04.979> are

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
so the problem the reason that EVs are

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.580 
so the problem the reason that EVs are
expensive<00:05:05.820> is<00:05:06.030> that<00:05:06.479> batteries<00:05:07.380> are

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
expensive is that batteries are

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.010 
expensive is that batteries are
expensive<00:05:07.970> batteries<00:05:08.970> are<00:05:09.120> 50<00:05:09.450> percent<00:05:09.840> of

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
expensive batteries are 50 percent of

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.850 
expensive batteries are 50 percent of
the<00:05:10.139> cost<00:05:10.290> maybe<00:05:10.650> more<00:05:11.540> electric<00:05:12.540> vehicles<00:05:13.020> so

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
the cost maybe more electric vehicles so

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.620 
the cost maybe more electric vehicles so
if<00:05:14.160> we<00:05:14.430> look<00:05:14.700> at<00:05:15.030> the<00:05:15.630> roster<00:05:16.260> for<00:05:17.630> batteries

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
if we look at the roster for batteries

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.230 
if we look at the roster for batteries
for<00:05:18.870> lithium-ion<00:05:19.350> batteries<00:05:20.240> they're

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
for lithium-ion batteries they're

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:28.840 
for lithium-ion batteries they're
dropping<00:05:21.720> by<00:05:21.870> 8<00:05:22.110> percent<00:05:22.380> per<00:05:23.010> year<00:05:23.190> in<00:05:23.699> cost

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.110 

sorry<00:05:30.260> basically<00:05:31.260> they're<00:05:31.590> going<00:05:31.680> to<00:05:31.800> drop<00:05:32.120> 56

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
sorry basically they're going to drop 56

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.010 
sorry basically they're going to drop 56
percent<00:05:33.539> by<00:05:33.690> 2020<00:05:34.380> so<00:05:35.340> the<00:05:35.460> migration<00:05:36.180> from

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
percent by 2020 so the migration from

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.400 
percent by 2020 so the migration from
gasoline<00:05:37.400> cars<00:05:38.400> to<00:05:38.729> electric<00:05:39.150> vehicles<00:05:39.660> will

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
gasoline cars to electric vehicles will

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.980 
gasoline cars to electric vehicles will
happen<00:05:40.950> by<00:05:41.220> 2020<00:05:41.910> if<00:05:42.450> current<00:05:43.200> trends<00:05:43.650> persist

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
happen by 2020 if current trends persist

name it it's all being looked at right
now<00:06:10.560> which<00:06:11.490> means<00:06:11.789> that<00:06:12.450> the<00:06:12.720> cost<00:06:13.020> curve<00:06:13.380> is

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710 
now which means that the cost curve is

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.520 
now which means that the cost curve is
gonna<00:06:14.550> go<00:06:14.760> down<00:06:15.000> further<00:06:15.330> just<00:06:15.990> like<00:06:16.169> it<00:06:16.320> did

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530 
gonna go down further just like it did

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.760 
gonna go down further just like it did
for<00:06:16.560> sort<00:06:16.979> of<00:06:17.039> solar<00:06:17.400> photovoltaics<00:06:18.500> so<00:06:19.500> let

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
for sort of solar photovoltaics so let

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.730 
for sort of solar photovoltaics so let
me<00:06:19.919> make<00:06:20.099> this<00:06:20.310> assumption<00:06:20.729> if<00:06:21.720> the<00:06:22.440> cost

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
me make this assumption if the cost

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.469 
me make this assumption if the cost
curve<00:06:23.010> goes<00:06:23.700> down<00:06:23.970> by<00:06:24.240> 12%<00:06:24.919> instead<00:06:25.919> of<00:06:26.039> 8%

curve goes down by 12% instead of 8%

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:30.590 
curve goes down by 12% instead of 8%
what's<00:06:27.479> going<00:06:27.660> to<00:06:27.720> happen

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.710 

cos<00:06:31.260> are<00:06:31.620> gonna<00:06:31.800> go<00:06:32.010> down<00:06:32.360> 50%<00:06:33.360> like<00:06:34.220> 2016

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.720 
cos are gonna go down 50% like 2016

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.080 
cos are gonna go down 50% like 2016
which<00:06:36.720> means<00:06:37.410> that<00:06:37.770> the<00:06:37.890> mass<00:06:38.100> migration<00:06:38.430> from

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090 
which means that the mass migration from

which means that the mass migration from
gasoline<00:06:39.690> cars<00:06:40.160> is<00:06:41.160> gonna<00:06:41.400> start<00:06:41.850> in<00:06:42.180> six

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:42.540 
gasoline cars is gonna start in six

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.190 
gasoline cars is gonna start in six
years<00:06:43.610> and<00:06:44.610> they're<00:06:44.970> gonna<00:06:45.090> drop<00:06:45.420> in<00:06:45.660> price<00:06:45.930> by

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:46.200 
years and they're gonna drop in price by

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:52.850 
years and they're gonna drop in price by
ninety<00:06:46.620> percent<00:06:47.210> by<00:06:48.770> 2028<00:06:50.270> which<00:06:51.270> means<00:06:51.860> three

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 
ninety percent by 2028 which means three

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.740 
ninety percent by 2028 which means three
things<00:06:53.160> and<00:06:53.430> I'll<00:06:53.550> leave<00:06:53.850> you<00:06:54.030> with<00:06:54.570> these

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:54.750 
things and I'll leave you with these

things and I'll leave you with these
three<00:06:55.320> dots<00:06:56.000> one<00:06:57.000> the<00:06:57.960> mass<00:06:58.230> migration<00:06:59.300> from

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300 
three dots one the mass migration from

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.650 
three dots one the mass migration from
gasoline<00:07:00.800> to<00:07:01.800> electric<00:07:02.370> is<00:07:03.000> gonna<00:07:03.330> start

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:03.660 
gasoline to electric is gonna start

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:09.080 
gasoline to electric is gonna start
sometime<00:07:04.620> between<00:07:05.450> 2016<00:07:06.450> and<00:07:06.630> 2020<00:07:08.090> if

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.090 
sometime between 2016 and 2020 if

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.230 
sometime between 2016 and 2020 if
current<00:07:09.540> trends<00:07:09.990> persist<00:07:10.890> we<00:07:11.490> don't<00:07:11.700> need<00:07:11.910> any

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 
current trends persist we don't need any

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:18.290 
current trends persist we don't need any
breakthroughs<00:07:13.520> to<00:07:15.200> the<00:07:16.200> last<00:07:17.300> commercial

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:18.300 
breakthroughs to the last commercial

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.490 
breakthroughs to the last commercial
vehicle<00:07:19.260> that<00:07:20.010> runs<00:07:20.280> gasoline<00:07:21.270> will<00:07:22.080> be<00:07:22.260> built

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:22.500 
vehicle that runs gasoline will be built

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.310 
vehicle that runs gasoline will be built
in<00:07:22.770> 2028<00:07:24.170> which<00:07:25.170> is<00:07:25.290> only<00:07:25.500> 18<00:07:25.950> years<00:07:25.980> out

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:27.320 
in 2028 which is only 18 years out

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.130 
in 2028 which is only 18 years out
because<00:07:28.320> by<00:07:28.560> then<00:07:28.860> the<00:07:29.310> cost<00:07:29.610> curve<00:07:29.900> will<00:07:30.900> be

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:31.140 
because by then the cost curve will be

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.190 
because by then the cost curve will be
just<00:07:31.860> unbelievable<00:07:32.610> of<00:07:32.820> the<00:07:33.420> current<00:07:33.840> cost

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:34.200 
just unbelievable of the current cost

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.950 
just unbelievable of the current cost
curve<00:07:34.440> and<00:07:34.950> three<00:07:35.670> oil<00:07:36.180> will<00:07:36.810> be<00:07:37.020> obsolete

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 
curve and three oil will be obsolete

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.070 
curve and three oil will be obsolete
following<00:07:39.960> these<00:07:40.230> trends<00:07:40.680> by<00:07:41.310> 2030<00:07:41.940> we<00:07:42.240> will

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.080 
following these trends by 2030 we will

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.570 
following these trends by 2030 we will
have<00:07:43.500> made<00:07:43.770> a<00:07:44.810> migration<00:07:45.810> from<00:07:46.260> the<00:07:46.980> gasoline

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:47.580 
have made a migration from the gasoline

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:55.170 
have made a migration from the gasoline
car<00:07:47.930> to<00:07:48.930> the<00:07:49.050> electric<00:07:49.410> vehicle<00:07:49.860> by<00:07:50.790> 2030

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:55.180
