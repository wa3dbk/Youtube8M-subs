00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.529 
but I'll go over it just so you guys can
see<00:00:22.699> it<00:00:23.140> again<00:00:24.140> I<00:00:24.169> am<00:00:24.409> using<00:00:24.710> the<00:00:25.130> eShop

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
see it again I am using the eShop

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.269 
see it again I am using the eShop
nano<00:00:27.529> overflow<00:00:28.249> box<00:00:29.739> there's<00:00:30.739> all<00:00:30.980> you<00:00:31.159> know

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
nano overflow box there's all you know

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.970 
nano overflow box there's all you know
all<00:00:31.310> the<00:00:31.609> stock<00:00:31.849> parts<00:00:32.270> to<00:00:32.480> it<00:00:32.680> but<00:00:33.680> here<00:00:33.890> you

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
all the stock parts to it but here you

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.110 
all the stock parts to it but here you
can<00:00:34.160> basically<00:00:34.340> just<00:00:34.609> get<00:00:34.940> an<00:00:35.059> idea<00:00:36.489> of<00:00:37.489> where

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
can basically just get an idea of where

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.660 
can basically just get an idea of where
the<00:00:38.269> water<00:00:38.480> level<00:00:38.930> is<00:00:39.050> on<00:00:39.230> the<00:00:39.350> bio<00:00:39.559> cube<00:00:42.670> it's

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
the water level is on the bio cube it's

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.759 
the water level is on the bio cube it's
it's<00:00:44.030> pretty<00:00:44.359> close<00:00:44.690> to<00:00:45.850> the<00:00:46.850> actual<00:00:47.769> maximum

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:48.769 
it's pretty close to the actual maximum

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:50.910 
it's pretty close to the actual maximum
that<00:00:49.010> you<00:00:49.070> can<00:00:49.219> fill<00:00:49.579> your<00:00:49.699> bio<00:00:49.910> cube<00:00:50.300> without

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
that you can fill your bio cube without

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:58.029 
that you can fill your bio cube without
overflowing<00:00:51.920> too<00:00:52.129> much<00:00:56.710> that's<00:00:57.710> basically

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
overflowing too much that's basically

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.849 
overflowing too much that's basically
give<00:00:58.339> overflow<00:00:58.730> box<00:00:58.969> they're<00:01:01.839> tightly<00:01:02.859> fitted

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:03.859 
give overflow box they're tightly fitted

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:07.090 
give overflow box they're tightly fitted
with<00:01:04.100> the<00:01:04.570> wingnut<00:01:05.570> that<00:01:05.840> they<00:01:05.990> provide<00:01:06.409> to

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
with the wingnut that they provide to

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.249 
with the wingnut that they provide to
prevent<00:01:07.460> the<00:01:07.900> actual<00:01:08.900> box<00:01:09.140> from<00:01:09.350> sliding<00:01:09.680> down

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
prevent the actual box from sliding down

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.670 
prevent the actual box from sliding down
so<00:01:12.259> the<00:01:12.950> YouTube<00:01:13.900> last<00:01:14.900> thing<00:01:15.110> you<00:01:15.259> do<00:01:15.409> goes

back of the tank and I'm using 3/4 inch
PVC<00:02:05.280> pipe<00:02:06.830> it<00:02:07.830> is<00:02:09.440> PVC<00:02:10.440> glue<00:02:10.790> straight<00:02:11.790> up<00:02:11.970> into

PVC pipe it is PVC glue straight up into

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.660 
PVC pipe it is PVC glue straight up into
the<00:02:12.480> fitting<00:02:13.380> that<00:02:13.650> comes<00:02:13.950> with<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.280> overflow

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
the fitting that comes with the overflow

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.550 
the fitting that comes with the overflow
box<00:02:15.800> so<00:02:16.800> my<00:02:17.010> PVC<00:02:17.340> tube<00:02:17.670> goes<00:02:17.970> down<00:02:18.240> there<00:02:18.780> and

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
box so my PVC tube goes down there and

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.190 
box so my PVC tube goes down there and
then<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.070> goes<00:02:20.370> into<00:02:20.850> that<00:02:21.120> elbow<00:02:21.630> which<00:02:21.930> goes

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
then it goes into that elbow which goes

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.420 
of more normal that's optional of course
so<00:02:55.760> so<00:02:56.760> once<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.510> elbow<00:02:58.410> goes<00:02:58.620> into<00:02:58.920> something

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
so so once the elbow goes into something

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.090 
so so once the elbow goes into something
there<00:02:59.640> I'll<00:02:59.910> go<00:03:00.120> around<00:03:00.450> in<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.690> tank<00:03:00.989> or<00:03:01.920> in

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
there I'll go around in the tank or in

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:09.040 
there I'll go around in the tank or in
the<00:03:02.220> sump<00:03:02.489> and<00:03:02.670> show<00:03:02.970> you<00:03:03.030> that<00:03:03.300> part

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.430 

so<00:03:10.050> this<00:03:10.500> is<00:03:11.450> elbow<00:03:12.450> that's<00:03:12.690> coming<00:03:13.170> from<00:03:13.290> the

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
so this is elbow that's coming from the

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:20.490 
so this is elbow that's coming from the
back<00:03:15.260> goes<00:03:16.260> into<00:03:16.560> another<00:03:16.680> elbow<00:03:17.250> up<00:03:17.400> there

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.490 

and<00:03:21.500> it<00:03:21.920> goes<00:03:22.130> into<00:03:22.459> my<00:03:23.890> my<00:03:24.890> my<00:03:25.370> l-shaped<00:03:26.500> PVC

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
and it goes into my my my l-shaped PVC

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.430 
and it goes into my my my l-shaped PVC
pipe<00:03:27.800> which<00:03:28.280> again<00:03:28.959> instead<00:03:29.959> of<00:03:30.080> having<00:03:30.260> the

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
pipe which again instead of having the

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.470 
pipe which again instead of having the
water<00:03:30.590> going<00:03:31.130> straight<00:03:31.459> down<00:03:31.489> into<00:03:31.819> my<00:03:32.090> water

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
water going straight down into my water

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.199 
water going straight down into my water
I<00:03:32.810> have<00:03:33.590> it<00:03:33.739> kind<00:03:34.069> of<00:03:34.220> going<00:03:34.489> around<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:37.209> the

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
I have it kind of going around the the

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.290 
I have it kind of going around the the
side<00:03:38.540> of<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.930> sump

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
side of the sump

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.750 
side of the sump
just<00:03:41.300> to<00:03:41.420> kind<00:03:41.750> of<00:03:41.870> quiet<00:03:42.170> things<00:03:42.470> down<00:03:42.760> I'm

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
just to kind of quiet things down I'm

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.340 
just to kind of quiet things down I'm
gonna<00:03:43.910> go<00:03:44.000> ahead<00:03:44.150> and<00:03:44.360> pause<00:03:44.480> the<00:03:44.660> video<00:03:44.810> and

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
gonna go ahead and pause the video and

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.460 
gonna go ahead and pause the video and
disconnect<00:03:46.390> the<00:03:47.390> pipe<00:03:47.630> and<00:03:48.019> show<00:03:48.290> you<00:03:48.350> a

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
disconnect the pipe and show you a

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.970 
disconnect the pipe and show you a
closer<00:03:48.860> look<00:03:49.690> of<00:03:50.690> how<00:03:50.959> I<00:03:50.989> drill<00:03:51.410> the<00:03:51.530> holes<00:03:51.739> on

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
closer look of how I drill the holes on

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:59.520 
closer look of how I drill the holes on
there<00:03:52.220> hold<00:03:53.090> on

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.340 

so<00:04:00.530> here<00:04:01.280> is<00:04:01.700> what<00:04:02.420> the<00:04:02.660> water<00:04:03.760> comes<00:04:04.760> down<00:04:05.000> as

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
so here is what the water comes down as

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.860 
so here is what the water comes down as
without<00:04:06.350> me<00:04:06.860> putting<00:04:07.280> in<00:04:07.549> the<00:04:07.850> elbow<00:04:08.480> that<00:04:08.720> I

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
without me putting in the elbow that I

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.830 
without me putting in the elbow that I
mentioned<00:04:10.150> you<00:04:11.150> see<00:04:11.299> the<00:04:11.420> water<00:04:11.600> goes

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
mentioned you see the water goes

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.400 
mentioned you see the water goes
straight<00:04:12.049> down<00:04:12.370> it<00:04:13.370> does<00:04:13.549> create<00:04:14.410> the

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
straight down it does create the

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.840 
straight down it does create the
splashing<00:04:15.680> sound<00:04:16.220> and<00:04:16.549> noise<00:04:17.260> and<00:04:18.729> again<00:04:19.729> I'm

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
splashing sound and noise and again I'm

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.240 
splashing sound and noise and again I'm
not<00:04:19.880> using<00:04:20.299> our<00:04:20.600> filters<00:04:21.019> up<00:04:21.229> here<00:04:21.650> or<00:04:21.889> any

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
not using our filters up here or any

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.010 
not using our filters up here or any
kind<00:04:22.460> of<00:04:22.520> sponge<00:04:22.850> so<00:04:23.090> that's<00:04:23.270> why<00:04:23.510> I<00:04:23.540> decided

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
kind of sponge so that's why I decided

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.580 
kind of sponge so that's why I decided
to<00:04:24.500> make<00:04:24.650> my<00:04:25.450> my<00:04:26.450> little<00:04:26.510> design<00:04:27.200> with<00:04:27.440> my

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
to make my my little design with my

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.749 
to make my my little design with my
elbow<00:04:28.270> which<00:04:29.270> here<00:04:29.750> it<00:04:29.870> is<00:04:29.990> in<00:04:30.530> detail

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:36.420 

it's<00:04:34.419> just<00:04:34.689> a<00:04:34.809> series<00:04:35.199> of<00:04:35.349> elbows<00:04:35.800> and<00:04:36.099> PVC

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
it's just a series of elbows and PVC

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.779 
it's just a series of elbows and PVC
pipe<00:04:36.819> again<00:04:37.270> 3/4<00:04:38.229> inch<00:04:38.409> PVC<00:04:38.589> pipe<00:04:39.099> so

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:39.789 
pipe again 3/4 inch PVC pipe so

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:42.089 
pipe again 3/4 inch PVC pipe so
basically<00:04:40.150> this<00:04:40.509> and<00:04:40.809> off<00:04:41.110> my<00:04:41.349> elbow<00:04:41.800> here

00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:42.099 
basically this and off my elbow here

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:48.510 
basically this and off my elbow here
would<00:04:42.839> fit<00:04:43.839> you<00:04:44.529> know<00:04:44.650> right<00:04:44.979> on<00:04:45.759> there<00:04:47.520> onto

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
would fit you know right on there onto

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.029 
would fit you know right on there onto
that<00:04:48.639> piece<00:04:48.789> of<00:04:48.939> PVC<00:04:49.089> pipe<00:04:49.710> water<00:04:50.710> goes

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
that piece of PVC pipe water goes

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.189 
that piece of PVC pipe water goes
through<00:04:51.370> this<00:04:51.520> tube<00:04:51.580> and<00:04:52.089> this<00:04:52.629> is<00:04:52.689> what<00:04:52.960> I<00:04:52.990> was

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
through this tube and this is what I was

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.469 
through this tube and this is what I was
mentioning<00:04:53.469> in<00:04:53.770> my<00:04:54.009> previous<00:04:54.460> video<00:04:54.759> on<00:04:55.029> the

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
mentioning in my previous video on the

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.350 
mentioning in my previous video on the
bottom<00:04:55.689> of<00:04:56.080> the<00:04:56.259> tube<00:04:56.650> I<00:04:56.919> made<00:04:57.729> a<00:04:57.759> series<00:04:58.330> of

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
bottom of the tube I made a series of

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.200 
bottom of the tube I made a series of
large<00:04:58.870> holes<00:04:59.439> with<00:05:00.189> a<00:05:00.219> drill<00:05:00.309> bit<00:05:00.729> I<00:05:00.969> just

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
large holes with a drill bit I just

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.480 
large holes with a drill bit I just
drilled<00:05:01.509> it<00:05:01.629> out<00:05:01.749> so<00:05:02.529> basically<00:05:02.889> as<00:05:03.129> the<00:05:03.159> water

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
drilled it out so basically as the water

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.749 
drilled it out so basically as the water
is<00:05:03.669> traveling<00:05:03.939> through<00:05:04.379> the<00:05:05.379> PVC<00:05:06.249> tube<00:05:06.490> here

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:06.759 
is traveling through the PVC tube here

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:09.749 
is traveling through the PVC tube here
the<00:05:07.270> water's<00:05:07.629> coming<00:05:07.839> out<00:05:08.399> most<00:05:09.399> of<00:05:09.490> the<00:05:09.580> water

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 
the water's coming out most of the water

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:13.610 
the water's coming out most of the water
is<00:05:09.939> coming<00:05:10.149> out<00:05:10.389> through<00:05:10.599> these<00:05:11.339> holes<00:05:12.339> and

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
is coming out through these holes and

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.820 
is coming out through these holes and
again<00:05:14.620> and<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:15.430> pipe<00:05:15.849> sits<00:05:16.330> just<00:05:16.569> on<00:05:17.529> top<00:05:17.770> of

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
again and the pipe sits just on top of

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.950 
again and the pipe sits just on top of
the<00:05:18.129> water<00:05:18.370> line<00:05:18.699> so<00:05:19.300> that<00:05:19.330> when<00:05:19.689> the<00:05:19.809> water

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
the water line so that when the water

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.510 
the water line so that when the water
comes<00:05:20.229> out<00:05:20.469> these<00:05:20.680> holes<00:05:20.919> there's<00:05:21.339> no

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
comes out these holes there's no

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.010 
comes out these holes there's no
splashing<00:05:21.909> sound<00:05:22.270> the<00:05:22.360> water<00:05:22.599> actually<00:05:22.779> comes

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
splashing sound the water actually comes

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.980 
splashing sound the water actually comes
out<00:05:23.550> slightly<00:05:24.550> below<00:05:24.789> the<00:05:25.149> water<00:05:25.389> line<00:05:25.629> and

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
out slightly below the water line and

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.709 
out slightly below the water line and
again<00:05:26.949> I<00:05:27.129> have<00:05:27.370> another<00:05:27.550> elbow<00:05:27.819> here<00:05:28.449> I'll

00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:28.719 
again I have another elbow here I'll

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:31.799 
again I have another elbow here I'll
open<00:05:28.899> set<00:05:29.169> PVC<00:05:29.620> tube<00:05:29.919> here<00:05:30.550> which<00:05:31.479> I<00:05:31.629> just

00:05:31.799 --> 00:05:31.809 
open set PVC tube here which I just

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:34.409 
open set PVC tube here which I just
sawed<00:05:32.379> off<00:05:32.610> you<00:05:33.610> know<00:05:33.699> a<00:05:33.729> part<00:05:34.059> of<00:05:34.149> it<00:05:34.270> like

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
sawed off you know a part of it like

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.339 
sawed off you know a part of it like
that<00:05:34.770> and<00:05:35.770> this<00:05:36.309> is<00:05:36.370> the<00:05:36.729> part<00:05:37.029> that<00:05:37.300> I<00:05:37.779> just

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:38.349 
that and this is the part that I just

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:44.040 
that and this is the part that I just
put<00:05:38.909> my<00:05:40.889> my<00:05:41.889> sponges<00:05:42.430> on<00:05:42.659> just<00:05:43.659> to<00:05:43.779> kind<00:05:44.020> of

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
put my my sponges on just to kind of

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.949 
put my my sponges on just to kind of
help<00:05:44.469> that<00:05:44.649> with<00:05:44.889> the<00:05:44.979> sound<00:05:45.659> put<00:05:46.659> a<00:05:46.689> piece<00:05:46.930> of

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:46.959 
help that with the sound put a piece of

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:49.820 
help that with the sound put a piece of
sponge<00:05:47.259> like<00:05:47.529> that<00:05:47.770> and<00:05:48.430> then<00:05:48.879> another<00:05:49.120> one

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
sponge like that and then another one

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.690 
sponge like that and then another one
right<00:05:50.830> over<00:05:50.860> there

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:02.060 

and<00:05:55.120> that's<00:05:55.840> you<00:05:56.650> know<00:05:58.530> basically<00:05:59.530> the<00:05:59.710> design

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.910 

all<00:06:03.070> right<00:06:03.250> guys<00:06:04.200> that's<00:06:05.200> basically<00:06:05.680> the

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:05.920 
all right guys that's basically the

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.620 
all right guys that's basically the
design<00:06:06.280> of<00:06:06.490> it<00:06:06.730> so<00:06:08.400> the<00:06:09.400> water<00:06:09.670> can<00:06:10.090> still<00:06:10.360> come

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
design of it so the water can still come

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.830 
design of it so the water can still come
out<00:06:10.660> through<00:06:11.170> this<00:06:11.290> and<00:06:12.180> if<00:06:13.180> a<00:06:13.330> lot<00:06:13.510> of<00:06:13.660> water

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
out through this and if a lot of water

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.380 
out through this and if a lot of water
is<00:06:13.960> coming<00:06:14.170> down<00:06:14.620> but<00:06:15.460> most<00:06:15.670> most<00:06:16.210> of<00:06:16.330> the

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:16.390 
is coming down but most most of the

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.420 
is coming down but most most of the
water<00:06:16.630> comes<00:06:16.750> through<00:06:17.110> the<00:06:17.560> holes<00:06:17.800> at<00:06:18.280> the

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
water comes through the holes at the

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.560 
water comes through the holes at the
bottom<00:06:18.700> of<00:06:18.820> the<00:06:18.940> tube<00:06:19.150> and<00:06:20.700> that's<00:06:21.700> pretty

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 
bottom of the tube and that's pretty

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.970 
bottom of the tube and that's pretty
much<00:06:22.810> it

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:25.980 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.500 

here's<00:06:26.980> a<00:06:27.160> video<00:06:27.310> of<00:06:27.760> everything<00:06:28.060> put<00:06:28.480> back

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:28.510 
here's a video of everything put back

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.320 
here's a video of everything put back
together<00:06:28.900> I<00:06:29.380> just<00:06:30.220> have<00:06:30.370> to<00:06:30.490> lit<00:06:30.730> out<00:06:30.910> right

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
together I just have to lit out right

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.470 
together I just have to lit out right
here<00:06:31.600> so<00:06:32.500> you<00:06:32.590> can<00:06:32.680> notice<00:06:33.100> it's<00:06:33.280> a<00:06:33.400> lot<00:06:33.670> lot

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:34.480 
here so you can notice it's a lot lot

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.720 
here so you can notice it's a lot lot
quieter<00:06:34.900> than<00:06:35.080> having<00:06:35.590> the<00:06:35.680> water<00:06:35.830> go

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:36.730 
quieter than having the water go

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.110 
quieter than having the water go
straight<00:06:37.060> down<00:06:37.210> into<00:06:37.690> your<00:06:37.900> or<00:06:38.080> something
