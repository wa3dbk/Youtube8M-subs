00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
think I would have liked if it was maybe

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.680 
think I would have liked if it was maybe
a<00:03:40.440> little<00:03:40.620> bit<00:03:40.850> thicker<00:03:41.850> the<00:03:42.120> blue<00:03:42.300> part<00:03:42.570> on

the top and a little bit less at the

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.710 
the top and a little bit less at the
bottom<00:03:44.670> but<00:03:44.940> it's<00:03:45.270> okay

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
bottom but it's okay

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.320

so definitely pick this one up if you

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.610 
so definitely pick this one up if you
can<00:04:27.880> instead<00:04:28.240> of<00:04:28.330> that<00:04:28.479> one<00:04:28.690> all<00:04:29.110> of<00:04:29.350> that<00:04:29.470> one

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
is good there's also a DC direct one but

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.100 
is good there's also a DC direct one but
that<00:04:33.100> one's<00:04:33.280> really<00:04:33.699> strangely<00:04:34.300> built<00:04:34.630> so<00:04:34.900> I

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
that one's really strangely built so I

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.350 
that one's really strangely built so I
definitely<00:04:35.979> suggest<00:04:36.190> you<00:04:36.520> pick<00:04:36.669> this<00:04:36.850> one<00:04:37.060> out
