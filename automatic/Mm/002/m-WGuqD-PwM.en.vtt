your options maybe what I'll do is I'll
increase<00:02:54.140> my<00:02:54.410> brush<00:02:54.950> size<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.820> maybe<00:02:56.000> I'll

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
increase my brush size and maybe I'll

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.300 
increase my brush size and maybe I'll
switch<00:02:56.510> out<00:02:56.720> to<00:02:57.170> one<00:02:57.320> of<00:02:57.410> those<00:02:57.470> calligraphy

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
switch out to one of those calligraphy

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.150 
switch out to one of those calligraphy
nibs<00:02:58.640> and<00:02:58.910> now<00:02:59.420> create<00:03:00.020> you<00:03:00.650> know<00:03:00.739> something

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
nibs and now create you know something

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.130 
nibs and now create you know something
like<00:03:01.310> this<00:03:01.520> right<00:03:01.910> maybe<00:03:02.120> that's<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.600> the

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
like this right maybe that's the the

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.690 
like this right maybe that's the the
effect<00:03:03.530> I<00:03:03.709> want<00:03:03.980> maybe<00:03:04.190> some<00:03:04.459> kind<00:03:04.580> of

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
effect I want maybe some kind of

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.000 
effect I want maybe some kind of
scrolling<00:03:05.630> effect<00:03:05.930> or<00:03:06.410> something<00:03:06.709> like<00:03:06.800> this

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
scrolling effect or something like this

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.240 
scrolling effect or something like this
again<00:03:07.610> controller<00:03:08.420> command<00:03:08.930> a<00:03:09.110> and<00:03:09.290> delete<00:03:10.100> on

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
again controller command a and delete on

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.460 
again controller command a and delete on
your<00:03:10.280> keyboard<00:03:10.430> to<00:03:11.030> reset<00:03:11.989> things<00:03:12.170> for

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
your keyboard to reset things for

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.530 
your keyboard to reset things for
yourself<00:03:12.860> so<00:03:13.430> it's<00:03:13.580> always<00:03:13.700> important<00:03:14.270> to

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
yourself so it's always important to

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.750 
yourself so it's always important to
experiment<00:03:15.260> along<00:03:15.860> and<00:03:16.130> see<00:03:16.370> what<00:03:16.489> you<00:03:16.640> can

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
experiment along and see what you can

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.240 
experiment along and see what you can
come<00:03:16.940> up<00:03:17.090> with<00:03:17.120> here<00:03:17.570> in<00:03:17.720> terms<00:03:18.080> of<00:03:18.530> your

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
come up with here in terms of your

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.130 
come up with here in terms of your
different<00:03:19.610> effects<00:03:19.970> and<00:03:20.330> your<00:03:20.959> different

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
different effects and your different

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.990 
different effects and your different
options<00:03:21.410> that<00:03:21.950> we<00:03:22.070> have<00:03:22.250> available<00:03:22.280> here<00:03:22.970> so

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
options that we have available here so

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.330 
options that we have available here so
there<00:03:23.269> we<00:03:23.390> go<00:03:23.420> maybe<00:03:23.690> something<00:03:24.110> like<00:03:24.230> that<00:03:24.410> so

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
there we go maybe something like that so

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.039 
there we go maybe something like that so
hopefully<00:03:25.730> pretty<00:03:25.910> straightforward<00:03:26.750> again

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
hopefully pretty straightforward again

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.070 
hopefully pretty straightforward again
it<00:03:27.290> isn't<00:03:27.590> anything<00:03:28.010> too<00:03:28.540> insane<00:03:29.540> or<00:03:29.750> crazy

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
it isn't anything too insane or crazy

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.140 
it isn't anything too insane or crazy
here<00:03:30.440> we<00:03:30.560> haven't<00:03:30.860> gone<00:03:31.250> to<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.430> insane<00:03:31.820> crazy

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
here we haven't gone to the insane crazy

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.060 
here we haven't gone to the insane crazy
stuff<00:03:32.450> just<00:03:32.690> yet<00:03:32.900> but<00:03:33.350> if<00:03:33.470> you<00:03:33.560> want

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
stuff just yet but if you want

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.800 
stuff just yet but if you want
once<00:03:34.489> again<00:03:34.640> you<00:03:34.910> can<00:03:34.940> move<00:03:35.180> your<00:03:35.360> eyeballs

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
once again you can move your eyeballs

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.990 
once again you can move your eyeballs
over<00:03:36.290> into<00:03:36.680> your<00:03:36.769> properties<00:03:37.310> panel<00:03:37.549> and<00:03:37.760> have

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
over into your properties panel and have

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.940 
over into your properties panel and have
a<00:03:38.030> look<00:03:38.269> there<00:03:38.510> there's<00:03:38.900> our<00:03:39.110> fill<00:03:39.380> color<00:03:39.680> once

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
a look there there's our fill color once

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:40.360 
a look there there's our fill color once
again

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
again

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.070 
again
another<00:03:40.730> spot<00:03:41.120> where<00:03:41.180> we<00:03:41.420> can<00:03:41.510> go<00:03:41.660> and<00:03:41.780> set<00:03:41.989> our

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
another spot where we can go and set our

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.860 
another spot where we can go and set our
fill<00:03:42.320> color<00:03:42.560> all<00:03:43.190> of<00:03:43.610> the<00:03:43.790> stroke<00:03:44.600> related

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
fill color all of the stroke related

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.800 
fill color all of the stroke related
options<00:03:45.620> like<00:03:46.190> the<00:03:46.430> align<00:03:46.940> style<00:03:47.450> the

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
options like the align style the

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.050 
options like the align style the
thickness<00:03:48.410> of<00:03:48.709> the<00:03:48.980> stroke<00:03:49.459> line<00:03:49.700> and<00:03:49.850> so<00:03:49.940> on

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
thickness of the stroke line and so on

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.580 
thickness of the stroke line and so on
they're<00:03:50.209> all<00:03:50.360> great<00:03:50.750> at<00:03:50.959> we<00:03:51.080> can't<00:03:51.320> change

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
they're all great at we can't change

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.170 
they're all great at we can't change
them<00:03:51.830> the<00:03:52.310> only<00:03:52.489> thing<00:03:52.610> that<00:03:52.730> we<00:03:52.820> do<00:03:53.030> have

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
them the only thing that we do have

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.110 
them the only thing that we do have
access<00:03:53.390> to<00:03:53.630> is<00:03:54.019> smoothing<00:03:54.500> and<00:03:55.120> smoothing

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
access to is smoothing and smoothing

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.170 
access to is smoothing and smoothing
works<00:03:56.480> here<00:03:57.110> for<00:03:57.739> the<00:03:57.950> paintbrush<00:03:58.340> tool<00:03:58.549> in

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
works here for the paintbrush tool in

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.150 
works here for the paintbrush tool in
exactly<00:03:59.720> the<00:03:59.870> same<00:04:00.080> way<00:04:00.230> as<00:04:00.350> it<00:04:00.500> works<00:04:00.709> for<00:04:01.010> the

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
exactly the same way as it works for the

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.650 
exactly the same way as it works for the
pencil<00:04:01.610> tool<00:04:01.790> and<00:04:01.820> again<00:04:02.030> that's<00:04:02.330> how<00:04:02.420> much

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
pencil tool and again that's how much

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.580 
pencil tool and again that's how much
influence<00:04:03.049> flash<00:04:03.590> has<00:04:03.980> over<00:04:04.880> our<00:04:05.180> work<00:04:05.870> so<00:04:06.500> if

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
influence flash has over our work so if

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.590 
influence flash has over our work so if
I<00:04:06.680> wanted<00:04:06.950> to<00:04:07.010> I<00:04:07.100> could<00:04:07.340> crank<00:04:07.820> up<00:04:08.090> the

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
I wanted to I could crank up the

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.410 
I wanted to I could crank up the
smoothing<00:04:09.380> value<00:04:09.680> to<00:04:09.829> a<00:04:09.860> higher<00:04:10.190> value<00:04:10.549> thus

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
smoothing value to a higher value thus

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.710 
smoothing value to a higher value thus
giving<00:04:11.989> Flash<00:04:12.380> a<00:04:12.680> greater<00:04:13.400> influence<00:04:13.760> over<00:04:14.480> my

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
giving Flash a greater influence over my

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.199 
giving Flash a greater influence over my
work<00:04:14.930> or<00:04:15.200> I<00:04:15.500> could<00:04:15.829> reduce<00:04:16.280> down<00:04:16.700> this

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
work or I could reduce down this

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.719 
work or I could reduce down this
smoothing<00:04:17.930> effect<00:04:18.049> maybe<00:04:18.470> down<00:04:18.769> maybe<00:04:19.340> around

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
smoothing effect maybe down maybe around

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.240 
smoothing effect maybe down maybe around
10<00:04:20.150> or<00:04:20.180> 15<00:04:20.810> or<00:04:20.930> something<00:04:21.200> like<00:04:21.290> that<00:04:21.350> and<00:04:21.709> that

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
10 or 15 or something like that and that

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.330 
10 or 15 or something like that and that
gives<00:04:22.490> flash<00:04:22.940> less<00:04:23.510> of<00:04:23.840> an<00:04:23.960> influence<00:04:24.140> over<00:04:25.010> my

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
gives flash less of an influence over my

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.980 
gives flash less of an influence over my
work<00:04:25.550> or<00:04:25.789> you<00:04:25.940> can<00:04:25.970> go<00:04:26.240> with<00:04:26.690> the

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
work or you can go with the

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.089 
work or you can go with the
old<00:04:27.139> midway<00:04:27.770> point<00:04:28.039> there<00:04:28.310> 50%<00:04:29.150> there<00:04:29.660> we<00:04:29.840> are

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:30.099 
old midway point there 50% there we are

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:32.830 
old midway point there 50% there we are
so<00:04:31.099> I<00:04:31.130> hope<00:04:31.310> that<00:04:31.370> makes<00:04:31.610> sense<00:04:31.759> this<00:04:32.419> is<00:04:32.479> meant

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
so I hope that makes sense this is meant

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.870 
so I hope that makes sense this is meant
to<00:04:32.900> really<00:04:33.289> just<00:04:33.500> be<00:04:33.620> a<00:04:33.650> brief<00:04:34.099> introduction

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
to really just be a brief introduction

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.960 
to really just be a brief introduction
to<00:04:35.120> the<00:04:35.780> paintbrush<00:04:36.680> tool<00:04:36.919> what<00:04:37.490> I<00:04:37.520> now<00:04:37.729> want

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
to the paintbrush tool what I now want

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.110 
to the paintbrush tool what I now want
to<00:04:38.030> do<00:04:38.210> is<00:04:38.360> I<00:04:38.449> want<00:04:38.599> to<00:04:38.630> take<00:04:38.810> a<00:04:38.870> closer<00:04:39.289> look<00:04:39.680> at

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
to do is I want to take a closer look at

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.300 
to do is I want to take a closer look at
Flash's<00:04:41.120> paintbrush<00:04:41.930> modes<00:04:42.590> this<00:04:42.919> is<00:04:43.099> where

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
Flash's paintbrush modes this is where

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.159 
Flash's paintbrush modes this is where
things<00:04:43.970> start<00:04:44.120> getting<00:04:44.449> a<00:04:44.630> little<00:04:44.840> bit<00:04:45.020> more

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
things start getting a little bit more

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.400 
things start getting a little bit more
interesting<00:04:45.620> let's<00:04:45.710> go<00:04:45.889> and<00:04:46.039> check<00:04:46.160> it<00:04:46.220> out
