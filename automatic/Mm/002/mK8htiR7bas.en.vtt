three down went flying forward I really

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.199 
three down went flying forward I really
didn't<00:03:42.300> like<00:03:42.450> that<00:03:42.690> and<00:03:43.099> it<00:03:44.099> has<00:03:44.310> very<00:03:44.580> not<00:03:44.849> our

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
didn't like that and it has very not our

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.199 
didn't like that and it has very not our
field<00:03:45.660> of<00:03:45.780> view<00:03:45.959> so<00:03:46.530> video<00:03:47.370> is<00:03:47.519> more<00:03:47.730> shaking

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
field of view so video is more shaking

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.770 
field of view so video is more shaking
and<00:03:48.330> you<00:03:48.780> have<00:03:48.989> to<00:03:49.170> fly<00:03:49.380> much<00:03:49.620> higher<00:03:50.690> video<00:03:51.690> is

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
and you have to fly much higher video is

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.170

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
annoyance is that video is not saved if

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.789 
annoyance is that video is not saved if
