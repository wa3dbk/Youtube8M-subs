horizon a game that is a tower defense
that<00:00:05.520> is<00:00:05.609> available<00:00:05.819> now<00:00:06.089> on<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.600> PlayStation

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.410 
that is available now on the PlayStation
4<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:08.040> it's<00:00:08.460> actually<00:00:08.790> pretty<00:00:09.030> good<00:00:09.210> I've

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
4 and it's actually pretty good I've

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.299 
4 and it's actually pretty good I've
been<00:00:09.599> enjoying<00:00:09.750> it<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.290> lot<00:00:10.320> it<00:00:10.559> is<00:00:10.710> very<00:00:11.070> very

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
been enjoying it a lot it is very very

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.759 
been enjoying it a lot it is very very
fast-paced<00:00:11.849> in<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.900> meaning<00:00:13.200> that<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.500> level

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
fast-paced in the meaning that a level

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.890 
fast-paced in the meaning that a level
usually<00:00:14.190> doesn't<00:00:14.700> last<00:00:14.880> more<00:00:15.150> than<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.360> minute

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
usually doesn't last more than a minute

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.380 
usually doesn't last more than a minute
or<00:00:16.020> two<00:00:16.320> there<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:16.830> actually<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.760> large<00:00:18.029> amount

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
or two there is actually a large amount

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.580 
or two there is actually a large amount
of<00:00:18.420> different<00:00:18.720> acts<00:00:18.930> in<00:00:19.140> different<00:00:19.410> levels

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
of different acts in different levels

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.590 
of different acts in different levels
and<00:00:19.859> different<00:00:19.920> objectives<00:00:20.670> per<00:00:20.939> level<00:00:21.150> so

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
and different objectives per level so

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.790 
and different objectives per level so
it's<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.750> little<00:00:21.990> hard<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.260> explain

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
it's a little hard to explain

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.220 
it's a little hard to explain
definitively<00:00:23.580> but<00:00:24.269> overall<00:00:24.570> it's<00:00:24.990> a

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
definitively but overall it's a

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.130 
definitively but overall it's a
fast-paced<00:00:25.680> tower<00:00:26.400> defense<00:00:26.869> we're<00:00:27.869> hopping

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
fast-paced tower defense we're hopping

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.349 
fast-paced tower defense we're hopping
into<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.380> level<00:00:28.650> here<00:00:28.769> with<00:00:28.890> Vega<00:00:29.099> Delta<00:00:29.550> 8<00:00:29.699> very

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
into a level here with Vega Delta 8 very

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.690 
into a level here with Vega Delta 8 very
early<00:00:30.720> in<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.900> game<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.320> like<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.070> said<00:00:32.130> it's<00:00:32.579> a

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
early in the game and like I said it's a

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.000 
early in the game and like I said it's a
purely<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.149> tower<00:00:33.390> defense<00:00:33.809> relatively<00:00:34.590> simple

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
purely a tower defense relatively simple

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.340 
purely a tower defense relatively simple
and<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.610> has<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:36.030> fast-paced<00:00:36.690> style<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.320> it

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
and it has that fast-paced style to it

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.110 
and it has that fast-paced style to it
that's<00:00:37.649> where<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.010> big<00:00:38.219> effectiveness<00:00:38.879> is

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
that's where the big effectiveness is

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.330 
that's where the big effectiveness is
and<00:00:39.420> basically<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:40.170> have<00:00:40.320> your<00:00:40.500> turrets<00:00:40.860> you

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
and basically you have your turrets you

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.340 
and basically you have your turrets you
have<00:00:41.610> these<00:00:42.090> little<00:00:42.329> towers<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:42.989> will<00:00:43.170> help

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
have these little towers that will help

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.930 
have these little towers that will help
you<00:00:43.530> gain<00:00:43.770> more<00:00:43.980> energy<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.610> make<00:00:44.789> more

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
you gain more energy to make more

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.819 
you gain more energy to make more
turrets<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.840> can<00:00:45.989> also<00:00:46.170> upgrade<00:00:46.530> the

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
turrets and you can also upgrade the

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.889 
turrets and you can also upgrade the
Turks<00:00:47.039> right<00:00:47.309> now<00:00:47.460> we<00:00:47.520> are<00:00:47.730> defending<00:00:48.090> escape

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
Turks right now we are defending escape

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.170 
Turks right now we are defending escape
pod<00:00:49.170> basically<00:00:49.800> if<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.280> enemy<00:00:50.550> destroys<00:00:50.940> that

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
pod basically if the enemy destroys that

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.330 
pod basically if the enemy destroys that
then<00:00:51.420> we<00:00:51.570> lose<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.320> our<00:00:52.440> main<00:00:52.739> goal<00:00:53.129> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
then we lose this is our main goal the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.740 
then we lose this is our main goal the
main<00:00:53.489> thing<00:00:53.730> we're<00:00:53.879> defending<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.539> tower

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
main thing we're defending in this tower

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.930 
main thing we're defending in this tower
defense<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.920> basically<00:00:56.460> it's<00:00:56.760> very

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
defense so basically it's very

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.549 
defense so basically it's very
fast-paced<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.690> shouldn't<00:00:57.960> last<00:00:58.079> more<00:00:58.230> than<00:00:58.379> a

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
fast-paced it shouldn't last more than a

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.599 
fast-paced it shouldn't last more than a
minute<00:00:58.649> or<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.340> but<00:00:59.910> we<00:00:59.969> have<00:01:00.120> these<00:01:00.420> bug<00:01:01.289> like

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
minute or so but we have these bug like

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:03.650 
minute or so but we have these bug like
robots<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.789> are<00:01:02.879> taking<00:01:03.210> over<00:01:03.420> all<00:01:03.629> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
robots that are taking over all the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.350 
robots that are taking over all the
planets<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.530> we<00:01:04.680> can<00:01:04.830> upgrade<00:01:05.010> these<00:01:05.489> very

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
planets so we can upgrade these very

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.910 
planets so we can upgrade these very
quickly<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.049> can<00:01:07.110> see<00:01:07.320> just<00:01:07.439> how<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.650> UI

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
quickly and you can see just how the UI

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.160 
quickly and you can see just how the UI
works<00:01:08.430> it's<00:01:08.670> very<00:01:08.729> very<00:01:09.090> quick<00:01:09.390> go<00:01:09.810> over<00:01:09.990> here

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
works it's very very quick go over here

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.690 
works it's very very quick go over here
and<00:01:10.229> we<00:01:10.380> can<00:01:10.500> upgrade<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:11.040> as<00:01:11.220> soon<00:01:11.400> as<00:01:11.549> it

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
and we can upgrade this as soon as it

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.340 
and we can upgrade this as soon as it
generates<00:01:12.030> more<00:01:12.270> energy<00:01:12.330> there<00:01:12.840> we<00:01:12.960> go<00:01:13.110> and

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
generates more energy there we go and

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.800 
generates more energy there we go and
Elvia<00:01:13.619> generating<00:01:14.610> more<00:01:14.790> energy<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.390> it's

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
Elvia generating more energy and it's

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.539 
Elvia generating more energy and it's
like<00:01:15.930> it's<00:01:16.080> very<00:01:16.320> limited<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:16.830> earlier<00:01:17.280> part

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
like it's very limited this earlier part

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.249 
like it's very limited this earlier part
of<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.729> game<00:01:17.909> but<00:01:18.090> basically<00:01:18.420> when<00:01:18.689> -<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:19.049> want

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
of the game but basically when - we want

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.920 
of the game but basically when - we want
to<00:01:19.320> upgrade<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.430> escape<00:01:20.909> pod<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.780> is

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
to upgrade the escape pod so that it is

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.240 
to upgrade the escape pod so that it is
ready<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.200> leave<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.740> then<00:01:22.860> we<00:01:23.009> need<00:01:23.159> to

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
ready to leave and then we need to

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.770 
ready to leave and then we need to
defend<00:01:23.490> long<00:01:23.759> enough<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.570> leaps

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
defend long enough so that it leaps

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.980 
defend long enough so that it leaps
properly<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.790> also<00:01:26.970> get<00:01:27.299> bonus<00:01:27.750> stars

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
properly and you also get bonus stars

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.710 
properly and you also get bonus stars
for<00:01:28.229> completing<00:01:28.680> bonus<00:01:29.299> objectives<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:30.509> those

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
for completing bonus objectives in those

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.170 
for completing bonus objectives in those
change<00:01:31.079> level<00:01:31.439> per<00:01:31.619> level<00:01:31.799> maybe<00:01:32.369> it's<00:01:32.700> being

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
change level per level maybe it's being

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.999 
change level per level maybe it's being
able<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.479> defeat<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.020> level<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.799> certain

amount<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.220> time<00:01:35.460> are<00:01:35.729> doing<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.119> with<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.570> soon

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930

amount of time are doing it with it soon
you<00:01:37.229> know<00:01:37.320> doing<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.220> certainly<00:01:38.880> well<00:01:39.240> and

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
you know doing it certainly well and

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.420 
you know doing it certainly well and
overall<00:01:40.259> it's<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.590> really<00:01:40.890> interesting<00:01:41.070> tower

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
overall it's a really interesting tower

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.179 
overall it's a really interesting tower
defense<00:01:41.790> it's<00:01:42.090> not<00:01:42.780> like<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.619> know<00:01:43.770> something

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
defense it's not like you know something

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.100 
defense it's not like you know something
groundbreaking<00:01:45.000> but<00:01:45.149> overall<00:01:45.450> it's<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.840> fun

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
groundbreaking but overall it's a fun

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.690 
groundbreaking but overall it's a fun
one<00:01:46.320> if<00:01:46.500> you're<00:01:46.649> interested<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.399> genre

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
and you don't have that much to play it

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.179 
and you don't have that much to play it
is<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.030> really<00:01:51.509> really<00:01:51.659> good<00:01:51.960> one<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.470> let's<00:01:53.040> uh

is a really really good one and let's uh

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.310 
is a really really good one and let's uh
launch<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.149> guy<00:01:54.360> that'll<00:01:54.750> in<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.990> second

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
will win as you can see here it is very

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.639 
will win as you can see here it is very
very<00:01:59.520> quick<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.210> it's<00:02:00.479> like<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:00.899> for<00:02:01.110> every

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
very quick and it's like this for every

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.620 
very quick and it's like this for every
single<00:02:02.009> level<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.520> quick<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.060> it's<00:02:03.479> that

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
single level that quick and it's that

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.060 
single level that quick and it's that
sort<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.140> quickness<00:02:04.409> that's<00:02:04.740> actually

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
sort of that quickness that's actually

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.560 
sort of that quickness that's actually
quite<00:02:05.250> refreshing<00:02:05.759> let's<00:02:06.060> try<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.240> go<00:02:06.420> into

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
quite refreshing let's try to go into

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.719 
quite refreshing let's try to go into
another<00:02:06.960> level<00:02:07.229> here<00:02:07.560> maybe<00:02:08.039> we<00:02:08.220> can<00:02:08.399> go<00:02:08.550> over

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
another level here maybe we can go over

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.360 
another level here maybe we can go over
to<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:09.090> Nandu<00:02:09.869> here<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.440> see<00:02:11.069> what<00:02:11.190> we<00:02:11.280> got

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
to a Nandu here and see what we got

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.390 
to a Nandu here and see what we got
going<00:02:11.430> on<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:11.910> know

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
going on you know

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.679 
going on you know
actually<00:02:12.610> had<00:02:12.700> a<00:02:12.730> level<00:02:13.150> I<00:02:13.180> wanted<00:02:13.629> to

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:13.689 
actually had a level I wanted to

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:15.449 
actually had a level I wanted to
show<00:02:13.810> off<00:02:13.959> here<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.500> I<00:02:14.980> think<00:02:15.189> that's<00:02:15.310> this

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
show off here and I think that's this

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.770 
show off here and I think that's this
one<00:02:16.019> so<00:02:17.019> basically<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.890> can<00:02:18.269> sometimes<00:02:19.269> get<00:02:19.540> a

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
one so basically you can sometimes get a

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.990 
one so basically you can sometimes get a
kill<00:02:20.470> streak<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:21.040> be<00:02:21.159> able<00:02:21.280> to<00:02:21.370> kill<00:02:21.640> people

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
kill streak and be able to kill people

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.210 
kill streak and be able to kill people
from<00:02:22.180> above<00:02:22.750> now<00:02:23.349> I'm<00:02:23.560> sort<00:02:23.829> of<00:02:23.890> showing<00:02:24.129> that

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
from above now I'm sort of showing that

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.000 
from above now I'm sort of showing that
off<00:02:24.430> in<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.700> level<00:02:24.970> that<00:02:25.060> is<00:02:25.209> specifically<00:02:25.870> for

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
off in a level that is specifically for

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.110 
off in a level that is specifically for
doing<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.129> kill<00:02:27.310> streaks<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:27.790> it<00:02:27.879> sort<00:02:28.060> of

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
doing the kill streaks and it sort of

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.729 
doing the kill streaks and it sort of
shows<00:02:28.299> that<00:02:28.659> there's<00:02:28.870> sort<00:02:28.930> of<00:02:29.019> a<00:02:29.109> variety<00:02:29.319> of

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
shows that there's sort of a variety of

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.920 
shows that there's sort of a variety of
levels<00:02:30.040> that<00:02:30.280> have<00:02:30.700> a<00:02:30.730> variety<00:02:30.970> of<00:02:31.239> tasks<00:02:31.900> that

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
levels that have a variety of tasks that

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.530 
levels that have a variety of tasks that
sort<00:02:32.530> of<00:02:32.560> combines<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.220> ideas<00:02:33.579> for<00:02:33.760> later<00:02:34.030> but

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
sort of combines the ideas for later but

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.030 
sort of combines the ideas for later but
overall<00:02:34.810> it's<00:02:35.109> really<00:02:35.439> cool<00:02:35.620> it<00:02:35.769> gives<00:02:35.920> you<00:02:36.010> a

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
overall it's really cool it gives you a

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.099 
overall it's really cool it gives you a
good<00:02:36.340> bit<00:02:36.549> of<00:02:36.700> variety<00:02:36.909> and<00:02:37.269> enjoy<00:02:37.629> ability

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
good bit of variety and enjoy ability

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:40.349 
good bit of variety and enjoy ability
and<00:02:38.290> overall<00:02:39.069> I<00:02:39.099> really<00:02:39.519> like<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.909> game<00:02:40.060> it's

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:40.359 
and overall I really like the game it's

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:42.780 
and overall I really like the game it's
it's<00:02:40.689> I<00:02:40.930> usually<00:02:41.379> don't<00:02:41.500> play<00:02:41.680> tower<00:02:41.950> defense

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
it's I usually don't play tower defense

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.879 
it's I usually don't play tower defense
as<00:02:42.939> much<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:43.510> I<00:02:43.780> also<00:02:43.959> like<00:02:44.319> quicker<00:02:44.590> pace

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:44.889 
as much and I also like quicker pace

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:46.680 
as much and I also like quicker pace
games<00:02:45.220> so<00:02:45.459> this<00:02:45.579> is<00:02:45.790> right<00:02:45.970> up<00:02:46.120> my<00:02:46.150> alley

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
games so this is right up my alley

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.780 
games so this is right up my alley
one<00:02:47.440> thing<00:02:47.620> I<00:02:47.709> would<00:02:47.950> say<00:02:48.129> that<00:02:48.159> graphically

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
one thing I would say that graphically

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.729 
one thing I would say that graphically
the<00:02:48.940> game<00:02:48.970> isn't<00:02:49.389> incredibly<00:02:49.900> impressive<00:02:50.230> the

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
the game isn't incredibly impressive the

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.920 
the game isn't incredibly impressive the
textures<00:02:51.280> really<00:02:51.549> aren't<00:02:51.940> that<00:02:52.180> great<00:02:52.569> in<00:02:52.840> my

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
textures really aren't that great in my

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.960 
textures really aren't that great in my
opinion<00:02:52.959> this<00:02:53.709> overall<00:02:54.159> the<00:02:54.340> game<00:02:54.519> isn't

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
opinion this overall the game isn't

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.179 
opinion this overall the game isn't
worth<00:02:55.150> you<00:02:55.629> know<00:02:55.659> you<00:02:56.200> know<00:02:56.319> checking<00:02:56.829> out<00:02:57.069> the

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:57.189 
worth you know you know checking out the

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:58.979 
worth you know you know checking out the
graphics<00:02:57.579> ports<00:02:57.909> for<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.180> gameplay<00:02:58.359> for<00:02:58.780> sure

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
graphics ports for the gameplay for sure

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.509 
graphics ports for the gameplay for sure
but<00:02:59.500> overall<00:02:59.769> it's<00:02:59.980> a<00:03:00.010> really<00:03:00.099> cool<00:03:00.459> game

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
but overall it's a really cool game

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.059

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
defenses this isn't going to change your

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.890 
defenses this isn't going to change your
mind<00:03:24.069> in<00:03:24.489> any<00:03:24.579> way<00:03:24.819> it's<00:03:25.120> still<00:03:25.480> pretty<00:03:25.720> much

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
mind in any way it's still pretty much

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.770 
mind in any way it's still pretty much
the<00:03:25.959> same<00:03:26.109> thing<00:03:26.620> if<00:03:26.849> the<00:03:27.849> fact<00:03:28.209> that<00:03:28.480> you<00:03:28.629> know

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
the same thing if the fact that you know

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.800 
the same thing if the fact that you know
they're<00:03:29.530> too<00:03:30.459> slow<00:03:30.940> if<00:03:31.269> that's<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.629> only

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
they're too slow if that's the only

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.210 
they're too slow if that's the only
reason<00:03:32.109> you<00:03:32.230> don't<00:03:32.379> like<00:03:32.500> tower<00:03:32.769> defenses

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
reason you don't like tower defenses

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.319 
reason you don't like tower defenses
then<00:03:33.340> maybe<00:03:33.579> you<00:03:33.730> should<00:03:33.879> give<00:03:33.970> this<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.180> try

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
then maybe you should give this a try

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.050 
then maybe you should give this a try
but<00:03:34.690> overall<00:03:35.680> it's<00:03:35.949> it's<00:03:36.280> still<00:03:36.609> the<00:03:36.849> same

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
but overall it's it's still the same

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.089 
but overall it's it's still the same
part<00:03:37.329> of<00:03:37.419> the<00:03:37.540> same<00:03:37.720> genre<00:03:38.109> there's<00:03:38.739> nothing

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
part of the same genre there's nothing

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.119 
part of the same genre there's nothing
you<00:03:39.220> know<00:03:39.340> changing<00:03:39.970> it<00:03:40.090> in<00:03:40.239> a<00:03:40.690> large<00:03:41.109> way<00:03:41.620> so

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:42.129 
you know changing it in a large way so

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:44.129
