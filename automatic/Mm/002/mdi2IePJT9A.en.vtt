00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:09.560
 Epistle of the Apostle Saint Paul to the 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:12.440
 Roman Romans chapter 4 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:15.280
 let's talk about abraham our father 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.270
 according to the meat 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:22.260
 what was the novelty in him 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.070
 abraham was right before god 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:30.180
 and if he had got it for his works 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:33.810
 could show off its merits but not the 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:38.280
 has before God in fact what the 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:42.170
 writing abraham believed god who 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.960
 he only took into account for doing the right thing 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.600
 when someone has performed a work or 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.030
 work 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.410
 you are not given the salary as a 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:55.739
 please but as a debt 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.309
 On the contrary, he can not 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.580
 present works but believe in one that 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:08.070
 makes sinners fair you will be taken 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:11.340
 consider your faith to do what is right 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.790
 so david congratulates the god that counts 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.530
 among the righteous without it being the fruit of 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.770
 his work 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.979
 happy those whose sins have been 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.780
 forgiven and whose offenses have been 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.630
 forgotten 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.799
 happy man who god does not take 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.770
 consider your sin this happiness is 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.000
 reserved only for the circumcised or 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.920
 it's also for the uncircumcised 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.369
 we just said that it was taken into account 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.990
 the faith of abraham to tell it among the 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.620
 fair 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.270
 but 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:54.510
 when that happened 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:57.200
 before circumcising it or after 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.200
 certainly play before 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.049
 he just received the rite of 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.990
 circumcision as a seal or as a 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:09.739
 sign of justice they receive 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:13.599
 those who believe when not yet 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.599
 they are circumcised 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.560
 so that abraham is the father of all 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.020
 those who believe without having been 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.980
 circumcised 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:29.990
 and God takes it into account for 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:34.520
 make them righteous and holy 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:36.100
 and also father of the Jewish people with 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.300
 such 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:42.370
 Do not be content with circumcision 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:46.510
 but also follow the traces of 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:50.500
 our father abraham who believed when 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:53.050
 I was not yet circumcised it 's easy 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:58.030
 see that the promise made by god to 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:01.600
 abraham or rather his offspring of 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.700
 that the world would belong to him was not 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.150
 fruit of the law 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.400
 but of the new justice that seeks 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.680
 faith 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.360
 if we should comply with the law for 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:20.470
 get the promise the faith would no longer have 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.700
 meaning and the promise would also stay 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:27.349
 nothing 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:30.250
 because the law only brings condemnation law and 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:37.890
 transgression go together 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:37.890
 That is why faith is the way and everything is a gift 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:45.260
 in this way the promise of abraham remains 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:47.750
 insured for your entire race because not only 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.900
 for their children according to the law but also 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.780
 for those who are children by faith 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:57.360
 his 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:04:01.000
 abraham is the father of all of us 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.870
 as the writing says 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.500
 I make you the father of many nations and arrived 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:13.030
 to do it when he believed in the one who gives 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:16.180
 life to the dead and calls to exist what 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.359
 that does not exist yet 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:23.199
 abraham believed and waited against all 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:27.440
 hope becoming the father of many 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:29.900
 nations as they had told him 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.009
 look with numerous will be your 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:36.569
 decendents 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:39.790
 I do not waver in your faith forgetting that your 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:43.120
 body could no longer give life 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:46.240
 I was then about 100 years old 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.990
 and that his wife Sarah could no longer have 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.320
 children 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:56.360
 I do not doubt God's promise or stop 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:57.440
 believe instead his faith gave him 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.569
 forces 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.899
 and god glory to god 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:08.380
 fully convinced that when god 

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:12.010
 promises something has power to fulfill it 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:14.670
 and God took that faith into account for 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.950
 do it right 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:22.000
 his faith was taken into account 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:24.940
 these words of writing not only 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.540
 they are addressed to him but also to 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:32.800
 we will be taken into account our 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:36.870
 faith in him who rose from among the 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.870
 dead to jesus our lord 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.160
 although it was delivered by our 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:48.360
 sins was resurrected so that 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:48.360
 let us enter the life of righteous glory to God
