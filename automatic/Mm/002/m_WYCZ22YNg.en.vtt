00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.720 
I've noticed that when he gets hit by
the<00:02:43.600> lunar<00:02:43.810> rover<00:02:44.200> yeah<00:02:44.470> but<00:02:44.920> I<00:02:45.100> don't<00:02:45.549> think

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
the lunar rover yeah but I don't think

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:46.170 
the lunar rover yeah but I don't think
so

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
so

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.910 
so
it's<00:02:46.390> supposed<00:02:46.570> to<00:02:46.630> be<00:02:46.750> to<00:02:46.959> hit<00:02:47.200> stuff<00:02:47.410> because

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
it's supposed to be to hit stuff because

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.560 
it's supposed to be to hit stuff because
it<00:02:48.160> pops<00:02:48.549> you<00:02:48.760> up<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:49.030> then<00:02:49.120> explodes<00:02:49.450> right

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
it pops you up and then explodes right

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.900 
it pops you up and then explodes right
okay<00:02:50.290> yeah<00:02:50.410> oh<00:02:50.440> it<00:02:50.680> looked<00:02:50.890> like<00:02:51.070> he<00:02:51.250> STI<00:02:51.579> had<00:02:51.760> a

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
okay yeah oh it looked like he STI had a

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.460 
okay yeah oh it looked like he STI had a
little<00:02:52.209> bit<00:02:52.329> of<00:02:52.360> first<00:02:52.690> one<00:02:52.870> he<00:02:53.019> did<00:02:53.200> then<00:02:53.440> that

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
little bit of first one he did then that

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.560 
little bit of first one he did then that
one<00:02:53.769> interested<00:02:54.160> I<00:02:54.549> guess<00:02:55.180> he's<00:02:55.299> not<00:02:55.329> throwing

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
one interested I guess he's not throwing

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.870 
one interested I guess he's not throwing
it<00:02:55.750> out<00:02:55.870> I<00:02:56.370> honestly<00:02:57.370> I<00:02:57.459> don't<00:02:57.640> know<00:02:57.730> if<00:02:57.790> you

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
can do it maybe it's just something

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.500 
can do it maybe it's just something
that's<00:03:01.299> doable<00:03:02.070> it<00:03:03.070> seems<00:03:03.340> very<00:03:03.430> set<00:03:03.940> at<00:03:04.269> no

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510
