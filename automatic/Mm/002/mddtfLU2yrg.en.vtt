00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
obviously doesn't scream fall at all but

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.330 
obviously doesn't scream fall at all but
yet<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.600> fallout<00:01:30.930> casting<00:01:31.650> document<00:01:32.130> and

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
yet it is a fallout casting document and

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.580 
yet it is a fallout casting document and
so<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.479> thought<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.200> was<00:01:34.380> interesting

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
so I thought this was interesting

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.260 
so I thought this was interesting
because<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.340> kind<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.670> relates<00:01:35.970> back<00:01:36.210> to

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
because it kind of relates back to

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.600 
because it kind of relates back to
Boston<00:01:36.930> where<00:01:37.409> everyone<00:01:37.979> was<00:01:38.159> thinking<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
Boston where everyone was thinking the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.219 
Boston where everyone was thinking the
game's<00:01:38.790> gonna<00:01:39.180> be<00:01:39.270> said<00:01:39.570> still<00:01:39.900> think<00:01:40.110> it's

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
game's gonna be said still think it's

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.840 
game's gonna be said still think it's
going<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.409> be<00:01:40.470> set<00:01:40.799> because<00:01:41.520> that's<00:01:41.670> where<00:01:41.820> the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
going to be set because that's where the

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.539 
going to be set because that's where the
survivor<00:01:42.180> 2299<00:01:42.600> was<00:01:43.259> pointing<00:01:43.740> that's<00:01:44.189> where

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
survivor 2299 was pointing that's where

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.240 
survivor 2299 was pointing that's where
the<00:01:44.909> reddit<00:01:45.600> quote<00:01:46.079> leaked<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.799> ended<00:01:47.189> up

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
the reddit quote leaked that ended up

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.639 
the reddit quote leaked that ended up
actually<00:01:47.490> being<00:01:47.850> fake<00:01:48.210> pointed<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.290> everyone

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
actually being fake pointed so everyone

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.679 
actually being fake pointed so everyone
was<00:01:49.770> kind<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.040> thinking<00:01:50.159> Boston<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.000> now<00:01:51.450> it's

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
was kind of thinking Boston and now it's

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.420 
was kind of thinking Boston and now it's
interesting<00:01:51.990> in<00:01:52.290> my<00:01:52.380> opinion<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.920> if<00:01:53.130> this

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
interesting in my opinion that if this

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.280 
interesting in my opinion that if this
is<00:01:53.939> an<00:01:54.119> actual<00:01:54.270> intentional<00:01:54.930> leaked<00:01:55.110> by

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
is an actual intentional leaked by

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.730 
is an actual intentional leaked by
Bethesda<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.100> Kotaku<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:57.360> maybe<00:01:57.930> Bethesda

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
Bethesda to Kotaku that maybe Bethesda

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.289 
Bethesda to Kotaku that maybe Bethesda
went<00:01:58.979> ahead<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.280> said<00:01:59.490> putting<00:01:59.700> in<00:01:59.880> Boston

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
went ahead and said putting in Boston

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.639 
went ahead and said putting in Boston
lead<00:02:00.479> them<00:02:00.630> down<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.869> wrong<00:02:01.020> path<00:02:01.170> let<00:02:01.500> them

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
lead them down the wrong path let them

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:02.929 
lead them down the wrong path let them
think<00:02:01.829> it's<00:02:02.040> Boston<00:02:02.399> so<00:02:02.520> when<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.729> game's

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
think it's Boston so when the game's

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.330 
think it's Boston so when the game's
revealed<00:02:03.329> it's<00:02:03.600> in<00:02:04.049> Chicago<00:02:04.799> something<00:02:05.189> like

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
revealed it's in Chicago something like

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.010 
revealed it's in Chicago something like
that<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:06.240> that's<00:02:06.450> kind<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:06.719> my<00:02:06.810> thoughts

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
that and so that's kind of my thoughts

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.199 
that and so that's kind of my thoughts
on<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.350> there<00:02:07.500> um<00:02:07.710> but<00:02:08.009> like<00:02:08.310> i<00:02:08.429> said<00:02:08.459> i<00:02:08.640> did

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
on it there um but like i said i did

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.790 
on it there um but like i said i did
mention<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.539> kotaku<00:02:10.289> lost<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.619> bit<00:02:10.770> of

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
mention that kotaku lost a bit of

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.940 
mention that kotaku lost a bit of
credibility

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
credibility

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.650 
credibility
kind<00:02:12.220> of<00:02:12.280> sparked<00:02:12.819> what<00:02:12.970> I<00:02:13.000> believe<00:02:13.330> was<00:02:13.480> this

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
kind of sparked what I believe was this

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.890 
kind of sparked what I believe was this
whole<00:02:13.870> gamergate<00:02:14.620> thing<00:02:15.010> with<00:02:15.970> their<00:02:16.209> whole<00:02:16.450> I

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
whole gamergate thing with their whole I

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.729 
whole gamergate thing with their whole I
think<00:02:17.260> some<00:02:17.800> editor<00:02:18.459> at<00:02:18.640> Kotaku<00:02:19.440> gave<00:02:20.440> some

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
think some editor at Kotaku gave some

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.339 
think some editor at Kotaku gave some
review<00:02:21.430> or<00:02:21.730> some<00:02:21.970> game<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.209> good<00:02:22.540> review<00:02:22.989> and

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
review or some game a good review and

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:24.839 
review or some game a good review and
highly<00:02:23.739> recommended<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:24.430> it<00:02:24.580> helped

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
highly recommended and it helped

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.270 
highly recommended and it helped
increase<00:02:25.000> sales<00:02:25.390> for<00:02:25.569> this<00:02:25.690> game<00:02:25.780> a<00:02:25.840> lot<00:02:26.280> just

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
increase sales for this game a lot just

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.280 
increase sales for this game a lot just
because<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.730> girl<00:02:27.940> who<00:02:28.150> made<00:02:28.390> it<00:02:28.569> slept<00:02:29.140> with

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
because the girl who made it slept with

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.690 
because the girl who made it slept with
him<00:02:29.440> or<00:02:29.650> something<00:02:29.709> like<00:02:30.069> that<00:02:30.130> I<00:02:30.310> think

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
him or something like that I think

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.150 
him or something like that I think
that's<00:02:31.090> how<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.239> story<00:02:31.330> went<00:02:31.720> and<00:02:31.930> so<00:02:32.739> since

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
that's how the story went and so since

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.589 
that's how the story went and so since
that<00:02:33.370> happened<00:02:33.519> Kotaku's<00:02:34.180> lost<00:02:34.360> a<00:02:34.450> lot<00:02:34.569> of

that happened Kotaku's lost a lot of

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.210 
that happened Kotaku's lost a lot of
credit<00:02:34.959> not<00:02:35.050> a<00:02:35.110> lot<00:02:35.290> of<00:02:35.380> people<00:02:35.590> believe<00:02:35.800> what

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
credit not a lot of people believe what

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.800 
credit not a lot of people believe what
they<00:02:36.280> say<00:02:36.610> they<00:02:36.849> get<00:02:36.970> a<00:02:37.000> lot<00:02:37.209> of<00:02:37.239> hate<00:02:37.569> and

they say they get a lot of hate and
although<00:02:38.739> i<00:02:38.769> still<00:02:39.010> use<00:02:39.310> them<00:02:39.489> as<00:02:39.610> a<00:02:39.640> new

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
although i still use them as a new

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.110 
although i still use them as a new
source<00:02:40.120> it<00:02:40.330> does<00:02:40.599> make<00:02:40.959> what<00:02:41.379> they<00:02:41.530> said<00:02:41.799> about

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
source it does make what they said about

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.059 
source it does make what they said about
fallout<00:02:43.120> 4<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.750> lot<00:02:44.110> more<00:02:44.290> skeptical<00:02:44.890> if<00:02:44.980> you

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
fallout 4 a lot more skeptical if you

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.270 
fallout 4 a lot more skeptical if you
ask<00:02:45.280> me<00:02:45.519> because<00:02:45.819> now<00:02:46.500> naturally<00:02:47.500> I<00:02:47.709> think<00:02:48.160> to

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
ask me because now naturally I think to

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.039 
ask me because now naturally I think to
myself<00:02:48.430> well<00:02:49.060> they<00:02:49.420> could<00:02:49.599> have<00:02:49.690> just<00:02:49.750> lied

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
myself well they could have just lied

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.539 
myself well they could have just lied
about<00:02:50.200> that<00:02:50.319> looked<00:02:50.769> like<00:02:50.829> the<00:02:51.010> savior<00:02:51.370> of<00:02:51.400> the

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
about that looked like the savior of the

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.120 
about that looked like the savior of the
day<00:02:51.730> gotten<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.540> ton<00:02:53.049> of<00:02:53.110> hits<00:02:53.560> because<00:02:53.799> that's

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
day gotten a ton of hits because that's

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.190 
day gotten a ton of hits because that's
easy<00:02:54.489> when<00:02:54.819> you<00:02:54.910> type<00:02:55.060> in<00:02:55.180> fall<00:02:55.329> for<00:02:55.599> that<00:02:55.780> is

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
fallout I feel like um just based off

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.140 
fallout I feel like um just based off
the<00:03:23.019> way<00:03:23.170> it<00:03:23.319> looks<00:03:23.590> and<00:03:23.739> stuff<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.790> seems

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
the way it looks and stuff it seems

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.590 
the way it looks and stuff it seems
quite<00:03:25.569> interesting<00:03:26.200> that<00:03:26.230> um<00:03:26.940> it<00:03:27.940> would<00:03:28.420> be

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
quite interesting that um it would be

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.259 
quite interesting that um it would be
fake<00:03:28.900> but<00:03:29.220> it<00:03:30.220> also<00:03:30.400> seems<00:03:30.730> hard<00:03:30.940> to<00:03:31.000> fake

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
fake but it also seems hard to fake

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.080 
fake but it also seems hard to fake
personally<00:03:31.840> but<00:03:32.049> that's<00:03:32.319> just<00:03:32.500> me<00:03:32.709> I<00:03:33.280> just

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
personally but that's just me I just

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.120 
personally but that's just me I just
wish<00:03:34.329> that<00:03:34.569> kotaku<00:03:35.139> went<00:03:35.410> to<00:03:35.530> that<00:03:35.650> extra

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
wish that kotaku went to that extra

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.890 
wish that kotaku went to that extra
length<00:03:36.400> and<00:03:36.639> found<00:03:36.880> a<00:03:37.000> way<00:03:37.150> to<00:03:37.209> kind<00:03:37.450> of<00:03:37.569> reveal

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
length and found a way to kind of reveal

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.590 
length and found a way to kind of reveal
where<00:03:38.739> they<00:03:38.980> got<00:03:39.130> this<00:03:39.340> information<00:03:39.670> from<00:03:40.090> or

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
where they got this information from or

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.259 
where they got this information from or
who<00:03:40.870> they<00:03:41.079> got<00:03:41.260> it<00:03:41.410> from<00:03:41.590> where<00:03:42.370> they<00:03:42.639> were<00:03:42.880> it

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
who they got it from where they were it

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:44.430 
who they got it from where they were it
would<00:03:43.389> be<00:03:43.510> a<00:03:43.540> lot<00:03:43.750> more<00:03:43.810> believable<00:03:44.290> but

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
would be a lot more believable but

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.840 
would be a lot more believable but
instead<00:03:44.739> they<00:03:44.859> took<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.160> route<00:03:45.310> of<00:03:45.340> saying<00:03:45.670> we

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850

instead they took the route of saying we
can't<00:03:46.060> say<00:03:46.269> where<00:03:46.480> we<00:03:46.569> got<00:03:46.720> this<00:03:46.870> from<00:03:47.049> you're
