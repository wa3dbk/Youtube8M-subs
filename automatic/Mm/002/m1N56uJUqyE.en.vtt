00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:06.039 
but mainly it's to be pesticide

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:07.650 
but mainly it's to be pesticide

the toxic waste on crops and so then

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.669 
the toxic waste on crops and so then
plants<00:01:49.209> are<00:01:49.330> very<00:01:49.509> good<00:01:49.750> at<00:01:49.869> absorbing<00:01:50.289> and

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679
