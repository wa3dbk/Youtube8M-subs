00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.220
 Yes 

00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:13.619
 why all his talents today 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:15.159
 mike attempt 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:18.349
 on one side we have to start with something so I will not quote 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:21.050
 this statistic 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.050
 to shut up is not a first 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.890
 I said to myself 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.429
 it would have to start with something 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.429
 henrique it should still be posted a test 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.480
 m 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.780
 cp after turn 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.740
 finally there will be no suspense I can quote directly as this 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.770
 success 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.030
 there I confess I can I am a lot of suspense 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.470
 but I have a little explanation of the modalities 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.900
 earlier mitchell how am I going to make her accept 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.109
 she repeats 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:56.810
 technical culture here is the first technique 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.890
 these tickets yesterday out of position and testing 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.100
 knowing that say its limits 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.300
 irreplaceable why tel 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.710
 so what 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.520
 seductive gamaty and the technique china third country 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.350
 m which is none other than you make five elected 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.200
 after you change why 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.200
 classes with determination 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.320
 it's still rare and will bring you to town 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.770
 today for a class of a tube approached pro 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.670
 he gets to do a lot more titles than he was stuck because 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.800
 this electric plot will do more damage 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.090
 it will unblock this replica very easily 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.280
 things 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.909
 while it's an art that the academy there net 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.400
 not that bad with a muffler 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.470
 far from being an easy weapon to use 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.620
 there is still way two of them declare not too impossible 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.270
 to tell you something else 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.840
 before playing with him 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.840
 Wednesday 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.369
 to years of practice 

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:17.639
 woman doing everything on purpose of this video of afp 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:21.459
 but not to have clear ideas but rather to explain everything to you 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:22.919
 high 

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:25.919
 however, we hope 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.200
 your voice the score 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.100
 Table 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.699
 perfect finances 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:34.699
 so this site I will be very clear 

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:37.249
 we'll go see that 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:39.869
 m 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:42.339
 track 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:45.949
 so why deprive yourself and well because this investigation triggered 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:47.669
 replica 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:50.819
 remains to know which home to reserve hectares 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.259
 in front of such a research and destruction reactor 

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:56.189
 while me it's more serious 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.129
 this is his thing 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.129
 so I'm not alone I will play with these assets 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.839
 and if this country has it all but they are more flexible 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:10.729
 ouf these choices 

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:13.729
 5 

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:18.999
 % to 23 turns 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.799
 in the cartoons affair 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:28.679
 see I do not really know what to say previously the worst would be that 

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:31.419
 it's trying to share 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.419
 I think it's impossible 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:38.079
 bruguière sector 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.859
 no I shared 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.949
 and in which I am in the company of those two who gave it to me 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:45.599
 some good I hope 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.469
 and failing to produce near this good first wish it quessy them 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:52.909
 bb brown but I assure you that when you are in crisis you hear 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.949
 a little your delusions crying 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:59.099
 what did we do just 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.169
 to disobey 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:02.079
 as to traffic 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.079
 it's a real mind is very disturbing 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.109
 a Saudi battery 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:10.969
 so they are very practical though I do not play with a huge 

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:12.149
 squat because 

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:16.829
 when i play i played with cigaliere 6 these contacts accepted 

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:20.629
 tibeirin to this text 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:26.610
 and assures you that I am mildly stressful with regard to the bpt know who 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.490
 it was and many others for carey which is part of the myth of orée 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.449
 test a glass score 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.449
 this story the mayor says that she is lived 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.610
 here I have taken a hundred ally of what is a little afraid 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:41.100
 the ouch 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.059
 what's left 

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:45.460
 and Turkey alstom 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.999
 who wanted well surrounded 

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:49.999
 but I can not find more history not to stress me too much 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.729
 is before everything 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:55.759
 it relaxes 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:58.759
 so see my activity in spring click here 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.930
 I fell in a trap the country 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.240
 run a lot of people and what do you want 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:10.729
 the 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:12.419
 the 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.419
 quite next 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:18.919
 the interior wakes up 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.919
 if he breeds the twin 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:30.339
 they are all out 

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:33.710
 I saw happen 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.580
 misplaced here 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.039
 it's still a lot of technicality but without being able to do 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:40.270
 click here 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.600
 it's really a man 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.229
 a little thing I mean because after the leak 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:46.699
 these countries do not kill cd4 below him 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:49.949
 I just tried p 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:51.969
 his personal touch 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:54.969
 it was a superstition 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.949
 maybe that's okay 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:03.300
 the score why think so sings direct contact with iris 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.300
 but I put very quickly 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:11.629
 sometimes I speak alone it's normal because it's 

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:14.629
 thierry crop and his friends santander 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:21.680
 cries 34 countries 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.680
 present crisis 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:32.520
 mike bibby I had to leave I was fine I had to leave 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.550
 mons 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.379
 nick reilly 

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:39.939
 we wanted it to be hidden but very delicate on the spot we will stop 

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:41.229
 to kill people 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:44.229
 and maybe jeremy class who knew how to be done quickly 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:47.020
 why would not they be serious 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.020
 Ahmadzai 

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:53.300
 to evacuate 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.300
 the concept 

00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:06.619
 buddy 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:11.240
 Tuesday morning 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.550
 mamoudzou 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.960
 saperlipopette I do not have tiptoes 

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.379
 a serious condition 

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:20.539
 this city 

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:21.860
 but it's a little bit true 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.860
 Gergorin 

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.460
 It is not possible 

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.460
 whew 

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:40.669
 Creyssel
