00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
fifth type tonality right there now

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:12.589 
fifth type tonality right there now
going<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.900> a<00:03:03.930> g7<00:03:04.650> so<00:03:05.389> GD<00:03:06.389> G<00:03:07.849> D<00:03:08.849> F<00:03:09.540> G<00:03:10.250> B<00:03:11.329> belly<00:03:12.329> no

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
down a B now this is C try it again so

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.920 
down a B now this is C try it again so

JC<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:19.799> I'm<00:03:19.859> gonna<00:03:20.010> walk<00:03:20.219> now<00:03:21.079> notice<00:03:22.079> how

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
JC and I'm gonna walk now notice how

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.559 
JC and I'm gonna walk now notice how
we're<00:03:22.439> moving<00:03:24.650> okay<00:03:25.650> all<00:03:26.310> basically<00:03:27.180> built<00:03:27.420> a

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
we're moving okay all basically built a

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.670 
we're moving okay all basically built a
1c<00:03:28.560> triad<00:03:29.099> we're<00:03:29.310> just<00:03:29.519> walking<00:03:29.819> down<00:03:30.180> the

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
1c triad we're just walking down the

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.459 
1c triad we're just walking down the
inversions<00:03:31.680> of<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:31.859> C<00:03:32.040> triad<00:03:32.519> and<00:03:33.420> I'm<00:03:33.989> basing

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:34.469 
inversions of the C triad and I'm basing

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:38.000 
inversions of the C triad and I'm basing
this<00:03:34.500> repeats<00:03:35.370> again<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.909> same<00:03:36.150> thing<00:03:37.010> here's

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
this repeats again the same thing here's

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:52.069 
this repeats again the same thing here's
the<00:03:38.159> e7<00:03:38.700> a<00:03:39.109> minor<00:03:41.000> d7<00:03:43.040> g<00:03:45.260> c<00:03:47.900> g7<00:03:50.780> walk<00:03:51.780> it<00:03:51.959> down

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
the e7 a minor d7 g c g7 walk it down

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.490 
the e7 a minor d7 g c g7 walk it down
the<00:03:52.139> c<00:03:52.409> chord<00:03:52.650> down<00:03:53.629> okay<00:03:54.629> now<00:03:54.930> here's<00:03:55.409> the

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
the c chord down okay now here's the

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.159 
the c chord down okay now here's the
basic<00:03:56.099> of<00:03:56.189> the<00:03:56.220> bridge<00:03:56.519> of<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:56.790> two<00:04:00.169> that's

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169 
basic of the bridge of the two that's

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:09.589 
basic of the bridge of the two that's
the<00:04:01.319> melody<00:04:01.590> that's<00:04:01.950> e<00:04:03.019> 1/2<00:04:04.019> g<00:04:04.799> g<00:04:06.260> FB<00:04:07.370> d<00:04:08.370> e<00:04:08.849> half

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
the melody that's e 1/2 g g FB d e half

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:20.360 
the melody that's e 1/2 g g FB d e half

half half e d c b a b c e f-sharp G ok

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.610 
half half e d c b a b c e f-sharp G ok
so<00:04:20.430> let's<00:04:20.729> build<00:04:21.030> some<00:04:21.209> core<00:04:21.419> tones<00:04:21.690> so<00:04:22.500> we

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
so let's build some core tones so we

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.580 
so let's build some core tones so we
last<00:04:22.889> left<00:04:23.130> off<00:04:23.340> with<00:04:24.199> so<00:04:25.199> it's<00:04:25.289> still<00:04:25.500> gonna

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
last left off with so it's still gonna

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:32.420 
last left off with so it's still gonna
be<00:04:25.680> part<00:04:25.979> of<00:04:26.159> a<00:04:26.280> C<00:04:26.460> triad<00:04:28.099> so<00:04:29.099> c<00:04:29.520> g<00:04:30.449> c<00:04:31.310> c/e

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
be part of a C triad so c g c c/e

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.720 
be part of a C triad so c g c c/e
and<00:04:32.909> that's<00:04:33.120> the<00:04:33.300> Molino
