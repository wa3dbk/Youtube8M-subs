think<00:00:15.570> you'll<00:00:15.809> be<00:00:15.900> having<00:00:15.990> one<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.260> these<00:00:16.440> when

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
think you'll be having one of these when

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.070 
think you'll be having one of these when
they<00:00:17.130> go<00:00:17.310> on<00:00:17.340> general<00:00:17.670> release<00:00:17.880> comes<00:00:18.810> in<00:00:18.990> a

they go on general release comes in a
tiny<00:00:19.350> bag<00:00:19.770> it'll<00:00:20.039> go<00:00:20.189> into<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.460> quiver<00:00:20.730> really

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
tiny bag it'll go into a quiver really

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.929 
tiny bag it'll go into a quiver really
easily<00:00:21.449> same<00:00:22.260> drill<00:00:22.500> as<00:00:22.619> normal<00:00:23.070> out<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.730> bag

easily same drill as normal out the bag
put<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.630> groundsheet<00:00:24.990> down<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.650> swim

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
put the groundsheet down in the swim

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.980 
put the groundsheet down in the swim
first<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.310> all<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.580> get<00:00:26.699> your<00:00:26.849> template<00:00:27.330> then

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
first of all to get your template then

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.779 
first of all to get your template then
get<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.349> bivvy<00:00:28.650> out<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.130> all<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.670> these

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
get the bivvy out and all of these

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.849 
get the bivvy out and all of these
lightweight<00:00:30.029> aluminium<00:00:30.510> poles<00:00:31.080> are<00:00:31.500> all

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
lightweight aluminium poles are all

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.260 
lightweight aluminium poles are all
doing<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.369> bivvy<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.700> haven't<00:00:32.880> got<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.000> thread

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
doing the bivvy you haven't got a thread

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.330 
doing the bivvy you haven't got a thread
anything<00:00:33.630> through<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:34.530> basically<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.219> have

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
anything through so basically you have

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.060 
anything through so basically you have
to<00:00:35.460> extend<00:00:35.880> little<00:00:36.480> bits<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.690> elk<00:00:36.870> rolando<00:00:37.469> the

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
to extend little bits of elk rolando the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.430 
to extend little bits of elk rolando the
pole<00:00:38.309> in<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.670> middle<00:00:38.850> extends<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.840> then<00:00:40.290> goes

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
pole in the middle extends and then goes

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.900 
pole in the middle extends and then goes
together<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.980> gives<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.370> sort<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.730> bat

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
together that gives you the sort of bat

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.819 
together that gives you the sort of bat
shape<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.570> then<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.200> do<00:00:43.350> each<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.710> these

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
shape and then you do each of these

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.860 
shape and then you do each of these
poles<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.670> come<00:00:44.879> across<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.420> they<00:00:45.539> must<00:00:45.719> be

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
poles that come across it they must be

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.450 
poles that come across it they must be
on<00:00:45.989> top<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.500> when<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.710> set<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.039> bivvy<00:00:47.340> up

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
on top of it when you set the bivvy up

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.000 
on top of it when you set the bivvy up
so<00:00:48.090> just<00:00:48.420> extend<00:00:48.899> them<00:00:49.050> together<00:00:49.410> extend<00:00:49.739> them

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
so just extend them together extend them

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.610 
so just extend them together extend them
together<00:00:50.340> like<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:51.270> very<00:00:51.840> easy<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.440> that's

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
together like that very easy and that's

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.200 
together like that very easy and that's
it<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.890> biddies<00:00:53.219> up<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.550> can<00:00:53.699> fish<00:00:53.910> with<00:00:54.090> it

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
it the biddies up you can fish with it

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.569 
it the biddies up you can fish with it
like<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:55.140> same<00:00:55.410> drill<00:00:55.739> do<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.160> pegs<00:00:56.399> all

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
like that the same drill do the pegs all

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.279 
like that the same drill do the pegs all
the<00:00:56.699> way<00:00:56.789> around<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.180> bivvy<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.750> this

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
the way around the bivvy and this

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.560 
the way around the bivvy and this
example<00:00:59.010> here<00:00:59.460> has<00:00:59.609> got<00:00:59.760> all<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.210> bits<00:01:00.420> that

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
example here has got all the bits that

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.599 
example here has got all the bits that
come<00:01:00.840> with<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.680> you've<00:01:01.800> got<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.980> multi-panel

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
come with it so you've got a multi-panel

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.690 
come with it so you've got a multi-panel
on<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.359> inside<00:01:03.780> zip<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.320> then<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.159> full

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
on the inside zip and then a full

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.060 
on the inside zip and then a full
winfield<00:01:06.210> panel<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.080> equity<00:01:07.380> x<00:01:07.500> material

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
winfield panel in the equity x material

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.640 
winfield panel in the equity x material
to<00:01:08.250> match<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.580> bivvy<00:01:08.880> itself<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.600> then<00:01:10.530> we've

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
to match the bivvy itself and then we've

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.469 
to match the bivvy itself and then we've
got<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.830> quick<00:01:11.070> sticks<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.670> as<00:01:11.760> well<00:01:11.939> just

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
got the quick sticks on it as well just

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.060 
got the quick sticks on it as well just
to<00:01:12.630> lift<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.960> up<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.170> little<00:01:13.290> bit<00:01:13.530> make<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.799> even

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
to lift it up a little bit make it even

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.130 
to lift it up a little bit make it even
more<00:01:14.250> rigid<00:01:14.790> that's<00:01:15.000> going<00:01:15.210> nowhere<00:01:15.450> even<00:01:15.900> in

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
more rigid that's going nowhere even in

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.520 
more rigid that's going nowhere even in
a<00:01:16.200> stone<00:01:16.790> very<00:01:17.790> stable<00:01:18.119> bivvy<00:01:18.570> indeed<00:01:18.900> acres

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
a stone very stable bivvy indeed acres

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.740 
a stone very stable bivvy indeed acres
of<00:01:19.650> room<00:01:19.860> inside<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:21.150> if<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.390> don't<00:01:21.600> want

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
of room inside it and if you don't want

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.899 
of room inside it and if you don't want
to<00:01:21.810> use<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.020> with<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.439> infill<00:01:22.799> panels<00:01:23.009> then

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
to use it with the infill panels then

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.609 
to use it with the infill panels then
you<00:01:24.060> can<00:01:24.180> leave<00:01:24.330> them<00:01:24.479> at<00:01:24.630> home<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:25.140> then<00:01:25.380> just

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
you can leave them at home and then just

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.260 
you can leave them at home and then just
literally<00:01:26.100> take<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.549> out<00:01:26.670> as<00:01:26.820> normal<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.180> can

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
literally take it out as normal you can

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.600 
literally take it out as normal you can
widen<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.960> if<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.200> want<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:29.009> rather<00:01:29.400> than

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
widen it if you want so rather than

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.760 
widen it if you want so rather than
using<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.090> ground<00:01:30.840> sheet<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.229> template<00:01:31.710> if

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
using the ground sheet is a template if

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.080 
using the ground sheet is a template if
you're<00:01:31.860> just<00:01:31.950> doing<00:01:32.220> overnighters<00:01:32.790> don't

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
you're just doing overnighters don't

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.940 
you're just doing overnighters don't
need<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.270> groundsheet<00:01:33.570> widen<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.619> out<00:01:34.680> if<00:01:34.860> you

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
need the groundsheet widen it out if you

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.830 
need the groundsheet widen it out if you
want<00:01:34.979> brings<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.549> down<00:01:35.670> even<00:01:35.880> lower<00:01:36.180> and

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840
