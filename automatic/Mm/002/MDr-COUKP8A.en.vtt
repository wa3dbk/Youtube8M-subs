me<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:18.390> particular<00:01:18.750> model<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.310> have<00:01:20.550> to

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
me this particular model is you have to

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.380 
me this particular model is you have to
hand<00:01:21.030> crank<00:01:21.480> the<00:01:22.140> pony<00:01:22.440> engine<00:01:23.060> to<00:01:24.060> get<00:01:24.210> it

hand crank the pony engine to get it
started<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.140> then<00:01:25.860> when<00:01:26.160> it's<00:01:26.340> up<00:01:26.580> and

running<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.390> start<00:01:27.690> the<00:01:27.870> main<00:01:28.050> diesel<00:01:28.500> engine

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
running you start the main diesel engine

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.980 
running you start the main diesel engine
from<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.430> it's<00:01:29.670> fun<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.000> drive<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.270> big<00:01:30.570> chunk<00:01:30.870> of

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
from it it's fun to drive a big chunk of

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.610 
from it it's fun to drive a big chunk of
machinery<00:01:31.430> many<00:01:32.430> years<00:01:32.700> ago<00:01:32.910> I<00:01:33.090> had<00:01:33.590> drove<00:01:34.590> a

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
machinery many years ago I had drove a

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.050 
machinery many years ago I had drove a
cat<00:01:35.520> similar<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.330> this<00:01:36.740> but<00:01:37.740> then<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.040> got<00:01:38.250> into

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
cat similar to this but then I got into

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.780 
cat similar to this but then I got into
much<00:01:39.660> more<00:01:39.900> exciting<00:01:40.710> occupation<00:01:41.640> and

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
much more exciting occupation and

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.970 
much more exciting occupation and
electronics<00:01:42.510> but<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.410> kind<00:01:43.620> of<00:01:43.710> brings<00:01:43.890> back

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980 
electronics but it kind of brings back

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.350 
electronics but it kind of brings back
fun<00:01:44.400> memories

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
fun memories

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.390
