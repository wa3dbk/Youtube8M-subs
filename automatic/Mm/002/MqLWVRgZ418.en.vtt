like it other other things you can tell

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.340 
like it other other things you can tell
is<00:01:41.909> if<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.090> do<00:01:42.360> try<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.600> tug<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:43.079> little<00:01:43.229> bit

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
is if you do try to tug it a little bit

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.139 
is if you do try to tug it a little bit
I'm<00:01:43.500> trying<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.829> tug<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.189> now<00:01:44.399> besides<00:01:44.970> from

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
I'm trying to tug it now besides from

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.149 
I'm trying to tug it now besides from
the<00:01:45.240> wind<00:01:45.450> blowing<00:01:45.930> I'm<00:01:46.140> tugging<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.040> can

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
the wind blowing I'm tugging it you can

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.740 
the wind blowing I'm tugging it you can
see<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.369> whole<00:01:47.579> branch<00:01:47.939> move<00:01:48.299> it's<00:01:48.570> not

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
see the whole branch move it's not

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.800 
see the whole branch move it's not
actually<00:01:49.259> separating<00:01:49.890> quite<00:01:50.220> easily<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:51.030> once

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
actually separating quite easily so once

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.690 
actually separating quite easily so once
again<00:01:51.930> color<00:01:53.299> touch<00:01:55.189> pulling<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.280> seemed<00:01:56.579> it

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
again color touch pulling it seemed it

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.810 
again color touch pulling it seemed it
comes<00:01:56.939> off<00:01:57.119> easily<00:01:58.280> another<00:01:59.280> indicator<00:01:59.729> that

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
comes off easily another indicator that

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.819 
comes off easily another indicator that
you<00:02:00.030> may<00:02:00.180> want<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.600> know<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.409> always<00:02:01.649> want

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
you may want to know is you always want

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.499 
you may want to know is you always want
to<00:02:01.890> look<00:02:02.130> down<00:02:02.399> not<00:02:02.759> because<00:02:03.030> you're<00:02:03.149> walking

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
to look down not because you're walking

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.429 
to look down not because you're walking
where<00:02:03.659> you're<00:02:03.810> going<00:02:04.049> because<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.290> might

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
where you're going because you might

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.260 
where you're going because you might
trip<00:02:04.649> over<00:02:04.770> something<00:02:05.219> but<00:02:05.729> because<00:02:06.060> on<00:02:06.180> the

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
trip over something but because on the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.719 
trip over something but because on the
ground<00:02:06.600> that's<00:02:07.200> where<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.649> tree<00:02:08.039> freely

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
ground that's where the tree freely

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.240 
ground that's where the tree freely
gives<00:02:09.420> its<00:02:09.629> fruit<00:02:09.989> if<00:02:10.259> it's<00:02:10.500> truly<00:02:10.830> ripe<00:02:11.039> and

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
gives its fruit if it's truly ripe and

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.940 
gives its fruit if it's truly ripe and
hey<00:02:11.370> hey<00:02:11.580> there's<00:02:12.030> me<00:02:12.239> hello

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
hey hey there's me hello

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.350 
hey hey there's me hello
so<00:02:14.099> on<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.310> ground<00:02:14.550> here<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:14.819> can<00:02:14.940> see<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.180> lot

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
so on the ground here you can see a lot

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.960 
so on the ground here you can see a lot
of<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.569> really<00:02:16.230> ripe<00:02:17.010> fruit<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.490> is<00:02:17.640> dropped

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
of the really ripe fruit that is dropped

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.940 
of the really ripe fruit that is dropped
because<00:02:18.150> in<00:02:18.420> nature<00:02:18.599> that's<00:02:19.110> what<00:02:19.440> happens

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
because in nature that's what happens

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.550 
because in nature that's what happens
the<00:02:20.280> fruit<00:02:20.670> is<00:02:20.790> ripe<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.209> drops<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:22.200> this<00:02:22.380> is

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
the fruit is ripe it drops so this is

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.440 
the fruit is ripe it drops so this is
probably<00:02:22.830> actually<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.340> truly<00:02:23.760> ripened<00:02:24.180> fruit

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
probably actually a truly ripened fruit

maybe<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.220> tree<00:04:11.489> next<00:04:11.670> door<00:04:11.940> is<00:04:12.180> better

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
maybe the tree next door is better

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.539 
maybe the tree next door is better
because<00:04:12.780> if<00:04:12.900> it's<00:04:13.290> a<00:04:13.380> different<00:04:13.680> variety<00:04:13.889> or

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
environmental factors so I'll go around

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.590 
environmental factors so I'll go around
to<00:04:18.840> multiple<00:04:19.289> trees<00:04:19.590> and<00:04:19.919> taste<00:04:20.789> test<00:04:21.120> one<00:04:21.570> or

two off each tree to see which tree I

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.920 
two off each tree to see which tree I
like<00:04:23.490> the<00:04:23.610> best<00:04:23.820> and<00:04:23.940> then<00:04:24.479> I'm<00:04:24.539> gonna<00:04:24.630> stick
