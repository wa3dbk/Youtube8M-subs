00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.650
 Today I'm not going to talk about a game 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.110
 of several I am going to talk about the saga 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.119
 clocktower the first clocktower came out 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.369
 for the super famicom that would be the super 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.070
 nintendo put say and was created by 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.900
 the human company in 95 a game of 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.079
 terror and super dye to say you 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.730
 Well, yes, and it 's a game flower, it 's like 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.829
 a cross of graphic adventure with 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.540
 survival horror and a pioneer in the 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.670
 genre history presents us to 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.560
 Jennifer Simpson an orphan who is 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.410
 adopted together with other girls for a 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.030
 strange lady called mary bar rosemary 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.070
 takes her to all to live in her case is 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.760
 an English mansion with a clock in a 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.380
 of its towers 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.800
 up there all the fantastic king and now 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.300
 Jennifer has to make two new 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.950
 good and the balls it turns out that 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.200
 girls begin to disappear inside 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.200
 the house and the culprit is this boy 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.109
 bobby mary's deformed psychotic son 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.399
 that pursues them all with some 

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:13.380
 scissors bigger than a motorbike 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.360
 we drive to Jennifer and we're going to have to 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.829
 escape from this terrifying place and 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.840
 get to the bottom of the mystery of who 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:20.670
 are these crazy crap from the mud 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.469
 the game works mostly as a 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.209
 graphic adventure you click on some 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:25.950
 object and the little one goes up there and makes 

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:27.869
 something but when the ranch rots and 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.459
 Bobby appears to kill us we have to 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.319
 escape from it and suddenly we can do 

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:33.090
 click on new objects that help us 

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:33.750
 hide or stop to be able to 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.459
 survive 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.170
 this is a unique gameplay that 

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:38.549
 conveys perfection the feeling of 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.530
 be in a slasher movie with a 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.659
 murderers trying to kill us is like 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.189
 Friday the 13th or scream in video games the 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.329
 argument and the setting in general 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.189
 they are inspired by the movie 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.049
 phenomenal dario argento also 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.119
 known as creepers starring 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.720
 Jennifer Connelly Clarkson and Fer with him 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.380
 and Jennifer Simpson and Jennifer Connelly 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.970
 Jennifer Connelly 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:04.020
 i 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.420
 and the game came out only in Japan and 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.369
 it was never translated into another language but 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.590
 yes they are showing has the letters 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.210
 in English they have to be clearer and 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.130
 that's because a game fan 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.050
 totally obsessive and sick of 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.460
 brain was dedicated to translate it already 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.710
 upload it to the internet so we can 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.720
 play with an emulator so there they have 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.640
 which is downloaded in an emulator of 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.680
 super nintendo and get the rom of the 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.940
 translated game do not worry about the 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.130
 issue of where to get them since 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.540
 feel www.google.com.ar they are going to 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.650
 find easily and they 're also going to 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.690
 count all the other games that 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.670
 I mentioned in play land the thing is that 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.200
 a few years later human was sent a 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.200
 sequel for playstation 1 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.150
 they will call it clock tower 2 logically and 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.950
 this game if it was translated into English and 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.900
 published in other countries the issue is that 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.610
 like the previous one was not international 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.590
 you could put this egg club and 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.690
 that there was not a clock tower 1 in English 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.790
 so the Yankees chose to call him 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.280
 simply clock tower and the previous one what 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.480
 they called clock tower of first trust in 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.000
 a reversal that was made for 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.709
 playstation still in Japanese we assume that 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.110
 they added the first fear phrases 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.150
 to differentiate the club tower 15 from 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.530
 clock tower one Japanese equal with each 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.360
 sequel this is going to talk more and more 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.130
 fucked up in this sequel we go back to 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.900
 handle jennifer survivors of the 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.459
 assassinations of Burroughs mansion already 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.290
 helen a girl who is dedicated to 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.940
 take care of them and you have left half in state of 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.400
 shock the press is full with the 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.080
 murders and with names are formed that you 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.940
 they put Bobby Burroughs so that 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.800
 have more wave in the newspapers raises 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.810
 the idea that bobby was not really 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.239
 deformed but he wore a mask and 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.800
 surprisingly the murders begin 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.140
 repeated among the people surrounding 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.870
 Jennifer seems that if only man came back and 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.500
 now it can be anybody up could 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.500
 be you 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.110
 the same interface remains 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.510
 graphic adventure but now in a 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.790
 3d environment beyond the primitive 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.410
 the graphics let's say do not be fucking and 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.180
 play what a great game a little 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.640
 slow at times but great game at last 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.040
 a few years later human took another clock 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.680
 tower plus this was called clock tower 3 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.930
 watch girl but of course it was called like that in 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.090
 Japan, Yankee, there was no clock 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.330
 tower 2 so they sent him clock tower 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.770
 2 to extract westin here is no longer 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.480
 Jennifer Simpson and the story 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:22.910
 It takes place in Japan with other people 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.530
 it is a clear separate story that neither 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.660
 there is no tower with a clock but 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.370
 you make yourselves idiots and ready is 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.620
 the story of alyssa a girl who 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.720
 has double personality one day his uncles 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.680
 they are killed violently just 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.810
 when she is going to visit them 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.160
 apparently his little cousin went crazy and 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.160
 he wants to kill everybody 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:48.800
 but Alisa is not alone since her other 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:51.750
 personality Mr. Weitz is a son 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.289
 of a whore and he is not afraid of anything 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.419
 to frei 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:58.430
 the game starts very well and the first 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.960
 screens has incredible weather 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.759
 unfortunately starts to fall towards the 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.960
 end with a story of worthy zombies 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:04.699
 that nothing else 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.909
 it's also good until there all 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:09.499
 well and what happened next came capcom with 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:12.110
 his missions and he bought the franchise 

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:13.550
 human to make another clock tower more 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.099
 this is the clock tower 3 so 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.689
 directly on 3 and stress throughout 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:19.309
 world and went out for playstation 2 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:20.899
 obviously it's a new story without 

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:23.059
 relation to the previous ones and to me 

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:24.770
 personally I thought it was a court or 

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:26.930
 the first screen and it does not give a bit 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.209
 scary and it's boring and stupid or what 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.009
 hate totally good maybe because I 

00:05:29.209 --> 00:05:32.479
 I have a lot of love to the previous ones but 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:33.740
 Well, it's a shit and I hate it and 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:35.300
 sebas then the congde is a yes 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.219
 you want to play you go in the game but I 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.129
 I'm not going to play it is bad choto and point 

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:42.199
 still something good came out of the club tower 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:43.879
 3 in the hands of capcom and that was this 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:45.889
 I play the haunting ground too 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:47.719
 known as an element for playstation 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:49.129
 2 in the first instance it has nothing 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:51.139
 what to do with even tower but keeps 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:52.639
 the same essence and share many things 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:54.619
 of the gameplay we had 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:56.029
 escaping the bad guys and hiding 

00:05:54.619 --> 00:05:57.830
 as we can instead of loading the 

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:59.689
 shoes while we explore a mansion 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.759
 more bizarre than shit for me 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:03.529
 as I am clock tower 3 that never was and 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:06.049
 that's why it deserves to be played is very 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:10.209
 entertaining terrifying disturber and 

00:06:06.049 --> 00:06:10.209
 has an impeccable technical bill 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.430
 a few years ago I found out they were 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.320
 making a movie based on the saga 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.300
 clocktower and the truth that I got wrong 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.770
 because because the truth that I am 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.540
 film director and wanted to be being 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.850
 the movie the clock tower this is one 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.650
 of my dreams since my adolescence 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.180
 since I 'm 17 years old luckily now 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.910
 it seems that the project is in limbo 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.650
 so let's cross our fingers in order not to 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:55.290
 deprive of playing this saga that gave 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.290
 much to the horror videogames 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.120
 good
