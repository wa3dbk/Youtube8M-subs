00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
well guys we're back and something that

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.740 
well guys we're back and something that
concerned<00:00:04.950> me<00:00:05.069> about<00:00:05.400> this<00:00:05.640> when<00:00:05.879> I<00:00:05.940> started

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
concerned me about this when I started

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.390 
concerned me about this when I started
this<00:00:06.870> whole<00:00:07.080> process<00:00:07.350> when<00:00:07.919> I<00:00:07.950> was<00:00:08.099> thinking

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
this whole process when I was thinking

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.480 
this whole process when I was thinking
about<00:00:08.490> it<00:00:08.730> was<00:00:09.269> will<00:00:09.929> my<00:00:10.139> inter<00:00:10.469> Mac<00:00:10.650> 620<00:00:11.309> water

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
about it was will my inter Mac 620 water

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.690 
about it was will my inter Mac 620 water
supply<00:00:12.240> fit<00:00:12.660> in<00:00:12.840> there<00:00:13.049> neatly<00:00:13.349> well<00:00:14.280> the

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
supply fit in there neatly well the

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.480 
supply fit in there neatly well the
answer<00:00:15.089> is<00:00:15.240> yes<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.780> no<00:00:16.310> originally<00:00:17.310> when<00:00:17.460> I

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
answer is yes and no originally when I

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.279 
answer is yes and no originally when I
tried<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:17.820> out<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.270> flipped<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:18.869> over<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.109> the

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
tried it out I flipped it over so the

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.650 
tried it out I flipped it over so the
fan<00:00:19.619> side<00:00:19.920> was<00:00:20.189> down<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.900> I<00:00:21.900> found<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:23.660> it

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
fan side was down and I found that it

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.000 
fan side was down and I found that it
didn't<00:00:24.990> mount<00:00:25.170> up<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.560> didn't<00:00:25.800> match<00:00:25.980> up

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
didn't mount up it didn't match up

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.859 
didn't mount up it didn't match up
properly<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:26.970> obviously<00:00:27.330> you're<00:00:27.539> supposed<00:00:27.810> to

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
properly so obviously you're supposed to

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.279 
properly so obviously you're supposed to
flip<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.289> over<00:00:29.150> upside<00:00:30.150> down<00:00:30.750> from<00:00:31.050> what<00:00:31.199> you

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
flip it over upside down from what you

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.340 
flip it over upside down from what you
would<00:00:31.410> normally<00:00:31.650> mount<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.899> it<00:00:33.899> lines<00:00:34.200> up

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
would normally mount it and it lines up

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.040 
would normally mount it and it lines up
nice<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.950> neatly<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.520> cleanly<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.899> was<00:00:37.020> a

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
nice and neatly and cleanly and I was a

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.959 
nice and neatly and cleanly and I was a
little<00:00:37.260> concerned<00:00:37.559> about<00:00:37.829> cable<00:00:38.550> lengths<00:00:38.760> in

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
little concerned about cable lengths in

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.090 
little concerned about cable lengths in
particular<00:00:39.890> with<00:00:40.890> our<00:00:41.390> motherboard<00:00:43.100> cabling

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
particular with our motherboard cabling

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.389 
particular with our motherboard cabling
I<00:00:44.309> main<00:00:44.820> cabling<00:00:45.590> let<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.710> have<00:00:46.860> enough<00:00:47.190> room

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
I main cabling let it have enough room

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.510 
I main cabling let it have enough room
to<00:00:47.430> reach<00:00:47.840> now<00:00:48.840> not<00:00:49.079> too<00:00:49.289> often<00:00:49.860> do<00:00:50.160> we<00:00:50.309> see

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
to reach now not too often do we see

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.090 
to reach now not too often do we see
motherboards<00:00:51.059> anymore<00:00:51.510> with<00:00:52.100> cabling

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
motherboards anymore with cabling

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.060 
motherboards anymore with cabling
reaching<00:00:53.520> up<00:00:53.670> here<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.420> we're<00:00:54.629> good<00:00:54.809> here<00:00:55.199> and

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
reaching up here so we're good here and

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.099 
reaching up here so we're good here and
then<00:00:56.190> we've<00:00:56.340> got<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.699> cabling<00:00:57.239> here<00:00:57.629> I'm<00:00:58.050> a

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
then we've got this cabling here I'm a

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.319 
then we've got this cabling here I'm a
little<00:00:58.379> concerned<00:00:58.789> but<00:00:59.789> I<00:00:59.850> don't<00:01:00.059> think<00:01:00.239> I

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
little concerned but I don't think I

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.510 
little concerned but I don't think I
have<00:01:00.510> too<00:01:00.690> much<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.020> worry<00:01:01.140> about<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.680> think

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
have too much to worry about I think

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.910 
have too much to worry about I think
I've<00:01:02.879> got<00:01:03.059> lots<00:01:03.329> here<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.260> only<00:01:04.439> thing<00:01:04.739> is

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
I've got lots here the only thing is

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.060 
I've got lots here the only thing is
it's<00:01:05.339> awful<00:01:05.760> tight<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.180> there<00:01:06.420> with<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:07.070> with

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
it's awful tight in there with that with

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.830 
it's awful tight in there with that with
that<00:01:08.250> big<00:01:08.549> bastard<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:10.520> a<00:01:11.520> fan<00:01:11.820> up<00:01:12.030> there<00:01:12.060> but<00:01:12.810> I

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
that big bastard of a fan up there but I

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.560 
that big bastard of a fan up there but I
think<00:01:12.960> we're<00:01:13.290> going<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.439> be<00:01:13.619> okay<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.390> next

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
think we're going to be okay so the next

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.200 
think we're going to be okay so the next
step<00:01:15.780> now<00:01:16.200> for<00:01:16.619> me<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.549> continue

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
step now for me is to continue

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.530 
step now for me is to continue
dismantling<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.439> other<00:01:19.619> case<00:01:20.240> take<00:01:21.240> out<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
dismantling the other case take out the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.950 
dismantling the other case take out the
video<00:01:21.780> cards<00:01:22.170> set<00:01:22.619> them<00:01:22.830> aside<00:01:23.479> pull<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.750> hard

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
video cards set them aside pull the hard

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.890 
video cards set them aside pull the hard
drive<00:01:25.049> cages<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.130> take<00:01:27.060> out<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.390> devices

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
drive cages and take out the devices

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.080 
drive cages and take out the devices
before<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.799> go<00:01:29.070> there's<00:01:29.340> something<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.759> want<00:01:30.000> to

a<00:02:13.590> lot<00:02:13.830> but<00:02:14.160> one<00:02:14.640> it's<00:02:14.940> got<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.269> mesh<00:02:15.569> which<00:02:16.319> is

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
a lot but one it's got the mesh which is

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.430 
a lot but one it's got the mesh which is
very<00:02:16.739> important<00:02:17.250> for<00:02:17.400> dust<00:02:18.230> avoidance<00:02:19.230> and

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
very important for dust avoidance and

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.289 
very important for dust avoidance and
