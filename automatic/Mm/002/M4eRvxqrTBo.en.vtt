00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:08.670
 and good to all condemned of the underworld 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:11.340
 Today I bring you an I do not know what you have 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.120
 entered the video you have read the 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.400
 title that is crafting horse armor and what 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.869
 I have read for version 1.6 point 2 and 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.550
 you know that these fumes but I have it 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.529
 to say because in my video point and 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.990
 when I have been told this if you know of 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.529
 what am I tired guys the truth 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.379
 saudi and youtube you get into a video and 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.659
 there are only installation videos worth yes 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.249
 I think it's very nice this boat is very 

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:40.979
 simple the truth you can find it 

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:43.170
 anywhere but I have decided that 

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:45.899
 I think we need 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.460
 and someone explain to you how to raise the 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.000
 things and that you waste an hour looking for 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.120
 how to punish the basic ones I have 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.270
 this is going to be the first mode 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.910
 later air with many more 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.170
 complicated well first of all how do you 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.860
 install this mod 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.250
 I will make a video ticket of how to install the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.560
 mods but in version 1.6 virtues is 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.149
 very simple you just have to 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:20.670
 set up the forum the ford for 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:24.299
 minecraft 1.6 points and ie forge it 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.090
 What it does to us is to install a 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.470
 carpetita mod and among other things what 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.240
 makes us is that we simply copy 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.250
 we paste in the model folder earthquake 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.380
 exist line or be as simple as that 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.659
 I will make a video explaining the best 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.960
 and before you say it, I'll also put 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:44.440
 where to download this mod 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:48.340
 and where to download the forge points 1 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:52.200
 well worth 6.2 points to cross 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.119
 mor as you know in this version of both 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.719
 we have to roll in this version of 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.880
 minecraft we have little horses 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:02.729
 you can train and assemble and put in 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.350
 armor the problem is that here the 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.560
 dan jones find 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.610
 without scoring 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.610
 the iron model 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.350
 and also because I have placed iron 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.780
 gold diamonds and our armors the 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:25.650
 typical for gold is weaker 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.569
 because here the iron is weaker 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:32.510
 that gold and gold is weaker 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:36.379
 that the mate and good for crafter 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:39.220
 to 7 mount to the almost with leather 3 iron 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.220
 for this 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.010
 of iron and gives us the cookies 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.440
 the easel 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.440
 why 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.000
 why 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.340
 I'm going to put the chair 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.490
 and now we can take it to our 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.490
 tell how we want to see the place but 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.120
 They have a lot of life but highlight our 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.530
 we go out with shift 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:20.080
 We have a horse with a chair that 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.040
 we can ride with armor they see 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.300
 how the iron armor is made 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:28.090
 we will need 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.090
 6 iron ingots and one of wool 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.010
 I have everything right here 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.010
 we do it like this 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.630
 and we put a wool one and it will give us the 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.560
 jacques armor well the gold one is 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.560
 does exactly the same 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.670
 we put it in this position the gold in 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.670
 the wool one and it will give us the gold one 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.500
 we already have gold armor and well and the 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.080
 of diamond for exactly the same 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.060
 we have 6 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:05.170
 of diamond one of wool 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.170
 and we put them 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.620
 and as we all armor 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.160
 as you see this mode is very very very 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.160
 simple 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.470
 but 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.020
 with me 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:32.950
 salt is lost 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.950
 jump runs 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.570
 and good guys this has been all 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.760
 I hope you liked that about 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.840
 everything has been useful 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.440
 and see you in the next video d 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.440
 with 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:54.260

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.260
