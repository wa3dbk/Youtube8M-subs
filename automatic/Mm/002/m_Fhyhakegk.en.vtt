to say I'm starting pardon the pun I'm

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:28.870 
to say I'm starting pardon the pun I'm
starting<00:01:27.470> to<00:01:27.500> see<00:01:27.740> it<00:01:27.770> like<00:01:28.159> I'm<00:01:28.280> starting<00:01:28.580> to

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
starting to see it like I'm starting to

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.030 
starting to see it like I'm starting to
get<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.390> idea<00:01:29.420> of<00:01:29.900> how<00:01:30.080> this<00:01:30.290> would<00:01:30.470> be<00:01:30.530> super

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
get the idea of how this would be super

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.090 
get the idea of how this would be super
useful<00:01:31.159> and<00:01:31.610> natural<00:01:32.060> yeah

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
useful and natural yeah

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.710 
useful and natural yeah
then<00:01:34.100> there's<00:01:34.310> Virginia<00:01:34.820> based<00:01:35.060> LC

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
then there's Virginia based LC

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.230 
then there's Virginia based LC
technologies<00:01:36.409> this<00:01:36.950> is<00:01:37.010> their<00:01:37.340> eye<00:01:37.369> gaze<00:01:37.909> edge

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
technologies this is their eye gaze edge

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.060 
technologies this is their eye gaze edge
the<00:01:38.869> idea<00:01:39.170> here<00:01:39.470> is<00:01:39.500> that<00:01:39.680> you<00:01:39.890> basically

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
the idea here is that you basically

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.520 
the idea here is that you basically
typed<00:01:40.729> with<00:01:41.119> your<00:01:41.330> eyes<00:01:41.510> the<00:01:42.110> computer

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
typed with your eyes the computer

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.500 
typed with your eyes the computer
translates<00:01:43.010> the<00:01:43.250> words<00:01:43.490> on<00:01:43.760> the<00:01:43.850> screen<00:01:43.970> into

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
translates the words on the screen into

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.730 
translates the words on the screen into
synthesized<00:01:45.110> speech<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:47.810> eyes<00:01:47.960> can<00:01:48.500> point

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
synthesized speech the eyes can point

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.100 
synthesized speech the eyes can point
very<00:01:49.010> precisely<00:01:49.400> so<00:01:49.760> if<00:01:49.880> we<00:01:50.030> can<00:01:50.240> get<00:01:50.780> camera

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
very precisely so if we can get camera

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.980 
very precisely so if we can get camera
technology<00:01:51.439> that<00:01:51.830> can<00:01:52.100> harness<00:01:52.369> that<00:01:52.810> then<00:01:53.810> we

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
technology that can harness that then we

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.800 
technology that can harness that then we
can<00:01:54.260> then<00:01:54.650> turn<00:01:54.950> that<00:01:54.979> into<00:01:55.310> say<00:01:55.810> essentially

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
can then turn that into say essentially

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.030 
can then turn that into say essentially
the<00:01:56.930> same<00:01:57.080> thing<00:01:57.290> as<00:01:57.409> a<00:01:57.439> mouse<00:01:57.680> on<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:58.010> screen

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
the same thing as a mouse on the screen

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.690 
the same thing as a mouse on the screen
I<00:01:59.290> asked<00:02:00.290> one<00:02:00.380> of<00:02:00.409> our<00:02:00.590> producers<00:02:00.950> to<00:02:01.189> Skype

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
I asked one of our producers to Skype

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.490 
I asked one of our producers to Skype
with<00:02:01.880> Jeff<00:02:02.090> cañada<00:02:02.420> to<00:02:02.720> give<00:02:02.840> it<00:02:02.960> a<00:02:03.020> try

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
with Jeff cañada to give it a try

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.410 
with Jeff cañada to give it a try
hey<00:02:03.920> how's<00:02:04.130> it<00:02:04.159> going<00:02:04.640> it's<00:02:04.880> going<00:02:05.240> well

eyes what is that like a little bit
fatigued<00:02:24.570> but<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:24.990> think<00:02:25.260> over<00:02:26.100> time<00:02:26.130> you'd<00:02:26.520> get

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
fatigued but I think over time you'd get

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.949 
fatigued but I think over time you'd get
pretty<00:02:26.880> used<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.240> and<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.480> gets<00:02:27.630> stronger

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
pretty used to it and it gets stronger

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.630 
pretty used to it and it gets stronger
but<00:02:28.350> it<00:02:28.470> just<00:02:28.620> goes<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:28.950> show<00:02:29.130> you<00:02:29.190> how<00:02:29.310> cool

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
but it just goes to show you how cool

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.310 
but it just goes to show you how cool
things<00:02:30.000> are<00:02:30.120> getting<00:02:30.360> now<00:02:30.480> like<00:02:30.750> I<00:02:30.959> can<00:02:31.230> just
