 all ways changing the subject to 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.590
 record this video today is much later 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.350
 than the rest of the days because madrid at 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.119
 4 is done at night now 4 same no but 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.380
 6 but the 4 without clouds do not have 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.180
 any 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.649
 wait and ask my partner 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.329
 floor if I had any torch will be the 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.430
 light to be able to make the video so 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:17.770
 at least I have it, I promised you that 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.110
 Monday would be the unboxing of the black ops 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.939
 well here is this unboxing is very 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.549
 special, because especially when 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:27.179
 I did it we were on jp's birthday 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.679
 here at home and then the boys 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:31.829
 they suggested that we will open it there in 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:34.990
 half lie 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.420
 now it does not matter I thought it was a good 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.360
 idea to open it in front of everyone after 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.189
 all the hype I was carrying with my compi 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.330
 floor that was always uncle has to 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.439
 get to the help package has to 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.209
 get the help package has already pulled out 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.270
 everyone then we will do 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:53.530
 something special is worth all the 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:56.970
 friends from all the jp friends group 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.970
 and now therefore apparently children too 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.869
 I'm sorry and I want you to see it 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.690
 judge and apartment that a little bit of 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.479
 conjunctivitis but did not touch I'll do 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.220
 stevie wonder with the glasses here so 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.560
 nothing guys I leave you with the unboxing tic 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.270
 tic 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.580
 and good friends here we are here we have 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.560
 the famous unboxing I'm going to use 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.030
 something different to open the box in the 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.860
 today I will use a head of 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.690
 redhead that is what is most 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.910
 used in belgium right now is what 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.099
 that is more fashionable they export from 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.690
 from Scotland and bring them there for what 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.250
 that does not work for us because the teeth 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.959
 they have very sharp so to take for 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.790
 I open it with a wooden spoon 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.349
 which is also one of the most 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:41.420
 used in patagonia and we opened it 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.910
 We will see that people are already 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.709
 touch now nothing more than seeing these 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.350
 scarf is that I'm going to put on my neck 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.080
 these cell phones that are from the facts of 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.319
 paper and what comes inside the box 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.780
 big comes another easy box j no flipes 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.690
 no flipes is good we open it with the 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.920
 own spoon assassins very well to scratch 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.349
 and there 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.120
 we remove it and finally we see we see another 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:09.930
 fucking box, but there it is 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.909
 thank you thank you thank you thank you 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.019
 but this comes to take for ass already touches 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.019
 I take out the trunk 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:23.220
 Now there it is, it's good, well, well, 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:25.500
 Look how good you look how nice look 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.510
 what box not prophylactic we do not remove it 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.549
 the plastic and we leave it there and good 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.239

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.650

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:39.120

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.730
 bastards hello bastards are worth here this is 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.970

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.420
 the end of the small band that has 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.420
 xbox 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.849
 we finally opened it after a lot 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.849
 delay 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.150
 we saw friends first in the water box 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:05.099
 fuck it when we opened orito 6 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.980
 the small box that the controller brings 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.180
 something that is what controls and 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.620
 control 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.829
 the east we'll see, people are already 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:18.600
 flipping stories do not touch the tc 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:22.919
 with the platform we put it there 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.840
 perfect is a fan of the j bags 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.370
 this seems that despite the little people 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.750
 is already applied but what the fuck is there 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.720
 inside, it does not matter, we're going to 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:35.310
 see us 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:37.530
 worse we open a point fucking 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.650
 helicopter 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.419
 a little kiss come on come what do you think 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.810
 It looks like a fucking helicopter with the game 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:48.690
 what the fuck the people were freaking 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:51.590
 it's not normal thanks for the 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.590
 tongue twister this 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:59.220
 thanks well the next thing you placed is 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:00.630
 this data two medals two coins in 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.229
 which inside the medal itself 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.639
 be in a fantastic print comes 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:07.110
 comes in the codes of the game is 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.550
 some downloadable codes to download 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.979
 the soundtrack and other things from the 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.979

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:15.810
 idea is new and is new you see there 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:17.370
 on the top 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.800
 because if you see it already the downloads 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.740

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.540

 behind so that you can make a 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.760
 idea but neither is it already you have seen the 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.290

 xbox security without breaking it 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.479

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:01.460
