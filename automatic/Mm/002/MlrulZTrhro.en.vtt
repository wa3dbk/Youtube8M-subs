era<00:02:07.149> and<00:02:07.719> so<00:02:07.869> this<00:02:08.019> is<00:02:08.170> something<00:02:08.470> that<00:02:08.590> will

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
era and so this is something that will

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.100 
era and so this is something that will
be<00:02:08.800> carried<00:02:09.160> across<00:02:09.250> with<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.119> ps3<00:02:10.450> performer

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
be carried across with the ps3 performer

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.190 
be carried across with the ps3 performer
so<00:02:11.650> moving<00:02:11.950> across<00:02:12.220> into<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:13.300> boat<00:02:13.930> server

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
so moving across into the boat server

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.130 
so moving across into the boat server
both<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:14.860> we've<00:02:15.430> all<00:02:15.580> seen<00:02:15.849> photographs<00:02:16.450> on<00:02:17.110> a

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
both and we've all seen photographs on a

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.900 
both and we've all seen photographs on a
screensaver<00:02:17.470> before<00:02:18.069> but<00:02:18.220> probably<00:02:18.340> not<00:02:18.670> like

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
screensaver before but probably not like

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.539 
screensaver before but probably not like
this<00:02:19.120> where<00:02:19.480> you<00:02:20.080> can<00:02:20.290> see<00:02:20.319> our<00:02:20.650> pictures<00:02:21.099> I

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
this where you can see our pictures I

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:23.580 
this where you can see our pictures I
don't<00:02:22.510> know<00:02:22.780> why<00:02:23.019> they're<00:02:23.260> all<00:02:23.290> of<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.560> same

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
don't know why they're all of the same

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.080 
don't know why they're all of the same
cat<00:02:24.040> but<00:02:24.310> they<00:02:24.810> beautiful<00:02:25.810> HD<00:02:26.739> quality<00:02:27.400> images

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
cat but they beautiful HD quality images

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.270 
cat but they beautiful HD quality images
but<00:02:28.299> seeing<00:02:28.870> them<00:02:29.049> just<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.470> static<00:02:29.920> images

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
but seeing them just the static images

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.860 
but seeing them just the static images
like<00:02:30.519> this<00:02:30.730> is<00:02:30.940> not<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.299> most<00:02:31.450> interesting

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
like this is not the most interesting

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.259 
like this is not the most interesting
way<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:32.709> show<00:02:33.069> them<00:02:33.280> that<00:02:33.340> when<00:02:33.519> you<00:02:33.700> combine

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
way to show them that when you combine

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.809 
way to show them that when you combine
the<00:02:35.200> photographs<00:02:35.860> of<00:02:36.069> your<00:02:36.190> collection<00:02:36.700> with

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
the photographs of your collection with

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.360 
the photographs of your collection with
a<00:02:36.940> pair<00:02:37.180> of<00:02:37.209> settle<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:38.019> RSX<00:02:38.530> you<00:02:38.950> can<00:02:39.099> do<00:02:39.160> some

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
a pair of settle and RSX you can do some

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.309 
a pair of settle and RSX you can do some
really<00:02:39.489> interesting<00:02:39.819> things<00:02:40.090> so<00:02:40.569> this<00:02:41.140> is

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
really interesting things so this is

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.440 
really interesting things so this is

with<00:03:30.000> your<00:03:30.150> friends<00:03:30.510> in<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.690> little<00:03:30.870> class

with your friends in the little class

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.600 
with your friends in the little class
and<00:03:32.720> we<00:03:33.530> would<00:03:33.740> be<00:03:33.860> evolving<00:03:34.460> this

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
and we would be evolving this

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.640 
and we would be evolving this
functionality<00:03:35.330> over<00:03:35.450> times<00:03:35.930> add<00:03:36.290> new

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
functionality over times add new

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.620 
functionality over times add new
features<00:03:36.920> to<00:03:37.190> this<00:03:37.610> which<00:03:38.270> i<00:03:38.360> think<00:03:38.420> is<00:03:38.600> a

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
features to this which i think is a

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.200 
features to this which i think is a
great<00:03:38.840> additional<00:03:39.770> benefit<00:03:40.220> to<00:03:40.460> the<00:03:40.940> device

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
great additional benefit to the device

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.600 
great additional benefit to the device
so<00:03:41.960> let's<00:03:41.990> have<00:03:42.260> a<00:03:42.320> look<00:03:42.470> at<00:03:42.680> some<00:03:43.430> of<00:03:43.460> the

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
so let's have a look at some of the

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.510 
so let's have a look at some of the
other<00:03:43.760> functionality<00:03:44.630> in<00:03:44.690> the<00:03:44.780> Cox<00:03:44.960> media<00:03:45.290> bar

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
other functionality in the Cox media bar

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.390 
other functionality in the Cox media bar
so<00:03:46.660> bit<00:03:47.660> hard<00:03:47.960> to<00:03:48.110> demonstrate<00:03:48.320> music<00:03:49.160> wire

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
so bit hard to demonstrate music wire

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.300 
so bit hard to demonstrate music wire
musically<00:03:50.120> in<00:03:50.660> a<00:03:50.750> room<00:03:50.930> like<00:03:51.110> this<00:03:51.170> but<00:03:51.590> in

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
musically in a room like this but in

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.790 
musically in a room like this but in
addition<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:52.940> the<00:03:53.360> music

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
addition to the music

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.560 
addition to the music
functionality<00:03:54.800> is<00:03:55.220> also<00:03:55.250> some<00:03:56.150> built-in

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
functionality is also some built-in

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.870 
functionality is also some built-in
visualizer<00:03:57.080> functionality<00:03:57.920> once<00:03:58.190> again<00:03:58.490> this

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
visualizer functionality once again this

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.550 
visualizer functionality once again this
is<00:03:59.120> just<00:03:59.300> the<00:03:59.450> beginning<00:03:59.930> of<00:04:00.050> where<00:04:00.230> we<00:04:00.410> will

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
is just the beginning of where we will

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.800 
is just the beginning of where we will
go<00:04:00.709> with<00:04:01.010> visualise<00:04:01.520> the<00:04:01.670> functionality<00:04:02.360> and

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
go with visualise the functionality and

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.440 
go with visualise the functionality and
it'll<00:04:03.050> extend<00:04:03.290> that<00:04:03.709> grow<00:04:04.220> over<00:04:04.610> time<00:04:04.880> as<00:04:05.330> you

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
it'll extend that grow over time as you
