then repeat exactly the same route and I
will<00:00:58.410> leave<00:00:58.530> instruction<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.280> second<00:00:59.609> time

so<00:01:09.090> what's<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.390> route<00:01:09.570> going<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.840> take<00:01:09.990> in

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
so what's the route going to take in

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.980 
so what's the route going to take in
total<00:01:10.530> Andy<00:01:10.829> the<00:01:11.579> routes<00:01:11.789> just<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.570> over<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
total Andy the routes just just over the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.109 
total Andy the routes just just over the
hour<00:01:13.170> it's<00:01:13.649> a<00:01:13.740> good<00:01:13.920> run<00:01:14.130> it's<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.700> 60<00:01:15.030> kilometer

00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:18.179 
run so hopefully we'll will show an

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:22.450 
run so hopefully we'll will show an
improvement<00:01:18.450> we<00:01:18.840> run<00:01:19.079> one<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.409> run<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.710> okay

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.740

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
further you're confident in route C I

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.190 
further you're confident in route C I
will<00:01:53.670> be<00:01:53.819> a<00:01:53.849> better<00:01:54.090> more<00:01:54.569> fuel-efficient

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
will be a better more fuel-efficient

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.620 
will be a better more fuel-efficient
driver<00:01:55.409> very<00:01:56.399> common

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.060 

well<00:02:01.630> that's<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:01.900> end<00:02:01.930> of<00:02:02.110> round<00:02:02.320> one<00:02:02.560> I<00:02:02.830> don't

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
well that's the end of round one I don't

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.370 
well that's the end of round one I don't
think<00:02:03.220> I<00:02:03.280> did<00:02:03.340> that<00:02:03.490> badly<00:02:04.030> and<00:02:04.990> it's<00:02:05.140> gone<00:02:05.290> off

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
think I did that badly and it's gone off

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.720 
think I did that badly and it's gone off
to<00:02:05.470> look<00:02:05.590> at<00:02:05.710> the<00:02:05.800> diner<00:02:06.010> fleet<00:02:06.280> data<00:02:06.490> and

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
to look at the diner fleet data and

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.389 
to look at the diner fleet data and
he'll<00:02:06.850> tell<00:02:07.090> me<00:02:07.120> just<00:02:07.450> how<00:02:07.570> well<00:02:07.780> I<00:02:07.930> did<00:02:08.350> do<00:02:08.560> so

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
he'll tell me just how well I did do so

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.030 
he'll tell me just how well I did do so
nd<00:02:09.700> in<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.420> real<00:02:10.630> one<00:02:10.899> how<00:02:11.200> did<00:02:11.350> we<00:02:11.440> do<00:02:11.620> we

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
nd in the real one how did we do we

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.650 
nd in the real one how did we do we
leave<00:02:12.160> it<00:02:12.220> okay<00:02:12.280> I<00:02:12.700> think<00:02:13.150> there's<00:02:13.270> some<00:02:13.390> areas

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
leave it okay I think there's some areas

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.930 
leave it okay I think there's some areas
where<00:02:13.840> we<00:02:13.990> can<00:02:14.140> improve<00:02:14.200> further<00:02:14.770> use<00:02:15.700> of<00:02:15.880> the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
where we can improve further use of the

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.000 
where we can improve further use of the
cruise<00:02:16.150> control<00:02:16.180> but<00:02:17.170> we<00:02:17.290> use<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.620> eye<00:02:17.650> roll

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
cruise control but we use the eye roll

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.120 
cruise control but we use the eye roll
function<00:02:18.550> a<00:02:18.730> little<00:02:19.030> bit<00:02:19.240> more<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:20.440> maybe<00:02:21.010> a

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
function a little bit more and maybe a

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.980 
function a little bit more and maybe a
bit<00:02:21.400> of<00:02:21.430> manual<00:02:21.670> intervention<00:02:22.450> where<00:02:22.630> we<00:02:22.780> can

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
bit of manual intervention where we can

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.449 
bit of manual intervention where we can
maybe<00:02:23.290> stop<00:02:23.590> some<00:02:23.830> of<00:02:23.860> those<00:02:24.010> unnecessary

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
maybe stop some of those unnecessary

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.270 
maybe stop some of those unnecessary
gear<00:02:25.030> changes<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:26.410> maybe<00:02:26.560> just<00:02:26.770> tickle<00:02:27.100> it<00:02:27.190> up

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
gear changes and maybe just tickle it up

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.220 
gear changes and maybe just tickle it up
into<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.730> higher<00:02:28.060> gear<00:02:28.390> on<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.840> fourth<00:02:29.020> wall

the vehicle moving we've maintained a
good<00:03:41.540> speed<00:03:42.080> so<00:03:42.680> it's<00:03:42.830> looking<00:03:43.070> for<00:03:43.220> that<00:03:43.370> gap

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
good speed so it's looking for that gap

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:44.560 
good speed so it's looking for that gap
in<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:43.880> road<00:03:44.090> ahead

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
but what would that that seven point

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.750 
but what would that that seven point
four<00:04:16.440> percent<00:04:16.620> improvement<00:04:17.040> actually<00:04:17.610> mean
