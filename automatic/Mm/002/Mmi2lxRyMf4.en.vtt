seconds and you do you squat you

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:39.280 
seconds and you do you squat you
vertically<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:37.160> reason<00:02:37.550> why<00:02:37.790> this<00:02:38.210> is<00:02:39.170> an

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
vertically the reason why this is an

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.790 
vertically the reason why this is an
exception<00:02:39.770> to<00:02:39.800> the<00:02:39.980> rule<00:02:40.220> is<00:02:40.490> that<00:02:40.910> if<00:02:41.800> you

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
exception to the rule is that if you

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.330 
exception to the rule is that if you
notice<00:02:43.160> that<00:02:43.190> if<00:02:43.820> you<00:02:44.030> do<00:02:44.180> a<00:02:44.210> lot<00:02:44.420> of<00:02:44.450> jumping

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
notice that if you do a lot of jumping

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.560 
notice that if you do a lot of jumping
you<00:02:46.340> really<00:02:46.670> you'll<00:02:46.790> notice<00:02:47.090> that<00:02:47.120> your<00:02:47.420> hip

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
you really you'll notice that your hip

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.980 
you really you'll notice that your hip
flexors<00:02:47.720> here<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:49.670> bird<00:02:49.940> right<00:02:50.450> why<00:02:50.750> did<00:02:50.870> they

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
flexors here the bird right why did they

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.100 
flexors here the bird right why did they
burn<00:02:51.250> because<00:02:52.250> when<00:02:52.730> you're<00:02:52.850> jumping<00:02:53.330> they're

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
burn because when you're jumping they're

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.780 
burn because when you're jumping they're
resisting<00:02:54.710> your<00:02:54.770> jump<00:02:55.070> these<00:02:55.250> muscles<00:02:55.670> right

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
resisting your jump these muscles right

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.450 
resisting your jump these muscles right
here<00:02:56.290> they're<00:02:57.290> sort<00:02:57.560> of<00:02:57.590> acting<00:02:57.950> like<00:02:58.040> a<00:02:58.070> break

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
here they're sort of acting like a break

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.070 
here they're sort of acting like a break
into<00:02:59.000> your<00:02:59.030> jump<00:02:59.360> because<00:02:59.600> now<00:02:59.720> they're<00:02:59.960> not

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
into your jump because now they're not

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.150 
into your jump because now they're not
really<00:03:00.370> you<00:03:01.370> don't<00:03:01.520> really<00:03:01.610> need<00:03:01.880> them<00:03:02.090> um<00:03:02.510> uh

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
really you don't really need them um uh

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.670 
really you don't really need them um uh
in<00:03:04.160> a<00:03:04.940> movement<00:03:05.210> like<00:03:05.240> jumping<00:03:05.720> right<00:03:06.110> or<00:03:06.350> even

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
in a movement like jumping right or even

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.680 
in a movement like jumping right or even
squatting<00:03:07.040> right<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.880> hip<00:03:08.060> flexors<00:03:08.480> here

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
squatting right the hip flexors here

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.600 
squatting right the hip flexors here
especially<00:03:09.410> jumping<00:03:10.040> they're<00:03:10.160> they're

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
especially jumping they're they're

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.610 
especially jumping they're they're
creating<00:03:11.090> a<00:03:11.180> sort<00:03:11.420> of<00:03:11.480> a<00:03:11.570> resistant<00:03:12.140> me<00:03:12.260> jump

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
creating a sort of a resistant me jump

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.200 
creating a sort of a resistant me jump
that's<00:03:12.800> why<00:03:12.920> you<00:03:13.400> tear<00:03:13.700> them<00:03:13.880> up<00:03:13.940> that's<00:03:14.060> where

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
that's why you tear them up that's where

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.060 
that's why you tear them up that's where
they<00:03:14.300> so<00:03:14.450> sore<00:03:14.720> after<00:03:14.960> you<00:03:15.080> do<00:03:15.740> a<00:03:15.770> bunch<00:03:15.980> of

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
they so sore after you do a bunch of

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.100 
they so sore after you do a bunch of
vertical<00:03:16.400> jumps<00:03:16.640> it<00:03:16.760> makes<00:03:16.910> my<00:03:17.110> vertical

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
vertical jumps it makes my vertical

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.720 
vertical jumps it makes my vertical
jumps<00:03:18.440> if<00:03:18.950> you<00:03:19.160> stress<00:03:19.550> these<00:03:19.760> muscles<00:03:20.390> here

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
jumps if you stress these muscles here

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.890 
jumps if you stress these muscles here
before<00:03:22.730> you<00:03:23.350> attempt<00:03:24.350> a<00:03:24.410> mex<00:03:24.860> effort<00:03:25.430> um

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
before you attempt a mex effort um

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.790 
before you attempt a mex effort um
vertical<00:03:26.900> jump<00:03:27.110> you<00:03:27.260> trying<00:03:27.500> to<00:03:27.560> catch<00:03:27.650> a

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
vertical jump you trying to catch a

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.670 
vertical jump you trying to catch a
vertical<00:03:28.190> you<00:03:28.880> put<00:03:29.450> them<00:03:29.630> asleep<00:03:29.840> you<00:03:30.260> making

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
vertical you put them asleep you making

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.590 
vertical you put them asleep you making
the<00:03:30.770> weaker<00:03:31.160> so<00:03:31.760> in<00:03:31.910> a<00:03:32.000> way<00:03:32.150> you're<00:03:32.360> you're

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
the weaker so in a way you're you're

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.450 
the weaker so in a way you're you're
freeing<00:03:32.900> them<00:03:33.170> like<00:03:33.319> you<00:03:33.470> you<00:03:33.830> free<00:03:34.100> the<00:03:34.280> rest

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
of the the muscles are that are

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.280 
of the the muscles are that are
activated<00:03:37.910> when<00:03:38.270> you<00:03:38.360> do<00:03:38.540> a<00:03:38.569> when<00:03:39.080> you<00:03:39.140> do<00:03:39.260> a

activated when you do a when you do a
vertical<00:03:39.440> jump<00:03:39.830> right<00:03:40.130> see<00:03:40.340> putting<00:03:40.819> these

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
vertical jump right see putting these

way<00:03:43.340> there<00:03:44.060> you<00:03:44.569> kind<00:03:45.110> of<00:03:45.140> just<00:03:45.350> you<00:03:45.530> know

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
way there you kind of just you know

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.540 
way there you kind of just you know
unlocking<00:03:46.520> that<00:03:46.640> break<00:03:46.940> right<00:03:47.390> right<00:03:47.600> here<00:03:47.840> so
