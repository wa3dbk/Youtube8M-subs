00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
a little bit more layering and it's kind

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.370 
a little bit more layering and it's kind
of<00:01:22.490> hard<00:01:22.640> to<00:01:22.670> tell<00:01:22.820> expires<00:01:23.240> slightly<00:01:24.170> damp

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
of hard to tell expires slightly damp

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.039 
of hard to tell expires slightly damp
and<00:01:24.649> dark<00:01:25.159> but<00:01:25.880> yeah<00:01:26.149> so<00:01:26.390> the<00:01:26.509> first<00:01:26.719> major

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
and dark but yeah so the first major

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.130 
and dark but yeah so the first major
change<00:01:27.350> will<00:01:27.649> be<00:01:27.939> cutting<00:01:28.939> these<00:01:29.689> types<00:01:30.020> of

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
change will be cutting these types of

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.219 
change will be cutting these types of
pieces<00:01:30.500> throughout<00:01:31.250> my<00:01:31.429> hair<00:01:31.670> um<00:01:32.049> like<00:01:33.049> I<00:01:33.079> said

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
pieces throughout my hair um like I said

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.039 
pieces throughout my hair um like I said
to<00:01:33.469> get<00:01:33.740> rid<00:01:33.860> of<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:34.009> rocks<00:01:34.159> ends<00:01:34.729> so<00:01:35.539> it's

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
to get rid of the rocks ends so it's

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.429 
to get rid of the rocks ends so it's
just<00:01:36.909> another<00:01:37.909> step<00:01:38.329> in<00:01:38.479> my<00:01:38.600> transition<00:01:39.289> I

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
just another step in my transition I

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.199 
just another step in my transition I
guess<00:01:39.649> to<00:01:39.860> be<00:01:39.979> completely<00:01:40.579> natural<00:01:41.060> because

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:41.209 
guess to be completely natural because

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:43.690 
guess to be completely natural because
obviously<00:01:41.860> most<00:01:42.860> of<00:01:42.979> my<00:01:43.069> hair<00:01:43.219> is<00:01:43.280> natural<00:01:43.610> but

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
obviously most of my hair is natural but

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.520 
obviously most of my hair is natural but
just<00:01:43.909> like<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.270> very<00:01:44.420> ends<00:01:44.750> art<00:01:44.899> so<00:01:45.259> that's

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
just like the very ends art so that's

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.749 
just like the very ends art so that's
why<00:01:45.729> next<00:01:46.729> I'll<00:01:46.909> just<00:01:47.090> talk<00:01:47.240> about<00:01:47.390> color<00:01:47.630> um

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
why next I'll just talk about color um

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.910 
why next I'll just talk about color um
obviously<00:01:49.759> I<00:01:49.939> still<00:01:50.179> have<00:01:50.360> this<00:01:50.569> in<00:01:50.959> but<00:01:51.739> it's

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
obviously I still have this in but it's

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.270 
obviously I still have this in but it's
growing<00:01:52.280> out<00:01:53.049> you<00:01:54.049> can<00:01:54.170> see<00:01:54.349> it's<00:01:54.950> grown<00:01:55.159> out

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
growing out you can see it's grown out

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.669 
growing out you can see it's grown out
quite<00:01:55.819> a<00:01:55.849> bit<00:01:55.939> and<00:01:56.299> a<00:01:57.140> lot<00:01:57.259> of<00:01:57.289> people<00:01:57.380> have

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
quite a bit and a lot of people have

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:59.889 
quite a bit and a lot of people have
been<00:01:57.739> asking<00:01:57.920> me<00:01:58.280> to<00:01:58.579> show<00:01:59.209> how<00:01:59.360> I<00:01:59.390> diet<00:01:59.689> which

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
been asking me to show how I diet which

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.600 
been asking me to show how I diet which
I<00:02:00.020> will<00:02:00.170> do<00:02:00.319> the<00:02:00.439> next<00:02:00.560> time<00:02:00.770> I<00:02:00.890> diet<00:02:01.099> but

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
I will do the next time I diet but

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.969 
I will do the next time I diet but
usually<00:02:01.939> let<00:02:02.119> it<00:02:02.239> grow<00:02:02.420> up<00:02:02.539> like<00:02:02.840> a<00:02:03.079> long<00:02:03.739> time

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
usually let it grow up like a long time

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.350 
usually let it grow up like a long time
because<00:02:04.220> you<00:02:04.399> can't<00:02:04.549> tell<00:02:04.789> since<00:02:05.000> it's<00:02:05.209> like

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
because you can't tell since it's like

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:12.729 
because you can't tell since it's like

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
it grow or get healthier just because

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.690

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
and it's kind of like together so like a

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.979 
and it's kind of like together so like a
chunk<00:03:10.900> of<00:03:11.019> hair<00:03:11.319> like<00:03:11.890> this<00:03:11.920> is<00:03:12.690> stronger<00:03:13.690> than

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
chunk of hair like this is stronger than

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.320 
chunk of hair like this is stronger than
one<00:03:14.500> strand<00:03:14.920> of<00:03:15.010> hair<00:03:15.220> so<00:03:15.760> by<00:03:15.849> having<00:03:15.970> it<00:03:16.180> like

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
one strand of hair so by having it like

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.289 
one strand of hair so by having it like
braided<00:03:16.660> you're<00:03:16.870> making<00:03:17.319> like<00:03:17.470> little<00:03:17.799> chunks

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
braided you're making like little chunks

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.210 
braided you're making like little chunks
so<00:03:19.299> I<00:03:19.690> was<00:03:19.750> like<00:03:20.170> I<00:03:20.440> don't<00:03:20.500> really<00:03:20.890> want<00:03:21.130> to

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.979 
so I was like I don't really want to
braid<00:03:21.579> my<00:03:21.610> whole<00:03:22.000> head<00:03:22.269> it's<00:03:22.540> just<00:03:22.690> not<00:03:22.840> my

because they start getting like kind of

because they start getting like kind of
dread<00:03:58.930> up<00:03:59.319> here<00:03:59.650> if<00:03:59.799> I<00:03:59.889> don't<00:04:00.100> um<00:04:00.389> redo<00:04:01.389> them

dread up here if I don't um redo them
every<00:04:01.750> week<00:04:01.900> so<00:04:02.170> strangely<00:04:03.040> enough<00:04:03.250> I<00:04:03.430> have

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:03.639 
every week so strangely enough I have

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:07.890 
every week so strangely enough I have
seen<00:04:03.819> them<00:04:03.970> grow<00:04:04.900> like<00:04:06.450> somewhat<00:04:07.450> rapidly

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
seen them grow like somewhat rapidly

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.530 
seen them grow like somewhat rapidly
it's<00:04:08.019> kind<00:04:08.200> of<00:04:08.260> strange<00:04:08.560> so<00:04:09.489> I'm<00:04:09.790> considering

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
it's kind of strange so I'm considering

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.720 
it's kind of strange so I'm considering
like<00:04:10.690> doing<00:04:11.079> just<00:04:11.290> a<00:04:11.440> row<00:04:11.709> of<00:04:11.739> braids<00:04:12.220> in<00:04:12.519> the

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
like doing just a row of braids in the

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.520 
like doing just a row of braids in the
back<00:04:12.910> um<00:04:13.769> for<00:04:14.769> like<00:04:14.980> the<00:04:15.010> winter<00:04:16.139> because<00:04:17.139> it's

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
back um for like the winter because it's

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.349 
back um for like the winter because it's
the<00:04:17.709> longest<00:04:17.919> layer<00:04:18.519> would<00:04:18.820> be<00:04:18.970> growing

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
the longest layer would be growing

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.170 
the longest layer would be growing
faster<00:04:19.780> but<00:04:20.289> yeah<00:04:20.470> so<00:04:21.099> that's<00:04:21.789> why<00:04:21.970> I<00:04:22.000> have

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
faster but yeah so that's why I have

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.480 
faster but yeah so that's why I have
those<00:04:22.450> I've<00:04:23.410> had<00:04:23.680> them<00:04:23.830> in<00:04:23.950> for<00:04:24.160> like<00:04:24.250> a<00:04:24.280> month

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
those I've had them in for like a month

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.080 
those I've had them in for like a month
and<00:04:24.849> they<00:04:25.120> seem<00:04:25.300> to<00:04:25.330> be<00:04:25.479> helping<00:04:26.940> today<00:04:27.940> I
