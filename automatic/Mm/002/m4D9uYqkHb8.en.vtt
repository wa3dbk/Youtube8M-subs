hey<00:00:07.379> guys<00:00:07.620> what's<00:00:07.890> up<00:00:08.010> this<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:08.429> done<00:00:09.150> and

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
hey guys what's up this is done and

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.720 
hey guys what's up this is done and
welcome<00:00:09.780> to<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:09.990> cinema<00:00:10.650> 4d<00:00:10.860> tutorial<00:00:11.550> and

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
welcome to a cinema 4d tutorial and

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.870 
welcome to a cinema 4d tutorial and
today<00:00:12.630> I<00:00:12.840> will<00:00:13.170> be<00:00:13.440> showing<00:00:13.860> you<00:00:14.070> how<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.309> speed

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
today I will be showing you how to speed

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.670 
today I will be showing you how to speed
up<00:00:14.910> freeze<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:16.109> or<00:00:16.590> slow<00:00:17.070> down<00:00:17.310> cinema<00:00:18.180> 4d

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
up freeze and or slow down cinema 4d

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.759 
up freeze and or slow down cinema 4d
dynamics<00:00:19.880> so<00:00:20.880> we<00:00:21.570> have<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:21.990> very<00:00:22.289> simple

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
dynamics so we have this very simple

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.830 
dynamics so we have this very simple
example<00:00:22.890> this<00:00:23.730> sphere<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.240> going<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.480> blow<00:00:24.660> up

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
example this sphere is going to blow up

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.650 
example this sphere is going to blow up
and<00:00:25.130> they<00:00:26.130> slow<00:00:26.430> down<00:00:26.609> in<00:00:26.789> midair<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.480> then

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
and they slow down in midair and then

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.669 
and they slow down in midair and then
return<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.500> normal<00:00:29.130> speed<00:00:29.689> afterward<00:00:30.689> so

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
return to normal speed afterward so

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.100 
return to normal speed afterward so
let's<00:00:32.009> get<00:00:32.160> started<00:00:32.630> we're<00:00:33.630> going<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.809> create

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
let's get started we're going to create

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.979 
let's get started we're going to create
a<00:00:34.260> new<00:00:34.710> project<00:00:35.219> let's<00:00:35.670> go<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.690> set<00:00:36.960> a

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
a new project let's go in and set a

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.470 
a new project let's go in and set a
floor<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:38.180> get<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.210> sphere<00:00:40.460> give<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:41.730> 12

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
floor and get a sphere give this 12

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.310 
floor and get a sphere give this 12
segments<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.170> radius<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.730> 50<00:00:45.020> let's<00:00:46.020> go<00:00:46.260> to

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
segments and a radius of 50 let's go to

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.520 
segments and a radius of 50 let's go to
our<00:00:46.559> more<00:00:47.160> graph<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.670> get<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> cloner<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.780> drop

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
our more graph and get a cloner and drop

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.189 
our more graph and get a cloner and drop
a<00:00:49.559> sphere<00:00:49.950> inside<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.579> cloner

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
a sphere inside the cloner

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.670 
a sphere inside the cloner
we<00:00:52.199> can<00:00:52.530> pull<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.579> app<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.820> little<00:00:54.030> bit<00:00:54.239> more

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
we can pull this app a little bit more

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.200 
we can pull this app a little bit more
let's<00:00:55.680> say<00:00:55.920> set<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.340> mode<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.550> our<00:00:56.789> corner

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
let's say set the mode of our corner

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.470 
let's say set the mode of our corner
from<00:00:57.420> linear<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.320> grid<00:00:58.890> array<00:00:59.430> just<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.359> we

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
from linear to grid array just so we

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.450 
from linear to grid array just so we
have<00:01:00.510> more<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.020> work<00:01:01.170> with

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
have more to work with

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.910 
have more to work with
let's<00:01:02.460> bump<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:02.879> up<00:01:03.030> again<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.539> now<00:01:03.920> we're

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
let's bump this up again and now we're

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.899 
let's bump this up again and now we're
going<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.100> go<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.280> more<00:01:05.640> graph<00:01:05.939> effective<00:01:06.900> and

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
going to go to more graph effective and

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.500 
going to go to more graph effective and
random<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.590> that's<00:01:10.590> just<00:01:10.740> going<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.920> give<00:01:11.070> us

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
random and that's just going to give us

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.539 
random and that's just going to give us
something<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.540> looks<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:13.049> little<00:01:13.200> less

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
something that looks a little less

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.719 
something that looks a little less
organized<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:15.439> need<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.590> bunch<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.310> up<00:01:17.520> more

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
organized I need to bunch this up more

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.420 
organized I need to bunch this up more
so<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.270> when<00:01:18.450> we<00:01:18.659> run<00:01:19.259> their<00:01:19.470> dynamics<00:01:19.979> these

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
so that when we run their dynamics these

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.800 
so that when we run their dynamics these
are<00:01:20.610> going<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.850> explode<00:01:21.890> a<00:01:22.890> little<00:01:23.400> better

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
are going to explode a little better

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.960 
are going to explode a little better
okay<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:24.869> let's<00:01:25.320> add<00:01:25.560> some<00:01:25.890> dynamics<00:01:26.549> let's<00:01:26.820> go

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
okay so let's add some dynamics let's go

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.170 
okay so let's add some dynamics let's go
to<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.180> floor<00:01:27.530> right<00:01:28.530> click<00:01:28.939> simulation<00:01:29.939> tags

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
to the floor right click simulation tags

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.950 
to the floor right click simulation tags
and<00:01:30.530> rigid<00:01:31.530> body<00:01:32.180> let's<00:01:33.180> do<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> same<00:01:33.659> for<00:01:33.720> our

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
and rigid body let's do the same for our

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.710 
and rigid body let's do the same for our
cloner<00:01:35.329> and<00:01:37.340> when<00:01:38.340> we<00:01:38.460> hit<00:01:38.610> play<00:01:38.850> we<00:01:39.479> have

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
cloner and when we hit play we have

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.069 
cloner and when we hit play we have
something<00:01:40.500> but<00:01:40.920> not<00:01:41.340> very<00:01:41.520> interesting<00:01:42.119> let's

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
something but not very interesting let's

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.280 
something but not very interesting let's
go<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:44.119> simulation<00:01:45.119> tag<00:01:45.689> on<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.930> calluna

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
go to the simulation tag on the calluna

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.550 
go to the simulation tag on the calluna
go<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.040> collision<00:01:47.549> tab<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.630> set

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
go to the collision tab and set

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.190 
go to the collision tab and set
individual<00:01:50.220> elements<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:51.000> all<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.780> way<00:01:51.960> all

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
individual elements to all that way all

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.450 
individual elements to all that way all
of<00:01:52.229> these<00:01:52.850> can<00:01:54.259> be<00:01:55.259> affected<00:01:55.770> by<00:01:55.799> dynamics

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
of these can be affected by dynamics

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.380 
of these can be affected by dynamics
separately<00:01:57.649> alright<00:01:59.030> pretty<00:02:00.030> cool

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
separately alright pretty cool

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.880 
separately alright pretty cool
but<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.840> explosion<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> little

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
but that explosion is a little

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.969 
but that explosion is a little
underwhelming<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:03.390> what<00:02:03.659> we<00:02:03.780> can<00:02:03.930> do<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.530> jazz

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
underwhelming so what we can do to jazz

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:05.420 
underwhelming so what we can do to jazz
it<00:02:05.159> up

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
it up

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.780 
it up
it<00:02:05.730> is<00:02:05.910> to<00:02:06.090> go<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:08.310> dynamics<00:02:08.970> tab<00:02:09.240> and<00:02:10.790> when

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
it is to go to the dynamics tab and when

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.630 
it is to go to the dynamics tab and when
we<00:02:12.210> want<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.510> set<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.900> custom<00:02:13.170> initial<00:02:13.980> velocity

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
we want to set a custom initial velocity

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.700 
we want to set a custom initial velocity
and<00:02:14.790> that<00:02:14.960> this<00:02:15.960> is<00:02:16.050> going<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.320> be<00:02:16.470> on<00:02:16.590> the

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
and that this is going to be on the

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.600 
and that this is going to be on the
y-axis<00:02:17.280> so<00:02:17.460> X<00:02:17.880> Y<00:02:18.450> let's<00:02:19.460> put<00:02:20.460> this<00:02:20.580> as<00:02:20.790> 500<00:02:21.510> so

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
y-axis so X Y let's put this as 500 so

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.949 
y-axis so X Y let's put this as 500 so
they're<00:02:23.610> going<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.880> sort<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.120> blow<00:02:24.360> up<00:02:24.540> in<00:02:24.750> the

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
they're going to sort of blow up in the

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:31.940 
they're going to sort of blow up in the
Y<00:02:27.140> direction<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:30.050> I<00:02:31.050> gain<00:02:31.350> a<00:02:31.650> little

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
Y direction and I gain a little

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.590 
Y direction and I gain a little
underwhelming<00:02:32.459> so<00:02:32.700> let's<00:02:32.880> go<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.150> the

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
underwhelming so let's go to the

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.949 
underwhelming so let's go to the
simulation<00:02:33.930> tag<00:02:34.500> go<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:34.980> collision<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:35.959> let's

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
simulation tag go to collision and let's

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.890 
simulation tag go to collision and let's
increment<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.830> size<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.580> little<00:02:38.910> bit<00:02:39.150> so<00:02:39.600> if<00:02:39.720> we

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
increment the size a little bit so if we

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.550 
increment the size a little bit so if we
say<00:02:40.110> 5<00:02:40.970> we<00:02:41.970> might<00:02:42.180> get<00:02:42.450> something<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:43.170> little

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
say 5 we might get something a little

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.479 
say 5 we might get something a little
better<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:43.970> indeed<00:02:44.970> we<00:02:45.390> do<00:02:45.739> in<00:02:46.739> fact<00:02:47.040> let's

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
better and indeed we do in fact let's

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.180 
better and indeed we do in fact let's
say<00:02:47.700> I<00:02:47.730> go<00:02:48.090> crazy<00:02:48.239> with<00:02:48.570> this<00:02:48.860> I'm<00:02:49.860> going<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.070> go

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
say I go crazy with this I'm going to go

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.860 
say I go crazy with this I'm going to go
to<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:51.480> count<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:51.989> make<00:02:52.080> it<00:02:52.230> 5<00:02:52.470> by<00:02:52.739> 5<00:02:52.950> by<00:02:53.280> 5<00:02:53.870> so

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
to the count and make it 5 by 5 by 5 so

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.640 
to the count and make it 5 by 5 by 5 so
that's<00:02:55.020> going<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.200> be<00:02:55.350> way<00:02:56.100> crazier<00:02:57.650> perhaps

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
that's going to be way crazier perhaps

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.070 
that's going to be way crazier perhaps
too<00:02:59.250> crazy<00:02:59.520> we<00:02:59.850> can<00:03:00.000> go<00:03:00.450> ahead<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:00.690> lower<00:03:00.870> that

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
too crazy we can go ahead and lower that

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:09.740 
too crazy we can go ahead and lower that
increment<00:03:01.530> now<00:03:01.739> to<00:03:01.800> 1<00:03:02.640> or<00:03:03.020> 0<00:03:07.550> awesome

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
increment now to 1 or 0 awesome

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.930 
increment now to 1 or 0 awesome
let's<00:03:10.200> say<00:03:10.410> now<00:03:10.620> do<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.920> freeze-frame<00:03:11.430> let's

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
let's say now do the freeze-frame let's

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.060 
let's say now do the freeze-frame let's
say<00:03:12.150> press<00:03:12.510> control-d<00:03:13.019> to<00:03:13.560> bring<00:03:13.769> up<00:03:13.920> the

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
say press control-d to bring up the

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.580 
say press control-d to bring up the
project<00:03:14.549> settings<00:03:14.940> go<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.750> dynamics<00:03:16.320> tab

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
project settings go to the dynamics tab

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.250 
project settings go to the dynamics tab
and<00:03:16.910> this<00:03:17.910> is<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.269> value<00:03:18.660> that<00:03:18.720> we<00:03:18.930> want<00:03:19.170> to

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
and this is the value that we want to

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.690 
and this is the value that we want to
tinker<00:03:19.500> with<00:03:19.680> it's<00:03:20.130> called<00:03:20.489> a<00:03:20.700> time<00:03:21.120> scale<00:03:21.690> so

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
tinker with it's called a time scale so

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.920 
tinker with it's called a time scale so
at<00:03:23.700> frame<00:03:24.600> 0<00:03:24.630> we<00:03:25.110> obviously<00:03:25.350> want<00:03:26.100> it<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:26.370> be<00:03:26.549> at

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
at frame 0 we obviously want it to be at

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.070 
at frame 0 we obviously want it to be at
100<00:03:27.930> so<00:03:28.560> let's<00:03:28.950> say<00:03:29.310> hold<00:03:30.060> ctrl<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:30.690> click<00:03:30.780> the

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
100 so let's say hold ctrl and click the

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.789 
100 so let's say hold ctrl and click the
circle<00:03:31.350> next<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.250> word<00:03:32.459> timescale<00:03:33.360> and

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
circle next to the word timescale and

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.650 
circle next to the word timescale and
when<00:03:34.799> it<00:03:34.890> goes<00:03:35.100> red<00:03:35.459> it<00:03:35.730> means<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.239> have<00:03:36.480> a

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
when it goes red it means you have a

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.270 
when it goes red it means you have a
keyframe<00:03:38.030> we<00:03:39.030> want<00:03:39.239> to<00:03:39.360> freeze<00:03:40.170> this<00:03:40.470> almost

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
keyframe we want to freeze this almost

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.890 
keyframe we want to freeze this almost
instantly<00:03:41.790> so<00:03:42.120> let's<00:03:42.480> go<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.750> frame<00:03:43.320> 10<00:03:43.799> and

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
instantly so let's go to frame 10 and

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.220 
instantly so let's go to frame 10 and
set<00:03:45.900> this<00:03:46.110> to<00:03:46.410> 0<00:03:47.070> and<00:03:47.329> hold<00:03:48.329> ctrl<00:03:48.750> again<00:03:49.049> and

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
set this to 0 and hold ctrl again and

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.360 
set this to 0 and hold ctrl again and
click<00:03:50.120> so<00:03:51.120> we<00:03:51.510> have<00:03:51.750> this<00:03:52.230> it<00:03:52.650> just<00:03:52.709> freezes

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
click so we have this it just freezes

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.360 
click so we have this it just freezes
like<00:03:53.579> that<00:03:53.970> and<00:03:54.239> that's<00:03:54.570> pretty<00:03:55.110> cool<00:03:55.370> we're

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
like that and that's pretty cool we're

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.180 
like that and that's pretty cool we're
going<00:03:56.489> to<00:03:56.549> go<00:03:56.640> to<00:03:56.700> frame<00:03:57.030> 50<00:03:57.630> and<00:03:58.190> insert

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
going to go to frame 50 and insert

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.970 
going to go to frame 50 and insert
another<00:03:59.400> keyframe<00:04:00.019> move<00:04:01.019> forward<00:04:01.440> 10<00:04:01.650> frames

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
another keyframe move forward 10 frames

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.620 
another keyframe move forward 10 frames
and<00:04:02.280> bring<00:04:02.760> this<00:04:02.880> back<00:04:03.120> to<00:04:04.190> 100<00:04:05.269> so<00:04:06.269> we<00:04:06.420> have

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
and bring this back to 100 so we have

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.500 
and bring this back to 100 so we have
this<00:04:06.840> animation<00:04:07.380> it<00:04:07.590> freezes<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.510> then

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
this animation it freezes and then

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.960 
this animation it freezes and then
carries<00:04:10.380> on<00:04:10.560> so<00:04:11.370> you<00:04:11.459> could<00:04:11.610> have<00:04:11.760> some<00:04:11.940> kind

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
carries on so you could have some kind

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.640 
carries on so you could have some kind
of<00:04:12.150> camera<00:04:12.450> move<00:04:12.810> panning

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
of camera move panning

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.939 
of camera move panning
around<00:04:13.829> this<00:04:14.069> as<00:04:14.459> this<00:04:14.819> air<00:04:15.150> is<00:04:16.139> frozen<00:04:16.500> and

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
around this as this air is frozen and

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.610 
around this as this air is frozen and
that<00:04:17.040> creates<00:04:17.340> a<00:04:17.400> really<00:04:17.609> cool<00:04:17.639> effect<00:04:18.620> I'm

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
that creates a really cool effect I'm

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.570 
that creates a really cool effect I'm
going<00:04:19.680> to<00:04:19.829> go<00:04:19.949> to<00:04:20.009> my<00:04:20.250> window<00:04:20.729> and<00:04:21.079> timeline

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
going to go to my window and timeline

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.850 
going to go to my window and timeline
let's<00:04:23.580> say<00:04:23.789> I<00:04:23.820> get<00:04:24.090> this<00:04:24.330> a<00:04:24.360> key<00:04:25.199> frames<00:04:25.500> here

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
let's say I get this a key frames here

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.529 
let's say I get this a key frames here
and<00:04:26.039> set<00:04:27.030> their<00:04:27.240> value<00:04:27.750> to<00:04:28.039> 25<00:04:29.039> instead<00:04:29.400> of<00:04:29.820> 0

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
and set their value to 25 instead of 0

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:34.810 
and set their value to 25 instead of 0
do<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:31.650> same<00:04:31.889> over<00:04:32.160> here<00:04:32.449> that<00:04:33.449> way<00:04:33.630> the

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
do the same over here that way the

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.860 
do the same over here that way the
spheres<00:04:35.820> are<00:04:35.940> never<00:04:36.090> going<00:04:36.240> to<00:04:36.300> stop<00:04:36.570> actually

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
spheres are never going to stop actually

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.540 
spheres are never going to stop actually
moving<00:04:37.259> completely<00:04:37.680> they're<00:04:38.160> just<00:04:38.310> going<00:04:38.460> to

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
moving completely they're just going to

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.779 
moving completely they're just going to
slow<00:04:38.759> down<00:04:39.000> and<00:04:39.449> then<00:04:39.570> speed<00:04:39.930> up<00:04:40.190> again<00:04:41.190> but

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
slow down and then speed up again but

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:45.320 
slow down and then speed up again but
that's<00:04:42.270> almost<00:04:42.449> too<00:04:43.410> quick<00:04:43.740> so<00:04:44.580> let's<00:04:44.880> say<00:04:45.150> I

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
that's almost too quick so let's say I

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.920 
that's almost too quick so let's say I
just<00:04:45.750> start<00:04:45.930> again<00:04:46.850> instead<00:04:47.850> of<00:04:47.970> 25<00:04:48.510> let's

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
just start again instead of 25 let's

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.640 
just start again instead of 25 let's
have<00:04:49.550> five<00:04:51.050> so<00:04:52.050> they're<00:04:52.199> gonna<00:04:52.289> be<00:04:52.470> moving

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
have five so they're gonna be moving

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.460 
have five so they're gonna be moving
very<00:04:53.070> slowly<00:04:53.610> for<00:04:54.090> a<00:04:54.150> while<00:04:54.330> and<00:04:54.750> then<00:04:54.990> speed

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
very slowly for a while and then speed
