00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello guys and well found in this 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.310
 new video weblog I iphoneitalia.com 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.839
 I'm Andrea Salomone Today Let's go to 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.820
 see the most important news of the 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.650
 iphone camera if we remember 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.639
 will be launched between September and October 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.639
 2015 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.910
 then as reported by 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.099
 several iphone 6s sources could have 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.399
 a 12 megapixel camera on the 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.600
 4k video recording portal stand 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.100
 new league 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.510
 this news could become the 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.460
 the voices that spoke of a noise 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.230
 camera actually improved on 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.290
 iphone 6 s also consider that the 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.449
 the camera's model was always 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:51.140
 improved in the iphone 4s added 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:53.300
 they have gone from 4 5 to 8 megapixels 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.399
 in general all hassan models has 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.300
 had improvements related to 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.440
 camera 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.640
 the news comes from a document 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.559
 reserved by an apple supplier 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.899
 appeared on the net specifically yes 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.610
 in short, he could think of one 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.759
 12 megapixel camera with the 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.530
 support for 4k native recording 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.690
 obviously there is no sure news and 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.399
 there was also a moment there was a 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.520
 news update 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.929
 a few days later a few hours later 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.060
 new information arrives on 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:20.590
 likely 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.479
 reports this news on the probable 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.009
 coming is a counselor if one speaks in the 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.290
 specific forzista there were already 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.110
 analyzed of the color in hours of 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.579
 a touch and even more powerful for 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.930
 regarding the camera 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:33.939
 obviously these are not news 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.860
 certainly the fact that 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.570
 we have already seen it done by apple in 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.009
 in short, all the other models 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.049
 improvements to the camera then 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.179
 we were usually in the 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.329
 passage for example between iphone 4s 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:48.549
 iphone 5 iphone 5 if maybe the camera 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.289
 it has remained more or less the same 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.299
 we also say that perhaps the hour x apple 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.700
 detaching from the 8 megapixels after three 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.310
 years and go precisely to 12 megapixels if 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.200
 not to 16 which would be more just forces 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.110
 but we can also 12 megapixels 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.970
 accept them at 4k video recording 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.890
 unit now in optical stabilization 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.569
 software at the opening it has reached 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.069
 truly exceptional levels could 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.530
 allow the iPhone to return to 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.239
 be a little unanimously even if like 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.090
 numbers where the camera still from 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.260
 camcorder most appreciated by users 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.239
 in any case the boys let me know 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.769
 what do you think of the camera itself 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.900
 consequences if I would like this is 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.609
 a life if you would prefer for example 12 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.560
 megapixels but also an improvement given 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:28.989
 sensor or 16 megapixel with a 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.370
 sensor that remains the same or 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.350
 let me know even if you register 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.750
 4k on a smartphone looks like a 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.060
 something exaggerated also because not 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.310
 I know how many of you have a monitor on 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.829
 which to produce 4k movies in 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.329
 comments we can discuss it as at 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.269
 I usually also read you some comments 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:48.609
 interesting published in the news 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.870
 iphoneitalia.com then we have band that 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:51.010
 writes is ok but less than expected 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.720
 introduce the possibility of making 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.319
 choose the quality with which to record 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.489
 that I know 720p and 1080p and 4k would be 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.680
 the ideal this is a very thing 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.940
 interesting that is today on the iPhone not 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.930
 we can choose the quality of 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.880
 registration 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.030
 the iphone director automatically at the top 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.480
 of quality 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.600
 we also say in the case of the 4k would be 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.510
 difficult to do it because if an iphone from 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.940
 16 giga directors in 4k fill it up later 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.459
 therefore very little indeed without doubt 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.080
 should allow you to change the 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.550
 how to register and in this 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.520
 we might have clues maybe already 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.600
 with ios 9 beginnings that we don't have for now 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.940
 conai is instead the possibility of 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.470
 carefully record this indeed 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.080
 what had escaped me you see the was 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.090
 just saying we really do not have 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.890
 watched by we look because if it were 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.470
 so it would actually be a clear one 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.870
 clue that on iphone 6 s could 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.880
 be there the 4k registration we consider 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.550
 that the iPhone does not record 1080p if 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.709
 I am not mistaken by the iPhone 4s is this 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.690
 then there was never function to see 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.840
 actually on the fly in photos and 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.360
 camera actually yes there is the 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:02.250
 ability to switch from 1080p hd to 30 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.739
 fps at 1080p hd 60 fps only this one in 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.220
 however, there is no mode 7 20 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:10.680
 there is the slow motion 7 minds 120 fps 240 fps 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.390
 however apple has made some additions 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.670
 so it is clear that they are working on it 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.780
 we will find out about this novelty of the 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.760
 camera on this novelty of the 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.380
 camera and on the new iPhone 6 data 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.570
 s all in September when 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.250
 device will be presented and then 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.720
 released in any case bound 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.310
 iphoneitalia tmnews returns week 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.990
 next with a new focus allows 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.190
 let me know what you think of them
