00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.260
 I am a driving school owner from Leusden 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.710
 and I have a lesson car and a Peugeot 308 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:19.529
 input 6 hard a diesel engine this car 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.720
 now has two 152,000 on the clock 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.150
 I am on my way to the inspection for the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.500
 car week audience is smiling around here and me 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.669
 I'm curious what the judge is about 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.540
 is going to find 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:29.710
 i hope it's all a bit 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.800
 not too bad 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.800
 ha 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.620
 a whole battery around me 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.230
 interior mirror exterior mirrors really like 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.170
 anything and everything 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.980
 few extra pedals yes this peugeot 308 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.210
 is a 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.680
 lesson car and those are tropics for miles 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.150
 generally because they have it 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.519
 just to endure 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.909
 I like anyone who cannot row yet 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.350
 still try here in this car high that 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:03.159
 is quite a challenge for technology 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.159
 fallen in a lot 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.500
 want links and things like that 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.229
 once again leads in present especially 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.020
 passed worn poker 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.490
 and links is very heavy just stood 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.630
 for the traffic light 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.280
 I saw him just a moment but in neutral 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.289
 put him on a time glass 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.240
 well that is for real one and unique 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:21.860
 me actually but it would be with that too 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.720
 double pedals 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.960
 And yes you can do the person again 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.119
 don't blame a point 6 hadith you 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.539
 may drive a whole with how is 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.210
 my entire pk's out of my mind and 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:38.750
 he runs very well in itself 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.869
 sounds very yes 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.390
 Well lets just say bad just 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.200
 is not a nice french chanson if you like it 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.369
 gas pedal 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.689
 it is above all a lot of chatter 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.259
 device good 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.790
 its running really well so do n't know if 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.590
 we can and the cause for it 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.240
 find 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.009
 I also really need to evidence 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.250
 look oh yes 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.630
 vibrate with brakes I felt that 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.100
 turn signal does not come naturally 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.479
 back so you take a right turn 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.790
 you really have to go there 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.810
 manually put that thing back because 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.610
 other than 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.530
 then you keep blinking wonder if or 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.620
 find it further on the bridge 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.850
 but yes so initially stop it 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.850
 engine engine noise after 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:42.239
 the opening sentence is oh dear some oil 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:44.459
 a chicken and a pipe that is good 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.040
 no yes this is and who sees and divide 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.560
 house with all valves 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.250
 to cool it in from this car that can 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.650
 That 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.840
 Exclude then air ran through the 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.599
 intercooler but directly 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.519
 from the listener's engine they have 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.709
 a very complicated plastic house 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.269
 made with all valves in it and that 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.450
 go very often 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:10.650
 leaking that is common and then you can 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.150
 try to close me all the way i guides 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.370
 that is also done here and it will be 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.019
 you just have to be rooted 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.000
 and branch out how to make a whole unit 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.950
 replace it once it gets there 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.280
 really a huge bowl of other problems 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.280
 different 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.280
 he all looks clean from vans 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.280
 far 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.480
 brake pad forum 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.480
 almost worn out 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.819
 you knew you would be today 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.819
 combination the front door 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.290
 give physio in minimum of 24 millimeters 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:53.810
 write for this 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.920
 well with this micrometer I can 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.930
 and then we arrive at 2395 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.790
 seated 500 family we aim 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.680
 of course only the negligible 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.060
 put sometime next block 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.950
 you have to write new blocks 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.370
 take the right front wheel of one 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.370
 lesson car 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:15.139
 embroidery damage that is of course that do 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.430
 nothing to you 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.459
 it will will ever toes curves 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.169
 You have to sit next to the floor in Liz 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:24.770
 if the wwb have sidewalk wants to roll 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:28.150
 sometimes i think so bol.com a bit 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.150
 it is not too bad 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:34.280
 now on a triangle behind with the e point 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.800
 6 pegs yes that is always exciting mic 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.340
 after it's that engine see me here a lot 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.110
 not because he's so good not to be well 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.490
 say it's a very terrible thing 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.289
 thing is but it is one 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.960
 the essenhof much relatively much 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:50.810
 problems especially with the first 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.280
 generation in 16-valve version is there 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.840
 this one too 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.120
 but this I my very few problems 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.009
 look like this is possible so that is also possible yes 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.139
 I am very pleased with that 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:02.360
 marked almost nothing about this car 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:04.580
 actually really little things that 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.990
 during the test drive or traffic jam they are the 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.940
 heater is not quite good at all 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.500
 does not work a number 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.990
 direction that does not come naturally 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.610
 returns after a right turn 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.349
 i start i found it annoying moments 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.639
 very quickly used to it certainly as you know 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:18.169
 what the part costs then makes 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.270
 actually not so much more than put out 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.520
 you already get it back 450 euros 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.070
 just so I put all himself back 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.530
 and then I also understood that we had the 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.509
 the owner of the car does the steering 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.210
 and the bow they are pretty worn for 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:34.849
 the kilometer but yes that will be the way 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.740
 of use and under the hood 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:39.520
 it turned out that valves were on the house 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.479
 fox oil is leaking and there is also some turbo pressure 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.639
 leaked well like that valve house 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:45.310
 replaced then it actually 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:49.389
 just completely done again 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.389
 blocks are prescribed next turn 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.240
 but like normal wear that are just 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.690
 below the minimum size where certainly not 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:06:00.250
 unsafe yes just a topper 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.250
 yet another goal comes like that 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.330
 come on point to make your tastes 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.610
 video file against 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.500
 thinking about luck is not too bad 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:13.100
 a few points that need some attention 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.419
 require yes yes something true exactly how long 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.470
 I have to do 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:17.630
 yes i hope you haven't got out of you 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.100
 makeup as I agreed must be below 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.880
 a thousand can still be nice but also 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:25.190
 sit fishing to go for half an hour 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.139
 one and a half per year sides thick 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.300
 Depreciation is the largest 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:30.620
 was also difficult 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.060
 goes there in a small per kilometer 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:37.400
 little yes so under anchors you have something more 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:39.520
 activity farewell meter and I am and 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.229
 organizations between it's my buddy 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.330
 I listen to that second house with two 

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:47.919
 spend the many hours and yes that is 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.919
 just yes it is very nice car
