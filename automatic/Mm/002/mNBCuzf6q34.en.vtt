Virgo<00:00:24.029> made<00:00:24.449> that<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.750> very<00:00:24.960> relevant<00:00:25.320> point

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
Virgo made that the very relevant point

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.070 
Virgo made that the very relevant point
that<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.160> now<00:00:26.340> becoming<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.970> disadvantage<00:00:27.810> to

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
tournament Lee what did you do I'm like

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.560 
tournament Lee what did you do I'm like
I<00:01:10.380> decided<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.159> at<00:01:11.340> some<00:01:11.549> stage<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:12.299> was<00:01:12.390> more

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
I decided that at some stage it was more

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.780 
I decided that at some stage it was more
or<00:01:12.659> less<00:01:12.750> impossible<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.890> really<00:01:14.340> guarantee

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
or less impossible to really guarantee

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.380 
or less impossible to really guarantee
to<00:01:15.540> get<00:01:15.900> these<00:01:16.020> balls<00:01:16.290> safe<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.340> why<00:01:17.939> not<00:01:18.210> just

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
to get these balls safe so why not just

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.440 
to get these balls safe so why not just
sacrifice<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:20.100> break<00:01:20.340> off<00:01:20.580> just<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.180> drop

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
sacrifice the break off just to drop

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.770 
sacrifice the break off just to drop
into<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.810> pack<00:01:22.159> and<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.549> way<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.420> don't

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
into the pack and that way you don't

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.240 
into the pack and that way you don't
actually<00:01:25.049> do<00:01:25.380> anything<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:25.920> if<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.220> a

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
actually do anything so if it is a

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.100 
actually do anything so if it is a
disadvantage<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:27.119> break<00:01:27.330> off<00:01:27.570> then<00:01:27.840> don't

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
disadvantage to break off then don't

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.679 
disadvantage to break off then don't
break<00:01:28.320> off<00:01:28.590> was<00:01:29.070> my<00:01:29.250> thought<00:01:29.490> pattern<00:01:29.909> but<00:01:30.540> if

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
break off was my thought pattern but if

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.569 
break off was my thought pattern but if
you<00:01:30.840> can<00:01:31.049> guarantee<00:01:31.290> getting<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.100> ball<00:01:32.280> safe

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
you can guarantee getting the ball safe

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.520

dangerous for your opponent yeah it's
just<00:02:31.420> funny<00:02:31.660> because<00:02:31.810> that<00:02:31.960> table<00:02:32.410> there<00:02:32.560> when

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650

the<00:02:32.740> Grand<00:02:32.950> Prix<00:02:33.070> I<00:02:33.310> seem<00:02:33.580> to<00:02:33.610> have<00:02:33.760> a<00:02:33.820> very

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
the Grand Prix I seem to have a very

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.600 
the Grand Prix I seem to have a very
strange<00:02:34.870> reason<00:02:35.770> I<00:02:35.890> thought<00:02:36.040> of<00:02:36.130> it<00:02:36.220> off<00:02:36.340> pat

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
strange reason I thought of it off pat

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.680 
strange reason I thought of it off pat
and<00:02:36.760> every<00:02:36.910> time<00:02:37.060> I<00:02:37.150> played<00:02:37.330> that<00:02:37.480> I<00:02:37.540> was

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
and every time I played that I was

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.120 
and every time I played that I was
finding<00:02:37.900> a<00:02:38.080> cushion<00:02:38.590> and<00:02:38.680> I<00:02:38.770> thought<00:02:38.950> that<00:02:39.100> I

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
finding a cushion and I thought that I

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.290 
finding a cushion and I thought that I
was<00:02:39.250> getting<00:02:39.310> an<00:02:39.490> advantage<00:02:39.730> after<00:02:39.970> break

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
was getting an advantage after break

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
he didn't fancy the saw so it's all

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.150

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
okay well the reason why the the jacking

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.420 
okay well the reason why the the jacking
the<00:03:14.350> cue<00:03:14.530> up<00:03:14.620> in<00:03:14.740> the<00:03:14.800> back<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.010> having<00:03:15.280> to

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.770 
the cue up in the back and having to
play<00:03:15.580> over<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.820> top<00:03:16.000> of<00:03:16.030> a<00:03:16.240> ball<00:03:16.420> is<00:03:16.600> so

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
play over the top of a ball is so

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.020 
play over the top of a ball is so
difficult<00:03:17.020> is<00:03:17.410> when<00:03:18.070> you<00:03:18.190> play<00:03:18.370> a<00:03:18.400> swerve<00:03:18.700> shot

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
difficult is when you play a swerve shot

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.370 
difficult is when you play a swerve shot
this<00:03:19.180> is<00:03:19.330> what<00:03:19.450> you<00:03:19.570> do<00:03:19.780> when<00:03:20.140> you're<00:03:20.290> playing

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
this is what you do when you're playing

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.990 
this is what you do when you're playing
a<00:03:20.560> swerve<00:03:20.800> shot<00:03:21.010> to<00:03:21.100> swerve<00:03:21.370> round<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:21.820> ball

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
a swerve shot to swerve round the ball

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.060 
a swerve shot to swerve round the ball
you<00:03:22.540> jack<00:03:22.810> up<00:03:22.990> the<00:03:23.110> coup<00:03:23.290> because<00:03:23.620> you<00:03:23.709> can<00:03:23.920> get

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
you jack up the coup because you can get

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.860 
you jack up the coup because you can get
more<00:03:24.220> side<00:03:24.550> spin<00:03:24.580> on<00:03:25.000> and<00:03:25.330> it<00:03:25.420> effectively

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
more side spin on and it effectively

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.140 
more side spin on and it effectively
swerves<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.440> cue<00:03:26.650> ball<00:03:26.830> realm<00:03:27.040> so<00:03:27.490> if<00:03:28.000> you're

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
swerves the cue ball realm so if you're

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.430 
swerves the cue ball realm so if you're
gonna<00:03:28.270> play<00:03:28.480> a<00:03:28.510> shot<00:03:28.720> where<00:03:28.900> you're<00:03:29.020> hampered

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
gonna play a shot where you're hampered

by a ball like this and you're hitting
down<00:03:31.120> on<00:03:31.330> the<00:03:31.420> shot<00:03:31.660> you<00:03:32.410> can<00:03:32.440> easily<00:03:32.770> swerve

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
down on the shot you can easily swerve

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.670 
down on the shot you can easily swerve
it<00:03:33.550> so<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.150> problem<00:03:34.450> becomes<00:03:34.570> what<00:03:35.200> do<00:03:35.350> you<00:03:35.440> do
