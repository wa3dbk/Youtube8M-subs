00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.230
 angiology and vascular surgery is a 

00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:08.940
 dedicated surgical medical specialty 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.340
 to the clinical diagnosis study and 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.559
 treatment of vascular pathology is 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.839
 say organic diseases or 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.730
 Functional of the venous arterial system 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.040
 and lymphatic the surgery specialist 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.689
 Vascular must also be competent in 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.180
 Knowledge and testing 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.980
 non- invasive and to interpret and value 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.259
 any other diagnostic technique 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.250
 by image in the field of pathology 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:30.960
 vascular 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.850
 [Music] 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.129
 what you have to do is a good study 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.739
 ecographic and know how to design for each 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:40.890
 patient the suit he needs to make a 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.079
 hemodynamic study of the leg seeing 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.960
 the confluent is not femoral seeing 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.699
 the whole saphenous vein where they are coming 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.890
 the main collaterals that we 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.480
 varices originate the same with the 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.050
 they do external and once you have 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.370
 made the hemodynamic map of that 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.640
 patient of that venous insufficiency 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.190
 you choose trying to do the least 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.610
 aggressive possible the patient what 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.380
 they had varicose veins on their leg 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.600
 left some varicose strangulation is 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.640
 dependent on failure undo 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.149
 internal has a lack of 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.920
 internal social safena from the street of 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.960
 they make them in the groin the confluence of 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.090
 they make it to two the femoral that 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.009
 it continued along the entire thigh and 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.350
 then they played and dilated 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.950
 varicose veins more superficial to 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.890
 from him 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.750
 of the distal third of the thigh and about 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.799
 the knees to treat those of others 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.799
 we have done an ablation with 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.479
 radiofrequency with ultrasound control 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.070
 we work on the saphenous once 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.520
 we are inside the scenes 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:46.060
 we introduce a guide and about that guide 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.860
 we introduce a valga introducer valga 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.630
 the redundancy in all that already once 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.390
 on the introducer we can put the 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.429
 radiofrequency catheter a catheter 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.350
 centimeter what takes the points a 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.360
 7-centimeter segment which is what 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.700
 will give us is going to be the emission of 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.619
 heat by radiofrequency waves that 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.380
 they are going to do the spasm of the scenes 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.970
 once placed inside everything with control 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.399
 with ultrasound to where we want 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.110
 get what we do is a tumescence 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.950
 around the saphenous ie 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.260
 cold saline injected around 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.269
 they do so lets us two things for a 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.069
 side protect the skin to avoid 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.220
 possibility of a burn and on the other 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:27.790
 side collapse help collapse 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.610
 compress the scene more so that the 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.170
 thermal ablation be more effective already 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.030
 from there we give the cycles 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.370
 in necessary in this case have been 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.630
 four cycles to be able to do the 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.030
 ablation of the entire segment 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.190
 insufficient are cycles of 20 seconds 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.890
 where we reach 120 degrees senses of 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:50.180
 temperature and then we are doing 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:52.550
 those segments of 710 centimeters each 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.470
 time that allows us to emit the 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.300
 heat that generates a spasm and a 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.090
 fibrosis over do them like that makes 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.940
 that collapse once the 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.290
 segment that interests us to collapse is 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.730
 makes a check to see that the 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.739
 confluence is made not femoral has 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.470
 remained permeable that the femoral has 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.850
 lita been permeating we have made a 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.830
 extraction by crochet technique 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.019
 with micro incisions and a hook for 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.319
 get the varicose veins out of all 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:20.150
 varices and then we have put 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.790
 we have done a second check of the 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.110
 state of the femoral actions and in 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.549
 instead of a compressive bandage now 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.250
 we are using an elastic mean 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.440
 specific for the surgical post leave 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.930
 of operating theater with an average with an average 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:37.330
 elastic which is much more 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.330
 comfortable for patients 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.200
 angiology and vascular surgery because 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.900
 the specialty is a specialty 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.020
 mixed surgical doctor we tackle the 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:52.710
 medical treatment 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:55.680
 with drugs with rehabilitation like 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:58.380
 surgical pathology of all 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.230
 both arterial and knossos vessels 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.180
 as lymphatics except the heart and 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.580
 the root of the aorta that is the field 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.610
 specific to cardiac surgery and 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.710
 intracranial vessels but the rest of the 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:15.380
 body to the rest of the body's vessels 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.380
 they are our field of action 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.659
