00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.180
 hi friends of the channel 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.489
 we are here for another review on 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.910
 knives specifically 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:40.590
 today we will talk about an Italian brand that 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.230
 the fox knife this unboxing video 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.120
 because this new knife is me 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:51.230
 arrived very recently and I waited 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:57.049
 to see it with you 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:01:04.830
 these are the sides of the package 

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:07.979
 then I state that I am strongly a 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:12.840
 favor of the Italian knife brands 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.440
 the fox the extreme breed are are the 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.440
 best 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.049
 cer envy us all over the world 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.299
 for their quality 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:26.640
 then let's take a moment to see more 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:33.090
 specifically it is a 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:35.570
 folding now I try to open it ok there 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.570
 we are 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.790
 it is a fox leaflet 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.909
 let's see it together I see it too 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.229
 together with you then the clip for the 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.690
 fixing the belt to the backpack 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.860
 classic metal clip a knife 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:03.830
 very essential cute inserts in 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:10.080
 wood that is not plastic 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:15.209
 I like this thing it's one of those 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:17.700
 knives that opens with one hand a 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:22.819
 the blade is quite large as you can see 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:29.790
 the blade despite the length is not 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:32.790
 very few centimeters the thickness la 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.959
 remarkable blade width too 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.850
 thickness in the initial part is 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:43.709
 good enough for this kind of 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:47.850
 knife has as many models of this 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:52.470
 type with a moving stop that locks 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:55.489
 the blade and that allows to close the 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:02.549
 knife and open it all with one hand 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:06.120
 this is very convenient when you are 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.410
 outdoor survival is not a 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.480
 real knife and from 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.380
 survival this is a knife that 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:16.170
 I would recommend for hikers 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:21.819
 on Sunday there is a good knife of 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:28.959
 reliable brand wanders around 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:32.239
 25 30 euros as a relatively low cost 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:35.330
 small in size so not even the 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:38.180
 weight is not excessive to carry e 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.640
 second put a hiker going 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.209
 out on Sunday with the backpack makes the 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:49.489
 walk can be very convenient 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:54.590
 I would recommend see it for a moment 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:58.879
 cut as you can see at a good 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:08.120
 cut is not a razor but it is anyway 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:10.849
 appreciable makes it for what a 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:15.129
 must be able to make out with a knife 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.129
 they went out on a donkey Sunday afternoon 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:21.639
 the logo is fine on the blade 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.639
 of the fox 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:31.680
 it's a simple knife so don't miss it 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:37.139
 is a very long review is a bit 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:45.300
 The Christmas treat I wanted 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:50.150
 take out pretty little cute at the 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:52.590
 hole to be carried with a strap 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:57.600
 we as always prefer to use 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:05:02.520
 of parÃ  rope that then maybe done 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:05.100
 in the form of key rings no so as to 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.800
 have at least a couple of meters of park 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.830
 herbs with us that you can use with the 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.110
 knife what to say for the review of 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.680

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:20.220
