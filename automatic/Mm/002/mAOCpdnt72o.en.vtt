they're<00:01:28.920> similar<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:30.060> jets<00:01:30.360> from<00:01:30.540> you

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
they're similar to the jets from you

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:31.969 
they're similar to the jets from you
know<00:01:31.020> what<00:01:31.140> I've<00:01:31.229> known<00:01:31.409> for<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.619> past<00:01:31.710> couple

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
know what I've known for the past couple

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.859 
know what I've known for the past couple
years<00:01:32.130> obviously<00:01:32.820> with<00:01:33.000> their<00:01:33.479> coordinator

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
years obviously with their coordinator

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.410 
years obviously with their coordinator
coming<00:01:34.110> from<00:01:34.200> there<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.939> try<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.000> go<00:01:36.119> off<00:01:36.240> that

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
coming from there and try to go off that

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.819 
coming from there and try to go off that
a<00:01:36.450> little<00:01:36.689> bit<00:01:36.750> but<00:01:36.900> obviously<00:01:37.259> personnel<00:01:37.770> is

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
a little bit but obviously personnel is

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.340 
a little bit but obviously personnel is
different<00:01:38.130> too<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.780> scheme<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.990> going<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.229> have

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
different too so scheme is going to have

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.020 
different too so scheme is going to have
to<00:01:40.500> kind<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.740> go<00:01:40.860> in<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.610> personnel<00:01:41.970> that

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
to kind of go in and the personnel that

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.710 
to kind of go in and the personnel that
you<00:01:42.180> have

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
you have

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.630 
you have
you<00:01:42.900> said<00:01:43.110> when<00:01:43.380> you're<00:01:43.530> over<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.950> know<00:01:44.280> Joey's

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
you said when you're over to know Joey's

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.160 
you said when you're over to know Joey's
about<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.940> turn<00:01:45.120> it<00:01:45.240> around<00:01:45.300> which<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:45.930> way

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
about to turn it around which is way

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.600 
about to turn it around which is way
after<00:01:46.470> approach<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.860> won't<00:01:47.370> give<00:01:47.520> you

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
after approach it won't give you

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.760 
after approach it won't give you
confidence<00:01:47.940> this<00:01:48.600> team<00:01:48.840> turn<00:01:49.230> around<00:01:49.440> your

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
confidence this team turn around your

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.610 
confidence this team turn around your
neck<00:01:50.450> I<00:01:51.450> don't<00:01:51.840> think<00:01:51.900> we<00:01:52.140> ever<00:01:52.170> lost

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
neck I don't think we ever lost

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.310 
neck I don't think we ever lost
confidence<00:01:53.090> obviously<00:01:54.090> it's<00:01:54.780> tough<00:01:55.050> when<00:01:55.200> you

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
confidence obviously it's tough when you

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.960 
confidence obviously it's tough when you
lose<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.920> two<00:01:56.070> close<00:01:56.310> games<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.700> could<00:01:56.850> have

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
lose the two close games I could have

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.610 
lose the two close games I could have
gone<00:01:57.060> either<00:01:57.090> way<00:01:57.270> but<00:01:58.080> you<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:58.470> keep

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
gone either way but you just keep

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.290 
gone either way but you just keep
paddling<00:01:58.800> and<00:01:59.340> that's<00:01:59.550> I<00:01:59.850> think<00:02:00.030> the

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
paddling and that's I think the

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.030 
paddling and that's I think the
character<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:00.810> team<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.260> that<00:02:01.440> you<00:02:01.950> know

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
character is team is that you know

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.680 
character is team is that you know
battle<00:02:02.520> through<00:02:02.700> adversity<00:02:02.970> and<00:02:03.270> keep<00:02:03.510> going

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
battle through adversity and keep going

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.410 
battle through adversity and keep going
until<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.230> know<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:05.010> final<00:02:05.310> whistle<00:02:05.640> no<00:02:06.090> lo

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
until you know that final whistle no lo

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.960 
until you know that final whistle no lo
so<00:02:07.130> you<00:02:08.130> just<00:02:08.399> got<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.580> be<00:02:08.700> one<00:02:08.790> on<00:02:08.880> a

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
so you just got to be one on a

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.669 
so you just got to be one on a
day-to-day<00:02:09.149> basis<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.899> week-to-week<00:02:10.110> basis

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
day-to-day basis in a week-to-week basis

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.380 
day-to-day basis in a week-to-week basis
and<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.490> know<00:02:11.940> good<00:02:12.090> things<00:02:12.270> will<00:02:12.360> happen

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
get a film on a young guy after a couple

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.350 
get a film on a young guy after a couple
games<00:02:19.440> that<00:02:19.650> they<00:02:19.740> haven't<00:02:19.920> seen<00:02:20.250> before<00:02:20.360> that

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
games that they haven't seen before that

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.880 
games that they haven't seen before that
they<00:02:21.510> make<00:02:21.690> adjustments<00:02:22.410> so<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.590> have

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
they make adjustments so you have

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.990 
they make adjustments so you have
counter<00:02:23.850> adjustments<00:02:24.540> in<00:02:24.660> mind<00:02:24.930> if<00:02:25.610> if<00:02:26.610> that

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
counter adjustments in mind if if that

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.690 
counter adjustments in mind if if that
does<00:02:27.240> happen<00:02:27.270> either<00:02:27.810> this<00:02:28.050> week<00:02:28.320> or<00:02:28.470> are<00:02:28.770> down

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
does happen either this week or are down

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.140 
does happen either this week or are down
the<00:02:29.880> line<00:02:30.060> I<00:02:30.680> don't<00:02:31.680> think<00:02:31.740> that<00:02:32.070> applies<00:02:32.850> too

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
the line I don't think that applies too

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.930 
the line I don't think that applies too
much<00:02:33.300> in<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.870> quarterback<00:02:34.230> position<00:02:34.940> there's

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
much in the quarterback position there's

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.730 
much in the quarterback position there's
so<00:02:36.120> much<00:02:36.240> going<00:02:36.420> on<00:02:36.600> to<00:02:36.840> focus<00:02:37.140> just<00:02:37.170> on<00:02:37.530> one

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
so much going on to focus just on one

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.680 
so much going on to focus just on one
guy<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:38.280> think<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:39.090> would<00:02:39.180> be<00:02:39.300> kind<00:02:39.480> of<00:02:39.510> hard

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
guy I think that would be kind of hard

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.350 
guy I think that would be kind of hard
to<00:02:39.780> do<00:02:40.020> so<00:02:40.500> it's<00:02:41.430> not<00:02:41.520> like<00:02:41.700> baseball<00:02:42.209> where

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
to do so it's not like baseball where

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.270 
to do so it's not like baseball where
our<00:02:42.450> young<00:02:42.600> pitcher<00:02:42.930> comes<00:02:43.140> in<00:02:43.320> and<00:02:43.500> no<00:02:44.160> one

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
our young pitcher comes in and no one

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.620 
our young pitcher comes in and no one
can<00:02:44.370> hit<00:02:44.520> them<00:02:44.610> for<00:02:44.820> a<00:02:44.850> few<00:02:45.060> weeks<00:02:45.270> and<00:02:45.480> then

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
can hit them for a few weeks and then

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.759 
can hit them for a few weeks and then
all<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:45.840> sudden<00:02:45.870> they<00:02:46.140> catch<00:02:46.380> up<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.590> this

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
all of a sudden they catch up to this

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.350 
all of a sudden they catch up to this
stuff<00:02:46.980> because<00:02:47.160> it's<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:47.880> know<00:02:47.910> fastball

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
stuff because it's you know fastball

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.729 
stuff because it's you know fastball
curveball<00:02:48.570> changeup<00:02:49.200> I<00:02:49.410> mean<00:02:49.530> there's<00:02:49.680> only

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
curveball changeup I mean there's only

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.050 
curveball changeup I mean there's only
so<00:02:50.130> much<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:50.280> can<00:02:50.370> do<00:02:50.519> but<00:02:50.550> with<00:02:50.820> our<00:02:50.940> offense

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
so much you can do but with our offense

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.890 
so much you can do but with our offense
we're<00:02:51.930> so<00:02:52.340> multiple<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.580> what<00:02:53.760> we<00:02:53.880> do<00:02:54.090> that<00:02:54.870> I

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
we're so multiple and what we do that I

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.240 
we're so multiple and what we do that I
don't<00:02:55.050> think<00:02:55.380> you<00:02:55.470> can<00:02:55.620> really<00:02:55.680> get<00:02:55.980> a<00:02:56.010> bead<00:02:56.220> on

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
don't think you can really get a bead on

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.030 
don't think you can really get a bead on
just<00:02:56.610> one<00:02:56.790> guy<00:02:56.970> it's<00:02:57.660> a<00:02:57.840> no<00:02:58.290> all<00:02:58.470> 11<00:02:58.830> going

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
just one guy it's a no all 11 going

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.220 
just one guy it's a no all 11 going
together<00:02:59.160> and<00:02:59.640> you<00:03:00.630> know<00:03:00.750> it's<00:03:00.840> not<00:03:00.900> something

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
together and you know it's not something

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.300 
together and you know it's not something
that<00:03:01.320> I<00:03:01.350> really

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
that I really

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
luck I have I think that's kind of hand

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.839 
luck I have I think that's kind of hand
in<00:04:03.609> hand<00:04:03.790> with<00:04:03.879> the<00:04:04.299> way<00:04:04.420> I<00:04:04.450> think<00:04:04.629> so<00:04:05.730> you<00:04:06.730> know

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
in hand with the way I think so you know

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.220 
in hand with the way I think so you know
you<00:04:06.910> just<00:04:07.090> gotta<00:04:07.269> try<00:04:07.780> to<00:04:07.810> cover<00:04:08.019> all<00:04:08.200> your

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
bases obviously someone's going to get

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.069 
bases obviously someone's going to get
thrown<00:04:10.239> at<00:04:10.359> you<00:04:10.480> that<00:04:10.599> you<00:04:10.690> haven't<00:04:10.840> seen

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:12.900 
thrown at you that you haven't seen
before<00:04:11.109> that's<00:04:11.470> just<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:11.799> way<00:04:11.919> it<00:04:12.459> is<00:04:12.519> in<00:04:12.819> this

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
before that's just the way it is in this

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.970 
before that's just the way it is in this
league<00:04:13.150> so<00:04:13.480> you<00:04:14.109> try<00:04:14.260> to<00:04:14.319> prepare<00:04:14.500> as<00:04:14.709> much<00:04:14.799> as

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.010 
for us like I said we're so multiple
there's<00:04:30.970> so<00:04:31.060> many<00:04:31.150> things<00:04:31.270> that<00:04:31.510> we<00:04:31.690> can<00:04:31.840> do

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
there's so many things that we can do

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.260 
there's so many things that we can do
not<00:04:32.770> only<00:04:32.979> just<00:04:33.220> because<00:04:33.639> of<00:04:33.760> our<00:04:33.820> scheme<00:04:34.120> but

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
not only just because of our scheme but

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.760 
not only just because of our scheme but
because<00:04:34.539> of<00:04:34.570> our<00:04:34.690> personnel<00:04:35.169> you<00:04:35.229> have<00:04:35.530> a<00:04:35.560> lot

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
because of our personnel you have a lot

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.589 
because of our personnel you have a lot
of<00:04:35.800> guys<00:04:36.010> out<00:04:36.220> there<00:04:36.280> you<00:04:36.610> can<00:04:36.820> do<00:04:37.360> a<00:04:37.389> lot<00:04:37.539> of

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:37.599 
of guys out there you can do a lot of

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:39.450 
of guys out there you can do a lot of
different<00:04:37.690> things<00:04:37.930> so<00:04:38.410> I<00:04:38.650> think<00:04:38.950> if<00:04:39.280> anything

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
different things so I think if anything

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.680 
different things so I think if anything
that<00:04:39.580> kind<00:04:39.729> of<00:04:39.880> keeps<00:04:40.030> the<00:04:40.210> defense<00:04:40.510> on<00:04:40.660> its

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
that kind of keeps the defense on its

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.379 
that kind of keeps the defense on its
toes<00:04:40.990> and<00:04:41.430> you<00:04:42.430> know<00:04:42.520> even<00:04:42.760> though<00:04:43.030> we<00:04:43.150> ran<00:04:43.300> it

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
toes and you know even though we ran it

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.180 
toes and you know even though we ran it
one<00:04:43.510> time<00:04:43.690> it<00:04:44.320> probably<00:04:44.440> you<00:04:44.919> know<00:04:44.950> makes

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
one time it probably you know makes

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.550 
one time it probably you know makes
Buffalo<00:04:45.580> practicing<00:04:46.030> and<00:04:46.270> take<00:04:46.870> some<00:04:47.020> time

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
Buffalo practicing and take some time

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.550 
Buffalo practicing and take some time
away<00:04:47.680> from<00:04:47.770> practice<00:04:48.280> in<00:04:48.400> our<00:04:48.490> normal<00:04:48.669> offense

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
away from practice in our normal offense

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.990 
away from practice in our normal offense
you<00:04:50.070> know<00:04:50.160> for<00:04:50.340> me<00:04:50.430> I<00:04:50.460> think<00:04:50.520> it's<00:04:50.820> great

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
you know for me I think it's great

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.270 
you know for me I think it's great
because<00:04:51.270> whenever<00:04:51.810> you<00:04:52.530> can<00:04:52.650> keep<00:04:52.860> a<00:04:52.950> defense

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
because whenever you can keep a defense

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.740 
because whenever you can keep a defense
on<00:04:53.430> their<00:04:53.550> toes<00:04:53.760> I<00:04:54.030> think<00:04:54.240> it<00:04:54.330> helps<00:04:54.450> out<00:04:54.660> the

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
on their toes I think it helps out the

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.650 
on their toes I think it helps out the
quarterback<00:04:55.520> tremendously<00:04:56.520> because<00:04:56.760> they're

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
quarterback tremendously because they're

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.180 
quarterback tremendously because they're
a<00:04:57.690> little<00:04:57.900> bit<00:04:58.080> less<00:04:58.290> aggressive<00:04:58.830> maybe<00:04:59.070> a

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
a little bit less aggressive maybe a

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.379 
a little bit less aggressive maybe a
little<00:04:59.340> more<00:04:59.460> hesitant<00:04:59.639> because<00:05:00.090> they're<00:05:00.270> not

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
little more hesitant because they're not

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:01.430 
little more hesitant because they're not
sure<00:05:00.570> what's<00:05:00.780> going<00:05:00.900> to<00:05:00.990> be<00:05:01.080> thrown<00:05:01.290> at<00:05:01.410> it

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
sure what's going to be thrown at it

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.070 
sure what's going to be thrown at it

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:52.050 
on you know no matter what happens

on you know no matter what happens
throughout<00:07:52.530> the<00:07:52.680> course<00:07:52.889> of<00:07:52.979> the<00:07:53.039> game<00:07:53.219> when

00:07:53.719 --> 00:07:53.729 
throughout the course of the game when

00:07:53.729 --> 00:07:55.249 
throughout the course of the game when
it<00:07:53.849> matters<00:07:54.090> most<00:07:54.120> kind<00:07:55.020> of<00:07:55.050> you<00:07:55.169> know

00:07:55.249 --> 00:07:55.259

00:07:55.259 --> 00:07:57.290 
it matters most kind of you know
delivering<00:07:55.830> in<00:07:55.949> the<00:07:56.039> clutch<00:07:56.280> yeah<00:07:57.060> and<00:07:57.240> i

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:57.300 
delivering in the clutch yeah and i

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.120 
delivering in the clutch yeah and i
think<00:07:57.330> the<00:07:57.810> game<00:07:58.139> kind<00:07:58.380> of<00:07:58.440> dictates<00:07:58.800> what<00:07:59.009> it

00:07:59.120 --> 00:07:59.130 
think the game kind of dictates what it

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:02.540 
think the game kind of dictates what it
is<00:07:59.280> but<00:07:59.550> you<00:08:00.000> know<00:08:00.780> you<00:08:00.870> just<00:08:01.139> I<00:08:01.590> don't<00:08:02.400> know<00:08:02.460> if

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:02.550 
is but you know you just I don't know if

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.159 
is but you know you just I don't know if
it's<00:08:02.639> preparation<00:08:02.940> of<00:08:03.389> you<00:08:03.719> know<00:08:03.810> dealing

00:08:04.159 --> 00:08:04.169 
it's preparation of you know dealing

00:08:04.169 --> 00:08:05.839 
it's preparation of you know dealing
with<00:08:04.259> any<00:08:04.380> practice<00:08:04.830> knowing<00:08:05.190> that<00:08:05.639> you<00:08:05.729> got

00:08:05.839 --> 00:08:05.849 
with any practice knowing that you got

00:08:05.849 --> 00:08:06.770 
with any practice knowing that you got
to<00:08:05.880> make<00:08:06.030> a<00:08:06.060> play<00:08:06.120> because<00:08:06.360> you're<00:08:06.539> down<00:08:06.750> I

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:06.780 
to make a play because you're down I

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.749 
to make a play because you're down I
mean<00:08:07.139> it's<00:08:07.409> obviously<00:08:07.800> an<00:08:08.370> imaginative

00:08:08.749 --> 00:08:08.759 
mean it's obviously an imaginative

00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:11.059 
mean it's obviously an imaginative
situation<00:08:09.719> but<00:08:09.990> you<00:08:10.409> kind<00:08:10.560> of<00:08:10.590> put<00:08:10.770> yourself

00:08:11.059 --> 00:08:11.069 
situation but you kind of put yourself

00:08:11.069 --> 00:08:12.620 
situation but you kind of put yourself
in<00:08:11.159> a<00:08:11.250> mental<00:08:11.729> state<00:08:12.000> and<00:08:12.150> then<00:08:12.300> it<00:08:12.389> carries

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:12.630 
in a mental state and then it carries

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:16.310 
in a mental state and then it carries
over<00:08:12.719> the<00:08:12.930> game<00:08:13.080> which<00:08:13.620> is<00:08:13.650> most<00:08:13.949> vivid
