00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.040 

they<00:00:52.250> use<00:00:52.460> a<00:00:52.670> splitting<00:00:53.090> machine<00:00:53.510> to<00:00:53.840> shave

they use a splitting machine to shave

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.590 
they use a splitting machine to shave
off<00:00:54.230> a<00:00:54.260> layer<00:00:54.559> from<00:00:54.770> the<00:00:54.950> underside

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
off a layer from the underside

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.639 
off a layer from the underside
equalizing<00:00:56.600> the<00:00:56.719> thickness<00:00:57.140> of<00:00:57.260> all<00:00:57.500> the

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
equalizing the thickness of all the

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.560 
equalizing the thickness of all the
pieces

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
pieces

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.200 
pieces
then<00:01:00.230> a<00:01:00.500> skiving<00:01:00.980> machine<00:01:01.310> thins<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:01.760> edges

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
then a skiving machine thins the edges

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.210 
then a skiving machine thins the edges
so<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:02.810> pieces<00:01:03.200> will<00:01:03.380> be<00:01:03.410> easier<00:01:03.860> to<00:01:04.040> sew

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
so the pieces will be easier to sew

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.980 
so the pieces will be easier to sew
together

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
together

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.350 
together
they<00:01:06.560> punch<00:01:06.829> decorative<00:01:07.430> holes<00:01:07.640> into<00:01:07.939> certain

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
they punch decorative holes into certain

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.719 
they punch decorative holes into certain
pieces<00:01:08.600> with<00:01:08.990> a<00:01:09.020> manual<00:01:09.409> press<00:01:09.799> so<00:01:10.340> it's<00:01:10.490> up<00:01:10.610> to

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
pieces with a manual press so it's up to

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.520 
pieces with a manual press so it's up to
the<00:01:10.850> operator<00:01:11.329> to<00:01:11.689> make<00:01:11.840> sure<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.140> distance

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
the operator to make sure the distance

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.969 
the operator to make sure the distance
between<00:01:12.770> holes<00:01:13.189> is<00:01:13.490> consistent

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
they sew together the upper pieces then

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.929 
they sew together the upper pieces then
hammer<00:01:23.409> the<00:01:23.619> stitches<00:01:24.070> to<00:01:24.369> make<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.670> seams
