first<00:00:34.710> step<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.430> we<00:00:36.059> pre-cut<00:00:36.420> our<00:00:36.870> feathers

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
first step is we pre-cut our feathers

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.080 
first step is we pre-cut our feathers
but<00:00:37.980> when<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.250> receive<00:00:38.579> them<00:00:38.760> in<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.940> mail

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
but when you receive them in the mail

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.060 
but when you receive them in the mail
they<00:00:39.270> come<00:00:39.540> by<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.750> yard<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.739> what<00:00:40.920> you're

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
they come by the yard so what you're

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.860 
they come by the yard so what you're
gonna<00:00:41.160> do<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.610> just<00:00:41.790> measure<00:00:42.059> around<00:00:42.420> your

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
gonna do is just measure around your

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.709 
gonna do is just measure around your
shoe<00:00:43.290> we<00:00:44.280> chose<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:44.789> length<00:00:45.149> because<00:00:45.600> it

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
shoe we chose this length because it

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.650 
shoe we chose this length because it
just<00:00:46.020> covers<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:47.010> heel<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.670> that's<00:00:48.420> what<00:00:48.570> we

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
just covers the heel and that's what we

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.910 
just covers the heel and that's what we
want<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.899> be<00:00:48.960> doing<00:00:49.140> we<00:00:49.260> want<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.500> cover<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
want to be doing we want to cover the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.860 
want to be doing we want to cover the
heel<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.489> have<00:00:50.910> not<00:00:51.090> too<00:00:51.449> many<00:00:51.629> feathers

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
heel and have not too many feathers

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.209 
heel and have not too many feathers
hitting<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.379> ground<00:00:52.590> because<00:00:52.920> those<00:00:53.070> will

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
hitting the ground because those will

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.069 
hitting the ground because those will
probably<00:00:53.610> end<00:00:53.730> up<00:00:53.910> falling<00:00:54.120> off<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.629> best<00:00:54.809> way

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
probably end up falling off the best way

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.729 
probably end up falling off the best way
so<00:00:55.710> it's<00:00:55.860> going<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.250> look<00:00:56.399> someone<00:00:56.940> like<00:00:57.149> this

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
so it's going to look someone like this

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.830 
so it's going to look someone like this
so<00:00:58.739> now<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.190> have<00:00:59.250> my<00:00:59.609> feather<00:01:00.120> fringe<00:01:00.510> cut

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
so now that I have my feather fringe cut

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.590 
so now that I have my feather fringe cut
and<00:01:01.079> ready<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.680> go<00:01:02.039> I'm<00:01:02.520> going<00:01:02.579> just<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.270> just

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
and ready to go I'm going just to just

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.260 
and ready to go I'm going just to just
make<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.809> mark<00:01:04.140> on<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.409> shoe<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.949> use<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.790> sharpie

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
make a mark on the shoe I use a sharpie

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.969 
make a mark on the shoe I use a sharpie
paint<00:01:06.960> marker<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.409> these<00:01:07.530> kinds<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.860> things

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
paint marker on these kinds of things

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.830 
paint marker on these kinds of things
but<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.250> could<00:01:08.369> use<00:01:08.520> chalk<00:01:08.850> or<00:01:09.270> pencil

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
but you could use chalk or pencil

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.830 
but you could use chalk or pencil
probably<00:01:10.320> over<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:11.119> just<00:01:12.119> make<00:01:12.299> little<00:01:12.630> mark

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
probably over I just make little mark

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.960

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
just like that to show me where to start

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.300 
just like that to show me where to start
it's<00:01:15.659> now<00:01:15.840> time<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.229> glue<00:01:16.710> down<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.950> feather

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310

and put a generous amount of glue all
along<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.960> top<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.200> one<00:01:22.710> side<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.400> shoe

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.039 

now<00:01:43.570> that<00:01:43.780> that<00:01:43.960> part<00:01:44.289> seems<00:01:44.560> pretty<00:01:44.920> secure

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
now that that part seems pretty secure

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.719 
now that that part seems pretty secure
hot<00:01:47.049> glue<00:01:47.320> dries<00:01:47.530> really<00:01:47.890> fast<00:01:48.070> we're<00:01:48.610> gonna

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
hot glue dries really fast we're gonna

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.999 
hot glue dries really fast we're gonna
flip<00:01:49.030> over<00:01:49.270> while<00:01:50.140> still<00:01:50.409> holding<00:01:50.619> the<00:01:50.890> other

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
flip over while still holding the other

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.740 
flip over while still holding the other
side<00:01:51.280> to<00:01:51.460> make<00:01:51.579> sure<00:01:51.640> it<00:01:51.880> doesn't<00:01:52.030> go<00:01:52.240> anywhere

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
side to make sure it doesn't go anywhere
