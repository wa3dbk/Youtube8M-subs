 that the measures adopted

 mutual biker appreciates this new impulse is an advance an agreement 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:08.539
 that was signed a year ago 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:11.539
 that does not meet all our expectations since we 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.180
 we want 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.720
 Well, the protection should be as broad as possible, but it is not 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.550
 true that the government of Navarre was the first in this tour in Spain that 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.520
 according to agreed this nature 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.240
 and it is also true that less than a year after completion of the affirmation

 yes we have reached agreement whereby it has accelerated in a very 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.690
 important 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.300
 percent the implementation of this agreement therefore our valuation 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.510
 it's positive 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.650
 the government of navarra committed to install barriers in 32 kilometers of 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.780
 roads within five years 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.670
 with this new boost to the regional government will have met 60% of the 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.090
 objectives of the agreement in just two years 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.760
 since the entry into force of the card by points to Navarra has reduced the 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.909
 mortality by 48% with the senate and reducing 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.170
 the number of traffic accidents the department of education and the 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.619
 general traffic management have signed an agreement on the subject of 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.590
 vial education 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.760
 from July 1, 2006 date in which the card by points came into force 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.059
 in Navarre almost 40 thousand points have been removed 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:19.139
 more than 10 thousand drivers 34% of the points stolen have been for 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.589
 speeding 

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:24.469
 this reason is followed by the use of mobile phones and alcohol intake 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.700
 in order to tackle the accident rate, to make young people aware that 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:30.529
 they will be the drivers of tomorrow 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:34.489

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.590
 this agreement with transversal character that consecrates for the subject 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.130
 road safety education is based on the absolute certainty that schoolchildren 

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:48.429
 they will be the drivers of tomorrow 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:51.399
 very clear 

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:53.059
 but not only drivers 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:56.219
 also pedestrians 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:59.219
 and I want to emphasize because also pedestrians 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:00.919
 we are 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:04.129
 a determining agent for safety 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:08.060

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:09.279

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:17.349
