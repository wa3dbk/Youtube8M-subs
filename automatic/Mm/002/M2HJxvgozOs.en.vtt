00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 let's go back in minecraft and good 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.910
 this episode we will not do anything to 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.740
 those who are interested in those things can 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.620
 leaving the video is simply going to be a 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.139
 little recapitulate everything we've done 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.560
 in this series because this is going to be a 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.199
 final episode humidity that is going to 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.620
 listen a little weird because I'm 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.100
 recording in another room 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:31.770
 and as well as eco 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:34.360
 but hey well then this is the house 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.750
 the second house that we were going to do 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.420
 I've gone too big and good 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.380
 I'm going to leave unfinished I'm very sorry 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.050
 by those who wanted the camera 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.870
 but I have neither not not have 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.170
 the time but I do not want to invest more 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.870
 time building this because for that 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.320
 already 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:00.240
 we have the series in creative that soon 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.030
 will bring some new construction 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.670
 but that's why I want to leave that house and the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.560
 I will let go although this world I am going to 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.830
 leave parked I will not do anything else 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.850
 at 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:16.180
 and from the new update 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:19.930
 another world may start 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.120
 and that we put other objectives because 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.580
 I have already complied with all of them here, 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.350
 I can do more or be 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.360
 I think it's going well home and 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.060
 they do not pay much attention to me either 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.960
 we have already done all the farms we did 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.060
 there the trap 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.590
 is that in this world I already have everything 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.049
 fact is that I can not think of anything else 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.840
 what can I do there are people who told me 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.170
 that didntnt and that destroyed my 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.710
 Castilla and things like that but I doubt that 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.710
 gunpowder 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.090
 I do not know if there will be a bug here 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.090
 let's look 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.420
 has said 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.820
 by the way that I have here not bee 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.820
 of gray color 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.090
 and that more than more we have there we did the 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.870
 reactor to the level that we see it there and 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.209
 could do something with material from 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.400
 of that stone that I do not remember how it 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.200
 The truth is that I do not feel like it 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.960
 much to know we have our farm of 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:28.440
 cantaloupe 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:31.740
 the cactus, the sugarcane and the 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:36.140
 of wheat after here at home 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:38.880
 we have everything that diamond iron mode 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.630
 we have everything that can be achieved 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.630
 practically 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.820
 and here the castle 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.560
 I think that is what has most occupied 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:55.040
 apart from this series 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:59.330
 ay with our dyes and here below 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.280
 our mushroom farm 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.520
 and then that's a little bit all that 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.880
 we have done in this series 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.920
 and 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.620
 and the truth is that I would only have that 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.600
 finish the other house but I would need 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.780
 put me to chop stone that is what 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.890
 I really miss 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:22.120
 chop coal to burn that stone and 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:25.650
 maybe cut wood and here is our 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.650
 first house with the mine 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.340
 that right now I have emptiness I have 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.750
 here a little stone and a thousand peaks 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.460
 what did I do for the mine 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.569
 and then I think this is going to be a 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:41.390
 little fired 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.569
 the series because it 's that I already have everything 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.700
 fact 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:49.900
 by the way, better if I have gunpowder 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.819
 but I think I do not have it but little 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.530
 I do not have here 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:58.460
 but they are not the and for now 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.770
 it's not coal I do not have practically 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.970
 and gunpowder I have 15 gunpowder that with 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:06.280
 I do not know if Maria 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:09.580
 three dynamics or something like that 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.830
 or less but well then I think that 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:16.020
 let's leave a bit here I have the 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.020
 good stones let's catch the loes ton 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:24.159
 quartz that this the truth we have not 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:24.159
 I'm going to look at it now 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:29.509
 and so we dismissed the series because it is that 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:32.999
 is that I have run out of things without doing 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:36.350
 first I will use with gloss stone 

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:38.840
 we would do this 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:42.500
 what are lamps 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:45.740
 text to decorate are more cool than 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.560
 torches the problem is that it is a 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.900
 limited resource that as we can only 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.129
 get it with the reactor at level 1 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.949
 I should have put it there 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:57.869
 Well this is very nice but it is 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:01.139
 difficult to achieve because only 

00:04:57.869 --> 00:05:04.139
 you get when you do the reactor 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:07.229
 and well let's look with quartz only 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.770
 it can be done apparently this kind of 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.590
 quartz 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:15.009
 that would be normal blocks that stops 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.409
 decorate take and bread there and like this house 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.360
 we will not use it to decorate 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:21.639
 these floors or things like that would be 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.880
 pretty cool how to make the floor of the 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:27.510
 castle or something like that 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:31.330
 but little more utility has and then 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:33.819
 let's say goodbye here in our little house 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:37.210
 this series will thank you very much for 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:41.889
 thank you very much for all the support that I have 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:43.659
 been receiving during these 27 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:45.520
 chapters if I'm not wrong can that 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:48.310
 some more 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.199
 just that and nothing from 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:53.669
 that the update comes out we'll see if 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:53.669
 we make another series of survival 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:06:00.919
 and we'll look later 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.050
 what will happen to the channel so nothing 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:04.819
 I'm going to fire here, although there will be a 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:08.330
 short video but good was just 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:09.949
 to dismiss the series so nothing 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.270
 I hope you liked it if it's like that 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:13.000

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.510
