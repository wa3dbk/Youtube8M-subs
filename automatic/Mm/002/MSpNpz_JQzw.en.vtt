00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.119
 hi paco here is a sanchez to see 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.220
 the importance of 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.290
 this match so much for the team to be 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.730
 immersed in the tie as for 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.189
 you here in the agent calderón 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.970
 I wanted you to value me ss the meeting 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.970
 today as you have seen 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.340
 I liked it 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.489
 we see 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.180
 there is a lot a good match we have committed 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.770
 some mistakes like 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.960
 of which the primary one knows 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.370
 take very well but I'm not leaving the 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.600
 all disgusted of what I've seen in the 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.880
 field so we have to improve 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.010
 certain things because 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.370
 give tail in this category 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.949
 Well, we have 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.880
 complicated then being able to put 0 in 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.890
 the party and yet we have done 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.060
 but if it is clear that the team is a 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.980
 great effort has not been put with the dow 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.330
 1 with him but he was very open we have 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.700
 had bad luck of that goal in own 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.850
 door again but good are things that 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.320
 happen we understand it as part of the 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.840
 competition and we have to improve what 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.250
 we have to learn from them but I have 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.680
 seen the team that I wanted to see here in 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.320
 the pilot is and in that aspect I think that 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.810
 the guys have done a good job 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.670
 the pac or eduardo with something to force the 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.710
 blog you can get something positive from 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.900
 find tonight if I am your sack 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.360
 many positive things you know you have 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.650
 that fixing something is something positive 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.510
 when you see that there is an error or when 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.640
 you see that things are done well 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.770
 empower them to try to fix 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.660
 small mistakes the big mistakes that 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.060
 but I have many things 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.530
 Positive team liked me before 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.360
 an opponent that is a great rival and that is 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.540
 a team that defensively very strong 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.380
 and that as we have seen that people are 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.039
 very fast that comes out against with a 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.530
 spectacular speed I think we've 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.729
 I repeated it, I connected one 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.410
 I would have liked the game to go 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.869
 keep going with that marker because 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.130
 it was very very even but but 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.170
 well it's also true that I say 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.580
 madrid is a team that was 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.420
 take advantage of their situations very well 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.420
 he has done perfectly 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.659
 and have listened many times during 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.939
 this season 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:23.890
 the expression give away goals and big 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:26.019
 mistakes gives the feeling that it does not 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.000
 never ends the failure that the 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.650
 defense today to what extent do you think it's worth 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.290
 it solves it in a day is a matter of the 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.269
 way to play the team 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.890
 yes yes yes, they have a solution 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.019
 my responsibility is to say for example 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.579
 that today he loses a ball the first 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.530
 goal he does because I tell him he has 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.200
 that to do that we try not to 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.810
 wrong but good is a part of 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.549
 game in which you are not wrong because there 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.769
 Sometimes it costs us dearly, for example 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.659
 I know worse the second goal than the 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.250
 first I think the second one is much more 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:56.019
 serious that the first one we commit more 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.560
 error in the second goal than in the 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.000
 First 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.620
 the first one is my responsibility 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.480
 they do what I ask of them 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.960
 what I tell them what we work 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.580
 and in that good aspect because today 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.900
 we see with mistakes and when you commit 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.610
 mistakes especially before an opponent with the 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.130
 theme of the pagans but let's 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.530
 keep trying to play as we do 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.930
 only that improving I do not think that the image 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.400
 of improvement is there not and we have 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.340
 to improve in that keep doing that 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.980
 without without without giving ease to the contrary 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.870
 so that it can hurt us 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.819
 to andres cabrera kaiser magazine 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:33.959
 how do you rate the buccaneers a 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:35.480
 had decided to come in my opinion what 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.310
 you want 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.810
 I dedicate myself to training and we have come 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.160
 here we have made the best match that 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.780
 we could have had a great 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.460
 a welcome here in our stadium 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:49.260
 we have something there they were all there with 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:51.330
 which well everything all calm 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.129
 josé vicente anaya national ideal in 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.000
 other occasions I remember for example 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:58.200
 before leaving before Christmas 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.970
 party and spanish was very pissed 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.909
 by re also errors that had 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.319
 cost the match on Spanish day 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.640
 today however you are happy with the 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.159
 image the team despite the fact that 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.200
 mistakes also cost us the meeting 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:12.349
 that differentiates time between a moment and 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.519
 another so that your sensations are 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.829
 positive and at that moment so 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.470
 negative because I think we've done 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.329
 more good things than bad without committing 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.660
 three mistakes in a match is not 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:27.570
 so serious there are times that they commit a lot 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.010
 more if it costs you less less goals to the 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.560
 final you can not analyze this only in 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.110
 a match or two matches not this at 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.669
 final is a compendium of 38 matches in 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.650
 what good when you get to the end 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.449
 you draw conclusions you get statistics 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.560
 make numbers and you realize that what 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:42.420
 he has done well that he has done wrong until 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.430
 where could he have arrived 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.810
 it is true that when we have good we have 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.160
 committed a couple of errors at the beginning of 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.770
 party that la leti madrid has known 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.789
 take advantage very well 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:55.280
 we do not always commit them that has 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.740
 touched what touches now is to work it 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.479
 improve them assimilate the see that we have 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.979
 committed and try to look for 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:02.720
 solutions so that it does not happen again 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:05.090
 but it is clear 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.700
 the fire there must be mistakes if not 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.960
 there were goals, absolutely nothing will happen 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.670
 then we who have to 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.400
 try without changing our way of 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:16.720
 do things and find solutions that 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.720
 errors that appear from time to time 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.270
 and apart 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:37.319
 a hat because it's like a cold with balls 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:37.319
 it's over at that age 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.960
 and as a last question, they are 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.930
 talking about possible casualties 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.730
 Morcillo today has been the owner how he values 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.639
 for ccoo the possible output of blood sausage 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.379
 and the match he has made today 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:54.409
 about we've been talking the other day and 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:57.229
 I repeat the same thing while not 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:59.060
 come another player that I like 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:00.919
 and that I believe that better also does not go 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.529
 nobody is going to leave nobody more than 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:05.649
 team 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:07.959
 today as no one is going anywhere 

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:10.239
 site I do not know what will happen tomorrow or 

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:11.559
 next week or I do not know but to day 

00:06:10.239 --> 00:06:13.749
 today what is what I can do 

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:15.009
 talk got the ray player today 

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:16.299
 has played because I wanted to convenient 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:16.839
 I had to play, I liked his 

00:06:16.299 --> 00:06:18.069
 match 

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:19.899
 It's true that you start a little bit but 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:22.539
 little by little he is a player who comes 

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:23.679
 without playing and playing in that position of 3 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:25.779
 behind 

00:06:23.679 --> 00:06:28.209
 At the end, the rhythm that I 

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:29.559
 I want him to fuck and I who sing 

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:31.539
 put because he 's a great professional if 

00:06:29.559 --> 00:06:32.709
 you have to stay will stay will bring 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:34.249
 what I think convenient that you have to 

00:06:32.709 --> 00:06:35.809
 contribute to the group but 

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:38.599
 the only way there is that a 

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:40.399
 player come out of the beam is to come to 

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:41.979
 another and in that aspect we do not see each other 

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:44.059
 harmed we are going to get people out 

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:45.439
 to stay in box I 

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:47.829
 I think that goes into the head of 

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:47.829
 anyone 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.510
 Goodnight
