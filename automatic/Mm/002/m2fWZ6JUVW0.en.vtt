showing you the construction for the top
part<00:00:11.759> of<00:00:11.880> this<00:00:11.969> in<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.210> future<00:00:12.420> video<00:00:12.660> this<00:00:13.019> is

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
part of this in a future video this is

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.530 
part of this in a future video this is
very<00:00:13.440> thick<00:00:13.740> plastic<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.519> about<00:00:15.299> four

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
very thick plastic it is about four

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.060 
very thick plastic it is about four
times<00:00:15.750> thicker<00:00:16.170> than<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.560> clear<00:00:16.800> shower

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070

curtain<00:00:17.550> it's<00:00:18.029> extremely<00:00:18.810> thick<00:00:19.050> vinyl<00:00:19.230> we

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
curtain it's extremely thick vinyl we

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.349 
curtain it's extremely thick vinyl we
need<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.130> heavy<00:00:20.279> vinyl<00:00:20.760> because<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.180> weight

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
need the heavy vinyl because the weight

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.450 
need the heavy vinyl because the weight
of<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.600> water<00:00:21.779> will<00:00:22.170> sag<00:00:22.529> down<00:00:22.859> which<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.279> what

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
of the water will sag down which is what

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.279 
of the water will sag down which is what
we<00:00:23.580> want<00:00:23.850> that<00:00:24.119> gives<00:00:24.330> us<00:00:24.449> our<00:00:24.600> water<00:00:24.869> parabola

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
we want that gives us our water parabola

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.339 
we want that gives us our water parabola
but<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.730> thicker<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.180> material<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:28.170> the

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
but the thicker the material and the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.130 
but the thicker the material and the
tighter<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.740> can<00:00:28.769> pull<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:30.090> larger<00:00:30.720> the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
tighter you can pull it the larger the

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.990 
tighter you can pull it the larger the
disk<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.560> can<00:00:31.590> make<00:00:31.859> thinner<00:00:32.130> material<00:00:32.700> sags

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
disk you can make thinner material sags

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.120 
disk you can make thinner material sags
and<00:00:33.270> in<00:00:33.420> previous<00:00:33.870> videos<00:00:34.260> we<00:00:34.290> showed<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.950> how

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
and in previous videos we showed you how

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.639 
and in previous videos we showed you how
to<00:00:35.160> start<00:00:35.550> fires<00:00:35.820> using<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.630> scientific<00:00:37.290> glass

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649

this<00:00:49.230> water<00:00:49.469> parabola<00:00:50.120> but<00:00:51.120> two<00:00:51.480> years<00:00:51.660> ago

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
this water parabola but two years ago

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.459 
this water parabola but two years ago
that<00:00:53.129> material<00:00:53.730> sagged<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.270> little<00:00:54.510> bit<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.989> it

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
that material sagged a little bit and it

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.290 
that material sagged a little bit and it
only<00:00:55.739> gave<00:00:55.980> us<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.280> disc<00:00:56.520> about<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:56.940> big<00:00:57.149> this

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
only gave us a disc about this big this

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.299 
only gave us a disc about this big this
one's<00:00:57.539> already<00:00:57.750> twice<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.410> diameter<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:59.129> that

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
one's already twice the diameter of that

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.340 
one's already twice the diameter of that
because<00:00:59.820> we<00:00:59.969> stretched<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.539> tighter<00:01:00.870> does

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
because we stretched it tighter does

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.080 
because we stretched it tighter does
that<00:01:01.500> mean<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.710> focal<00:01:02.070> point<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.430> more<00:01:02.789> narrow

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
that mean the focal point is more narrow

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.960 
that mean the focal point is more narrow
the<00:01:03.930> longer<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.830> thinner<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.400> amount<00:01:05.909> of

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
the longer the thinner the amount of

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.600 
the longer the thinner the amount of
water<00:01:06.270> shallow<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.650> shower<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
water shallow the shower it is the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.250 
water shallow the shower it is the
longer<00:01:09.000> your<00:01:09.180> focal<00:01:09.540> length<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.080> this

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
longer your focal length is so this

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.960 
longer your focal length is so this
focal<00:01:10.710> length<00:01:10.860> right<00:01:11.070> now<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.400> almost<00:01:11.700> three

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
focal length right now is almost three

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.670 
focal length right now is almost three
meters<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.510> other<00:01:12.659> one<00:01:12.840> we<00:01:12.960> were<00:01:13.080> up<00:01:13.260> high<00:01:13.409> we

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
meters the other one we were up high we

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.499 
meters the other one we were up high we
couldn't<00:01:13.979> go<00:01:14.070> really<00:01:14.369> big<00:01:14.549> we're<00:01:15.240> gonna<00:01:15.330> be

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
couldn't go really big we're gonna be

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.420 
couldn't go really big we're gonna be
doing<00:01:15.750> some<00:01:15.930> add-ons<00:01:16.439> whether<00:01:17.130> providing

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
doing some add-ons whether providing

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.640 
doing some add-ons whether providing
we've<00:01:17.880> had<00:01:18.030> two<00:01:18.270> months<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.780> solid<00:01:19.350> cloud

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
we've had two months of solid cloud

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.590 
we've had two months of solid cloud
cover<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.729> first<00:01:21.030> time<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.570> a

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
cover so this is the first time in a

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.499 
cover so this is the first time in a
long<00:01:22.110> long<00:01:22.710> time<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.670> we've<00:01:23.790> had<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:24.240> good

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
long long time that we've had a good

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.840 
long long time that we've had a good
clear<00:01:25.020> day<00:01:25.200> I'm<00:01:25.979> gonna<00:01:26.189> be<00:01:26.310> cooking<00:01:26.670> today

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
clear day I'm gonna be cooking today

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.399 
clear day I'm gonna be cooking today
she's<00:01:27.420> gonna<00:01:27.540> be<00:01:27.750> making<00:01:28.049> what<00:01:28.290> are<00:01:28.320> you

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
she's gonna be making what are you

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.560 
she's gonna be making what are you
making<00:01:28.470> well<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.340> just<00:01:29.610> got<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:29.970> package<00:01:30.210> of

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
making well I just got a package of

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.480 
making well I just got a package of
frozen<00:01:30.840> breaded<00:01:31.829> fish<00:01:32.040> sticks

frozen breaded fish sticks

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.249 
frozen breaded fish sticks
and<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.820> wanted<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.210> see<00:01:33.329> how<00:01:33.479> fast<00:01:33.720> they<00:01:34.079> would

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
and I wanted to see how fast they would

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.920 
and I wanted to see how fast they would
cook<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.770> six-inch<00:01:35.310> skillet<00:01:35.970> pan<00:01:36.210> with<00:01:36.630> just
