00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.520
 so here complicates a little the 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.919
 things by putting the incident ray on 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:13.380
 a reverse prism the prism to see 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:15.809
 always a refractive index of 1.5 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.170
 who is outside is the rpn 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.630
 refractive index 2 1 ch of triangle 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.320
 isosceles with an angle at the top of 50 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.170
 degrees and the radius here the radius here in 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.840
 it arrives perpendicular to the surface 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.090
 if we put the normal we see 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.010
 visualize well that the angle of incidence 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.460
 is equal to zero 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.530
 it could be the law of this is the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.050
 cards by doing a former of the ens 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.870
 of incidents segalen two weeks of 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.690
 refraction language and we would find a 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.559
 refraction angle equal to zero degrees 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.600
 also if the only case where the rays the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.039
 ray is not tricky pulling in a 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:02.190
 other surface of different density the 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:06.810
 spokes go straight on without having any 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.119
 lives by deciding 0 in retraction 0 the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.960
 radius to hit a second ten others 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.930
 there will surely be a refraction 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.390
 because the residence is not zero 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.520
 the angle of incidence in this case the 6 he 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.960
 is happy calculate no we're going to make a 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:28.829
 series of geometric operations 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.610
 if it's done it's 90 degrees here on 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.979
 at 90 Â° 50 degrees we are able to 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.780
 find the angle here that would be equal 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.210
 at 40 degrees because in a triangle 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.560
 the sum of the angles equals 180 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:47.200
 degrees if there are 40 degrees this is 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:52.630
 not the residence the angle of incidence is 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:54.670
 regale at 50 degrees another time is going 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.560
 to appeal to the law of snell cards 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.690
 n 1 would be 1.5 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.880
 since we are in the green if he 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.450
 the angle of incidence that would be 50 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.840
 degrees is equal to n 2 one gets sent into 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.390
 the air 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.820
 if one of the angle of the break-in that 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:17.170
 look for the angle of refraction 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:19.690
 in this collar off my calculator tells me 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.590
 mistake I repeat well said again 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.780
 mistake it gives me a clue about the fact 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.120
 that refraction is not possible on 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.819
 is dealing with a total internal reflection 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.069
 the radius arrivals with an angle 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.590
 of incidence that exceeded tongue the 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.290
 critical while the calculator 10 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.860
 errors to that reflection is not 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.739
 possible 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.450
 there will be a total reflection 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.290
 internal the ray and thinks about 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.760
 inside the same medium 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.200
 following the rules of reflection 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.350
 the angle of incidence was parked at the corner 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.489
 of reflection the ray will still make a 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:03.190
 another time another ten we will place 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:06.880
 a normal to be able to know the angle 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.709
 of incidence is still there a shot 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.010
 geometric operations 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:17.440
 so if it is a right angle one deals 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:20.880
 at an angle of 40 Â° 40 degrees with a 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.880
 triangle here 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:32.349
 we are dealing with an angle of 75 degrees to 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.540
 this place but it's not the angle 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.670
 of incidence the angle of incidence is 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.940
 with normal then it's going to be a 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:43.120
 angle of 15 degrees we take the law of 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.430
 snell carp with as second 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:50.530
 middle as the middle middle the worm a 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.220
 point 5 cl of the year of incidence is equal 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.130
 1 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.640
 we want to bring into the air if he 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:01.120
 the angle of refraction and here the angle of 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.910
 thinking if we win we get like 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.299
 angle of refraction an angle of 23 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:11.950
 degrees to place it one can do 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:16.950
 call angle reporters an angle 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.950
 23 degrees with normal 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:46.480
 an angle of 23 degrees here is the radius 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:49.660
 can finally get out of the prism after having 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.600
 does a refraction without being deflected a 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.820
 total internal reflection and one last 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.310
 offense away from normal 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:01.050
 since we are sending ourselves into an environment that 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.050
 is less dense we take the east
