to go I think Cal is in a really good

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.140 
to go I think Cal is in a really good
position<00:00:28.980> actually<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.699> be<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.910> number<00:00:30.119> one

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
you know we let them get off to a good

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.200 
you know we let them get off to a good
start<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.100> we<00:00:44.190> fell<00:00:44.399> behind<00:00:44.430> by<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.879> lot<00:00:45.090> of

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.299 
start and we fell behind by a lot of
goals<00:00:45.390> we<00:00:46.079> can't<00:00:46.289> let<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.559> happen<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.160> you
