15 percent of our people buying a GT car
which<00:04:29.300> is<00:04:29.450> a<00:04:29.480> fairly<00:04:30.290> expensive<00:04:30.530> choice<00:04:31.310> in

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
which is a fairly expensive choice in

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.700 
which is a fairly expensive choice in
that<00:04:31.640> segment<00:04:32.030> that<00:04:32.870> means<00:04:33.170> people<00:04:33.590> are

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
that segment that means people are

on<00:04:46.160> the<00:04:46.340> other<00:04:46.460> hand<00:04:46.700> I'm<00:04:47.480> a<00:04:47.540> little<00:04:47.900> bit

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
on the other hand I'm a little bit

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.660 
on the other hand I'm a little bit
doubtful<00:04:48.590> because<00:04:49.040> if<00:04:49.160> I<00:04:49.250> look<00:04:49.430> at<00:04:49.550> the

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
doubtful because if I look at the

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.840 
doubtful because if I look at the
current<00:04:49.850> golf<00:04:50.330> segment<00:04:50.960> so<00:04:51.290> to<00:04:51.350> say<00:04:51.710> it's<00:04:52.640> not

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
current golf segment so to say it's not

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.380 
current golf segment so to say it's not
existent<00:04:54.310> we<00:04:55.310> have<00:04:55.430> to<00:04:55.640> really<00:04:55.910> watch<00:04:56.120> a

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
existent we have to really watch a

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.790 
existent we have to really watch a
little<00:04:56.600> bit<00:04:56.840> what<00:04:57.380> the<00:04:57.590> customer<00:04:58.160> is<00:04:58.310> doing

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
little bit what the customer is doing

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.380 
little bit what the customer is doing
cars<00:05:00.800> in<00:05:01.100> that<00:05:01.370> segment<00:05:01.640> currently<00:05:02.300> are

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
cars in that segment currently are

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.410 
cars in that segment currently are
fairly<00:05:02.630> expensive<00:05:03.080> cars<00:05:03.940> and<00:05:04.940> they're<00:05:05.180> very

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
fairly expensive cars and they're very

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.080 
fairly expensive cars and they're very
limited<00:05:05.660> numbers<00:05:06.260> so<00:05:07.010> I<00:05:07.040> see<00:05:07.370> still<00:05:07.640> more<00:05:07.910> room

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
limited numbers so I see still more room

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.720 
limited numbers so I see still more room
to<00:05:08.120> grow<00:05:08.510> from<00:05:08.810> where<00:05:09.020> we<00:05:09.140> are<00:05:09.320> and<00:05:10.220> then<00:05:10.490> see

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
to grow from where we are and then see

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:11.410 
to grow from where we are and then see
what<00:05:10.880> happens

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420 
what happens

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.150 
what happens
one<00:05:11.660> last<00:05:11.870> point<00:05:12.110> Michael<00:05:12.710> that<00:05:12.800> I<00:05:12.830> would<00:05:13.010> like

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
one last point Michael that I would like

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.700 
one last point Michael that I would like
to<00:05:13.310> ask<00:05:13.430> you<00:05:13.640> about

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
to ask you about

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.680 
to ask you about
and<00:05:14.949> I<00:05:15.280> haven't<00:05:15.460> intentionally<00:05:16.090> saved<00:05:16.360> it<00:05:16.539> for

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
and I haven't intentionally saved it for

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.960 
and I haven't intentionally saved it for
the<00:05:16.810> end<00:05:16.840> but<00:05:17.259> it's<00:05:17.949> sort<00:05:18.280> of<00:05:18.340> turned<00:05:18.580> out<00:05:18.759> that

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
the end but it's sort of turned out that

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.480 
the end but it's sort of turned out that
way<00:05:19.410> when<00:05:20.410> you<00:05:20.470> talked<00:05:20.680> about<00:05:20.830> in<00:05:21.130> fact<00:05:21.310> near

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
way when you talked about in fact near

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:22.680 
way when you talked about in fact near
in<00:05:21.610> your<00:05:21.729> presentation<00:05:22.270> earlier<00:05:22.330> when<00:05:22.660> you

in your presentation earlier when you
were<00:05:22.780> talking<00:05:22.900> about<00:05:23.610> how<00:05:24.610> you<00:05:24.669> cannot<00:05:25.180> simply

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
was a lot of buzz around the tycoon

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.830 
was a lot of buzz around the tycoon
concept<00:05:30.970> that<00:05:31.060> you<00:05:31.210> showed<00:05:31.389> at<00:05:31.509> the<00:05:31.539> Auto<00:05:31.720> Expo

concept that you showed at the Auto Expo

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.409 
concept that you showed at the Auto Expo
it's<00:05:32.800> clearly<00:05:33.160> a<00:05:33.280> segment<00:05:33.729> that<00:05:33.820> continues<00:05:34.270> to

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
it's clearly a segment that continues to

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:36.570 
it's clearly a segment that continues to
show<00:05:34.600> growth<00:05:34.870> there<00:05:35.800> are<00:05:35.919> new<00:05:36.070> models<00:05:36.250> getting

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
show growth there are new models getting

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 
can folks wagon afford not to be there

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.790 
can folks wagon afford not to be there
because<00:05:40.870> it's<00:05:41.020> not<00:05:41.050> part<00:05:41.350> of<00:05:41.410> your<00:05:41.530> list<00:05:41.710> of

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
it's the same interesting why for my

it's the same interesting why for my
perspective<00:06:00.130> is<00:06:00.520> not<00:06:00.669> so<00:06:00.849> the<00:06:01.030> off-road

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:32.969 
segment with a Tiguan to demonstrate the
capabilities<00:06:30.849> and<00:06:31.380> you<00:06:32.380> can<00:06:32.590> be<00:06:32.740> sure<00:06:32.949> that

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:32.979 
capabilities and you can be sure that

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:37.529 
capabilities and you can be sure that
this<00:06:33.280> is<00:06:33.490> one<00:06:33.669> of<00:06:33.699> the<00:06:33.909> most<00:06:35.190> prominent<00:06:36.539> fields

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:37.539 
this is one of the most prominent fields

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:40.560 
this is one of the most prominent fields
we<00:06:38.199> are<00:06:38.229> concentrating<00:06:38.650> our<00:06:39.190> forces<00:06:39.789> to<00:06:40.389> bring

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:40.570 
we are concentrating our forces to bring

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.350 
we are concentrating our forces to bring
that<00:06:40.870> then<00:06:41.110> down<00:06:41.470> into<00:06:41.889> the<00:06:42.550> broader<00:06:42.970> and

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 
that then down into the broader and

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.990 
that then down into the broader and
lower<00:06:44.020> segments<00:06:44.590> as<00:06:44.680> well<00:06:44.889> all<00:06:45.370> right<00:06:45.550> so<00:06:45.759> it's

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 
lower segments as well all right so it's

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.580 
lower segments as well all right so it's
a<00:06:46.120> top-down<00:06:46.479> approach<00:06:46.539> and<00:06:47.169> in<00:06:47.259> the<00:06:47.380> future

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.590 
a top-down approach and in the future

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.920 
a top-down approach and in the future
we'll<00:06:47.860> see<00:06:47.889> more<00:06:48.250> more<00:06:48.550> exactly<00:06:49.030> that's

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:49.930 
we'll see more more exactly that's

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.420 
we'll see more more exactly that's
encouraging<00:06:50.380> it's<00:06:50.530> a<00:06:50.590> positive<00:06:50.770> not<00:06:51.130> to<00:06:51.280> end

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430 
encouraging it's a positive not to end

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.189 
encouraging it's a positive not to end
