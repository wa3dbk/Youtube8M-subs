00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.390
 hello welcome, I'm Pablo and I'm extra 

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.860
 finally the second part of my trip to 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.470
 USA and Mexico 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.070
 today we take the airplane concepcion to the 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.070
 maya riviera 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.050
 or 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.570
 just land the plane we take a 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.279
 car and we go direction of the sun 2 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.630
 playacar that is very close to playa del 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.500
 Carmen where you can visit the famous 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.500
 fifth truth 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.390
 in the hotel we received a nice 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:43.010
 attention throughout our stay 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.539
 although it is true that it has a certain height and 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.949
 is that despite his days restaurants 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.489
 different did not have a great 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.489
 variety 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.379
 but any problem is over if you 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.220
 you can rest for a while at 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.600
 wonderful beaches of crystal clear water and 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.710
 white sand obviously during these 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.440
 seven days we made different 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.790
 excursions where I would highlight three in 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.590
 special the exclusion that more of this 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.300
 quality would be the visit to one of the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.100
 most important archaeological parks of 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.540
 all of mexico and where is one of 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.620
 the seven wonders of the world 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.620
 I'm talking about this 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.579
 where we can find different 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:40.619
 different Mayan structures where the 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.530
 most obvious obviously this property 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.720
 another of the excursions that most called me 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.509
 the attention was the visit to the cenotes 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.880
 these cenotes are famous because the 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.649
 Maya culture believed they were sources 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.929
 essentials of life because they contained the 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.460
 vital fluid besides being connections 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.799
 with another world and a way of 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.659
 communicate with oaks the truth that was 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.000
 an experience to be able to bathe in one of 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.429
 these natural wells that are full 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.220
 of undoubtedly the most diversity excursion 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.390
 was the visit to the multi-adventure park 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.030
 explore cancÃºn we did not have the opportunity 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.530
 of flying over the Mexican jungle with the 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.720
 largest zip line of all 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.130
 Latin America with 45 meters in height and 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.130
 almost 4 km 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.250
 we also had the opportunity to 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.900
 to cross the jungle and the mysterious ones 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.130
 caverns driving an amphibious vehicle 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.130
 through different 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.730
 and we also explore swimming through 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.650
 an underground river the different caves 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.890
 the water has been forming for thousands of 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.890
 years 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.330
 but without a doubt what stands out most 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.940
 to people and that is that people and 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.470
 friendly friendly medium-sized companies already 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.840
 despite being working all day 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.430
