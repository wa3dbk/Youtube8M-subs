00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:02.810 

here<00:00:01.829> you<00:00:01.920> can<00:00:02.070> see<00:00:02.250> how<00:00:02.370> I've<00:00:02.520> been<00:00:02.639> making

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
here you can see how I've been making

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.550 
here you can see how I've been making
progress<00:00:03.210> with<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.750> Assembly<00:00:04.200> of<00:00:04.230> the<00:00:04.380> lower

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
progress with the Assembly of the lower

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.299 
progress with the Assembly of the lower
control<00:00:04.980> arms<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.850> shock<00:00:06.180> mounts<00:00:06.629> and

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:07.309 
control arms the shock mounts and

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:11.419 
control arms the shock mounts and
ultimately<00:00:08.360> attaching<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.450> bracket<00:00:10.309> for<00:00:11.309> the

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
ultimately attaching the bracket for the

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.780 
ultimately attaching the bracket for the
rear<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:13.139> control<00:00:13.559> arm<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.040> you<00:00:14.490> notice

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
rear of the control arm and you notice

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.369 
rear of the control arm and you notice
there's<00:00:14.969> actually<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.389> really<00:00:15.570> big<00:00:15.780> spacer

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
there's actually a really big spacer

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.519 
there's actually a really big spacer
here<00:00:16.699> this<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:17.880> 3/8<00:00:18.330> inch<00:00:18.630> thick<00:00:18.930> on<00:00:19.260> this

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
here this is 3/8 inch thick on this

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.380 
here this is 3/8 inch thick on this
particular<00:00:19.859> side<00:00:20.310> that<00:00:20.550> was<00:00:20.670> necessary<00:00:21.180> in

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
particular side that was necessary in

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.320 
particular side that was necessary in
order<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.689> get<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.930> proper<00:00:22.230> motion<00:00:23.300> because<00:00:24.300> I

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
order to get the proper motion because I

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.750 
order to get the proper motion because I
had<00:00:24.660> only<00:00:24.750> attached<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.500> front<00:00:25.800> bracket<00:00:26.070> as

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
had only attached the front bracket as

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.150 
had only attached the front bracket as
we<00:00:27.000> can<00:00:27.150> see<00:00:27.330> here<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:27.930> hadn't<00:00:28.650> ever<00:00:28.769> attached

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
we can see here I hadn't ever attached

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.490 
we can see here I hadn't ever attached
the<00:00:29.400> rear<00:00:29.609> bracket<00:00:29.929> now<00:00:30.929> using<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.380> approach

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
the rear bracket now using that approach

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.220 
the rear bracket now using that approach
it<00:00:32.099> means<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.640> there's<00:00:32.850> some<00:00:33.030> play<00:00:33.540> there's

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
it means that there's some play there's

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.410 
it means that there's some play there's
some<00:00:34.610> movement<00:00:35.610> here<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.030> we<00:00:36.149> want<00:00:36.329> to

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
some movement here that we want to

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.240 
some movement here that we want to
consider<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.140> what<00:00:37.500> you'll<00:00:37.680> notice<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:38.070> it's

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
consider and what you'll notice is it's

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.760 
consider and what you'll notice is it's
actually<00:00:38.870> changing<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.050> position<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.620> the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
actually changing the position of the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.700 
actually changing the position of the
lower<00:00:40.950> clover<00:00:41.730> ball<00:00:41.910> joint<00:00:42.180> quite<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.510> bit<00:00:42.719> so

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
lower clover ball joint quite a bit so

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.500 
lower clover ball joint quite a bit so
this<00:00:44.070> isn't<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.399> fully<00:00:44.579> compressed<00:00:45.059> view<00:00:45.300> and

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
this isn't a fully compressed view and

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.130 
this isn't a fully compressed view and
if<00:00:46.020> we<00:00:46.170> were<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.320> fully<00:00:46.590> extend<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.960> 15<00:00:48.960> inch

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
if we were to fully extend it 15 inch

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.200 
if we were to fully extend it 15 inch
shock<00:00:49.410> we<00:00:49.800> noticed<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.700> goes<00:00:50.850> all<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.090> way

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
shock we noticed it it goes all the way

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.139 
shock we noticed it it goes all the way
down<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.539> there<00:00:53.989> and<00:00:55.399> of<00:00:56.399> course<00:00:56.430> we<00:00:56.789> end<00:00:56.910> up

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
down to there and of course we end up

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.819 
down to there and of course we end up
with<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.420> challenge<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:58.020> what<00:00:58.469> do<00:00:58.530> we<00:00:58.590> do<00:00:58.710> with

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
with the challenge of what do we do with

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.610 
with the challenge of what do we do with
this<00:00:58.949> play<00:00:59.359> so<00:01:00.359> I'm<00:01:00.629> probably<00:01:00.840> going<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.350> bias

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
this play so I'm probably going to bias

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.740 
this play so I'm probably going to bias
this<00:01:02.010> particular<00:01:02.699> control<00:01:03.090> arm<00:01:03.300> toward<00:01:03.600> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
this particular control arm toward the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.929 
this particular control arm toward the
front<00:01:03.989> moving<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.010> ball<00:01:05.220> joint<00:01:05.489> as<00:01:05.700> far

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
front moving this ball joint as far

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.600 
front moving this ball joint as far
forward<00:01:06.390> as<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.659> can<00:01:06.950> because<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.130> opposite

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
forward as I can because the opposite

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.690 
forward as I can because the opposite
problem<00:01:08.880> occurred<00:01:09.390> on<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.260> other<00:01:10.380> side<00:01:10.700> where

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
problem occurred on the other side where

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.429 
problem occurred on the other side where
I<00:01:11.729> found<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.240> ball<00:01:12.479> joint<00:01:12.750> was<00:01:12.960> positioned

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
I found this ball joint was positioned

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.249 
I found this ball joint was positioned
too<00:01:13.590> far<00:01:13.830> toward<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.280> front<00:01:15.080> this<00:01:16.080> has<00:01:16.229> a

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
too far toward the front this has a

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.620 
too far toward the front this has a
similar<00:01:16.680> level<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.100> play<00:01:17.400> as<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.299> can<00:01:18.450> see

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
similar level of play as you can see

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.380 
similar level of play as you can see
here<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:18.900> haven't<00:01:19.229> attached<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.860> rear<00:01:20.390> bracket

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
here I haven't attached a rear bracket

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.200 
here I haven't attached a rear bracket
yet<00:01:22.040> you<00:01:23.040> might<00:01:23.220> also<00:01:23.400> notice<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.060> have<00:01:24.180> a

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
yet you might also notice that I have a

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.210 
yet you might also notice that I have a
lot<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.390> spacers<00:01:24.990> placed<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.530> between<00:01:25.650> here<00:01:26.130> in

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
lot of spacers placed in between here in

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.550 
lot of spacers placed in between here in
order<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.610> again<00:01:27.060> get<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.479> right<00:01:27.750> control<00:01:28.350> arm

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
order to again get the right control arm

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.830 
order to again get the right control arm
toward<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.100> rear<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.579> on<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.420> other<00:01:30.540> side

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
toward the rear and on the other side

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.270 
toward the rear and on the other side
you'll<00:01:31.140> notice<00:01:31.259> spacers<00:01:31.860> are<00:01:31.979> doing<00:01:32.189> the

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
you'll notice spacers are doing the

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.539 
you'll notice spacers are doing the
opposite<00:01:32.759> in<00:01:33.720> order<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.110> get<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.500> control<00:01:35.310> arm

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
opposite in order to get the control arm

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.609 
opposite in order to get the control arm
toward<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.970> front<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:36.990> found<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.409> was

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
toward the front and I found this was

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.030 
toward the front and I found this was
necessary<00:01:38.220> because<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.479> lower<00:01:39.990> ball<00:01:40.530> joints

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
necessary because the lower ball joints

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.569 
necessary because the lower ball joints
from<00:01:41.939> side<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.210> side<00:01:42.390> were<00:01:43.280> fore-and-aft<00:01:44.280> a

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
from side to side were fore-and-aft a

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.819 
from side to side were fore-and-aft a
difference<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.060> about<00:01:45.149> 3/4<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:45.960> an<00:01:46.170> inch<00:01:46.259> which

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
difference of about 3/4 of an inch which

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.679 
difference of about 3/4 of an inch which
is<00:01:46.979> pretty<00:01:47.159> significant<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:47.939> felt<00:01:48.540> that

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
is pretty significant I felt that

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.999 
is pretty significant I felt that
three-quarters<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.170> an<00:01:49.380> inch<00:01:49.439> was<00:01:49.649> too<00:01:49.829> much

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
three-quarters of an inch was too much

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.590 
three-quarters of an inch was too much
in<00:01:50.310> order<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.850> have<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.149> front<00:01:51.390> wheels

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
in order to have the front wheels

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.649 
in order to have the front wheels
tracking<00:01:52.259> different<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:52.710> differently<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:54.119> so

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
tracking different on differently and so

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.600 
tracking different on differently and so
I'm<00:01:55.200> going<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.470> focus<00:01:55.649> on<00:01:55.890> getting<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.340> ball

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
I'm going to focus on getting this ball

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.480 
I'm going to focus on getting this ball
joint<00:01:56.850> toward<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.479> rear<00:01:57.719> as<00:01:58.159> you<00:01:59.159> can<00:01:59.310> see<00:01:59.460> I

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
joint toward the rear as you can see I

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.010 
joint toward the rear as you can see I
still<00:01:59.729> have<00:01:59.790> some<00:02:00.149> play<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.630> all<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.840> rubber

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
still have some play in all the rubber

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.560 
still have some play in all the rubber
bushings<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.880> I'm<00:02:02.880> going<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.060> focus<00:02:03.420> on

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
bushings and I'm going to focus on

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.330 
bushings and I'm going to focus on
getting<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:04.049> lower<00:02:04.380> ball<00:02:04.649> joint<00:02:04.920> toward<00:02:05.219> the

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
getting this lower ball joint toward the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.639 
getting this lower ball joint toward the
front<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.479> goal<00:02:06.689> being<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.500> when<00:02:07.619> I

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
front and the goal being that when I

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.339 
front and the goal being that when I
look<00:02:07.890> at<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.190> from<00:02:08.369> side<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.640> side<00:02:09.020> if<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.229> were

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
look at it from side to side if I were

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.650 
look at it from side to side if I were
to<00:02:10.440> come<00:02:10.590> out<00:02:10.619> from<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.950> top<00:02:11.160> view<00:02:11.540> what<00:02:12.540> we

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
to come out from a top view what we

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.880 
to come out from a top view what we
would<00:02:12.810> expect

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
would expect

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.500 
would expect
is<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.610> these<00:02:14.790> ball<00:02:15.000> joints<00:02:15.330> would<00:02:15.420> be

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
is that these ball joints would be

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.809 
is that these ball joints would be
perfectly<00:02:15.960> in<00:02:16.050> line<00:02:16.080> from<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.590> top<00:02:16.800> view<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.400> so

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
perfectly in line from a top view and so

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.670 
perfectly in line from a top view and so
that's<00:02:18.030> where<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.450> adjustability<00:02:19.020> comes<00:02:19.470> in

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
that's where the adjustability comes in

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.800 
that's where the adjustability comes in
with<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.280> rubber<00:02:20.490> bushings<00:02:20.760> this<00:02:21.360> was<00:02:21.540> not<00:02:21.690> by

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
with the rubber bushings this was not by

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.500 
with the rubber bushings this was not by
design<00:02:22.220> this<00:02:23.220> was<00:02:23.370> just<00:02:23.580> because<00:02:23.880> my<00:02:24.450> the

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
design this was just because my the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.449 
design this was just because my the
accuracy<00:02:25.230> of<00:02:25.260> my<00:02:25.380> control<00:02:25.800> arms<00:02:26.100> isn't<00:02:26.340> that

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
accuracy of my control arms isn't that

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.910 
accuracy of my control arms isn't that
great<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.970> I<00:02:27.510> had<00:02:27.720> mounted<00:02:28.140> these<00:02:28.319> brackets

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
great and I had mounted these brackets

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.580 
great and I had mounted these brackets
in<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.550> assembly<00:02:29.970> process<00:02:30.350> arguably<00:02:31.350> too

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
in the assembly process arguably too

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.090 
in the assembly process arguably too
soon

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
soon

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.710 
soon
I<00:02:32.130> should<00:02:32.760> have<00:02:32.850> mounted<00:02:33.240> these<00:02:33.390> brackets

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
I should have mounted these brackets

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.900 
I should have mounted these brackets
waiting<00:02:34.590> till<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.980> control<00:02:35.340> arms<00:02:35.580> were<00:02:35.670> fully

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
waiting till the control arms were fully

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.030 
waiting till the control arms were fully
assembled<00:02:36.450> get<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.050> lower<00:02:37.290> bracket

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
assembled get the lower bracket

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.120 
assembled get the lower bracket
in<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.760> front<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.840> rear<00:02:40.040> should<00:02:41.040> have

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
in the front and the rear should have

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.010 
in the front and the rear should have
been<00:02:41.310> done<00:02:41.459> at<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.300> same<00:02:42.510> time<00:02:42.780> they<00:02:42.959> should

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
been done at the same time they should

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.479 
been done at the same time they should
have<00:02:43.200> been<00:02:43.260> mounted<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.770> the<00:02:43.860> chassis<00:02:44.100> at<00:02:44.370> the

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
have been mounted to the chassis at the

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.340 
have been mounted to the chassis at the
same<00:02:44.700> time<00:02:45.000> so<00:02:45.690> as<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:45.930> mentioned<00:02:46.320> before

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
same time so as I mentioned before

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.770 
same time so as I mentioned before
there's<00:02:46.830> a<00:02:46.890> 3/8<00:02:47.340> inch<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.880> plate<00:02:48.180> going<00:02:48.600> to<00:02:48.690> be

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
there's a 3/8 inch of plate going to be

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.810 
there's a 3/8 inch of plate going to be
added<00:02:49.170> here<00:02:49.590> in<00:02:49.739> order<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:50.010> get<00:02:50.190> this<00:02:50.400> bracket

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
added here in order to get this bracket

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.729 
added here in order to get this bracket
at<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:50.940> correct<00:02:51.270> height<00:02:51.390> so<00:02:52.320> that<00:02:52.350> I<00:02:52.530> have<00:02:52.709> a

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
at the correct height so that I have a

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.170 
at the correct height so that I have a
correct<00:02:53.100> range<00:02:53.370> of<00:02:53.550> motion

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
correct range of motion

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.060 
correct range of motion
I<00:02:54.209> found<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:55.080> without<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:55.830> would<00:02:55.950> be

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
I found that without that it would be

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.400 
I found that without that it would be
floating<00:02:56.519> in<00:02:56.580> space<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:58.700> easily<00:02:59.700> shown

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
floating in space and easily shown

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:07.550 
floating in space and easily shown
floating<00:03:01.410> in<00:03:01.530> space<00:03:06.260> except<00:03:07.260> in<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.440> most

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
floating in space except in the most

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.830 
floating in space except in the most
extreme<00:03:07.739> condition<00:03:08.610> and<00:03:08.760> in<00:03:08.970> full<00:03:09.239> in<00:03:09.540> full

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
extreme condition and in full in full

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.710 
extreme condition and in full in full
bump<00:03:10.470> on<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:12.120> other<00:03:12.269> side<00:03:12.630> I<00:03:14.120> do<00:03:15.120> have<00:03:15.480> some

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
bump on the other side I do have some

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.229 
bump on the other side I do have some
previous<00:03:16.290> brackets<00:03:17.130> that<00:03:17.280> I<00:03:17.310> had<00:03:17.489> removed<00:03:17.850> and

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
previous brackets that I had removed and

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.340 
previous brackets that I had removed and
you'll<00:03:18.480> notice<00:03:18.720> there's<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:18.959> big<00:03:19.079> gap<00:03:19.320> right

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
you'll notice there's a big gap right

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.039 
you'll notice there's a big gap right
here<00:03:19.620> so<00:03:20.579> I<00:03:20.820> need<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.150> put<00:03:21.329> some<00:03:21.510> plate<00:03:21.720> steel

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
here so I need to put some plate steel

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.050 
here so I need to put some plate steel
here<00:03:22.260> anyway<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.620> cover<00:03:22.920> that<00:03:23.100> gap<00:03:23.340> and<00:03:23.850> weld

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
here anyway to cover that gap and weld

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.390 
here anyway to cover that gap and weld
everything<00:03:24.180> shut<00:03:24.720> but<00:03:25.380> what<00:03:25.530> I<00:03:25.560> found<00:03:25.860> again

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
everything shut but what I found again

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.600 
everything shut but what I found again
in<00:03:26.519> this<00:03:26.610> situation<00:03:28.220> when<00:03:29.220> I<00:03:29.250> work<00:03:29.459> this

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
in this situation when I work this

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.550 
in this situation when I work this
through<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:29.910> range<00:03:30.120> of<00:03:30.299> motion<00:03:30.360> that<00:03:31.079> kind<00:03:31.500> of

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
through the range of motion that kind of

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.560 
through the range of motion that kind of
wants<00:03:31.829> to<00:03:31.980> float<00:03:32.400> up<00:03:32.430> there<00:03:32.940> you<00:03:33.060> can<00:03:33.239> see<00:03:33.420> how

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
wants to float up there you can see how

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.380 
wants to float up there you can see how
it<00:03:33.660> wants<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:34.049> rise<00:03:34.829> up<00:03:35.100> and<00:03:35.310> so<00:03:35.970> putting<00:03:36.269> a

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
it wants to rise up and so putting a

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.729 
it wants to rise up and so putting a
piece<00:03:36.570> of<00:03:36.690> play-doh<00:03:36.870> in<00:03:37.140> that<00:03:37.290> gap<00:03:37.500> is

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
piece of play-doh in that gap is

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.100 
piece of play-doh in that gap is
probably<00:03:38.160> not<00:03:38.310> a<00:03:38.340> bad<00:03:38.519> idea<00:03:38.760> it<00:03:39.390> won't<00:03:39.540> be<00:03:39.690> 3/8

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
probably not a bad idea it won't be 3/8

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.569 
probably not a bad idea it won't be 3/8
of<00:03:40.260> an<00:03:40.410> inch<00:03:40.470> it<00:03:40.709> will<00:03:40.799> probably<00:03:40.950> be<00:03:41.190> more<00:03:41.370> like

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
of an inch it will probably be more like

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.550 
of an inch it will probably be more like
Melek<00:03:42.180> 1/8<00:03:42.420> of<00:03:42.450> an<00:03:42.750> inch

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
Melek 1/8 of an inch

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.050 
Melek 1/8 of an inch
but<00:03:43.829> I<00:03:43.860> need<00:03:44.070> some<00:03:44.220> plate<00:03:44.430> steel<00:03:44.670> under<00:03:44.940> that

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
but I need some plate steel under that

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.810 
but I need some plate steel under that
bracket<00:03:45.360> anyway
