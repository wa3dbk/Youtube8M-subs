00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
musical samples and if I go into the

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.340 
musical samples and if I go into the
selection<00:01:33.860> loops<00:01:34.220> here<00:01:34.540> I've<00:01:35.540> actually<00:01:35.750> got<00:01:36.110> a

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
selection loops here I've actually got a

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.180 
selection loops here I've actually got a
series<00:01:37.159> of<00:01:37.190> different<00:01:37.310> stabs<00:01:37.880> and<00:01:38.409> hits<00:01:39.409> that

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
series of different stabs and hits that

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.789 
series of different stabs and hits that
all<00:01:40.370> have<00:01:40.640> a<00:01:40.940> musical<00:01:41.720> root<00:01:41.930> note<00:01:42.110> so<00:01:42.650> for

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
all have a musical root note so for

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.289 
all have a musical root note so for
instance<00:01:43.040> this<00:01:43.159> one<00:01:43.400> is<00:01:43.580> in<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:43.850> root<00:01:44.000> know<00:01:44.150> of

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
instance this one is in the root know of

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.789 
instance this one is in the root know of
E

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.099 

so<00:01:47.310> all<00:01:47.490> these<00:01:47.670> stabs<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.359> loop<00:01:51.109> all

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:52.109 
so all these stabs in this loop all

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:55.550 
so all these stabs in this loop all
share<00:01:52.859> the<00:01:53.009> same<00:01:53.219> root<00:01:53.549> note<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.939> e<00:01:54.240> now<00:01:54.539> I<00:01:55.229> know

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
share the same root note of e now I know

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.590 
share the same root note of e now I know
that<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.920> silky<00:01:56.280> scream<00:01:56.579> track<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:57.119> in<00:01:57.299> the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
that the silky scream track is in the

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.289 
that the silky scream track is in the
root<00:01:57.780> note<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.140> F<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:59.369> all<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.579> need<00:01:59.819> to<00:01:59.939> do<00:02:00.090> to

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
root note of F so all I need to do to

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.569 
root note of F so all I need to do to
get<00:02:00.450> these<00:02:00.600> samples<00:02:00.929> to<00:02:01.469> play<00:02:01.770> in<00:02:02.039> key<00:02:02.310> with

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
get these samples to play in key with

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.039 
get these samples to play in key with
the<00:02:02.670> silky<00:02:02.969> scream<00:02:03.240> track<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.630> make<00:02:03.780> sure<00:02:03.810> that

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
the silky scream track is make sure that

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.840 
the silky scream track is make sure that
instead<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.679> playing<00:02:04.829> an<00:02:05.069> E<00:02:05.189> they<00:02:05.399> play<00:02:05.579> an<00:02:05.700> F

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
instead of playing an E they play an F

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.479 
instead of playing an E they play an F
so<00:02:06.630> that's<00:02:06.689> one<00:02:06.990> semitone<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:08.250> I'm<00:02:08.310> going<00:02:08.459> to

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
so that's one semitone so I'm going to

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.880 
so that's one semitone so I'm going to
drag<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:08.789> over<00:02:08.970> into<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:10.200> session<00:02:10.619> view

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
drag that over into a session view

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.190 
drag that over into a session view
alongside<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.700> silky<00:02:12.000> screen<00:02:12.239> track<00:02:12.510> just<00:02:13.080> go

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
alongside the silky screen track just go

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.470 
alongside the silky screen track just go
down<00:02:13.349> to<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:13.500> transpose<00:02:14.099> function<00:02:14.360> take<00:02:15.360> it

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
down to the transpose function take it

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
down to the transpose function take it
up<00:02:15.569> by<00:02:15.720> one<00:02:15.959> semitone<00:02:16.379> so<00:02:16.890> E<00:02:17.069> is<00:02:17.459> now<00:02:17.730> F<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.500> if

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
up by one semitone so E is now F and if

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.350 
up by one semitone so E is now F and if
I<00:02:19.650> play<00:02:19.829> those<00:02:20.040> samples<00:02:20.910> now

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.730 

they're<00:02:27.360> now<00:02:27.540> playing<00:02:27.840> in<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.200> root<00:02:28.530> note<00:02:28.710> of

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
they're now playing in the root note of

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.130 
they're now playing in the root note of
F<00:02:29.100> so<00:02:30.090> what<00:02:30.210> I'm<00:02:30.300> gonna<00:02:30.390> do<00:02:30.570> I'm<00:02:30.630> going<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:30.840> work

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
F so what I'm gonna do I'm going to work

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.050 
F so what I'm gonna do I'm going to work
through<00:02:31.200> this<00:02:31.650> clip<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.340> just<00:02:32.700> take<00:02:32.880> all

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
through this clip and just take all

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.480 
through this clip and just take all
these<00:02:33.180> different<00:02:33.390> little<00:02:34.350> stabs<00:02:34.770> and<00:02:35.100> chords

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
these different little stabs and chords

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.940 
these different little stabs and chords
and<00:02:36.120> just<00:02:36.480> add<00:02:36.660> some<00:02:36.720> walk<00:02:37.230> markers<00:02:37.650> in<00:02:37.800> here

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
and just add some walk markers in here

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.530 
and just add some walk markers in here
and<00:02:38.070> just<00:02:38.160> move<00:02:38.430> them<00:02:38.670> up<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:39.270> nearest

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
and just move them up to the nearest

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.920 
and just move them up to the nearest
four<00:02:40.170> bars<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:41.060> that<00:02:42.060> way<00:02:42.300> I<00:02:42.330> know<00:02:42.510> that<00:02:42.660> I've

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
four bars and that way I know that I've

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.840 
four bars and that way I know that I've
got<00:02:43.080> a<00:02:43.110> little<00:02:43.290> sample<00:02:43.890> that<00:02:44.190> plays<00:02:44.460> every

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
got a little sample that plays every

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.760 
got a little sample that plays every
four<00:02:45.120> bars<00:02:45.740> that<00:02:46.740> is<00:02:46.890> in<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.160> root<00:02:47.400> note<00:02:47.640> of<00:02:47.820> F

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
four bars that is in the root note of F

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.680 
four bars that is in the root note of F
now<00:02:49.770> I<00:02:50.100> can<00:02:50.370> put<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:50.610> silky<00:02:50.940> scream<00:02:51.210> track<00:02:51.480> on

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
now I can put the silky scream track on

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.630 
now I can put the silky scream track on
and<00:02:52.140> actually<00:02:52.560> I've<00:02:52.680> set<00:02:52.950> up<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.220> little<00:02:53.250> loop

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
and actually I've set up a little loop

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.000 
and actually I've set up a little loop
here<00:02:53.670> in<00:02:54.120> this<00:02:54.690> second<00:02:55.110> clip<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.650> it's<00:02:55.800> from

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
here in this second clip that it's from

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.830 
here in this second clip that it's from
you<00:02:56.250> know<00:02:56.340> it's<00:02:56.460> the<00:02:56.520> same<00:02:56.700> tune<00:02:56.970> but<00:02:57.300> I've

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
you know it's the same tune but I've

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.870 
you know it's the same tune but I've
just<00:02:57.900> looped<00:02:58.350> up<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.710> little<00:02:58.950> selection<00:02:59.310> of<00:02:59.700> the

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
just looped up a little selection of the

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.240 
just looped up a little selection of the
track<00:03:00.150> which<00:03:00.450> is<00:03:00.480> kind<00:03:01.470> of<00:03:01.560> towards<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.070> end

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
track which is kind of towards the end

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.490 
track which is kind of towards the end
of<00:03:02.490> the<00:03:02.640> track<00:03:02.880> it's<00:03:03.270> it's<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.870> final<00:03:04.290> drop

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
of the track it's it's the final drop

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.490 
of the track it's it's the final drop
and<00:03:05.030> for<00:03:06.030> me<00:03:06.150> it's<00:03:06.300> the<00:03:06.360> kind<00:03:06.600> of<00:03:06.690> peak<00:03:06.930> of<00:03:07.170> the

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
and for me it's the kind of peak of the

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.880 
and for me it's the kind of peak of the
track<00:03:07.770> if<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:08.040> just<00:03:08.220> play<00:03:08.430> that<00:03:12.590> and<00:03:13.590> this<00:03:13.740> is

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
track if I just play that and this is

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.320 
track if I just play that and this is
just<00:03:14.070> purely<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.490> show<00:03:14.700> you<00:03:14.760> how<00:03:15.030> these

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
just purely to show you how these

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:24.080 
just purely to show you how these
samples<00:03:15.930> will<00:03:16.110> fit<00:03:16.500> perfectly<00:03:16.740> over<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:18.870> top

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.460 

now<00:03:24.569> if<00:03:24.660> I<00:03:24.720> just<00:03:24.840> bring<00:03:25.050> that<00:03:25.080> down<00:03:25.349> your

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
now if I just bring that down your

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.110 
now if I just bring that down your
volume<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.770> bit<00:03:25.980> off<00:03:26.130> start<00:03:26.700> adding<00:03:27.000> these

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
volume a bit off start adding these

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.440 
volume a bit off start adding these
stabs<00:03:27.599> that<00:03:27.930> are<00:03:28.020> thrown<00:03:28.319> in<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:28.970> tuned<00:03:29.970> with

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
stabs that are thrown in and tuned with

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.910 
stabs that are thrown in and tuned with
the<00:03:30.480> transpose<00:03:31.110> control<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.730> key<00:03:32.970> of<00:03:33.120> F<00:03:33.920> so

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
the transpose control to the key of F so

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.270 
the transpose control to the key of F so
if<00:03:35.010> I<00:03:35.099> just<00:03:35.280> drop<00:03:35.459> these<00:03:35.580> in<00:03:35.760> now

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.100 

I've<00:03:40.820> got<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.090> silky<00:03:41.390> scream<00:03:41.690> a<00:03:41.720> little<00:03:41.930> bit

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
I've got the silky scream a little bit

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.330 
I've got the silky scream a little bit
quieter<00:03:42.560> just<00:03:42.770> so<00:03:42.860> you<00:03:42.950> can<00:03:43.040> hear<00:03:43.220> the

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
quieter just so you can hear the

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.120 
quieter just so you can hear the
difference<00:03:44.620> and<00:03:45.620> you<00:03:45.710> can<00:03:45.770> hear<00:03:45.950> they're

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
difference and you can hear they're

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.720 
difference and you can hear they're
perfectly<00:03:46.700> locked<00:03:47.600> in<00:03:47.870> key<00:03:48.250> with<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.370> silky

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
perfectly locked in key with the silky

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.970 
perfectly locked in key with the silky
scream<00:03:50.000> trap<00:03:52.990> so<00:03:53.990> this<00:03:54.140> is<00:03:54.290> my<00:03:54.410> little<00:03:54.710> extra

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
scream trap so this is my little extra

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.400 
scream trap so this is my little extra
stamp<00:03:55.250> out<00:03:55.520> of<00:03:55.670> putting<00:03:56.000> on<00:03:56.120> top<00:03:56.330> of<00:03:56.480> this<00:03:56.570> tune

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.990 

there's<00:04:00.950> those<00:04:01.100> two<00:04:01.370> kind<00:04:01.670> of<00:04:01.760> placed

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
there's those two kind of placed

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.170 
there's those two kind of placed
side-by-side<00:04:02.270> together

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.410 

it's<00:04:06.720> just<00:04:06.870> adding<00:04:07.019> a<00:04:07.230> little<00:04:07.349> bit<00:04:07.470> of<00:04:07.560> extra

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
it's just adding a little bit of extra

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.589 
it's just adding a little bit of extra
musical<00:04:09.890> presence<00:04:10.890> in<00:04:11.069> you

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:19.059 

let's<00:04:14.599> put<00:04:14.810> that<00:04:14.900> over<00:04:15.200> the<00:04:15.290> intro

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:19.069 

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:21.439 

so<00:04:20.069> here<00:04:20.280> in<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.489> intro<00:04:20.819> of<00:04:20.849> the<00:04:21.000> track<00:04:21.239> it's

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
so here in the intro of the track it's

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:31.709 
so here in the intro of the track it's
mainly<00:04:21.780> drums<00:04:22.079> and<00:04:22.440> percussion

00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:31.719 

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:38.469 

and<00:04:32.719> that<00:04:32.869> just<00:04:33.049> fits<00:04:33.289> perfectly

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:43.850 

so<00:04:39.050> any<00:04:39.289> sample<00:04:39.860> I've<00:04:39.949> got<00:04:40.099> in<00:04:40.219> here<00:04:40.370> that<00:04:40.580> is<00:04:40.669> e

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860
