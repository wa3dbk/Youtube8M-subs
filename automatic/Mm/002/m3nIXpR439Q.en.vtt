00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.770
 also did what they were preparing 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.389
 coming holiday and folded 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.030
 paper decorations 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.150
 something a long time u did not think about toys 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.460
 origami in this video lesson we add 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.180
 new origami ship model 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:26.039
 and then let it stay for now 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:29.760
 secret start for the model ship 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:35.390
 origami we need one sheet of paper 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.390
 A4 in any color 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.829
 bend the sheet in half 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.320
 now again 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:14.540
 unbend put the sheet bent in half 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:15.860
 fold it from above, we bend both 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:24.960
 corner 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:31.310
 down along the center line and ok 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.310
 well iron all bends 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:48.380
 now turn down the bottom edge of the sheet 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.380
 curved corners 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:05.360
 overturn and sprinkle edge with this 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.360
 parties too 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.010
 further up again every 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:23.280
 from bent just 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.280
 parts in this way 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:40.920
 we have a model very similar to 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:48.690
 paper hat is now open 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:48.690
 bottom and bring together the ends of this hat 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.650
 put on one side 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:09.830
 and again, good, good, iron everything 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.830
 bends 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:18.320
 we already have 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:23.630
 rum raise a large angle from the bottom up 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.630
 to the level of these points 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:46.989
 turn over and do the same with 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:57.660
 this side again reveal the figure 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:57.660
 bottom and leaf through this way 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:13.060
 bend up the edge of the product 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:26.740
 on the one hand and now on the other 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:40.580
 it is very important to ensure that 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:44.020
 These are the little corners on these corners. 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:50.569
 paper tore 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:54.650
 neat and all we have to do next 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:58.789
 make it pull two little ones 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:01.629
 corner hidden here pull 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:01.629
 them out 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:23.709
 our boat is ready and now as for 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:25.939
 the promised surprise 

00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:29.539
 this boat is not easy 

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:32.559
 it's very easy to turn it into a whole 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:36.259
 fairy tale now I will show how to do it 

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:38.989
 this tale told me still my 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:43.339
 origami teacher and now i want 

00:05:38.989 --> 00:05:47.479
 share it with you listen and 

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:51.739
 remember once lived captain 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:55.219
 and was not too smart because I decided 

00:05:51.739 --> 00:05:56.229
 make a sail for your boat and old 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:59.739
 newspapers 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:02.800
 here is one the highest our captain in the sea 

00:05:59.739 --> 00:06:06.589
 walked away from the shore and here on you 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.959
 black clouds began to whistle storm 

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:11.779
 the wind did not have time our captain's eyes 

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:13.669
 blink like lightning struck from heaven and 

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:17.929
 right in the stern 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:20.469
 his boats hit and tore off the boat 

00:06:17.929 --> 00:06:20.469
 tail 

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:37.080
 I did not have time to thunder thunder flashed yet 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:41.569
 one zipper and in front of the captain 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.569
 split you the nose of his boat 

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:56.909
 then came a terrible crash and a hurricane 

00:06:54.029 --> 00:07:00.469
 broke the mast of the boat his nose off her 

00:06:56.909 --> 00:07:00.469
 together with the sail 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:19.730
 and nothing left for our poor fellow to 

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:33.210
 food how to raise the wreckage of the mast 

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:35.250
 instead of sailing your vest necessarily 

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:38.040
 tell the same tale with your 

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:41.690
 brother or sister or just 

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:44.790
 to friends they will be very satisfied and 

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:47.750
