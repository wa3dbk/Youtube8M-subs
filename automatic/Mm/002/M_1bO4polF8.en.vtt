00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.290
 hi friends continuing the topic midone whether 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.090
 games we decided to play one more 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.849
 themed role-playing game if 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.990
 of course you can call it that 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:16.170
 characterized it as beetles against 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.430
 corpses for hand honor tried cent 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.430
 kingpin unsure whether 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.140
 nix and broodmother for the dead bodies spoke 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.510
 of course pooja lifestiller 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.920
 anda skeleton king ilich yes i know 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.599
 that could take other heroes 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.029
 which you also came but for some reason we 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.040
 I stopped those I hope that 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.380
 there will be at least some kind of balance in general 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.570
 I can not say that he was not me 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.910
 it seems that with a certain so to speak 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.830
 a set of people can be defeated like a bug 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.350
 so for the corpses but in our party to 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:46.260
 Sorry, our dead army 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.940
 lost in fact zhekov very 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.310
 a lot of stealth and of course he counters 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.630
 wards there will be moments when I'm very 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.770
 successfully put in the arts we kill 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:58.050
 broodmother but honestly all the same 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.630
 I still think that the more 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.160
 Mills as practice shows the easier 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.060
 play a team in medon because we have 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.950
 there were matches for example with war against there 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.720
 trentov when to play there is simply no 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.060
 meaning because 5 camps will take it apart 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.610
 please even heroes like wenge 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.380
 having 5 camps playing five by five have 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.570
 more great advantage and here 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.790
 it turned out the same thing that is spiders 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.710
 potentially more mills more so 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.380
 say control why im still 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.420
 it's easier to kill something apart and 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.280
 of course go stealth after all too 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.850
 not the worst option all wards not 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.770
 make 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.560
 although of course you can buy land in metal 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.780
 liegen is quite expensive though i don't know 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.420
 which is more profitable to take someone or wards in such 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.030
 situations however as you see we 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.150
 we sit feed we sit though did keit 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.940
 frags but somehow it was all very 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.640
 sad and of course another very 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.260
 offensive detail our ghoul is absolutely not 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.030
 I was able to do nothing first because 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.340
 that stealth or very fun running it 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.200
 gank 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.789
 by the way i have an alternative version 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.689
 explanation of our defeat 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:04.689
 but of course creep die this lover 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.549
 answer the question woman
