00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 but they were the sweet girls then today 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.930
 the intention to finally offer you a 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.189
 sparing name and type tenth time 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.559
 try to turn these then entered 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:18.779
 forgive me if I am a bit like that I go 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:22.410
 in a hurry because after a while today 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.539
 precisely I propose this this series 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.730
 of easy diy you can 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.349
 quietly replicate if you have 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.090
 intention or otherwise you will try to 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.099
 reproduce something that I propose to you 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.520
 remember to take lots of pictures and to 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.079
 share them to the hashtag on instagram 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.450
 julia low coffin watson so that 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.430
 so at least I can have it too and can 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.710
 participate in your creations 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.930
 I want to make a small note a little 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.660
 precisely on these candles that soon 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.520
 you will see how I made it in the video 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.170
 if you follow me on instagram already there 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.270
 know why I had already published a 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.920
 some pictures with these then I'll explain 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.920
 a second, as I've decided, is me 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.250
 came the idea of ​​doing what is me then 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.790
 you're pumping profiles not on instagram of 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.799
 rum interior rooms and so on 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.290
 to see everywhere in every profile in 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.580
 all these cute puccioso photos 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.260
 candle cabbage 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.689
 then I did some research and I have 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.509
 discovered that I'm from hm com 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.820
 what I do badly in Italy or not 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.500
 there is but it is logical if I want to say not 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.750
 they sell here in Italy and I didn't say no 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.540
 what I do I tried to make 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.729
 no purchases from the UK site 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.500
 they just don't even send things in 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.450
 italy if only the kingdom sends them there 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.970
 united enough and then I made myself from it 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.799
 alone in extreme extreme remedies 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.020
 he did for example in this case 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.820
 two though I didn't do it in the video 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.680
 see how I did the other way 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.729
 just another option 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.680
 I decided to vip among them I am funnel 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.320
 many ideas fail to come out I have 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.420
 decided to make us the right print 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.659
 really very similar to those of hm 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.049
 you can really do it but really 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.270
 the idea of the label is really wide 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.340
 in the sense that one can print on it 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.960
 of flowers 1 can print us on one 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.700
 a little special writing 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.560
 in short, joke and I recommend it 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.209
 share it with me so at least it is 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.980
 just an exchange of ideas that has one 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.709
 what i really like is youtube is 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.019
 this also for example this in 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.060
 reality would not exist in the collection 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.250
 in quotation marks 10 com 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.170
 and then I decided he said why not is 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.269
 hope is a beautiful thing and so I have 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.860
 decided to write that one myself 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:36.629
 nothing will leave you to the video and see you 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:38.670
 after the first that should be using self 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.500
 a bottle of wine or vinegar and gods 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.450
 fake flowers to our taste I have suffered 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.980
 changed my mind having decided to use 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.810
 the bunch now with hot water 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.670
 I remove all the labels that 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.250
 there are on the bottle and the go for 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.530
 I will use this as decoration 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.329
 very soft pink ribbon applying it 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.190
 in this way I take the measure e 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.190
 I consider 2 of the temple for the glue 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.959
 why 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.910
 you can use both the tattk and the paste 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.440
 warm in both cases, but do a lot 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.030
 attention I recommend to not 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.440
 stick your fingers in it which is not a thing 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.819
 enjoyable 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.890
 now the water bottle rebounds 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.080
 so that our flowers even though they are 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.800
 fake they will seem maybe a little bit more 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.800
 realistic 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.819
 let's move on to hawaii's second straight away 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.420
 today in which precisely I will show you the 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.489
 taper 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.350
 Racz was just melt in the pan 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.820
 without adding water or anything else 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.160
 if you want you can easily 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.940
 add some romea yours to yours 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.620
 choice 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.690
 now I take a long candle there 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:45.640
 often to get the fuse is the 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.489
 premium fism takes a measure and also 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.140
 here I leave it a little longer 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.940
 because I'm going to roll it up to 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.510
 straw to make sure it has a 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.510
 support 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.050
 then guys really doing now 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.150
 lots of attention to the wax 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.640
 melted in the glass and I wait for it 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.070
 solidify already inserting the fuse now 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.610
 in the meantime, I go immediately to do mine 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.250
 label 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.960
 I decided to register as a coop already 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.760
 I have explained to you before, however, logically 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.519
 you can write all that 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.560
 you will want in the info box I leave you all 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.630
 various information you need for 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.310
 can print it correctly and voila 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.200
 now we have it printed and we go 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.810
 immediately cut it to be able to apply it 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.420
 to our now solidified candle 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.190
 I also advise you to choose a 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.450
 glass with straight and non-straight walls 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.340
 rounded so that the application 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.490
 of the label may be a little more 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.490
 easy 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.810
 here is our similar candle 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.370
 chandan I gave you the second one here 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.980
 I actually option this is also done 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.720
 in that the candle but wanting that yes 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.850
 can put in another glass 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.920
 maybe even the little cute things of the 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.170
 bracelets you see in short what 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.780
 you can enjoy it more now finally 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:01.850
 we arrived at the fateful writing on the 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.160
 The wall has decided to write suite 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.160
 lido fim I forgot to mention it 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.380
 logically though both before and now I have 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.060
 used the photoshop and there the writing 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.220
 you can do the dimensions you do 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.900
 just want to change them 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.550
 keyboard size 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.710
 after having cut all of them well 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.419
 letters I apply the double-sided tape in strips 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.700
 very thin so that they remain 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:25.100
 hidden precisely proceed to 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.600
 I advise putting the writing on the wall 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.580
 perhaps to trace a lot 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.020
 light a line with the pencil to make 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.050
 the writing straight and I recommend it 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.950
 logically remember later 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.600
 erase that gum 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.700
 this for today is all if this video 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.040
 you enjoyed it and leave me a sap sap 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.419
 amnesty sap and we'll see you at 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.710
 next I recommend let me know 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:44.980
 What is your favorite 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.980
 Hello
