difference in terms of yeah the clock if

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.200 
difference in terms of yeah the clock if
I<00:00:55.110> were<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.379> zooming<00:00:55.710> like<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:57.739> focus<00:00:58.739> but

kinda like that where you can see are
the<00:01:03.210> difference<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:04.049> it's<00:01:04.170> not<00:01:04.290> as<00:01:04.500> well<00:01:04.710> made

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
the difference so it's not as well made

inches<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.909> kind<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.180> hard<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.420> measure<00:01:42.659> this

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
inches it's kind of hard to measure this

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.770 
inches it's kind of hard to measure this
one<00:01:43.140> because<00:01:43.500> it's<00:01:43.710> like<00:01:43.860> curving<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.880> coiled

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
up and it's a snake so it's kind of hard

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.999 
up and it's a snake so it's kind of hard
to<00:01:47.700> measure<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.149> but<00:01:49.079> as<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.799> can<00:01:49.920> see<00:01:51.920> so<00:01:52.920> this

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
to measure it but as you can see so this

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.789 
to measure it but as you can see so this
is<00:01:53.070> kind<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:54.049> yeah<00:01:55.049> more<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.409> velvety

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
is kind of yeah more of the velvety

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.350 
is kind of yeah more of the velvety
texture<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.250> we're<00:01:56.399> talking<00:01:56.700> about<00:01:56.909> her

a<00:01:59.520> little<00:01:59.579> bigger<00:01:59.850> we're<00:02:00.090> probably<00:02:00.329> talking

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
a little bigger we're probably talking

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.120 
a little bigger we're probably talking
maybe<00:02:01.380> like<00:02:02.310> 12<00:02:02.579> inches<00:02:02.880> around<00:02:03.659> there<00:02:04.130> and

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
maybe like 12 inches around there and

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.650 
maybe like 12 inches around there and
you<00:02:05.549> can<00:02:05.909> see<00:02:07.129> the<00:02:08.129> way<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.369> scenes<00:02:08.789> are<00:02:09.060> it's

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
you can see the way the scenes are it's

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.980 
you can see the way the scenes are it's
more<00:02:09.899> detail<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.679> way<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:12.060> attachments<00:02:12.780> are

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
more detail the way the attachments are

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.420 
more detail the way the attachments are
yeah<00:02:14.990> the<00:02:15.110> vines<00:02:15.350> are<00:02:15.500> pretty<00:02:15.680> crazy<00:02:15.920> I<00:02:16.160> think

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
yeah the vines are pretty crazy I think

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.530 
yeah the vines are pretty crazy I think
I<00:02:16.550> think<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.790> attention<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.180> detail<00:02:17.450> is

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
I think the attention to detail is

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.050 
I think the attention to detail is
pretty<00:02:17.780> crazy<00:02:17.960> yeah<00:02:18.560> for<00:02:19.160> Pokemon<00:02:19.520> Center<00:02:19.820> and

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
pretty crazy yeah for Pokemon Center and

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.800 
pretty crazy yeah for Pokemon Center and
of<00:02:20.360> course<00:02:20.570> we<00:02:20.690> have<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.880> chibi<00:02:23.240> version<00:02:23.270> as

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
of course we have the chibi version as

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.140 
of course we have the chibi version as
you<00:02:24.350> can<00:02:24.500> see<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.830> head<00:02:25.010> is<00:02:25.040> much<00:02:25.610> much<00:02:25.910> bigger

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
you can see the head is much much bigger

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.030 
you can see the head is much much bigger
yeah<00:02:27.020> it<00:02:27.200> is<00:02:27.290> a<00:02:27.320> lot<00:02:27.470> bigger<00:02:27.590> if<00:02:27.740> you<00:02:27.800> put<00:02:27.950> them

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
yeah it is a lot bigger if you put them

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.440 
yeah it is a lot bigger if you put them
side-by-side

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
side-by-side

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.810 
side-by-side
there<00:02:29.990> goes<00:02:30.200> yeah<00:02:30.800> you<00:02:30.920> can<00:02:31.040> see<00:02:31.220> that<00:02:31.430> it's<00:02:31.610> a

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
there goes yeah you can see that it's a

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.050 
there goes yeah you can see that it's a
definitely<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.840> lot<00:02:32.960> bigger<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.910> the

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
definitely a lot bigger and and the

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.790 
definitely a lot bigger and and the
vines<00:02:35.380> don't<00:02:36.380> stand<00:02:36.590> up<00:02:36.740> as<00:02:36.920> much<00:02:37.100> but<00:02:38.800> I'm

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
vines don't stand up as much but I'm

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.140 
vines don't stand up as much but I'm
gonna<00:02:39.980> show<00:02:40.160> them<00:02:40.280> in<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.460> enemy<00:02:40.700> either<00:02:40.820> I

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
think it's only they really got to the

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.090 
think it's only they really got to the
final<00:02:44.420> evolutions<00:02:44.990> Jeff<00:02:45.230> yeah<00:02:45.380> not<00:02:45.709> just<00:02:45.890> yet
