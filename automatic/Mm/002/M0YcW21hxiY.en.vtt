00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:14.940
 the first little boy in the area 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.900
 again bringing more dragon there to 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.140

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.610
 perfect and not daggers the best weapon 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.040
 of the game is the long shine boat of ok 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.290
 in comparison with with my weapon that 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.430
 in case it is stronger than I had until the 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.700
 moment it has less attribute 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.930
 however it has a space for an urn 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.329
 if you put a superb 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:56.399
 whatever it is but pride 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:01:00.420

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:05.070
 damage and give my gun to give you 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.820
 221 dps an attribute cop in it that the 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.250
 weapon fires three shots when it attacks 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.729
 perfect for you to catch it's mission 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.990
 that pride has forged the gorgeous touch to 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:22.080
 this mission you go there to the digital time 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:25.229
 I really like this position where I am and you. 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.630
 will get her to have done something that 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.890
 already advance for you that many videos 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.200
 on youtube and you 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.780
 No one said anything that I'm going to 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.939
 talk is the following if you have playing 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.840
 perfect and this phase is open to you from 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:47.149
 that pride for jewelry you can understand 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:51.030
 go there, calmly pick up this item 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:54.149
 ends the phase and returns and continues 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.860
 Playing your yoke, I understand. 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.719
 go to the end because I thought that era 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.079
 one of the last stages and a game 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:05.850
 End up understood then it was a last 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:08.340
 phase that I picked up right but you can 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.280
 to be there to pick up your bow and 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.690
 continue your game because this dc game 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.110
 this good 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.100
 he gives a damage the day he tripled his 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.480
 owner 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.880
 there a little while before while I 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.850
 was showing the location of the 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.160
 pocket right after you enter the spindle 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.890
 of the mittal garden friends have to 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.330
 solve three polzin you're already going to enter 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.430
 for the time will go up 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.040
 stairs he will already come left 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.540
 you then exact location you return there 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.910
 a little video you will see a local 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.730
 perfect where you'll catch him well at 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.610
 stone is ok 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.230
 remembering that in this example 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.170
 presenting at this moment that I am 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.390
 fighting the guard where mittal I 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.250
 I did not have superb rue 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.420
 So this damage you're seeing there is not the 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.400
 her maximum 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.500
 understood if you with a superb give 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.470
 much more than that 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.270
 Okay, and this is it, boys, remembering 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.760
 you have playing open the phase o 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.340
 Pride fled for you, go and get it. 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.940
 the gun and turn your game 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.730
 quietly you will not clear the game 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.940
 going in perfect mittal time 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:21.890
 the farm that's it I'll get out 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:25.590
 check out this duel with the dragon 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:28.320
 the three damages at the same time I hope 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.050
 Have you enjoyed the strong hug left? 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:34.100

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.100
