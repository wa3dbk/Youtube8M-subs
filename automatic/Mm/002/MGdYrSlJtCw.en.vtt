00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.680
 they are raising people, yes, but 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:15.360
 pressing sack to eat did not take out the 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.360
 count gas 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:23.710
 this taxi driver is a friend of the devil 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.660
 well this I'm altering the meter 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:30.150
 so that I can mark more 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.990
 and so I can already get out is pirate 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.990
 in the place 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.500
 yes, but as we get 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:51.800
 yes yes but official to verify the 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:55.219
 taximeter is 350 pesos but if 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:58.239
 wants with a little help you have to put 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.239
 Extra money 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.129
 and they charge 300 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.740
 he did not give it to him, they gave it to me 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.150
 the 20% alternates 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.720
 there are places that 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.390
 valid until the devil of a few years ago 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:28.000
 it's not the same taxi meter devil 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:30.860
 digital is same tricks but more 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.550
 sophisticated already then jumped to this the 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.550
 goal in code 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.700
 and only with the speed of the car 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.970
 changing more the taximeters and to be 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.580
 modern are no longer this one of them are 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.470
 digital no longer 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.870
 now you have to walk moving the red 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.720
 through the famous mouse on the lever 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.540
 of the speeds on the stereo or using 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.100
 a smaller ring are things of the past 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.920
 but impunity prevails in the 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.590
 present it is assumed that the authorities 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.920
 they check the taximeters and even 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.680
 stamp stamps hell is for the 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.990
 users burn them like fire pay the 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.290
 trip the problem is that they stay 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:15.260
 silent in 2012 the secretariat of 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.450
 transport and road only received 112 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.700
 allegations related to abuse in the 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.670
 fee collection last year the 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.740
 setravi had only authorized 11 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.290
 taximeter verification units 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.020
 but how the workshops have proliferated 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.959
 ducklings where they modify the business 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.930
 it's round and the invea operatives 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.820
 who knows next some 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.770
 recommendations for you to take in 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.050
 account and you can notice if the devil 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.510
 goes on board the taxi ie if the 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.590
 meter is altered if the change and 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.690
 take out 250 meters or every 45 seconds 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.390
 or is normally in a kilometer are 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.460
 four changes 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.640
 in the taximeter when we go fast there are 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:00.160
 antithesis of demons are taxi drivers 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.130
 who work honestly in the medallion 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.170
 of your unit without inscribed the legend 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.410
 normal rate but if you see the 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.480
 devil denounce the sanctions go from 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:15.240
 the yard to the loss of 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.240
