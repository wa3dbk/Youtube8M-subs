mentioned<00:05:54.880> in<00:05:55.870> my<00:05:56.530> episode<00:05:57.219> JC<00:05:57.789> the<00:05:58.360> real

mentioned in my episode JC the real

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.629 
mentioned in my episode JC the real
issue<00:05:58.840> here<00:05:59.020> is<00:05:59.440> that<00:05:59.469> you<00:06:00.340> have<00:06:00.610> to

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 
issue here is that you have to

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:02.959 
issue here is that you have to
distinguish<00:06:01.330> between<00:06:01.539> a<00:06:01.750> freckle<00:06:02.199> and<00:06:02.349> a<00:06:02.740> mole

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:02.969 
distinguish between a freckle and a mole

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:06.209 
distinguish between a freckle and a mole
when<00:06:03.969> they're<00:06:04.120> flat<00:06:04.360> because<00:06:05.020> if<00:06:05.409> it's<00:06:05.650> a<00:06:05.770> mole

00:06:06.209 --> 00:06:06.219 
when they're flat because if it's a mole

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:09.180 
when they're flat because if it's a mole
and<00:06:06.659> you're<00:06:07.659> trying<00:06:07.960> to<00:06:08.050> get<00:06:08.139> rid<00:06:08.289> of<00:06:08.349> it<00:06:08.560> with

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
and you're trying to get rid of it with

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.969 
and you're trying to get rid of it with
any<00:06:09.400> destructive<00:06:09.940> modality<00:06:10.719> you<00:06:11.380> just<00:06:11.650> don't

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:11.979 
any destructive modality you just don't

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:13.950 
any destructive modality you just don't
know<00:06:12.069> was<00:06:12.550> the<00:06:12.669> mole<00:06:12.880> normal<00:06:13.330> to<00:06:13.479> start<00:06:13.750> with

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
know was the mole normal to start with

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.110 
know was the mole normal to start with
number<00:06:14.770> two<00:06:15.009> did<00:06:15.130> you<00:06:15.250> get<00:06:15.430> rid<00:06:15.639> of<00:06:15.699> the<00:06:15.940> hole

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
number two did you get rid of the hole

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.270 
number two did you get rid of the hole
mole<00:06:16.389> have<00:06:16.840> you<00:06:17.020> altered<00:06:17.469> the<00:06:17.620> mole<00:06:17.830> in<00:06:18.039> any

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
mole have you altered the mole in any

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.180 
mole have you altered the mole in any
way<00:06:18.550> to<00:06:18.610> make<00:06:18.880> it<00:06:19.150> dangerous<00:06:19.330> so<00:06:20.289> I'm

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
way to make it dangerous so I'm

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.249 
way to make it dangerous so I'm
perfectly<00:06:21.729> fine<00:06:21.849> with<00:06:22.120> sun<00:06:22.599> freckles<00:06:23.050> and
