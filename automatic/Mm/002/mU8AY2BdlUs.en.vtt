00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
now I finally found a set of wheels that

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.700 
now I finally found a set of wheels that
I<00:00:02.100> want<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.700> put<00:00:02.909> on<00:00:03.000> my<00:00:03.149> car<00:00:03.419> however<00:00:03.780> they

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.750 

once<00:00:33.290> we<00:00:33.410> met<00:00:33.560> up<00:00:33.710> with<00:00:33.740> Robyn<00:00:33.980> to<00:00:34.220> shop<00:00:34.490> we<00:00:34.730> got

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
once we met up with Robyn to shop we got

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.180 
once we met up with Robyn to shop we got
straight<00:00:35.210> to<00:00:35.240> work<00:00:35.450> the<00:00:36.410> first<00:00:36.650> step<00:00:36.860> is<00:00:37.040> to

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
straight to work the first step is to

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.650 
straight to work the first step is to
sandblast<00:00:37.520> all<00:00:37.880> of<00:00:38.030> the<00:00:38.150> flat<00:00:38.360> black

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
sandblast all of the flat black

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.940 
sandblast all of the flat black
powder-coat<00:00:39.290> off<00:00:39.470> of<00:00:39.710> the<00:00:39.800> wheel<00:00:40.630> so<00:00:41.630> powder

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
powder-coat off of the wheel so powder

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.310 
powder-coat off of the wheel so powder
will<00:00:42.950> only<00:00:43.070> stick<00:00:43.400> to<00:00:43.430> bare<00:00:43.760> metal<00:00:43.970> you<00:00:44.930> are

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
will only stick to bare metal you are

will only stick to bare metal you are
going<00:00:45.559> to<00:00:45.650> sandblast<00:00:46.190> we<00:00:46.489> use<00:00:46.670> a<00:00:46.700> garnet

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
going to sandblast we use a garnet

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.290 
going to sandblast we use a garnet
plastic<00:00:48.170> media<00:00:48.500> that<00:00:49.250> we're<00:00:49.580> able<00:00:49.700> to<00:00:49.879> recycle

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
plastic media that we're able to recycle

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.970 
plastic media that we're able to recycle
after<00:00:50.780> done<00:00:50.989> and<00:00:51.199> they<00:00:51.440> can<00:00:51.620> make<00:00:51.739> park

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
after done and they can make park

after done and they can make park
benches<00:00:52.340> out<00:00:52.520> of<00:00:52.640> us<00:00:52.989> now<00:00:53.989> it<00:00:54.140> is<00:00:54.320> possible<00:00:54.770> to

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
benches out of us now it is possible to

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.890 
benches out of us now it is possible to
overheat<00:00:55.370> the<00:00:55.489> metal<00:00:55.760> if<00:00:55.970> it's<00:00:56.270> thin<00:00:56.600> enough

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
overheat the metal if it's thin enough

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.110 
overheat the metal if it's thin enough
during<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.350> sandblasting<00:00:57.949> process<00:00:57.980> but<00:00:58.820> I

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
during the sandblasting process but I

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.000 
during the sandblasting process but I
did<00:00:59.600> pretty<00:00:59.809> good<00:00:59.900> for<00:01:00.020> my<00:01:00.260> first<00:01:00.290> time<00:01:00.710> don't

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
did pretty good for my first time don't

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.280 
did pretty good for my first time don't
you<00:01:01.129> think<00:01:01.480> we're<00:01:02.480> going<00:01:02.600> to<00:01:02.660> hang<00:01:02.840> the<00:01:02.870> part

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
you think we're going to hang the part

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:10.590 
you think we're going to hang the part
and<00:01:04.330> start<00:01:05.330> our<00:01:05.420> next<00:01:05.540> process<00:01:08.710> powder<00:01:09.710> is

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
and start our next process powder is

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.090 
and start our next process powder is

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
charged with a positive charge and you

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.450 
charged with a positive charge and you
have<00:01:29.180> a<00:01:29.210> grounded<00:01:29.780> part<00:01:30.080> which<00:01:30.950> allows<00:01:31.250> the

coverage the with conventional wet spray

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.930 
coverage the with conventional wet spray
there<00:01:37.970> would<00:01:38.180> be<00:01:38.210> maybe<00:01:39.110> 40<00:01:40.100> to<00:01:40.220> 50<00:01:40.550> percent

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
there would be maybe 40 to 50 percent

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.510 
there would be maybe 40 to 50 percent
transfer<00:01:41.420> efficiency<00:01:41.750> with<00:01:42.290> powder<00:01:42.590> you<00:01:43.370> get

transfer efficiency with powder you get

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.840 
transfer efficiency with powder you get
more<00:01:43.820> of<00:01:44.090> 80<00:01:44.390> to<00:01:44.630> 90<00:01:44.930> percent<00:01:45.490> so<00:01:46.490> how<00:01:46.670> are<00:01:46.790> we

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
more of 80 to 90 percent so how are we

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.580 
more of 80 to 90 percent so how are we
going<00:01:47.090> to<00:01:47.240> achieve<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.810> kind<00:01:48.050> of<00:01:48.170> candy
