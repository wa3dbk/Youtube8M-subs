00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:02.840 

in<00:00:01.319> this<00:00:01.469> video<00:00:01.800> we'll<00:00:02.280> look<00:00:02.460> at<00:00:02.639> how<00:00:02.820> to

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
in this video we'll look at how to

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.590 
in this video we'll look at how to
change<00:00:03.810> the<00:00:04.790> multiplication<00:00:05.790> table<00:00:06.240> that<00:00:06.480> we

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
change the multiplication table that we

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.169 
change the multiplication table that we
made<00:00:06.779> in<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:07.080> previous<00:00:07.259> video<00:00:07.740> into<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.670> special

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
made in a previous video into a special

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.570 
made in a previous video into a special
kind<00:00:09.420> of<00:00:09.480> multiplication<00:00:10.290> table<00:00:10.740> one<00:00:11.370> that

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
kind of multiplication table one that

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.730 
kind of multiplication table one that
does<00:00:12.179> multiplication<00:00:12.990> in<00:00:13.200> modular

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
does multiplication in modular

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.490 
does multiplication in modular
arithmetic<00:00:14.269> now<00:00:15.269> modular<00:00:15.750> arithmetic<00:00:15.809> is

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
arithmetic now modular arithmetic is

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.400 
arithmetic now modular arithmetic is
sometimes<00:00:16.890> called<00:00:17.160> clock<00:00:17.789> arithmetic<00:00:18.410> it's

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
sometimes called clock arithmetic it's

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.490 
sometimes called clock arithmetic it's
accessible<00:00:20.189> at<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.609> fairly<00:00:21.080> elementary<00:00:22.080> level

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
accessible at a fairly elementary level

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.769 
accessible at a fairly elementary level
although<00:00:23.220> it's<00:00:23.550> often<00:00:23.850> not<00:00:24.240> formally

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
although it's often not formally

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.750 
although it's often not formally
introduced<00:00:25.320> until<00:00:25.830> college<00:00:26.099> classes<00:00:26.519> and

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
introduced until college classes and

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.780 
introduced until college classes and
number<00:00:27.570> theory<00:00:27.930> or<00:00:28.849> abstract<00:00:29.849> algebra<00:00:31.790> okay

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
number theory or abstract algebra okay

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.709 
number theory or abstract algebra okay
so<00:00:33.170> here<00:00:34.170> we<00:00:34.200> have<00:00:34.399> the<00:00:35.399> multiplication<00:00:36.329> table

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
so here we have the multiplication table

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.209 
so here we have the multiplication table
that<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:36.930> described<00:00:37.440> how<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.649> make<00:00:37.890> in<00:00:38.129> a

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
that I described how to make in a

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.819 
that I described how to make in a
previous<00:00:38.640> video<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.930> most<00:00:40.140> important

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
previous video and the most important

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.240 
previous video and the most important
formula<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.579> over<00:00:42.420> here<00:00:43.170> I'll<00:00:43.680> show<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
formula is over here I'll show it the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.840 
formula is over here I'll show it the
magnifying<00:00:44.879> glass<00:00:45.200> and<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:47.070> dollar<00:00:47.370> signs

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
magnifying glass and the dollar signs

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.420 
magnifying glass and the dollar signs
show<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.420> we're<00:00:48.600> using<00:00:49.430> absolute

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
show that we're using absolute

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.060 
show that we're using absolute
references<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:52.289> explained<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.039> other

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
references and I explained in the other

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.020 
references and I explained in the other
video<00:00:54.199> what<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.379> means<00:00:55.590> okay<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:56.699> I'm<00:00:56.910> going

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
video what that means okay so I'm going

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.860 
video what that means okay so I'm going
to<00:00:57.090> keep<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.420> same<00:00:57.600> formula<00:00:58.460> delete<00:00:59.460> delete

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
to keep the same formula delete delete

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.900 
to keep the same formula delete delete
some<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.109> cells<00:01:01.350> we<00:01:01.530> don't<00:01:01.739> need<00:01:01.890> here<00:01:02.160> now

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
some of the cells we don't need here now

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.270 
some of the cells we don't need here now
for<00:01:02.969> modular<00:01:03.710> multiplication<00:01:04.710> tables<00:01:05.100> will

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
for modular multiplication tables will

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.490 
for modular multiplication tables will
usually<00:01:05.430> start<00:01:05.909> with<00:01:06.000> 0<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.689> by<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.260> way<00:01:07.439> you

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
usually start with 0 and by the way you

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.310 
usually start with 0 and by the way you
can<00:01:07.799> use<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> very<00:01:08.610> very<00:01:08.700> similar<00:01:09.210> technique<00:01:09.840> to

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
can use a very very similar technique to

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.370 
can use a very very similar technique to
make<00:01:10.500> addition<00:01:10.979> tables<00:01:11.400> okay<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:12.570> let<00:01:12.869> me<00:01:12.900> let

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
make addition tables okay so let me let

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.340 
make addition tables okay so let me let
me<00:01:13.560> erase<00:01:13.830> these<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.930> I<00:01:15.930> think<00:01:16.110> I'm<00:01:16.500> gonna<00:01:16.680> do

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
me erase these and I think I'm gonna do

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.700 
me erase these and I think I'm gonna do
I'm<00:01:19.350> gonna<00:01:19.500> do<00:01:19.860> mod<00:01:20.130> 6<00:01:20.970> which<00:01:21.600> means<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:22.170> go<00:01:22.409> from

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
I'm gonna do mod 6 which means I go from

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.490 
I'm gonna do mod 6 which means I go from
0<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.100> 5

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
0 to 5

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.910 
0 to 5
maude<00:01:26.160> six<00:01:27.260> they're<00:01:28.260> going<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.620> be<00:01:28.770> the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
maude six they're going to be the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.340 
maude six they're going to be the
remainders<00:01:29.550> after<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.120> divide<00:01:30.450> by<00:01:30.660> six<00:01:31.020> you

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
remainders after you divide by six you

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.730 
remainders after you divide by six you
can<00:01:32.220> kind<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.580> think<00:01:32.820> about<00:01:33.080> going<00:01:34.080> around<00:01:34.530> and

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
can kind of think about going around and

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.370 
can kind of think about going around and
around<00:01:34.830> in<00:01:35.160> a<00:01:35.280> circle<00:01:35.640> that's<00:01:36.630> kind<00:01:37.080> of<00:01:37.140> like<00:01:37.350> a

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
around in a circle that's kind of like a

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.090 
around in a circle that's kind of like a
clock<00:01:37.830> but<00:01:38.130> instead<00:01:38.580> of<00:01:38.700> going<00:01:39.030> from<00:01:40.100> 12

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
clock but instead of going from 12

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.700 
clock but instead of going from 12
o'clock<00:01:41.270> to<00:01:42.270> 12<00:01:42.570> o'clock<00:01:42.690> or<00:01:43.080> something<00:01:43.470> and

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
o'clock to 12 o'clock or something and

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.120 
o'clock to 12 o'clock or something and
we<00:01:44.130> just<00:01:44.940> have<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.510> number<00:01:45.810> 0<00:01:46.110> through<00:01:46.560> 5

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
we just have the number 0 through 5

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.130 
we just have the number 0 through 5
written<00:01:47.670> on<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.940> clock<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.479> so<00:01:48.660> when<00:01:48.869> we<00:01:48.990> get

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
written on the clock and so when we get

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.400 
written on the clock and so when we get
to<00:01:49.729> what<00:01:50.729> would<00:01:50.940> be<00:01:51.119> 6<00:01:51.450> we're<00:01:51.750> really<00:01:51.930> back<00:01:52.200> at

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
to what would be 6 we're really back at

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.280 
to what would be 6 we're really back at
0<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.160> what<00:01:53.369> goes<00:01:53.580> in<00:01:53.760> the<00:01:53.880> table<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.420> where<00:01:55.110> we

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
0 and what goes in the table is where we

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.710 
0 and what goes in the table is where we
would<00:01:55.470> land<00:01:56.040> after<00:01:56.490> doing<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.509> said

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
would land after doing the said

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.400 
would land after doing the said
multiplication<00:01:58.790> okay<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.270> change<00:02:01.080> the

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
multiplication okay so change the

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.780 
multiplication okay so change the
formula<00:02:02.360> and<00:02:03.440> it's<00:02:04.440> really<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.830> minor

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
formula and it's really a minor

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.469 
formula and it's really a minor
modification<00:02:06.210> here<00:02:07.170> I'm<00:02:07.410> gonna<00:02:07.649> put<00:02:08.479> the

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
modification here I'm gonna put the

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.530 
modification here I'm gonna put the
multiplication<00:02:10.380> that<00:02:11.220> we<00:02:11.370> did<00:02:11.550> before<00:02:11.700> inside

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
multiplication that we did before inside

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.900 
multiplication that we did before inside
this<00:02:12.780> mod<00:02:13.080> function<00:02:13.440> ok<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.430> mod<00:02:14.640> function

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
this mod function ok the mod function

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.199 
this mod function ok the mod function
takes<00:02:15.360> two<00:02:15.630> arguments<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.580> number<00:02:17.580> which<00:02:17.940> is

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
takes two arguments a number which is

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.270 
takes two arguments a number which is
going<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:19.020> be<00:02:19.320> the<00:02:19.709> result<00:02:20.070> of<00:02:20.160> our

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
going to be the result of our

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.400 
going to be the result of our
multiplication<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.300> then<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:22.050> takes<00:02:22.230> a

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
multiplication and then it takes a

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.560 
multiplication and then it takes a
divisor<00:02:22.709> which<00:02:23.130> in<00:02:23.400> this<00:02:23.610> case<00:02:23.850> because<00:02:24.360> we're

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
divisor which in this case because we're

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.780 
divisor which in this case because we're
doing<00:02:24.780> mod<00:02:24.959> six<00:02:25.320> will<00:02:25.530> be<00:02:25.680> six<00:02:25.980> we<00:02:26.430> could<00:02:26.640> do

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
doing mod six will be six we could do

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.430 
doing mod six will be six we could do
another<00:02:27.330> number<00:02:27.660> here<00:02:28.610> okay<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:30.920> then<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:32.160> just

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
another number here okay and then I just

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.630 
another number here okay and then I just
drag<00:02:34.440> this

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
drag this

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.480 
drag this
and<00:02:37.150> I<00:02:37.270> have<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.540> multiplication<00:02:38.230> table<00:02:38.560> now

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
and I have the multiplication table now

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.020 
and I have the multiplication table now
this<00:02:39.670> is<00:02:39.880> a<00:02:39.910> nice<00:02:40.530> activity<00:02:41.530> to<00:02:42.280> have<00:02:42.430> students

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
this is a nice activity to have students

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.210 
this is a nice activity to have students
make<00:02:43.320> multiplication<00:02:44.320> tables<00:02:44.710> for<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:44.950> variety

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
make multiplication tables for a variety

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.240 
make multiplication tables for a variety
of<00:02:45.610> mods<00:02:46.030> and<00:02:46.450> then<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.350> look<00:02:47.530> for<00:02:47.740> patterns<00:02:47.920> in

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
of mods and then to look for patterns in

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.650 
of mods and then to look for patterns in
them<00:02:48.460> there<00:02:48.820> are<00:02:48.970> a<00:02:49.030> lot<00:02:49.210> of<00:02:49.240> interesting

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
them there are a lot of interesting

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.380 
them there are a lot of interesting
patterns<00:02:50.350> some<00:02:51.190> of<00:02:51.340> which<00:02:51.490> correspond<00:02:52.240> to

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
patterns some of which correspond to

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.020 
patterns some of which correspond to
some<00:02:52.960> pretty<00:02:53.170> important<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.250> deep<00:02:54.550> results

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
some pretty important and deep results

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.660 
some pretty important and deep results
in<00:02:55.150> number<00:02:55.450> three
