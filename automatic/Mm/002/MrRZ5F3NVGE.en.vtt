00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
job itself but I over exaggerated a

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:07.399 
job itself but I over exaggerated a
little<00:02:06.930> bit

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
little bit

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.469

explode and so I wouldn't recommend

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.560 
explode and so I wouldn't recommend
going<00:02:13.350> up<00:02:13.740> those<00:02:13.920> speeds<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:15.030> do<00:02:15.180> these<00:02:15.360> thumb
