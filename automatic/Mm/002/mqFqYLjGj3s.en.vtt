 so they told me that he was somewhere here 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.450
 here the devil's leg will break 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:23.910
 I'm already late is not good on the photo 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.869
 hello sorry for being late for scared he 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.369
 already seven consequence 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.369
 let's reincarnate drove 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.910
 need to 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.829
 and yourself 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:56.320
 true before you have to drive it 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:56.320
 not an acrobat 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.520
 pressure 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.300

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.780
 height h 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.030
 Well, we start the engine strictly according to 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:19.200
 instructions including mass then raise 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.200
 pressure up to 5 atmospheres 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.140
 manual gas and starter 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:44.200
 you are 3476 soviet medium tank tank 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.780
 symbol tank whose name will live forever on 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.770
 pages of history books and in memory 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.579
 our descendants 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.100
 the car went into production in 1940 before 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:57.039
 how to get a terrible and respected name 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.250
 there was a lot of work done assignment from 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:02.380
 the party entered in 1938 in 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.840
 Kharkiv Design Bureau 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.959
 which then led Mikhail Ilyich 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.929
 cat he said work not to catch up 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:13.750
 she a year in the design use 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.120
 not an analogue but a tendency to introduce such 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.489
 new tank which would be long lasting 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.019
 time promising and did not require 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.019
 significant changes 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.650
 what does it mean it means with them and catia 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.270
 it was awesome but at the same time 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.520
 the design of the combat vehicle was very 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.200
 simple technologically tank hull 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.630
 welded about to 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.390
 from rolled slabs or with you homogeneous 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:05.270
 steel sheets fell down at the corners that 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.550
 increased projectile rebound undercarriage 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.410
 also not functional 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.050
 tractor support rollers 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.510
 the caterpillar lies on big wheels even 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.870
 if one of them is damaged 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.760
 besides all the elements of the torsion 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.220
 suspension system christi hidden in 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.310
 the hull and the rollers themselves which again 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.900
 reduced the possibility of damage 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.890
 dimensions of the combat vehicle were small 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:34.310
 length with a gun 6060 2 millimeters wider at 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:37.280
 3000 millimeters height 2050 2 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.120
 millimeter combat weight of about 30 tons 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.730
 car crew consisted of four people 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.400
 driver and gunner 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.230
 located in the department of management and 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.810
 loader with the commander performing 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.860
 also gunner functions they sat in 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.160
 twin tower 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:58.370
 they were protected not by the worst armor forehead 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.640
 sides of 45 millimeters tower mask 40 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.640

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:13.270
 combat vehicle t-34 76 armed 76 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:16.600
 millimeter tank gun f-34 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.549
 Gorky plant number 92 ammunition 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.519
 cow produced a lot from 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.530
 armor-piercing shrapnel shell 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:27.040
 also on the tank there are two machine guns 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.410
 caliber 7 62 millimeters dt degtyarev 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.660
 tank and such a mower of death with 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.660
 rate of fire 600 shots per minute 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.160
 its motor numbers won't leave you 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.160
 indifferent 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.740
 You figurative dvenadtsatitsilindrovy 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.380
 diesel liquid cooled with 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.090
 direct injection 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.840
 operational capacity of 400 horse 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.580
 force 3700 rpm 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.280
 as it consumes fuel but it does not matter 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.570
 but the fact that the diesel tank burned worse 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.320
 german gasoline 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:05.410
 this is exactly the speed on the highway 54 kilometers 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.340
 per hour speed over rough terrain 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.850
 25 kilometers per hour 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.310
 range on the highway 300 kilometers alright 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.220
 while it is possible to ride a tank 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:19.690
 it is impossible to miss this all the more 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.690
 he manages very well 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:37.020
 production of the t-34 76 lasted until 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:39.659
 In 1944, a total of 35 thousand were produced . 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.150
 four hundred and sixty seven cars this 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:43.289
 very much but as they say no gods 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.470
 pots burned 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:51.259
 and the people in the story with the t-34 was a union 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.259
 magnificent cars and heroic crews 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:21.030
 I still wanted to ask why the tank 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:25.479
 called sniper this is the tank t-34 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:27.790
 42 year old was part thirty 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:31.000
 the third tank brigade was raised in 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.840
 2003 at 408 second kilometer highway 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.419
 Moscow-Riga 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.639
 near the city of falcon in the Pskov region 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:39.040
 when the car was lifted out of the swamp 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:41.050
 rinse selected bytes to the tower 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.810
 the inscription sniper appeared at all 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:46.090
 inscription sniper received cars that 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.979
 manifested themselves in battles with 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.530
 nazi invaders 

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:52.090
 destroyed a great gave a groan 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.919
 thirty-three survived much but 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:56.680
 probably only in the central museum 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:57.220
 armored weapons and equipment 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.490
 Cuban woman 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:04.660
 all major are most fully represented 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:06.490
 modifications of the legend want to finish 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.590
 in the words of the German general in 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:12.010
 Field Marshal Talk Commander 

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:16.150
 tank army southward their 

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:18.570
 the t-34 was the best tank in the world 

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:23.740
 sorry world 

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:25.870
 what a year 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.500
 see on catcher and the beast runs 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.500
 the hunt continues
