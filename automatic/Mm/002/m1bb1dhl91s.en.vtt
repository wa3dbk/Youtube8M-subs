00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.180
 good morning dear viewers 

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:10.570
 continue the topic of gladiolus 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:13.240
 clean the bulbs look removed Donets 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.730
 Here is the house is to say should occupy 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.540
 not less than 7 parts 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.010
 Here it occupies this area of onions 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.830
 much smaller part means we have 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.150
 bulb all blooming even when so 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.550
 onion is in progress 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.460
 do not be afraid of anything terrible there 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.340
 if you count the square area of â€‹â€‹this 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.960
 Donets it will still be less than 7 parts 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.120
 which means the onion will be fine 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.579
 blossom here when donets take half 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.320
 bulbs here it will be bad these 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.620
 bulbs all young look I her 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:48.030
 I cleaned off all the scales and saw 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:51.660
 that there is just a whole herd otritsa 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.399
 cleaning out all these 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.610
 parts of the bulb look u interprets 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.500
 generally half of the area go to but 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.210
 throwing it out not necessarily not 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.799
 suffered no bottom not flower buds 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.009
 suffered only part then my pulp 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:11.319
 bulbs so that we cleaned all 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.359
 there are no trips here because there is none 

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:13.780
 one scales and we all took off where they could 

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:17.979
 would 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.590
 but to keep out the mold viruses and 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:24.159
 all sorts of take here such wadded 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:27.039
 sticks we have means for 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.380
 processing this brilliant green is iodine and this 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.749
 potassium permanganate we are very thick 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.229
 we take Zelenka dipped wand and 

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:36.490
 starting to process the surface eaten 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.509
 and thrips 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.509
 these ones 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:46.600
 square onions carefully falling 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.650
 every wound here when you do it all 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.040
 will process 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.510
 it must be well dried and removed already 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.130
 for storage 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:02:00.240
 And powder in karbofosom this necessarily and 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:04.000
 if you don't want to shoot 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.780
 scales and here are the damaged places 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.200
 onions 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:14.410
 then you have to dissolve karbofos from 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:17.610
 calculating 1 tablespoon per liter of water 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.790
 notice not on the bucket on whether and 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:26.350
 keep these bulbs at least 30 a 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:29.170
 thats 40 45 minutes in this solution only 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.110
 then you will get a good result by 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.300
 at least 30 calm down and running 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.640
 will not continue further but again at 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.489
 provided if you remove the bulbs in 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:43.090
 cool room cool it 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.850
 means plus 5 plus 7 degrees and 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.850
 it is desirable that she still 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.850
 aired
