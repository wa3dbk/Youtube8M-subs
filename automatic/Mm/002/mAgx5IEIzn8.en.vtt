00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
all changed now we know that this next

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.179 
all changed now we know that this next
map<00:00:30.869> pack<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.199> going<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.470> be<00:00:31.529> called<00:00:31.710> vengeance

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
map pack is going to be called vengeance

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.040 
map pack is going to be called vengeance
and<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.730> won't<00:00:32.910> make<00:00:33.059> sense<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.719> can't<00:00:33.960> be

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
and it won't make sense so it can't be

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.660 
and it won't make sense so it can't be
called<00:00:34.290> fear<00:00:34.530> us<00:00:34.770> anymore<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.370> if<00:00:35.430> we<00:00:35.520> just

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
called fear us anymore so if we just

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.610 
called fear us anymore so if we just
start<00:00:35.969> from<00:00:36.510> call<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.780> duty<00:00:37.050> black<00:00:37.079> ops<00:00:37.410> where

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
start from call of duty black ops where

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.229 
start from call of duty black ops where
it<00:00:37.739> all<00:00:37.829> began<00:00:38.010> we<00:00:38.340> have<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.579> four<00:00:38.790> map<00:00:39.000> packs

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
it all began we have the four map packs

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.389 
it all began we have the four map packs
which<00:00:39.750> started<00:00:40.200> with<00:00:40.230> first<00:00:40.620> strike<00:00:40.980> then<00:00:41.309> it

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
which started with first strike then it

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.340 
which started with first strike then it
was<00:00:41.489> escalation<00:00:42.149> than<00:00:42.300> annihilation<00:00:42.960> then

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
was escalation than annihilation then

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.350 
was escalation than annihilation then
resurrection<00:00:44.040> which<00:00:44.460> spelled<00:00:44.850> fee<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.300> then

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
resurrection which spelled fee and then

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.299 
resurrection which spelled fee and then
we<00:00:45.480> go<00:00:45.570> into<00:00:45.600> black<00:00:45.960> ops<00:00:46.200> 2<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.710> we<00:00:47.070> thought

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
we go into black ops 2 and we thought

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.619 
we go into black ops 2 and we thought
that<00:00:47.370> we<00:00:47.610> would<00:00:47.730> end<00:00:47.879> up<00:00:48.000> spelling<00:00:48.420> r<00:00:48.450> us

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
that we would end up spelling r us

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.959 
that we would end up spelling r us
because<00:00:49.020> we<00:00:49.260> first<00:00:49.500> got<00:00:49.710> revolution<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.550> then

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
because we first got revolution and then

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.610 
because we first got revolution and then
we<00:00:51.090> got<00:00:51.239> uprising<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.079> then<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:52.440> thought<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
we got uprising and then we thought the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.529 
we got uprising and then we thought the
next<00:00:53.010> map<00:00:53.160> pack<00:00:53.370> would<00:00:53.579> begin<00:00:53.820> with<00:00:53.969> an<00:00:54.090> S<00:00:54.300> but

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
next map pack would begin with an S but

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.080 
next map pack would begin with an S but
it<00:00:54.629> doesn't<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.199> begins<00:00:55.559> with<00:00:55.770> AV<00:00:55.890> Sophia<00:00:56.850> Ross

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
it doesn't it begins with AV Sophia Ross

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.639 
it doesn't it begins with AV Sophia Ross
is<00:00:57.239> totally<00:00:57.719> out<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.020> question<00:00:58.140> I

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
is totally out of the question I

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:59.689 
is totally out of the question I
actually<00:00:58.829> don't<00:00:59.129> know<00:00:59.340> why<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.489> we<00:00:59.670> thought

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
actually don't know why I we thought

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.490 
actually don't know why I we thought
that<00:00:59.940> anyway<00:01:00.420> because<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.870> don't<00:01:01.170> think<00:01:01.199> Russ

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
that anyway because I don't think Russ

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.500 
that anyway because I don't think Russ
man<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.770> all<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.190> bad<00:01:02.370> but<00:01:02.579> moving<00:01:03.300> on<00:01:03.359> I've

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
man is all that bad but moving on I've

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.000 
man is all that bad but moving on I've
got<00:01:03.660> two<00:01:03.809> ideas<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.320> theories<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:04.739> what<00:01:04.860> it

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
got two ideas and theories on what it

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.620 
got two ideas and theories on what it
could<00:01:05.040> be<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.549> first<00:01:05.790> one<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.000> fear<00:01:06.299> Teddy

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
could be so the first one is fear Teddy

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.030 
could be so the first one is fear Teddy
and<00:01:06.930> I'm<00:01:07.170> going<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.350> tell<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.560> how<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.890> could

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
and I'm going to tell you how it could

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.039 
and I'm going to tell you how it could
be<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.460> just<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.820> second<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.689> second

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
be that in just a second and the second

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.200 
be that in just a second and the second
one<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.170> fear<00:01:10.470> roover<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.580> if<00:01:11.670> we<00:01:11.790> start<00:01:11.850> off

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
one is fear roover so if we start off

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.359 
one is fear roover so if we start off
with<00:01:12.360> fear<00:01:12.570> /<00:01:12.990> or<00:01:13.140> /<00:01:13.350> don't<00:01:13.799> are<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.070> pronounce

any other map packs but I thought of

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.950 
any other map packs but I thought of
just<00:01:50.130> pointing<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.490> out<00:01:50.549> anyway<00:01:51.000> so<00:01:51.030> fear

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
Nikolai could be the first one I don't

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.490 
Nikolai could be the first one I don't
know<00:01:53.909> how<00:01:54.149> we<00:01:54.210> could<00:01:54.299> be<00:01:54.570> evil<00:01:54.840> we<00:01:55.229> know<00:01:55.350> that

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
know how we could be evil we know that

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.410 
know how we could be evil we know that
in<00:01:55.590> World<00:01:55.799> War<00:01:55.890> two<00:01:56.040> Russia<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.210> Germany

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
in World War two Russia and Germany

in World War two Russia and Germany
weren't<00:01:58.350> good<00:01:58.649> friends<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.250> maybe<00:01:59.490> stuff

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
weren't good friends so maybe stuff

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.039 
weren't good friends so maybe stuff
could<00:01:59.969> happen<00:02:00.000> between<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.750> don't<00:02:00.960> know

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
could happen between that I don't know

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.359 
could happen between that I don't know
we<00:02:01.170> could<00:02:01.290> get<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.469> whole<00:02:01.680> new<00:02:01.710> twisted

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
we could get a whole new twisted

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.950 
we could get a whole new twisted
storyline<00:02:02.820> but<00:02:03.000> that's<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.570> first<00:02:03.780> one

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
storyline but that's the first one

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.240 
storyline but that's the first one
anyway<00:02:04.200> that's<00:02:04.409> nickel<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.799> don't<00:02:05.040> think

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
anyway that's nickel I don't think

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.499 
anyway that's nickel I don't think
that's<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.490> biggest<00:02:05.670> possibility<00:02:06.329> but<00:02:06.450> I

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
that's the biggest possibility but I

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.609 
that's the biggest possibility but I
thought<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:06.899> share<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.200> with<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.439> guys

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
thought to share that with you guys

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.619 
thought to share that with you guys
anyway<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.429> think<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.819> year<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.420> best

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
anyway and I think the year the best

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.029 
anyway and I think the year the best
possibility<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.530> I'm<00:02:10.619> going<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.800> tell<00:02:11.009> you

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
possibility that I'm going to tell you

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.830 
possibility that I'm going to tell you
guys<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.700> there<00:02:11.970> may<00:02:12.060> be<00:02:12.090> many<00:02:12.390> more<00:02:12.599> if<00:02:12.720> you

one it i think does quite make quite a

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.190 
one it i think does quite make quite a
bit<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.760> sense<00:02:17.939> so<00:02:18.150> this<00:02:18.329> one<00:02:18.510> is<00:02:18.599> fear<00:02:18.840> teddy

is<00:03:06.959> a<00:03:06.989> big<00:03:07.260> part<00:03:07.889> in<00:03:08.159> college<00:03:08.670> zombies<00:03:09.180> that<00:03:09.239> I

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
is a big part in college zombies that I

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.750 
is a big part in college zombies that I
think<00:03:09.569> to<00:03:09.750> how<00:03:10.200> fear<00:03:10.500> Teddy<00:03:10.829> would<00:03:11.040> make<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.489> lot

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760

a<00:03:12.000> lot<00:03:12.269> of<00:03:12.420> sense<00:03:12.629> so<00:03:12.870> I<00:03:13.049> think<00:03:13.290> that<00:03:13.530> one<00:03:13.739> again

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
a lot of sense so I think that one again

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.470 
a lot of sense so I think that one again
could<00:03:14.280> really<00:03:14.579> work<00:03:14.730> if<00:03:14.939> you<00:03:15.030> take<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:15.209> look<00:03:15.389> at

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
could really work if you take a look at

could really work if you take a look at
this<00:03:15.540> picture<00:03:15.780> as<00:03:15.989> well<00:03:16.139> you<00:03:16.290> see<00:03:16.439> Samantha
