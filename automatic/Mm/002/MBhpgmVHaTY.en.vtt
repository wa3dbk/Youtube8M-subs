three coats of the magnetic primer

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.630 
three coats of the magnetic primer
applied<00:00:54.690> we've<00:00:55.410> waited<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.829> full<00:00:56.010> 30<00:00:56.280> minutes

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
applied we've waited the full 30 minutes

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.790 
applied we've waited the full 30 minutes
in<00:00:56.760> between<00:00:56.879> coats<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:58.079> used<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.500> foam

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
in between coats and I used a foam

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.130 
in between coats and I used a foam
roller<00:00:59.070> brush<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.699> about<00:00:59.910> 4<00:01:00.210> inches<00:01:00.510> wide<00:01:00.750> to

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
roller brush of about 4 inches wide to

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.650 
roller brush of about 4 inches wide to
apply<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.559> maybe<00:01:02.399> next<00:01:02.640> time<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.359> would

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
apply it maybe next time I would

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.370 
apply it maybe next time I would
actually<00:01:04.470> use<00:01:04.680> one<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.580> little<00:01:06.210> bit<00:01:06.390> wider<00:01:06.869> just

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
actually use one a little bit wider just

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.980 
actually use one a little bit wider just
so<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.590> wouldn't<00:01:07.799> take<00:01:07.920> quite<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.280> long<00:01:08.520> and

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
so it wouldn't take quite so long and

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.149 
so it wouldn't take quite so long and
overall<00:01:09.990> though<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.170> think<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.650> applied<00:01:10.920> very

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
overall though I think it applied very

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.609 
overall though I think it applied very
easily<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.850> was<00:01:11.970> hot<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:13.170> dried<00:01:13.350> pretty

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
easily it was hot so it dried pretty

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.340 
easily it was hot so it dried pretty
quick<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.130> now<00:01:14.640> we're<00:01:14.790> ready<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.090> add<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:16.049> top

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
and unfortunately for me my cat decided

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.780 
and unfortunately for me my cat decided
to<00:01:57.000> walk<00:01:57.149> across<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.780> but<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:58.920> dry<00:01:59.340> so

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
to walk across this but it is dry so

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.660 
to walk across this but it is dry so
that'll<00:02:00.659> just<00:02:00.810> be<00:02:01.049> dust<00:02:02.299> that<00:02:03.299> we<00:02:03.479> can

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
that'll just be dust that we can

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.990 
that'll just be dust that we can
later<00:02:05.210> so<00:02:05.990> this<00:02:06.560> is<00:02:06.770> actually<00:02:07.189> due<00:02:07.310> to<00:02:07.340> dry<00:02:07.700> for

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
later so this is actually due to dry for

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.300 
later so this is actually due to dry for
just<00:02:08.030> a<00:02:08.240> little<00:02:08.360> bit<00:02:08.630> longer<00:02:08.959> and<00:02:09.440> then<00:02:10.190> we'll

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
just a little bit longer and then we'll

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.100 
just a little bit longer and then we'll
be<00:02:10.399> able<00:02:10.429> to<00:02:10.700> take<00:02:10.940> it<00:02:11.120> into<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.510> house<00:02:11.720> and

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
be able to take it into the house and

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.350 
be able to take it into the house and
hang<00:02:12.860> it<00:02:12.980> up<00:02:13.130> after<00:02:13.550> we<00:02:13.640> hang<00:02:13.819> it<00:02:13.849> up<00:02:14.030> we<00:02:14.150> will

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
hang it up after we hang it up we will

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.010 
hang it up after we hang it up we will
need<00:02:14.569> to<00:02:14.780> allow<00:02:15.080> it<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.290> cure<00:02:15.890> for<00:02:16.880> a<00:02:17.300> total<00:02:17.780> of

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
need to allow it to cure for a total of

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.570 
need to allow it to cure for a total of
three<00:02:18.410> to<00:02:18.500> four<00:02:18.650> days<00:02:18.830> before<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.340> kids

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
three to four days before the kids

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.490 
three to four days before the kids
actually<00:02:19.849> use<00:02:20.180> it<00:02:20.330> for<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.690> chalkboard<00:02:21.110> part

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
actually use it for the chalkboard part

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.590 
actually use it for the chalkboard part
but<00:02:21.950> well<00:02:22.489> at<00:02:22.580> least<00:02:22.640> have<00:02:22.940> it<00:02:23.060> up<00:02:23.180> so<00:02:23.450> that

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
but well at least have it up so that

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.440 
but well at least have it up so that
they're<00:02:23.780> not<00:02:23.959> having<00:02:25.000> unfettered<00:02:26.000> access<00:02:26.209> to

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
they're not having unfettered access to

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.570 
they're not having unfettered access to
the<00:02:26.660> kaga<00:02:27.020> which<00:02:27.200> is<00:02:27.650> kind<00:02:28.190> of<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.310> little<00:02:28.459> bit

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
the kaga which is kind of a little bit

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.150 
the kaga which is kind of a little bit
of<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.730> problem<00:02:28.970> right<00:02:29.090> now<00:02:29.270> so<00:02:29.980> one<00:02:30.980> other

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
of a problem right now so one other

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.559 
of a problem right now so one other
thing<00:02:31.430> that<00:02:31.459> I<00:02:31.580> want<00:02:31.850> to<00:02:31.970> point<00:02:32.180> out<00:02:32.330> is<00:02:32.540> that

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
thing that I want to point out is that

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.420 
thing that I want to point out is that
the<00:02:32.810> edges<00:02:33.200> of<00:02:33.350> the<00:02:33.470> door<00:02:33.650> we<00:02:33.920> didn't<00:02:34.190> want<00:02:34.370> to

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
the edges of the door we didn't want to

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.470 
the edges of the door we didn't want to
be<00:02:34.790> a<00:02:35.090> bare<00:02:35.750> wood<00:02:36.190> so<00:02:37.190> we<00:02:37.489> did<00:02:37.640> use<00:02:37.819> a<00:02:37.880> resto

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
be a bare wood so we did use a resto

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.370 
be a bare wood so we did use a resto
liam<00:02:38.840> black<00:02:39.500> primer<00:02:39.980> paint<00:02:40.430> just<00:02:40.670> on<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:41.030> edge

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
liam black primer paint just on the edge

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.289 
liam black primer paint just on the edge
before<00:02:42.380> we<00:02:42.739> did<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.130> blackboard<00:02:43.670> paint<00:02:44.000> and

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
before we did the blackboard paint and

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.390 
before we did the blackboard paint and
this<00:02:44.750> way<00:02:44.959> you<00:02:45.620> know<00:02:45.709> we<00:02:45.799> didn't<00:02:46.040> have<00:02:46.069> to<00:02:46.190> use

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
this way you know we didn't have to use

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.150 
this way you know we didn't have to use
four<00:02:46.730> of<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.299> magnetic<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:48.620> we<00:02:48.739> didn't<00:02:49.010> mean

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
four of the magnetic that we didn't mean

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.340 
four of the magnetic that we didn't mean
because<00:02:49.430> putting<00:02:50.299> magnets<00:02:50.720> on<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.019> inside

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
because putting magnets on the inside

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.110 
because putting magnets on the inside
edge<00:02:51.530> obviously<00:02:52.040> but<00:02:52.580> yet<00:02:52.730> it<00:02:52.850> would<00:02:52.970> match

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
edge obviously but yet it would match

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.380 
edge obviously but yet it would match
the<00:02:53.420> rest<00:02:53.569> of<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.870> door<00:02:53.989> so<00:02:55.239> here<00:02:56.239> we<00:02:56.360> are

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
the rest of the door so here we are

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.840 
the rest of the door so here we are
we've<00:02:56.959> completed<00:02:57.530> our<00:02:57.860> two<00:02:58.220> closet<00:02:58.700> doors

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
we've completed our two closet doors

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.630 
we've completed our two closet doors
what<00:02:59.420> do<00:02:59.480> I<00:02:59.540> think<00:02:59.630> well<00:03:00.590> overall<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:01.130> am<00:03:01.280> very

what do I think well overall I am very
pleased<00:03:02.030> we<00:03:02.390> took<00:03:02.569> two<00:03:02.959> very<00:03:03.530> outdated

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
pleased we took two very outdated

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
functional they serve as a really good

place<00:03:15.320> for<00:03:15.560> them<00:03:15.680> to<00:03:15.859> use<00:03:16.010> their<00:03:16.190> chalk<00:03:16.489> and<00:03:17.000> it

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
place for them to use their chalk and it

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.930 
place for them to use their chalk and it
just<00:03:17.780> makes<00:03:18.109> a<00:03:18.230> very<00:03:18.440> clean<00:03:18.709> look<00:03:18.739> now<00:03:19.430> one

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
just makes a very clean look now one

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.060 
just makes a very clean look now one
thing<00:03:20.090> I<00:03:20.209> did<00:03:20.359> take<00:03:20.630> away<00:03:20.780> is<00:03:21.350> the<00:03:21.680> magnetic

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
thing I did take away is the magnetic

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.740 
thing I did take away is the magnetic
features<00:03:22.609> but<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:22.970> resto<00:03:23.299> liam<00:03:23.480> primer

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
features but the resto liam primer

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.720 
features but the resto liam primer
didn't<00:03:24.470> quite<00:03:24.620> come<00:03:24.799> out<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:25.070> way<00:03:25.160> I<00:03:25.190> hoped<00:03:25.489> it

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
didn't quite come out the way I hoped it

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.009 
didn't quite come out the way I hoped it
would<00:03:25.760> and<00:03:26.090> there<00:03:26.329> are<00:03:26.390> two<00:03:26.570> reasons<00:03:26.900> I<00:03:26.959> think

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
would and there are two reasons I think

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:27.970 
would and there are two reasons I think
that<00:03:27.290> this<00:03:27.440> happened

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
that this happened

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.520 
that this happened
number<00:03:28.459> one<00:03:28.730> we<00:03:29.299> had<00:03:29.510> such<00:03:29.720> a<00:03:29.840> large<00:03:29.989> surface

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
number one we had such a large surface

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.319 
number one we had such a large surface
area<00:03:30.799> that<00:03:31.310> it<00:03:31.400> was<00:03:31.489> really<00:03:31.640> hard<00:03:31.940> to<00:03:32.030> evenly

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
area that it was really hard to evenly

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.270 
area that it was really hard to evenly
distribute<00:03:32.450> those<00:03:33.320> filings<00:03:33.829> that<00:03:33.890> are<00:03:34.070> found

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
distribute those filings that are found

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.490 
distribute those filings that are found
inside<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:34.730> magnetic<00:03:35.030> primer<00:03:35.420> we<00:03:36.109> started

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
inside the magnetic primer we started

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.080 
inside the magnetic primer we started
stirred<00:03:36.739> and<00:03:36.890> stirred<00:03:36.920> and<00:03:37.370> we<00:03:37.459> did<00:03:37.579> exactly

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
stirred and stirred and we did exactly

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.330 
stirred and stirred and we did exactly
as<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.329> directions<00:03:38.600> asked<00:03:39.410> us<00:03:39.530> to<00:03:39.560> but<00:03:40.310> I

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
as the directions asked us to but I

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.560 
as the directions asked us to but I
really<00:03:40.579> think<00:03:40.790> because<00:03:40.850> of<00:03:41.060> a<00:03:41.180> large<00:03:41.420> area

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
really think because of a large area

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.780 
really think because of a large area
like<00:03:41.900> this<00:03:42.079> it's<00:03:42.350> hard<00:03:42.709> to<00:03:42.859> work<00:03:43.010> with<00:03:43.220> we

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
like this it's hard to work with we

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.490 
like this it's hard to work with we
could<00:03:43.970> have<00:03:44.060> benefited<00:03:44.540> from<00:03:44.570> a<00:03:44.810> couple<00:03:45.049> extra

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
could have benefited from a couple extra

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.340 
could have benefited from a couple extra
bottom<00:03:45.829> coats<00:03:46.070> as<00:03:46.370> well<00:03:47.060> as<00:03:47.299> maybe<00:03:47.959> stirring

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
bottom coats as well as maybe stirring

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.050 
bottom coats as well as maybe stirring
and<00:03:48.560> storing<00:03:48.799> and<00:03:48.920> storing<00:03:48.980> a<00:03:49.190> string<00:03:49.430> again<00:03:49.700> a

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
and storing and storing a string again a

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.479 
and storing and storing a string again a
little<00:03:50.359> bit<00:03:50.450> more<00:03:50.600> also<00:03:51.440> anytime<00:03:52.130> you<00:03:52.430> apply

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
little bit more also anytime you apply

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.000 
little bit more also anytime you apply
something<00:03:53.450> over<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:53.959> primer<00:03:54.230> which<00:03:54.680> it<00:03:54.829> says

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
something over the primer which it says

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.000 
something over the primer which it says
you<00:03:55.160> can<00:03:55.430> one<00:03:56.000> to<00:03:56.120> two<00:03:56.269> coats<00:03:56.510> and<00:03:56.840> we<00:03:56.989> did<00:03:57.230> with

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
you can one to two coats and we did with

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.069 
you can one to two coats and we did with
the<00:03:58.130> chalkboard<00:03:58.370> paint<00:03:58.880> you<00:03:59.569> lose<00:03:59.720> some<00:04:00.049> of

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
the chalkboard paint you lose some of

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:01.599 
the chalkboard paint you lose some of
the<00:04:00.230> effectiveness<00:04:00.680> of<00:04:00.950> that<00:04:01.100> magnetic

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
the effectiveness of that magnetic

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.729 
the effectiveness of that magnetic
function<00:04:02.209> so<00:04:02.780> you<00:04:03.109> want<00:04:03.260> to<00:04:03.350> make<00:04:03.440> sure<00:04:03.590> the

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
function so you want to make sure the

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.490 
function so you want to make sure the
coats<00:04:03.950> of<00:04:04.130> the<00:04:04.250> topcoat<00:04:04.670> are<00:04:04.880> very<00:04:05.269> thin<00:04:05.600> use

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
coats of the topcoat are very thin use

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.860 
coats of the topcoat are very thin use
one<00:04:06.889> if<00:04:07.040> you<00:04:07.160> can<00:04:07.370> -<00:04:08.120> you<00:04:08.299> absolutely<00:04:08.450> have<00:04:08.840> to

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
one if you can - you absolutely have to

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.100 
one if you can - you absolutely have to
and<00:04:09.290> we<00:04:09.739> did

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
and we did

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.180 
and we did
Coates<00:04:10.320> and<00:04:10.560> they<00:04:10.680> may<00:04:10.800> have<00:04:10.920> been<00:04:11.010> a<00:04:11.040> bit

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
Coates and they may have been a bit

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.910 
Coates and they may have been a bit
thick<00:04:11.400> which<00:04:12.090> took<00:04:12.630> the<00:04:12.750> magnetic<00:04:13.260> and<00:04:13.530> need

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
thick which took the magnetic and need

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.250 
thick which took the magnetic and need
to<00:04:14.010> even<00:04:14.250> more<00:04:14.490> delete<00:04:14.760> it<00:04:14.910> so<00:04:15.390> we<00:04:15.990> learned<00:04:16.200> a

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
to even more delete it so we learned a

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.990 
to even more delete it so we learned a
couple<00:04:16.290> things<00:04:16.650> from<00:04:16.859> this<00:04:17.070> I<00:04:17.220> would<00:04:17.459> highly

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
couple things from this I would highly

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.160 
couple things from this I would highly
recommend<00:04:18.030> if<00:04:18.540> you're<00:04:18.660> going<00:04:18.810> to<00:04:18.900> use<00:04:19.019> that

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
recommend if you're going to use that

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.259 
recommend if you're going to use that
magnetic<00:04:19.650> primer<00:04:19.890> you<00:04:20.549> start<00:04:20.820> with<00:04:20.940> a<00:04:21.000> small

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
magnetic primer you start with a small

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.300 
magnetic primer you start with a small
area<00:04:21.510> you<00:04:21.840> get<00:04:22.230> an<00:04:22.320> idea<00:04:22.560> of<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:22.740> texture<00:04:23.100> in

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
area you get an idea of the texture in

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.250 
area you get an idea of the texture in
the<00:04:23.340> feel<00:04:23.640> and<00:04:23.880> how<00:04:24.030> it<00:04:24.150> is<00:04:24.270> applied<00:04:24.360> and<00:04:25.050> you

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260
