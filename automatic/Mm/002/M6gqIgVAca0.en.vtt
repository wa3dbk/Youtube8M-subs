 playing in case of incident 2013 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.660
 only when I run it now because 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.150
 because of the program you are using to 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:16.000
 do the monitoring of my screen 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.919
 the game will come out very light even 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.050
 being a quad core device 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:22.419
 The game is very light so it will stay 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:26.340

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:28.810
