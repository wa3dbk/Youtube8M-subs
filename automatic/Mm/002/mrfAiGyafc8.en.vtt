it on the bottom of the tap or the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.209 
it on the bottom of the tap or the
easiest<00:00:36.960> thing<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.230> do<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.380> just<00:00:37.530> use<00:00:37.890> this

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
easiest thing to do is just use this

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.220 
easiest thing to do is just use this
spot<00:00:38.550> right<00:00:38.790> here<00:00:39.000> on<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.540> outside<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.140> your

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
shoe and the idea is almost like you're

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.020 
shoe and the idea is almost like you're
scraping<00:00:43.440> dog<00:00:43.860> poop<00:00:44.190> off<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.610> edge<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.879> your

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
listen yeah other side and they can do

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
sounds like a hammer right now the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.499 
sounds like a hammer right now the
really<00:01:41.250> difficult<00:01:41.490> part<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.090> using<00:01:42.420> the

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
really difficult part is using the

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.020 
really difficult part is using the
outside<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.380> foot<00:01:43.409> again<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.460> key<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.880> to

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
outside of the foot again the key is to

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.139 
outside of the foot again the key is to
plie<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:46.259> there's<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.280> trick<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:47.939> may

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
plie so there's this trick that you may

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.399 
plie so there's this trick that you may
