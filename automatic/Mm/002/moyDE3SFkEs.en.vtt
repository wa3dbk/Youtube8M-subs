 once we have downloaded the application 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:26.230
 we open it 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.599
 and this platform will appear 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.970
 As you can see, it's among popular funds 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.559
 that appears here in the first place but if 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.360
 they do not appear the two go to the tab 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.300

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.820
 several options but the most important 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.250

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.930
