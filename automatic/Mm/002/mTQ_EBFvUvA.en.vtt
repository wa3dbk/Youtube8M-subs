00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:06.808
 Cleanliness 

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:15.794
 Cleanliness is something that I think there are very, very few people who understand what it is and know what it is. 

00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:23.260
 The purpose that Jesus has set for purity, how he has set it. 

00:00:23.644 --> 00:00:26.320
 For example, what he says in Matthew. 

00:00:26.903 --> 00:00:30.155
 That is a high standard, but not an impossible standard. 

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:32.235
 Because that's how he took it. 

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:45.144
 To be clean is much more than to be clean in appearance. The majority of cleanliness has to do with how you take it in your thought life. 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.114
 If your eyes look at a woman to lust after her, you have committed fornication. This is something nobody can see. 

00:00:52.843 --> 00:00:54.708
 It's about your thoughts and your eyes. 

00:00:54.833 --> 00:01:01.539
 But he took it so seriously and that is how he wants his followers, his disciples, to take it. 

00:01:04.852 --> 00:01:13.126
 If you live for your desires, that means what we naturally want as young people. 

00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:22.671
 You leave that in an emptiness and when you look back you can see that your thoughts have been with many different things and many different people. 

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:23.831
 And that is not pure. 

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:25.855
 Rein means clean. 

00:01:25.995 --> 00:01:30.872
 That your heart is completely pure. And that your heart is for God and only for God. 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.351
 How can I keep myself clean? 

00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:38.191
 Where are your thoughts? 

00:01:38.554 --> 00:01:51.340
 You cannot be clean in thought if you use your time to follow, watch or listen with all kinds of things. 

00:01:52.102 --> 00:01:57.570
 Or by being with people where there is no cleanliness. 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.830
 So the first step is to watch how you use your time, 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.340
 for example with the internet and what you watch or listen to. 

00:02:10.338 --> 00:02:15.430
 Is it clean? Does it help me? Do I follow the example set by Jesus? 

00:02:16.797 --> 00:02:19.360
 But I'm still being asked -? 

00:02:19.673 --> 00:02:24.350
 A thought in itself, for example when an unclean thought comes up, 

00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:27.800
 That does not mean that you have sinned. 

00:02:27.973 --> 00:02:32.590
 That comes as a temptation, that first thought. But the question is: what do I do with that thought? 

00:02:32.592 --> 00:02:38.720
 If that unclean thought leads to another unclean thought, if those thoughts go on, then it is uncleanness. 

00:02:38.873 --> 00:02:42.310
 But it is very normal for you as a young person to be requested. 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.320
 You are invited to desire youth and there are many thoughts that arise for the first time. 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:53.980
 But to be aware, to be aware that when that thought comes and it is not pure. 

00:02:54.083 --> 00:02:59.430
 What should I do? Then I stop thinking that thought. 

00:02:59.915 --> 00:03:04.760
 I remember that as a young person I felt that I was being asked non-stop, 

00:03:04.763 --> 00:03:07.810
 Thought after thought, after thought, after thought. 

00:03:08.374 --> 00:03:15.240
 But if you are faithful thought after thought, that is cleanliness! 

00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:20.680
 Then it is very important to know that I have decided to serve God with all my heart and mind. 

00:03:20.682 --> 00:03:30.370
 Then temptations come, but not to listen to Satan, who wants me to believe that I have sinned and that it is not possible for me. 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.650
 What is the result of your pure storage? 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.920
 It says: those who believe go to rest. 

00:03:37.917 --> 00:03:40.070
 And then you can say? What is rest? Rest is rest, 

00:03:40.068 --> 00:03:51.020
 Rest means that the things that you were previously asked for - it felt like you were constantly being asked, 

00:03:52.118 --> 00:03:55.160
 you will get peace there now. 

00:03:55.157 --> 00:04:03.240
 I have experienced it myself. That it brings real joy to choose to live a pure life. 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:11.630
 And for myself I can say, choosing cleanliness is the greatest thing you can do for yourself. 

00:04:11.632 --> 00:04:20.380
 It is not at all that it is difficult and it is slavery. You save yourself so much. 

00:04:20.666 --> 00:04:28.430
 You make it so much easier for yourself and for your future.
