pistols attached to this buckle but
there's<00:03:50.340> no<00:03:50.489> way<00:03:50.519> of<00:03:50.790> doing<00:03:51.030> that<00:03:51.120> in<00:03:51.269> Lego<00:03:51.540> so

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
there's no way of doing that in Lego so

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.170 
there's no way of doing that in Lego so
we<00:03:51.870> also<00:03:52.049> have<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.560> sort<00:03:53.340> connected<00:03:53.940> to<00:03:54.030> each

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
we also have to sort connected to each

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.300 
we also have to sort connected to each
side<00:03:54.540> here<00:03:55.280> you<00:03:56.280> know<00:03:57.650> the<00:03:58.650> belt<00:03:58.890> it<00:03:59.159> has<00:03:59.280> a

buckle cross here which I drew on added

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.360 
buckle cross here which I drew on added
some<00:04:05.030> details<00:04:06.030> to<00:04:06.450> the<00:04:06.599> belt<00:04:06.810> to<00:04:07.170> make<00:04:07.620> sure

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
some details to the belt to make sure

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.520 
some details to the belt to make sure
that<00:04:08.750> it<00:04:09.750> is<00:04:10.290> in<00:04:10.410> fact<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.709> belt<00:04:11.090> this<00:04:12.090> is<00:04:12.530> our

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
that it is in fact the belt this is our

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.289 
that it is in fact the belt this is our
goals<00:04:13.829> and<00:04:14.160> shoulder<00:04:14.549> pieces<00:04:14.790> and<00:04:17.269> same<00:04:18.269> thing

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
goals and shoulder pieces and same thing

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.500 
goals and shoulder pieces and same thing
goes<00:04:18.570> to<00:04:18.690> the<00:04:18.780> back<00:04:18.930> that<00:04:18.959> I<00:04:19.349> actually<00:04:19.590> painted

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
goes to the back that I actually painted

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.330 
goes to the back that I actually painted
two<00:04:21.510> flintlock<00:04:21.989> pistols<00:04:22.440> on<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.830> back<00:04:22.950> I

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
two flintlock pistols on the back I

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.300 
two flintlock pistols on the back I
think<00:04:23.729> he<00:04:23.849> should<00:04:24.090> have<00:04:24.300> his<00:04:24.990> flintlock

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
think he should have his flintlock

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.820 
think he should have his flintlock
pistols<00:04:26.840> you<00:04:27.840> don't<00:04:28.080> show<00:04:28.289> where<00:04:28.470> well<00:04:28.650> but

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
pistols you don't show where well but

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.240 
pistols you don't show where well but
there's<00:04:29.010> some<00:04:29.130> great<00:04:29.280> details<00:04:29.729> ended<00:04:30.510> in<00:04:30.840> here

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
there's some great details ended in here

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.680 
there's some great details ended in here
to<00:04:32.250> just<00:04:32.820> show<00:04:33.150> that<00:04:33.180> they<00:04:33.479> are<00:04:33.510> pistols<00:04:35.690> and

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
to just show that they are pistols and

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.150 
to just show that they are pistols and
his<00:04:37.139> coat<00:04:37.910> it's<00:04:38.910> blue<00:04:39.300> and<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:40.470> white<00:04:40.500> and<00:04:41.039> I

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
his coat it's blue and the white and I

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.219 
his coat it's blue and the white and I
think<00:04:41.810> what<00:04:42.810> made<00:04:43.080> this<00:04:44.750> stand<00:04:45.750> out<00:04:45.930> is<00:04:46.169> the

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
think what made this stand out is the

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:48.710 
think what made this stand out is the
outlining<00:04:46.949> everything<00:04:47.580> is<00:04:47.940> better<00:04:48.330> when<00:04:48.599> you

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
outlining everything is better when you

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.379 
outlining everything is better when you
outline<00:04:49.110> it<00:04:49.260> so<00:04:49.380> I<00:04:49.410> outlined<00:04:50.010> it<00:04:50.190> in<00:04:50.430> black<00:04:50.940> as

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
outline it so I outlined it in black as

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:56.330 
outline it so I outlined it in black as
you<00:04:51.539> can<00:04:51.660> see<00:04:51.900> here<00:04:52.169> to<00:04:52.770> make<00:04:52.949> the<00:04:53.419> you<00:04:54.419> know<00:04:55.340> to

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
you can see here to make the you know to

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.740 
you can see here to make the you know to
separate<00:04:56.820> the<00:04:56.970> blue<00:04:57.150> from<00:04:57.449> the<00:04:57.599> white

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
separate the blue from the white

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.350 
separate the blue from the white
