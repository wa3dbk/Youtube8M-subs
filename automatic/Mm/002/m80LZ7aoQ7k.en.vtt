00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:05.850
 Well now I 'm going to teach you how 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.830
 Freezing fruit at the time is fine 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.840
 simple and we like strawberries 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.140
 it seems to me that these people find 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.250
 in a dollar so well a super average 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.870
 expression because it is usually 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.160
 also faces so let's freeze 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.679
 strawberries and bananas 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.660
 The first thing I'm going to do is obvious 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:25.289
 rinse all the strawberries that I'm going to 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.529
 need to be clean and 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.409
 Ready to use, I'll use them to 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:34.800
 smoothies and all that so grains 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:38.610
 I teach look here also freeze some 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.040
 spinach that I did now is added a 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.260
 little bit of water with the bati in the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.350
 blender and put them in ice cubes 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.059
 to freeze and that's how they look like 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.640
 that is already ready for smoothies or 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.589
 for the broths and all that because I no longer 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.770
 has made a cube of spinach and more 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:57.440
 healthy a little bit more 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.840
 so here is my little boy 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.530
 wanting to steal prey and bananas and 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.460
 all because he loves it so I'm going 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.560
 to rinse all this and here I have the 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.210
 the strawberries all rinsed now what 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.680
 only thing we have to do is take it 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.970
 the corner to the leaves these and not 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.350
 I find myself 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.720
 triple so I have to do everything 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.520
 with one hand which is difficult to have 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.020
 Take care of my love or that you have to leave 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:29.030
 I dabble so I left them almost him 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.030
 I cut that yellowish subtract and cut it 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.340
 ends half and now I'm just going to 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.850
 put on a piece of paper around here 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.270
 on a napkin or on a towel 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.280
 fabric to let them dry that 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.880
 they are very well dried so that they do not 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:50.140
 are going to stick when it freezes and 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.140
 Well, let's get them out 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.909
 and from there and now we can bag like 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.590
 will see I put them in small and plus and 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.909
 from there I'm going to put them in these bags 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:04.420
 bigger and this is for and this is 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:08.780
 to put them like that so I do not know 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.550
 not many and make us ugly so 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.400
 Now what I'm going to do is freeze the 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.680
 bananas here already remove the peel and 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.390
 I have a little bit of orange juice 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.180
 here and these only for the 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.250
 bananas do not turn black they do not go out 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.100
 ugly that works a lot can use 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.900
 lemon too but I did not want it 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.230
 they were so acidic so the 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.660
 I put in orange and they grab a little taste 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.160
 very rich the truth now the only thing that 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.680
 I have to do is cut them in 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.840
 little slices to throw them here are already in 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.989
 the juice and then I'll put them in the 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.500
 little bag so then let's put all 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.630
 the bags and 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.610
 as you will see he says them that thick and 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.790
 now your posts for the smoothies that 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:55.030
 Gerardito likes we make him smoothie 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.650
 of fruit and everything and that's what it looks like 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.150
 that's how it drinks milk because the truth 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.330
 almost does not like it and that's how 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.830
 we make and we take special now 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.620
 what we have to do is bag 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.620
 everything and leave I do it here quickie 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.390
 so here are my bags with 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.990
 the bananas I divided them into small 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:20.290
 amounts I have so let's put it 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.360
 quickie to the freezer look at that cute 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.880
 chick that I bought in the store of a 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.150
 only price and nothing else here are 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.580
 all things I have several things here 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.930
 so then I'm going to keep freezing 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.450
 cutting and freezing 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.299
 and I also put bread and I have chicken and 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.689
 He also froze tortillas to the snow that 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.939
 I buy my husband and this helps save 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:48.260
 a lot of money and they also throw us 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:50.060
 losing things is a very very good guy 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.730
 and there are several little things that can 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.810
 save you are to frozen strawberries 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.849
 they get very expensive so that was a one to one 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.590
 great savings not having to be 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:03.620
 buying because we buy from 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.870
 those now and nothing else I need the 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.450
 blueberries but these are also 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.109
 caritas so that's how we have them 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.109
 buy well 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.150
 So that's it, I hope that 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.110
