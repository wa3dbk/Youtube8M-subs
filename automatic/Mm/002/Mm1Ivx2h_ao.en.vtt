00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.008
 -This Carpathian Express! Welcome! 

00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:07.170
 Get to know an internationally renowned researcher at the beginning of our show 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.358
 Prof. Dr. Dávid Tamás, born in Budapest 

00:00:10.358 --> 00:00:13.677
 who has been engaged in cancer research for over 20 years. 

00:00:13.677 --> 00:00:18.707
 One result of this is the tropical tea blend whose beneficial physiological effects have already been proven. 

00:00:18.707 --> 00:00:23.196
 So far, he has helped 11 types of cancer in healing patients. 

00:00:23.196 --> 00:00:29.778
 The tea, which was registered as a nutritional supplement in Austria, is divided into medical opinions. 

00:00:30.444 --> 00:00:35.359
 - Believe, love, understand, help. 

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:39.554
 Professor Tamás Dávid quoted his own book from the aftermath. 

00:00:39.554 --> 00:00:43.354
 He admits this as a researcher, and has been educated in his childhood. 

00:00:43.354 --> 00:00:49.194
 -I always loved my grandfather on his knees and said he should never forget my baby, 

00:00:49.194 --> 00:00:52.638
 to try to help people every day! 

00:00:52.638 --> 00:00:56.598
 It has remained in me for many many decades, 

00:00:56.598 --> 00:01:02.040
 my dad was a gynecologist and I remember it, especially in those days 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.728
 that, from the 40s to 50s, we all went a lot 

00:01:06.728 --> 00:01:10.390
 to a home master on Saturday night, did not ask my father for anything, 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.727
 but he was only happy to help. 

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:20.457
 -Dávid Tamás was born in Budapest. After the birth of his parents, he lived alone at the age of 14. 

00:01:20.457 --> 00:01:25.397
 He studied, sports. He worked in Újpest and was a Hungarian champion several times. 

00:01:25.397 --> 00:01:31.189
 In 1962, he won the European Championship title in a category without weight. 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:37.031
 Meanwhile, he graduated from the Szent István University with a cum cum laude qualification. 

00:01:37.031 --> 00:01:42.955
 Then he left Hungary in the year of the 1964 summer ring games. 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:50.318
 -I didn't want to be 3/3, I left it, I was more honorable 

00:01:50.353 --> 00:01:55.380
 I had no trouble, I was a teaching assistant, I was a celebrated athlete 

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:56.820
 I had everything. 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.420
 But I'm sure I'm not gonna tell my friends for money and position! 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.917
 And that's why I had to leave my country! 

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:11.806
 -He started a new life in Vienna. In 1969, head of a group of scientists 

00:02:11.806 --> 00:02:16.582
 he started looking for new operating possibilities for juvenile hip fits. 

00:02:16.582 --> 00:02:19.925
 This procedure later became a world patent. 

00:02:19.925 --> 00:02:25.022
 -And so much so to say that it was common to invite us to South America 

00:02:25.022 --> 00:02:30.994
 to show you this surgery, and we operated brazilian girls and boys there 

00:02:30.994 --> 00:02:39.743
 including an Indian boy whose grandfather was the grandson of world-renowned Janomamian Indians. 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:47.056
 the grandfather was the chief pharmacist of these Indians. 

00:02:47.056 --> 00:02:55.694
 And it was called Katun, and he then gave us different plants wrapped in newsprint, 

00:02:55.694 --> 00:02:58.964
 bark, leaves, roots. 

00:02:58.964 --> 00:03:05.269
 -The Brazilian doctors called the attention of the scientists at the time when the plants were still unknown. 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.212
 The high average age of Indians consuming the potion daily also seemed interesting. 

00:03:10.212 --> 00:03:16.056
 -I always ask what kind of viewers or students think about this picture 

00:03:16.056 --> 00:03:19.168
 how old is Katunka? 

00:03:19.168 --> 00:03:22.212
 Well, it doesn't look like he's 95 years old. 

00:03:22.212 --> 00:03:26.951
 And when the old warrior saw his granddaughter recover from surgery, 

00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:28.757
 of course he didn't think of a word for him. 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.097
 Then he was very pleased and then handed over these plants. 

00:03:34.097 --> 00:03:39.535
 And then we pulled it out so it was the ingredients of a tea. 

00:03:39.535 --> 00:03:43.757
 And how to do it and what a great effect it has. 

00:03:43.757 --> 00:03:48.972
 Well, we thought we would take it and put together a tea in Vienna. 

00:03:49.007 --> 00:03:55.139
 And then we had a cancer cell culture laboratory, we thought we'd look at bone cancer, 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:04.869
 whereas one of the main columns of my research group at that time was Prof. Dr. Reiner Kotz, a world-famous bone cancer surgeon in Vienna 

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:07.015
 then let's look at bone cancer. 

00:04:07.015 --> 00:04:12.170
 And in the first 24 hours 90% of the bone cancer cells are dead. 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.892
 Of course this was a great spiritual joy for us 

00:04:17.892 --> 00:04:24.919
 and we ordered all the most aggressive cancer cell lines available, 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.838
 we looked at it in a row and the results were excellent, 

00:04:28.838 --> 00:04:34.921
 so it is now being specifically targeted against 11 types of cancer. 

00:04:34.921 --> 00:04:40.047
 -David Tamás Professor has launched 20 expeditions in South America, 

00:04:40.047 --> 00:04:43.013
 then to Thailand, Japan and Vietnam. 

00:04:43.013 --> 00:04:47.853
 He has been working for decades to prove the physiological effects of tea. 

00:04:47.853 --> 00:04:51.899
 - It's not a panacea that heals someone from tomorrow, 

00:04:51.899 --> 00:05:00.340
 it takes at least 14 weeks for the patient to have a very weakened immune system 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.115
 95% rise, activate. 

00:05:05.115 --> 00:05:15.352
 Activate and the number of so-called dendritic and natural killer cells will increase to 80-90%. 

00:05:15.352 --> 00:05:19.329
 This is extremely important, it is a key element in the fight against cancer, 

00:05:19.329 --> 00:05:23.804
 our self-healing powers, our immune system is the only force 

00:05:23.804 --> 00:05:28.951
 which can destroy cancer cells without side effects. 

00:05:28.951 --> 00:05:34.796
 - It also turned out that tea multiplies the effect of chemotherapy on cancer cell killing, 

00:05:34.796 --> 00:05:39.923
 later research has shown that Hepatitis C, the influenza A virus, 

00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:43.651
 and bitter decoction is also effective against Alzheimer's disease. 

00:05:43.651 --> 00:05:49.899
 Consumption increases with so-called coenzyme-q10 enzymes, antioxidants, 

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:53.941
 as well as the concentration of selenium and iron in the body. 

00:05:54.189 --> 00:06:00.161
 -It's not just a tropical tea blend, it's a vitamin antioxidant preparation, 

00:06:00.161 --> 00:06:03.720
 which is now very low due to our diet 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.786
 in plants, vegetables, fruits much less vitamin, mineral, etc. it is 

00:06:08.786 --> 00:06:14.602
 This needs to be replaced! He came for example recognition of several Nobel Prize winners 

00:06:14.602 --> 00:06:17.783
 and have been used worldwide for 30 years now, 

00:06:17.783 --> 00:06:22.326
 dosing of oral and intravenous mega-glucose C-vitamin. 

00:06:22.326 --> 00:06:27.923
 It is also a condition of healing to change the patient's lifestyle if necessary. 

00:06:27.923 --> 00:06:32.623
 - Symptomatic treatment has not led to long-term results. 

00:06:32.623 --> 00:06:36.459
 This is what we see in hospitals, clinics and clinics. 

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:40.485
 The tumor is removed, but the patient is not healthy yet! 

00:06:40.485 --> 00:06:42.288
 The reasons remain. 

00:06:42.288 --> 00:06:45.018
 So everyone should think about it 

00:06:45.018 --> 00:06:49.116
 What were the causes of his life in the last 10-15 years? 

00:06:49.116 --> 00:06:53.583
 Smoking, alcohol, malnutrition, spiritual conflicts 

00:06:53.583 --> 00:07:01.617
 As Sigmund Freud said, about 30% of the psychic conflicts are responsible for cancer. 

00:07:01.617 --> 00:07:05.699
 Because the immune system is brought to the floor, it is ruined and weakened. 

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:11.513
 And as we got told, there are millions of amalgam teeth in Hungary. 

00:07:11.513 --> 00:07:18.278
 Professor Tamás Dávid's scientific work in 1994 with the Cross of the Austrian Order of Honor, 

00:07:18.278 --> 00:07:22.519
 In 2003, he was recognized with an international peace prize. 

00:07:22.519 --> 00:07:24.773
 The researcher has new plans. 

00:07:24.773 --> 00:07:32.479
 - Clinical treatment, surgery, chemo, ray, hormone, gene therapy, and nature medicine 

00:07:32.514 --> 00:07:41.792
 the goal of the wise individualized combination of procedures that have been used for millennia. 

00:07:41.792 --> 00:07:45.116
 But I think it's still a vision. 

00:07:45.116 --> 00:07:49.649
 In our home, most doctors don't recognize the professor's work. 

00:07:49.649 --> 00:07:55.014
 But he thought he had helped 9,000 Hungarians in healing in 15 years, 

00:07:55.014 --> 00:07:59.123
 it is worth more than anything. A result that points to the future.
