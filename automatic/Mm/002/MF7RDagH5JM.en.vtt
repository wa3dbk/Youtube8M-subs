00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.449 
once i fixed the g500 are my g5 i'll do
a<00:02:21.550> comparison<00:02:22.550> video<00:02:22.940> with<00:02:23.750> other<00:02:24.220> mice<00:02:25.220> that

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
a comparison video with other mice that

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.520 
a comparison video with other mice that
i<00:02:25.489> have<00:02:25.700> i<00:02:25.880> have<00:02:26.150> that<00:02:26.510> one<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:26.959> i<00:02:27.019> also<00:02:27.230> have<00:02:27.470> a

i have i have that one and i also have a
death<00:02:27.709> adder<00:02:27.950> but<00:02:28.459> that<00:02:28.610> one's<00:02:28.790> not<00:02:28.880> really

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
death adder but that one's not really

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.550 
death adder but that one's not really
working<00:02:29.330> i'll<00:02:29.690> just<00:02:29.989> do<00:02:30.080> like<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:30.290> size

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
working i'll just do like a size

working i'll just do like a size
comparison<00:02:30.769> and<00:02:31.580> comforts<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:32.510> stuff<00:02:32.720> like

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
comparison and comforts and stuff like

that later and then so take the mouse
with<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:15.739> core<00:03:16.040> is<00:03:16.630> there<00:03:17.630> you<00:03:17.690> go<00:03:17.840> there's

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
with the core is there you go there's

the mossen the cartilage and then you

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.240 
the mossen the cartilage and then you
have<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.280> little<00:03:25.489> weighing<00:03:26.799> that<00:03:27.799> holds<00:03:28.160> the

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
have the little weighing that holds the

have the little weighing that holds the
weight<00:03:28.400> the<00:03:28.640> tray<00:03:30.280> ok<00:03:31.280> so<00:03:31.340> that's<00:03:31.700> basically

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
weight the tray ok so that's basically

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.660 
weight the tray ok so that's basically
everything<00:03:32.660> let<00:03:33.470> me<00:03:33.590> do<00:03:33.739> like<00:03:33.920> a<00:03:33.950> zoom<00:03:34.280> in<00:03:34.489> on

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
everything let me do like a zoom in on

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
it definitely looks a lot like the g5 it

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.580 
it definitely looks a lot like the g5 it
dies<00:03:51.859> in<00:03:52.220> a<00:03:52.310> way<00:03:52.660> it<00:03:53.660> looks<00:03:53.840> a<00:03:53.959> lot<00:03:54.109> like<00:03:54.290> it

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
dies in a way it looks a lot like it

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.960 
dies in a way it looks a lot like it
also<00:03:55.430> looks<00:03:55.670> a<00:03:55.790> lot<00:03:55.940> a<00:03:56.150> little<00:03:56.540> bit<00:03:56.660> like<00:03:56.840> the

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
also looks a lot a little bit like the

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.330 
also looks a lot a little bit like the
mx518<00:03:58.970> but<00:03:59.750> I<00:03:59.989> say<00:04:00.230> it<00:04:00.350> looks<00:04:00.530> a<00:04:00.650> lot<00:04:00.889> more<00:04:00.950> like

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
mx518 but I say it looks a lot more like

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.449 
mx518 but I say it looks a lot more like
the<00:04:01.489> g5<00:04:02.060> they<00:04:02.989> really<00:04:03.200> do<00:04:03.530> look<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:03.950> same<00:04:04.160> and

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
the g5 they really do look the same and

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.390 
the g5 they really do look the same and
then<00:04:05.060> you<00:04:05.180> have<00:04:05.329> the<00:04:05.799> free<00:04:06.799> scrolling<00:04:07.280> right

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
then you have the free scrolling right

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.599 
then you have the free scrolling right
here<00:04:07.609> I<00:04:08.920> hopefully<00:04:09.920> you<00:04:10.010> guys<00:04:10.100> can<00:04:10.160> hear<00:04:10.400> that

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
doesn't want the weights and this is

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.339 
doesn't want the weights and this is
also<00:05:07.539> the<00:05:07.689> Teflon<00:05:08.520> feet<00:05:09.520> right<00:05:09.759> here<00:05:10.169> I'm<00:05:11.169> not

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:11.349 
also the Teflon feet right here I'm not

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:14.279 
also the Teflon feet right here I'm not
sure<00:05:11.560> if<00:05:11.919> it's<00:05:12.039> the<00:05:12.250> same<00:05:12.279> as<00:05:12.669> the<00:05:12.789> g5<00:05:13.180> but<00:05:13.960> the

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
sure if it's the same as the g5 but the

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:16.709 
sure if it's the same as the g5 but the
screws<00:05:14.710> would<00:05:15.129> probably<00:05:15.610> be<00:05:15.729> under<00:05:16.539> these

00:05:16.709 --> 00:05:16.719 
screws would probably be under these

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:21.230 
screws would probably be under these
right<00:05:17.139> here<00:05:18.000> and<00:05:19.000> i<00:05:19.150> also<00:05:19.330> do<00:05:19.629> like<00:05:19.810> a<00:05:20.139> video<00:05:20.439> of

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
right here and i also do like a video of

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.670 
right here and i also do like a video of
disassembling<00:05:22.240> the<00:05:22.389> g5<00:05:22.719> because<00:05:23.439> i<00:05:23.560> had<00:05:23.650> a

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
disassembling the g5 because i had a

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.649 
disassembling the g5 because i had a
disassembled<00:05:24.279> and<00:05:24.400> I<00:05:24.699> temporarily<00:05:25.060> fixed<00:05:25.539> it

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:25.659 
disassembled and I temporarily fixed it

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:30.480 
disassembled and I temporarily fixed it
but<00:05:26.229> then<00:05:26.789> yeah<00:05:27.789> I'll<00:05:28.979> I'll<00:05:29.979> give<00:05:30.159> I'll<00:05:30.339> show

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
but then yeah I'll I'll give I'll show

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.459 
but then yeah I'll I'll give I'll show
that<00:05:30.550> to<00:05:30.729> you<00:05:30.909> guys<00:05:30.969> later<00:05:31.210> so<00:05:31.900> this<00:05:32.199> is<00:05:32.349> the

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:32.469 
that to you guys later so this is the

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:35.339 
that to you guys later so this is the
Court<00:05:32.770> itself<00:05:33.330> looks<00:05:34.330> a<00:05:34.479> lot<00:05:34.719> more<00:05:34.779> sturdy

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:35.349 
Court itself looks a lot more sturdy

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:38.249 
Court itself looks a lot more sturdy
it's<00:05:35.740> definitely<00:05:36.159> a<00:05:36.490> lot<00:05:36.759> better<00:05:37.060> than<00:05:37.689> the<00:05:37.839> g5

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:38.259 
it's definitely a lot better than the g5

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:40.769 
it's definitely a lot better than the g5
and<00:05:38.529> quality<00:05:38.919> wise<00:05:39.099> because<00:05:39.849> before<00:05:40.389> I<00:05:40.689> know

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:40.779 
and quality wise because before I know

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:43.050 
and quality wise because before I know
it's<00:05:41.020> braided<00:05:41.500> but<00:05:42.039> then<00:05:42.279> this<00:05:42.430> braid<00:05:42.789> was

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
it's braided but then this braid was

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.929 
it's braided but then this braid was
really<00:05:43.389> weak<00:05:43.659> and<00:05:44.219> it<00:05:45.219> was<00:05:45.370> just<00:05:45.610> breaking

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:45.939 
really weak and it was just breaking

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:48.749 
really weak and it was just breaking
through<00:05:46.479> so<00:05:47.139> you'll<00:05:47.409> be<00:05:47.589> going<00:05:47.740> into<00:05:48.039> the<00:05:48.399> cord

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:48.759 
through so you'll be going into the cord

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:50.879 
through so you'll be going into the cord
and<00:05:49.029> you'll<00:05:49.569> actually<00:05:49.779> see<00:05:50.139> the<00:05:50.259> wiring<00:05:50.770> and

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889 
and you'll actually see the wiring and

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:53.249 
and you'll actually see the wiring and
that<00:05:51.370> was<00:05:51.490> going<00:05:51.639> to<00:05:51.699> screw<00:05:52.089> it<00:05:52.210> up<00:05:52.330> and<00:05:52.569> a<00:05:53.110> lot

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:53.259 
that was going to screw it up and a lot

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:54.719 
that was going to screw it up and a lot
of<00:05:53.319> problem<00:05:53.649> with<00:05:53.710> the<00:05:53.830> chief<00:05:54.009> I<00:05:54.159> was<00:05:54.430> this

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:54.729 
of problem with the chief I was this

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:57.689 
of problem with the chief I was this
wiring<00:05:55.180> right<00:05:55.599> here<00:05:55.960> it<00:05:56.500> would<00:05:57.039> be<00:05:57.219> exposed

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:57.699 
wiring right here it would be exposed

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:01.079 
wiring right here it would be exposed
and<00:05:58.180> whenever<00:05:59.139> you<00:05:59.529> move<00:05:59.710> the<00:05:59.919> mouse<00:06:00.159> the

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:01.089 
and whenever you move the mouse the
