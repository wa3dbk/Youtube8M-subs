00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
at this point and I already have a

connected<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.530> tap<00:01:04.160> initially<00:01:05.160> I<00:01:05.190> had<00:01:05.460> a

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:05.490 
connected to the tap initially I had a

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.640 
connected to the tap initially I had a
problem<00:01:05.880> with<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.300> bit<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.720> leak<00:01:06.960> gauge<00:01:07.200> but

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
problem with a bit of a leak gauge but

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.440 
problem with a bit of a leak gauge but
for<00:01:07.830> some<00:01:07.980> reason<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.430> kind<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.640> just<00:01:09.180> stops

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
for some reason it kind of just stops

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.200 
for some reason it kind of just stops
like<00:01:09.690> that<00:01:09.900> on<00:01:10.080> its<00:01:10.230> own<00:01:10.370> so<00:01:11.370> which<00:01:11.910> is<00:01:12.000> pretty

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
like that on its own so which is pretty

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.720 
like that on its own so which is pretty
good<00:01:12.450> anyway<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.730> I<00:01:14.730> have<00:01:14.910> that<00:01:15.120> connected<00:01:15.960> to

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.730 
good anyway and I have that connected to

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
good anyway and I have that connected to
the<00:01:17.730> washer<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:19.760> then<00:01:20.760> of<00:01:20.910> course<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.270> have<00:01:21.480> the
