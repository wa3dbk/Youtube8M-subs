00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
because this thing is ugly and that's

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.680 
because this thing is ugly and that's
really<00:05:02.340> a<00:05:02.430> disservice<00:05:02.850> to<00:05:03.030> the<00:05:03.210> word<00:05:03.360> ugly

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
really a disservice to the word ugly

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.510 
really a disservice to the word ugly
when<00:05:04.320> you<00:05:04.410> look<00:05:04.560> at<00:05:04.680> the<00:05:04.770> car<00:05:04.980> the<00:05:05.220> first<00:05:05.340> thing

that<00:05:05.640> comes<00:05:05.760> into<00:05:05.850> mind<00:05:06.060> a<00:05:06.150> lot<00:05:06.300> of<00:05:06.450> people<00:05:06.570> is

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
that comes into mind a lot of people is

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.930 
that comes into mind a lot of people is
that<00:05:07.110> it's<00:05:07.410> like<00:05:07.620> a<00:05:07.650> cross<00:05:07.860> between<00:05:07.980> a<00:05:08.550> sick

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
that it's like a cross between a sick

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.870 
that it's like a cross between a sick
grouper<00:05:09.450> and<00:05:09.600> a<00:05:10.380> pig<00:05:10.740> now<00:05:11.550> one<00:05:11.730> of<00:05:11.760> the

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
grouper and a pig now one of the

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.730 
grouper and a pig now one of the
advantages<00:05:12.180> to<00:05:12.570> the<00:05:12.660> rodius<00:05:13.020> is<00:05:13.230> that<00:05:13.500> they

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
advantages to the rodius is that they

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.710 
advantages to the rodius is that they
didn't<00:05:14.100> build<00:05:14.190> very<00:05:14.460> many<00:05:14.640> of<00:05:14.820> them<00:05:14.970> and<00:05:15.120> most

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
didn't build very many of them and most

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.990 
didn't build very many of them and most
importantly<00:05:16.169> it's<00:05:16.620> now<00:05:16.890> thankfully<00:05:17.610> out<00:05:17.880> of

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000
