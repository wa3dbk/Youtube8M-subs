00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:19.029

 We have strived for many years to enter into operational excellence 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.410
 for example in terms of arrivals on time we have a record 91 percent 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.379
 when comparatively against the industry average against america 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.280

 they cross 20 meters and in 35 40 minutes they board another plane 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.900
 that will take us to Lima for example 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.479
 but the operations center historically has been here 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.299
