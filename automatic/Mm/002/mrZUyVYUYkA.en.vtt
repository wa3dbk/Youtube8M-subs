does one channel work and the other one
not<00:00:09.030> well<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.200> problem<00:00:10.559> could<00:00:10.769> be<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:11.099> plug

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
not well the problem could be the plug

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.400 
not well the problem could be the plug
that<00:00:11.670> goes<00:00:11.849> into<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.330> jack<00:00:12.599> of<00:00:12.840> your<00:00:13.139> playing

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.680 
that goes into the jack of your playing
device<00:00:13.799> like<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.370> iPod<00:00:14.790> or<00:00:15.030> what<00:00:15.150> have<00:00:15.330> you

now this happened with my daughter's
headphones<00:00:18.270> several<00:00:19.170> times<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.740> I<00:00:20.039> fixed

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
headphones several times and I fixed

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.429 
headphones several times and I fixed
them<00:00:20.460> each<00:00:20.609> time<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.210> now<00:00:21.779> I've<00:00:21.900> decided<00:00:22.230> to

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
is the final assembly after you've

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.910 
is the final assembly after you've
repaired<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.329> headphone<00:00:54.329> plug<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.020> what

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
repaired the headphone plug and what

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.000 
repaired the headphone plug and what
I've<00:00:56.039> used<00:00:56.340> here<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:57.079> metal<00:00:58.079> plug<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:58.620> made

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
I've used here is a metal plug it's made

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.740 
I've used here is a metal plug it's made
out<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.190> brass<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.390> also<00:01:00.570> has<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:02.120> wire<00:01:03.120> coil

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
out of brass and it also has a wire coil

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.469 
out of brass and it also has a wire coil
on<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.110> top<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.650> that's<00:01:05.100> there<00:01:05.489> really<00:01:05.790> to

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
on the top and that's there really to

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.530 
on the top and that's there really to
prevent<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.290> stress<00:01:07.860> on<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.729> wire<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.390> it

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
prevent the stress on the wire so it

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.300 
prevent the stress on the wire so it
doesn't<00:01:09.840> break<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.260> frequently<00:01:10.740> after<00:01:11.040> you've

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
doesn't break so frequently after you've

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.399 
doesn't break so frequently after you've
repaired<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.720> course<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.110> metal

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
repaired it and of course the metal

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.770 
repaired it and of course the metal
housing<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:14.010> course<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:15.150> makes<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.600> more

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
housing of course that to makes it more

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.380 
housing of course that to makes it more
durable<00:01:16.080> but<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.640> kind<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.119> plug

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
durable but this is the kind of plug

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.420 
durable but this is the kind of plug
that<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.750> want<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.110> get<00:01:19.290> before<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.860> repair

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
that you want to get before you repair

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.640 
that you want to get before you repair
your<00:01:20.460> headphones<00:01:21.119> if<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.840> get<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.200> kind<00:01:22.439> that

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.570 
have the the plastic housing they
generally<00:01:25.619> don't<00:01:25.740> work<00:01:26.009> as<00:01:26.189> well<00:01:26.400> because

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
generally don't work as well because

together<00:01:56.219> but<00:01:56.969> in<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.180> first<00:01:57.420> place<00:01:57.719> this

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
together but in the first place this

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.170 
together but in the first place this
shows<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.579> assembly<00:01:59.579> so<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.850> speak<00:02:00.149> that

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
shows the assembly so to speak that

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
shows the assembly so to speak that
you're<00:02:00.479> going<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.840> put<00:02:01.020> on<00:02:01.140> your<00:02:01.409> head

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
you're going to put on your head

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.209 
you're going to put on your head
phones<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.960> first<00:02:05.200> thing<00:02:05.380> you<00:02:05.439> have<00:02:05.560> to<00:02:05.619> do<00:02:05.920> is

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
phones the first thing you have to do is

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:08.699 
phones the first thing you have to do is
put<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:06.939> stress<00:02:07.210> relieving<00:02:07.630> wire<00:02:08.019> into<00:02:08.590> the

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
put the stress relieving wire into the

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.009 
put the stress relieving wire into the
housing<00:02:09.190> and<00:02:09.369> then<00:02:09.789> pull<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.330> wire<00:02:10.569> through

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
housing and then pull the wire through

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:12.780 
housing and then pull the wire through
that<00:02:11.290> reliever<00:02:11.769> and<00:02:12.040> through<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.400> housing

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
that reliever and through the housing

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.570 
that reliever and through the housing
itself<00:02:13.090> so<00:02:13.720> that<00:02:13.930> you<00:02:14.050> can<00:02:14.230> now<00:02:14.470> attach<00:02:14.650> it<00:02:15.129> to

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
itself so that you can now attach it to

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.369 
itself so that you can now attach it to
the<00:02:15.819> lugs<00:02:16.209> which<00:02:16.629> of<00:02:16.780> course<00:02:16.810> are<00:02:17.230> the

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
the lugs which of course are the

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.339 
the lugs which of course are the
terminal<00:02:17.890> points<00:02:18.280> on<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:19.090> plug<00:02:19.540> itself<00:02:19.989> and

plug to now when you get the outside
insulation<00:02:52.989> off<00:02:53.140> you'll<00:02:53.410> find<00:02:53.769> inside<00:02:54.400> there

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
insulation off you'll find inside there

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.720 
insulation off you'll find inside there
are<00:02:55.090> two<00:02:56.019> wires<00:02:56.380> that<00:02:56.799> are<00:02:57.220> coated<00:02:57.700> with

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
are two wires that are coated with

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.259 
are two wires that are coated with
insulation<00:02:58.329> most<00:02:59.110> often<00:02:59.590> red<00:03:00.250> and<00:03:00.519> green

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
insulation most often red and green

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.509 
insulation most often red and green
sometimes<00:03:02.019> the<00:03:02.410> insulation<00:03:02.980> is<00:03:03.099> not<00:03:03.250> even

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
sometimes the insulation is not even

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.339 
sometimes the insulation is not even
plastic<00:03:03.819> sometimes<00:03:04.360> it's<00:03:04.840> just<00:03:05.110> like<00:03:05.319> a

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
plastic sometimes it's just like a

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.710 
plastic sometimes it's just like a
lacquer<00:03:05.769> that's<00:03:06.130> put<00:03:06.310> on<00:03:06.489> there<00:03:06.760> to<00:03:07.299> prevent

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
lacquer that's put on there to prevent

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.330 
lacquer that's put on there to prevent
them<00:03:07.900> from<00:03:07.930> making<00:03:08.410> contact<00:03:08.920> with<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.130> other

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
them from making contact with the other

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.699 
them from making contact with the other
wires<00:03:09.639> after<00:03:10.180> they've<00:03:10.329> been<00:03:10.510> attached<00:03:11.410> to<00:03:11.560> the

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
wires after they've been attached to the

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.309 
wires after they've been attached to the
plug<00:03:11.980> there's<00:03:12.670> also<00:03:12.970> a<00:03:13.450> couple<00:03:13.720> of<00:03:13.959> third

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
plug there's also a couple of third

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.530 
plug there's also a couple of third
wires<00:03:14.680> when<00:03:15.430> I<00:03:15.459> say<00:03:15.700> a<00:03:15.730> couple<00:03:15.970> of<00:03:16.090> third<00:03:16.329> wells

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
wires when I say a couple of third wells

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.569 
wires when I say a couple of third wells
I<00:03:16.750> mean<00:03:16.930> two<00:03:17.079> different<00:03:17.200> strands<00:03:17.739> but<00:03:18.340> these

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
I mean two different strands but these

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.199 
I mean two different strands but these
are<00:03:19.530> not<00:03:20.530> coated<00:03:20.920> they<00:03:21.220> have<00:03:21.400> no<00:03:21.579> insulation

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
are not coated they have no insulation

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.240 
are not coated they have no insulation
on<00:03:22.329> them<00:03:22.569> at<00:03:22.660> all<00:03:22.870> so<00:03:23.079> the<00:03:23.769> first<00:03:23.799> thing<00:03:24.160> you

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
on them at all so the first thing you

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.099 
on them at all so the first thing you
want<00:03:24.459> to<00:03:24.519> do<00:03:24.670> is<00:03:24.819> strip<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.269> insulation<00:03:25.299> off

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
want to do is strip the insulation off

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.979 
want to do is strip the insulation off
the<00:03:26.440> end<00:03:26.680> of<00:03:27.010> those<00:03:27.850> that<00:03:28.120> are<00:03:28.209> coated<00:03:28.510> that<00:03:28.810> is

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
the end of those that are coated that is

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.440 
the end of those that are coated that is
probably<00:03:29.620> and<00:03:29.950> I<00:03:30.549> say<00:03:30.760> probably<00:03:31.000> because<00:03:31.329> the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
probably and I say probably because the

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.690 
probably and I say probably because the
colors<00:03:31.720> could<00:03:31.930> be<00:03:32.049> different<00:03:32.470> but<00:03:32.590> most<00:03:33.220> often

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
colors could be different but most often

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.879 
colors could be different but most often
the<00:03:34.060> green<00:03:34.389> and<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:34.780> red<00:03:34.989> wire<00:03:35.260> so<00:03:35.620> that<00:03:35.769> you

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
the green and the red wire so that you

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:37.680 
the green and the red wire so that you
have<00:03:36.069> some<00:03:36.310> wire<00:03:36.519> exposed<00:03:36.819> that<00:03:37.239> you<00:03:37.359> can<00:03:37.510> then

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
have some wire exposed that you can then

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.410 
have some wire exposed that you can then
hook<00:03:37.989> to<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:38.950> plug<00:03:39.730> itself<00:03:42.030> now<00:03:43.030> after<00:03:43.329> you

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
hook to the plug itself now after you

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.000 
hook to the plug itself now after you
get<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:43.660> wire<00:03:43.840> strip<00:03:44.319> the<00:03:44.500> next<00:03:44.769> thing<00:03:44.920> you

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
get the wire strip the next thing you

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.150 
get the wire strip the next thing you
have<00:03:45.040> to<00:03:45.310> do<00:03:45.459> is<00:03:45.670> take<00:03:45.880> the<00:03:46.060> ones<00:03:46.269> that<00:03:46.480> are

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
have to do is take the ones that are

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.819 
have to do is take the ones that are
uninsulated<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:49.060> bare<00:03:49.299> wires<00:03:49.660> and<00:03:50.049> kind<00:03:50.709> of

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
uninsulated the bare wires and kind of

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.949 
uninsulated the bare wires and kind of
spindle<00:03:51.549> them<00:03:51.700> together<00:03:51.910> in<00:03:52.510> other<00:03:52.599> words<00:03:52.840> you

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
spindle them together in other words you

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.080 
spindle them together in other words you
want<00:03:53.139> to<00:03:53.230> connect<00:03:53.560> them<00:03:53.709> to<00:03:53.950> each<00:03:54.310> other<00:03:54.579> so

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
want to connect them to each other so

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.910 
want to connect them to each other so
that<00:03:55.269> you<00:03:55.450> can<00:03:55.630> then<00:03:55.660> connect<00:03:56.380> both<00:03:56.650> those

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
that you can then connect both those

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.599 
that you can then connect both those
wires<00:03:57.250> to<00:03:57.579> one<00:03:57.760> of<00:03:57.880> the<00:03:57.970> lugs<00:03:58.180> on<00:03:58.419> the<00:03:59.109> on<00:03:59.709> the

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
wires to one of the lugs on the on the

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.970 
wires to one of the lugs on the on the
plug<00:04:00.910> so<00:04:01.480> what<00:04:01.810> I'm<00:04:01.900> doing<00:04:01.930> here<00:04:02.440> is<00:04:02.500> trying<00:04:02.739> to

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
plug so what I'm doing here is trying to

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.220 
plug so what I'm doing here is trying to
twist<00:04:03.220> those<00:04:03.370> wires<00:04:03.730> together<00:04:04.060> that<00:04:04.870> is<00:04:05.049> the

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
twist those wires together that is the

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.880 
twist those wires together that is the
uninsulated<00:04:06.069> wire

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
uninsulated wire

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.720 
uninsulated wire
not<00:04:07.610> the<00:04:07.820> red<00:04:08.030> or<00:04:08.300> green<00:04:08.570> wires<00:04:09.460> now<00:04:10.460> here<00:04:10.700> I

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
not the red or green wires now here I

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.820 
not the red or green wires now here I
show<00:04:11.060> you<00:04:11.090> the<00:04:11.390> wires<00:04:11.660> after<00:04:12.380> they've<00:04:12.620> been

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
show you the wires after they've been

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.670 
show you the wires after they've been
stripped<00:04:13.280> and<00:04:13.520> the<00:04:14.180> uninsulated<00:04:14.750> wires<00:04:15.290> have

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
stripped and the uninsulated wires have

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.460 
stripped and the uninsulated wires have
been<00:04:16.060> twisted<00:04:17.060> together<00:04:17.209> and<00:04:17.720> now<00:04:18.230> they're

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
been twisted together and now they're

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
been twisted together and now they're
ready<00:04:18.650> to<00:04:18.799> be<00:04:19.070> attached<00:04:19.459> to<00:04:19.670> the<00:04:20.480> plug<00:04:20.720> itself

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.890 

next<00:04:25.490> you<00:04:25.700> want<00:04:25.880> to<00:04:25.970> pick<00:04:26.120> up<00:04:26.150> the<00:04:26.420> plug<00:04:26.660> and

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
next you want to pick up the plug and

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.960 
next you want to pick up the plug and
take<00:04:27.080> a<00:04:27.110> small<00:04:27.710> phillips<00:04:28.190> screwdriver<00:04:28.250> that's

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
take a small phillips screwdriver that's

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.930 
take a small phillips screwdriver that's
the<00:04:29.180> star<00:04:29.510> type<00:04:29.870> probably<00:04:30.530> a<00:04:30.710> matter<00:04:31.580> of<00:04:31.700> fact

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
the star type probably a matter of fact

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.810 
the star type probably a matter of fact
I'm<00:04:32.150> sure<00:04:32.450> it<00:04:32.600> is<00:04:32.720> if<00:04:32.900> you<00:04:33.020> buy<00:04:33.230> the<00:04:33.700> plug<00:04:34.700> from

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
I'm sure it is if you buy the plug from

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.970 
I'm sure it is if you buy the plug from
RadioShack<00:04:35.210> and<00:04:35.720> you<00:04:36.080> want<00:04:36.260> to<00:04:36.350> loosen<00:04:36.770> each

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
RadioShack and you want to loosen each

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.220 
RadioShack and you want to loosen each
one<00:04:37.310> of<00:04:37.460> the<00:04:37.550> little<00:04:37.730> screws<00:04:38.210> on<00:04:38.480> the<00:04:38.960> three

different lug terminals that is the

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.909 
different lug terminals that is the
connection<00:04:43.220> points<00:04:44.260> now<00:04:45.260> after<00:04:45.590> you<00:04:45.710> do<00:04:45.890> that

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
connection points now after you do that

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.659 
connection points now after you do that
the<00:04:46.669> job<00:04:46.970> is<00:04:47.300> to<00:04:47.540> connect<00:04:47.990> the<00:04:48.440> wires<00:04:48.710> to<00:04:49.220> those

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
the job is to connect the wires to those

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.810 
the job is to connect the wires to those
screws<00:04:50.680> what<00:04:51.680> you<00:04:51.830> want<00:04:52.070> to<00:04:52.190> do<00:04:52.310> is<00:04:52.580> connect

upper screw and the wires that were
uninsulated<00:05:04.010> that<00:05:04.520> you<00:05:04.700> twisted<00:05:05.630> together<00:05:05.780> to

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
uninsulated that you twisted together to

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.820 
uninsulated that you twisted together to
the<00:05:06.830> longest<00:05:07.370> lug<00:05:07.790> and<00:05:08.290> that's<00:05:09.290> not<00:05:09.470> easy<00:05:09.680> to

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
the longest lug and that's not easy to

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.320 
the longest lug and that's not easy to
do<00:05:10.070> it's<00:05:10.280> going<00:05:10.340> to<00:05:10.520> take<00:05:10.700> a<00:05:10.730> little<00:05:10.910> manual

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
do it's going to take a little manual

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.090 
do it's going to take a little manual
dexterity<00:05:11.510> but<00:05:12.080> you<00:05:12.200> certainly<00:05:12.410> can<00:05:12.740> do<00:05:12.950> it

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
dexterity but you certainly can do it

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.010 
dexterity but you certainly can do it
what<00:05:13.850> you<00:05:13.940> want<00:05:14.150> to<00:05:14.240> do<00:05:14.330> of<00:05:14.450> course<00:05:14.479> is<00:05:14.810> try<00:05:14.990> to

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
what you want to do of course is try to

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.230 
what you want to do of course is try to
wrap<00:05:15.380> the<00:05:15.590> wire<00:05:15.620> around<00:05:15.830> the<00:05:16.520> screw<00:05:16.610> and<00:05:17.090> then

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
wrap the wire around the screw and then

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.400 
wrap the wire around the screw and then
tighten<00:05:17.690> it<00:05:17.750> down<00:05:17.990> as<00:05:18.260> tightly<00:05:18.530> as<00:05:18.680> you<00:05:18.919> can

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
tighten it down as tightly as you can

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.560 
tighten it down as tightly as you can
now<00:05:21.410> here<00:05:21.680> what<00:05:21.830> I'm<00:05:21.919> trying<00:05:22.250> to<00:05:22.340> do<00:05:22.640> is<00:05:23.000> I'm

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
now here what I'm trying to do is I'm

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.659 
now here what I'm trying to do is I'm
trying<00:05:23.720> to<00:05:23.900> slip<00:05:24.260> a<00:05:24.470> small<00:05:24.830> pieces<00:05:25.220> of<00:05:25.400> paper

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
trying to slip a small pieces of paper

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:30.730 
trying to slip a small pieces of paper
in<00:05:26.060> between<00:05:26.810> the<00:05:28.780> individual<00:05:29.780> terminal<00:05:30.500> lugs

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
in between the individual terminal lugs

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.400 
in between the individual terminal lugs
and<00:05:31.070> the<00:05:31.610> reason<00:05:31.910> for<00:05:32.090> that<00:05:32.240> is<00:05:32.540> if<00:05:32.780> you<00:05:33.080> have

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
and the reason for that is if you have

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.370 
and the reason for that is if you have
even<00:05:33.620> the<00:05:33.710> smallest<00:05:34.220> strand<00:05:35.180> of<00:05:35.390> wire<00:05:35.660> that

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
even the smallest strand of wire that

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.190 
even the smallest strand of wire that
makes<00:05:36.650> contact<00:05:37.280> between<00:05:38.030> the<00:05:38.479> terminal<00:05:38.960> lugs

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
makes contact between the terminal lugs

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.290 
makes contact between the terminal lugs
it'll<00:05:39.860> short<00:05:40.190> out<00:05:40.400> and<00:05:40.640> you<00:05:40.790> will<00:05:40.910> get<00:05:41.090> no

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
it'll short out and you will get no

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.600 
it'll short out and you will get no
sound<00:05:41.660> so<00:05:42.320> if<00:05:42.620> you<00:05:42.740> put<00:05:42.919> that<00:05:42.950> wire<00:05:43.340> in<00:05:43.580> between

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
sound so if you put that wire in between

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.090 
sound so if you put that wire in between
you<00:05:44.450> can<00:05:44.600> be<00:05:44.750> sure<00:05:44.990> to<00:05:45.140> keep<00:05:45.320> them<00:05:45.560> separated

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
you can be sure to keep them separated

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.430 
you can be sure to keep them separated
when<00:05:46.700> you<00:05:46.729> screw<00:05:47.150> the<00:05:47.300> cap<00:05:47.510> back<00:05:47.540> on<00:05:48.020> the<00:05:48.050> plug

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
when you screw the cap back on the plug

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.500 
when you screw the cap back on the plug
now<00:05:48.710> if<00:05:49.370> you<00:05:49.460> don't<00:05:49.640> want<00:05:49.790> to<00:05:49.880> do<00:05:50.000> that<00:05:50.210> in

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
now if you don't want to do that in

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.420 
now if you don't want to do that in
other<00:05:50.570> words<00:05:50.840> it's<00:05:51.050> not<00:05:51.530> that<00:05:51.710> easy<00:05:51.890> to<00:05:52.010> do<00:05:52.280> to

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
other words it's not that easy to do to

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.159 
other words it's not that easy to do to
get<00:05:52.550> those<00:05:52.729> pieces<00:05:53.120> of<00:05:53.300> paper<00:05:53.330> in<00:05:53.750> there<00:05:53.960> and

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:54.169 
get those pieces of paper in there and

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:56.110 
get those pieces of paper in there and
make<00:05:54.590> them<00:05:54.770> small<00:05:55.100> enough<00:05:55.130> so<00:05:55.850> that<00:05:56.060> they

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
make them small enough so that they

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.880 
make them small enough so that they
actually<00:05:56.270> fit<00:05:56.690> under<00:05:56.900> the<00:05:56.990> plug<00:05:57.260> what<00:05:57.770> you

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:57.890 
actually fit under the plug what you

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.920 
actually fit under the plug what you
could<00:05:58.100> do<00:05:58.250> instead<00:05:58.430> is<00:05:58.850> take<00:05:59.360> some<00:05:59.630> clear

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
could do instead is take some clear

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.469 
could do instead is take some clear
fingernail<00:06:00.500> polish<00:06:00.880> make<00:06:01.880> sure<00:06:02.060> all<00:06:02.330> the

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 
fingernail polish make sure all the

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:04.960 
fingernail polish make sure all the
strands<00:06:02.750> of<00:06:02.960> wire<00:06:03.169> are<00:06:03.530> not<00:06:04.130> in<00:06:04.310> contact<00:06:04.790> with

each other in other words there's no

each other in other words there's no
crosstalk<00:06:07.640> and<00:06:07.880> then<00:06:08.510> what<00:06:08.750> you<00:06:08.840> do<00:06:09.020> is<00:06:09.229> you

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:09.380 
crosstalk and then what you do is you

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.800 
crosstalk and then what you do is you
coat<00:06:09.650> the<00:06:09.890> wires<00:06:10.190> that<00:06:11.060> are<00:06:11.120> attached<00:06:11.510> to<00:06:11.660> the

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810 
coat the wires that are attached to the

coat the wires that are attached to the
plug<00:06:12.080> that<00:06:12.650> is<00:06:12.830> the<00:06:12.950> bare<00:06:13.190> wire<00:06:13.460> anyway

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
plug that is the bare wire anyway

plug that is the bare wire anyway
with<00:06:14.660> the<00:06:14.870> clear<00:06:15.349> fingernail<00:06:15.950> polish<00:06:16.190> let<00:06:16.940> it

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060 
with the clear fingernail polish let it

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.540 
with the clear fingernail polish let it
dry<00:06:17.270> for<00:06:17.330> a<00:06:17.570> while<00:06:17.780> and<00:06:18.020> not<00:06:18.140> of<00:06:18.289> course

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
dry for a while and not of course

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.880 
dry for a while and not of course
we'll<00:06:18.700> be<00:06:18.820> an<00:06:18.940> insulation<00:06:19.530> so<00:06:20.530> you<00:06:20.620> won't

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:20.890 
we'll be an insulation so you won't

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.200 
we'll be an insulation so you won't
really<00:06:21.010> have<00:06:21.250> to<00:06:21.370> put<00:06:21.520> the<00:06:21.640> paper<00:06:21.850> in<00:06:22.060> there

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
really have to put the paper in there

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:23.520 
really have to put the paper in there
but<00:06:22.360> you<00:06:22.420> could<00:06:22.540> use<00:06:22.690> the<00:06:22.810> paper<00:06:23.020> if<00:06:23.200> you<00:06:23.320> want

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
but you could use the paper if you want

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.710 
but you could use the paper if you want
to<00:06:23.740> it's<00:06:24.250> really<00:06:24.460> up<00:06:24.700> to<00:06:24.850> you<00:06:25.030> I<00:06:25.210> think<00:06:25.630> the

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 
to it's really up to you I think the

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.660 
to it's really up to you I think the
fingernail<00:06:26.140> polish<00:06:26.320> is<00:06:26.620> easier<00:06:27.010> and<00:06:27.130> works

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:27.670 
fingernail polish is easier and works

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.300 
fingernail polish is easier and works
just<00:06:27.760> as<00:06:28.060> well<00:06:28.680> now<00:06:29.680> here's<00:06:29.860> what<00:06:30.040> it<00:06:30.070> looks

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 
just as well now here's what it looks

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.240 
just as well now here's what it looks
like<00:06:30.460> with<00:06:30.670> all<00:06:30.760> the<00:06:30.910> wires<00:06:31.120> attached<00:06:31.690> and<00:06:32.250> the

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.250 
like with all the wires attached and the

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.640 
like with all the wires attached and the
fingernail<00:06:34.120> polish<00:06:34.360> applied<00:06:34.900> and<00:06:35.320> it's<00:06:35.440> ready

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
fingernail polish applied and it's ready

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.070 
fingernail polish applied and it's ready
now<00:06:35.890> to<00:06:35.950> have<00:06:36.190> the<00:06:36.340> cap<00:06:36.580> put<00:06:36.850> over<00:06:37.030> the<00:06:37.180> top<00:06:37.390> now

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
now to have the cap put over the top now

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.420 
now to have the cap put over the top now
the<00:06:38.140> first<00:06:38.470> thing<00:06:38.590> you<00:06:38.710> want<00:06:38.860> to<00:06:38.920> do<00:06:39.010> is<00:06:39.130> slide

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
the first thing you want to do is slide

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.030 
the first thing you want to do is slide
that<00:06:39.670> plastic<00:06:40.270> cap<00:06:40.540> which<00:06:41.230> you<00:06:41.410> have<00:06:41.590> string

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:42.040 
that plastic cap which you have string

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.130 
that plastic cap which you have string
and<00:06:42.310> strung<00:06:42.520> through<00:06:42.730> the<00:06:42.850> wire<00:06:43.090> over<00:06:43.630> the

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:44.140 
and strung through the wire over the

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.580 
and strung through the wire over the
entire<00:06:44.500> assembly<00:06:44.950> and<00:06:45.370> that<00:06:46.030> plastic<00:06:46.780> make

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.590 
entire assembly and that plastic make

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.470 
entire assembly and that plastic make
sure<00:06:47.830> that<00:06:48.010> the<00:06:48.190> wires<00:06:48.400> don't<00:06:48.790> touch<00:06:49.030> the<00:06:49.270> cap

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:49.480 
sure that the wires don't touch the cap

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.300 
sure that the wires don't touch the cap
itself<00:06:49.900> because<00:06:50.350> that<00:06:50.380> too<00:06:50.740> would<00:06:50.920> short<00:06:51.190> it

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:51.310 
itself because that too would short it

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.000 
itself because that too would short it
out<00:06:51.430> so<00:06:52.150> you<00:06:52.180> slide<00:06:52.690> the<00:06:52.930> plastic<00:06:53.140> cap<00:06:53.620> over

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.010 
out so you slide the plastic cap over

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.180 
out so you slide the plastic cap over
it's<00:06:54.130> a<00:06:54.220> clear<00:06:54.460> plastic<00:06:54.730> sleeve<00:06:55.330> and<00:06:55.600> then<00:06:56.500> you

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:57.190 
it's a clear plastic sleeve and then you

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.700 
it's a clear plastic sleeve and then you
slide<00:06:57.490> the<00:06:57.550> metal<00:06:57.880> cap<00:06:58.240> over<00:06:58.540> and<00:06:58.900> carefully

00:06:59.700 --> 00:06:59.710 
slide the metal cap over and carefully

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.960 
slide the metal cap over and carefully
screw<00:07:00.070> it<00:07:00.220> on<00:07:00.370> to<00:07:00.640> the<00:07:00.910> plug<00:07:01.240> and<00:07:02.700> when<00:07:03.700> you<00:07:03.820> get

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:03.970 
screw it on to the plug and when you get

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.360 
screw it on to the plug and when you get
done<00:07:04.240> you<00:07:04.420> have<00:07:04.600> the<00:07:04.630> completed<00:07:05.230> assembly<00:07:05.560> now

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:06.370 
done you have the completed assembly now

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.300 
done you have the completed assembly now
it's<00:07:06.580> probably<00:07:07.060> a<00:07:07.090> good<00:07:07.330> idea<00:07:07.840> before<00:07:08.620> you<00:07:08.980> put

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:09.310 
it's probably a good idea before you put

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.610 
it's probably a good idea before you put
the<00:07:09.460> cap<00:07:09.670> on<00:07:09.940> and<00:07:10.240> before<00:07:10.630> you<00:07:10.870> slide<00:07:11.350> that

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:11.620 
the cap on and before you slide that

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.030 
the cap on and before you slide that
plastic<00:07:12.220> sleeve<00:07:12.550> over<00:07:12.910> the<00:07:13.330> whole

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:14.040 
plastic sleeve over the whole

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.100 
plastic sleeve over the whole
arrangement<00:07:15.040> to<00:07:15.460> plug<00:07:15.910> it<00:07:16.060> into<00:07:16.210> your<00:07:16.510> iPod<00:07:16.930> or

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:17.110

arrangement to plug it into your iPod or
whatever<00:07:17.230> and<00:07:17.620> make<00:07:17.740> sure<00:07:17.920> that<00:07:18.100> it<00:07:18.220> works

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:18.490 
whatever and make sure that it works

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.400 
whatever and make sure that it works
otherwise<00:07:19.420> what<00:07:19.720> you're<00:07:19.840> going<00:07:20.020> to<00:07:20.110> have<00:07:20.260> to

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:20.410 
otherwise what you're going to have to

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.580 
otherwise what you're going to have to
do<00:07:20.530> of<00:07:20.680> course<00:07:20.710> is<00:07:21.300> unscrew<00:07:22.300> the<00:07:22.450> cap<00:07:22.660> take<00:07:23.440> it

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:23.590 
do of course is unscrew the cap take it

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.560 
do of course is unscrew the cap take it
apart<00:07:23.980> find<00:07:24.670> out<00:07:24.880> where<00:07:25.150> the<00:07:25.330> cross

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:25.570 
apart find out where the cross

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.110 
apart find out where the cross
connection<00:07:26.140> is<00:07:26.320> and<00:07:26.590> sever<00:07:27.580> the<00:07:27.700> connection

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:28.120 
connection is and sever the connection

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.470 
connection is and sever the connection
which<00:07:28.810> is<00:07:28.990> probably<00:07:29.440> by<00:07:29.860> a<00:07:29.890> very<00:07:30.220> fine<00:07:30.550> wire<00:07:30.910> so

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:31.480 
which is probably by a very fine wire so

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.420 
which is probably by a very fine wire so
that<00:07:31.630> you<00:07:31.810> don't<00:07:31.990> have<00:07:32.140> that<00:07:32.200> that<00:07:32.890> shorting

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:33.430 
that you don't have that that shorting

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.760 
that you don't have that that shorting
so<00:07:34.000> if<00:07:34.300> you<00:07:34.450> do<00:07:34.600> this<00:07:34.780> before<00:07:35.170> you<00:07:35.290> put<00:07:35.320> the<00:07:35.560> cap

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:35.770 
so if you do this before you put the cap

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:37.680 
so if you do this before you put the cap
on<00:07:36.010> before<00:07:36.460> you<00:07:36.580> put<00:07:36.760> that<00:07:36.910> sleeve<00:07:37.210> over<00:07:37.570> it

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:37.690 
on before you put that sleeve over it

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.540 
on before you put that sleeve over it
you<00:07:38.140> will<00:07:38.260> avoid<00:07:38.620> having<00:07:38.890> to<00:07:39.100> take<00:07:39.250> it<00:07:39.400> all

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:39.550 
you will avoid having to take it all

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.430 
you will avoid having to take it all
apart<00:07:39.880> again<00:07:40.000> and<00:07:40.210> kind<00:07:40.570> of<00:07:40.660> start<00:07:40.930> over

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:41.440 
apart again and kind of start over

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.790 
apart again and kind of start over
so<00:07:41.910> that<00:07:42.910> would<00:07:43.060> be<00:07:43.150> a<00:07:43.180> good<00:07:43.360> idea<00:07:43.750> but<00:07:44.230> once

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:44.800 
so that would be a good idea but once

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.650 
so that would be a good idea but once
you<00:07:44.890> get<00:07:45.040> it<00:07:45.160> done<00:07:45.370> this<00:07:45.910> is<00:07:46.120> the<00:07:46.150> final

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:46.660 
you get it done this is the final

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.780 
you get it done this is the final
assembly<00:07:46.960> and<00:07:47.320> it's<00:07:47.830> pretty<00:07:48.040> durable<00:07:48.340> as<00:07:48.670> I

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:48.790 
assembly and it's pretty durable as I

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:50.430 
assembly and it's pretty durable as I
say<00:07:48.970> primarily<00:07:49.570> because<00:07:49.840> you<00:07:50.080> have<00:07:50.230> a<00:07:50.260> nice

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:50.440 
say primarily because you have a nice

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.920 
say primarily because you have a nice
metal<00:07:50.800> plug<00:07:51.550> on<00:07:51.760> there<00:07:52.000> and<00:07:52.210> you<00:07:52.510> also<00:07:52.660> have

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:52.930 
metal plug on there and you also have

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.440 
metal plug on there and you also have
that<00:07:52.960> strain<00:07:53.500> relieving<00:07:54.070> wire<00:07:54.340> that<00:07:55.210> still

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:55.450 
that strain relieving wire that still

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:56.790 
that strain relieving wire that still
doesn't<00:07:55.720> mean<00:07:55.810> that<00:07:55.960> of<00:07:56.050> course<00:07:56.260> you<00:07:56.380> can<00:07:56.530> pull

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:56.800 
doesn't mean that of course you can pull

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.230 
doesn't mean that of course you can pull
on<00:07:56.980> it<00:07:57.100> with<00:07:57.220> all<00:07:57.340> your<00:07:57.520> strength<00:07:57.700> it's<00:07:58.060> still

00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.240 
on it with all your strength it's still

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.940 
on it with all your strength it's still
going<00:07:58.390> to<00:07:58.450> come<00:07:58.600> detached<00:07:59.110> but<00:07:59.710> it'll

00:07:59.940 --> 00:07:59.950 
going to come detached but it'll

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:02.850 
going to come detached but it'll
certainly<00:08:00.130> last<00:08:00.610> quite<00:08:01.120> a<00:08:01.180> long<00:08:01.270> time<00:08:01.860> so

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:02.860 
certainly last quite a long time so

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.400 
certainly last quite a long time so
that's<00:08:02.980> the<00:08:03.160> story<00:08:03.430> folks<00:08:03.760> I'm<00:08:04.300> try<00:08:05.020> to<00:08:05.080> show

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:05.410 
that's the story folks I'm try to show

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:08.550 
that's the story folks I'm try to show
you<00:08:05.470> how<00:08:05.650> you<00:08:05.830> can<00:08:06.160> fix<00:08:06.400> your<00:08:06.640> headphones<00:08:07.560> and

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560 
you how you can fix your headphones and

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.220 
you how you can fix your headphones and
make<00:08:09.250> them<00:08:09.400> work<00:08:09.610> like<00:08:09.640> new<00:08:10.210> if<00:08:10.480> you<00:08:10.930> do<00:08:11.080> it

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:11.230 
make them work like new if you do it

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.940 
make them work like new if you do it
correctly<00:08:11.700> good<00:08:12.700> luck
