00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.180

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.890

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.409
 we killed him great great I've put 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.969
 nervous for a moment 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.729
 although we will continue to go eating 

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:15.259
 eating eating until recovering all 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.630
 life and we are going to lower a little bit 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.210
 It's a little strong and good, we're going to 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.429
 go here we will see if in the middle 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.609
 we can equip ourselves better and good 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:27.319
 remember, my name is case 94 case 96 as 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:28.590
 simple 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:31.469
 efe 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.990
 and good to know what is happening with the 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:35.909
 server they do not let me grab the 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.310
 chests I think it has to be a bit of 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.859
 long but good is the truth to do 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.920
 a beta server, it's a good thing 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:46.770
 I say and more with this that you can go more 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.170
 fast already tells them what you go slow or 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.020
 it is like already pc type that's why they put 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.780
 the positions was very good idea 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:00.920
 I think it's not that kind 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:04.760
 I kill you I kill you wow guys apparently 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.160

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.620
 equipping is not expected is not expected 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.720

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.720

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.520

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.810
 very very good like 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.610

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.290
 agreement but but it's a car with 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.140
 schools on a route with the school of 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.910

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.930

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:08.469

 chests in the middle 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:18.949

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:57.319
