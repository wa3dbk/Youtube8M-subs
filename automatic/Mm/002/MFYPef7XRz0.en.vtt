00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.290
 today we are with daniel corral other than 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.940
 the representatives of the delegation 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.770
 mexicana that will be in london 2012 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.280
 thank you for giving us these minutes of your 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.000
 weather 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:25.520
 also how do you feel 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.520
 to 59 days of the Olympic Games 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:41.780
 what we have been training this 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.780
 Olympic cycle 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.079
 happy 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.309
 Honduras to a great satisfaction for 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.329
 me because a lot of people were happening 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.329
 many people one supported 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:06.259
 and they are different your mornings do not 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.240
 wake up with nerves already thinking about what 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.550
 you're going to do once you set foot 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.430
 down the plane already in london 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:17.270
 I do not think I prefer to leave 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:20.570
 simply to live everything is to try 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.580
 visualize how everything will be 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.159
 of falling a little anxious then I 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.790
 I think for me it's mind to let the 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.790
 things flow 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.220
 At some stage of your life you had the 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.450
 opportunity to join the team 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.490
 United States politician because you 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.550
 they offered a scholarship already at that time 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:48.729
 be declined the recent offer of 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:48.729
 that and everything that has 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:02:00.870
 and now he has a decision objective to 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:10.050
 like 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:12.390
 all the decisions that the 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.640
 experts had predicted that your 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.770
 the best time was going to be for 2016 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.560
 these four years before you want that 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.270
 also not be an auspicious time for 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.530
 think there might be a medal 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.530
 for you london 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:32.040
 in the goal of really if it is 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.040
 judicial 2016 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.050
 to be able to think of a medal but I think 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.700
 that we imagine that right now 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.700
 possibility because he does not seek to inhabit 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.690
 because we have with the mentality of 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.020
 make history of making my story my 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:56.200
 own life then I think we can 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.350
 open the door to a lot of people behind 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.350
 my 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.489
 and have a 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.000
 you're going to do with all the fans 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.300
 to receive you on your return from london 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:21.220
 2012 and bet at the airport 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:23.019
 waiting to sue last for 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.650
 share with our travel friends 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.269
 sports five personal things that do not 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.720
 They may be missing in your london suitcase 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.720
 2002 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.520
 well 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:39.100
 I do not have any such things as for example 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.840
 a series of rituals something like that but more 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.060
 that nothing are things that I do 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.070
 with me 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.070
 really my god 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:56.650
 I think my family would be something else 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.540
 but with me 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.360
 many people not that I've been 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.810
 supporting me simple state by my side 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:09.079
 only mine my work team what 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.609
 which are three things called strengths 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.870
 to man all the adjustment we want the 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:14.510
 best of luck in this experience 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.950
 it's called londres-2012 and we're 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.690
 sure that the name of mexico will remain 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.250
 very high with your representation 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.700
