00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
you can't really like hit it because you

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.690 
you can't really like hit it because you
don't<00:01:18.630> know<00:01:18.720> what<00:01:19.490> control<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.549> direction

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
don't know what control the direction

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.609

with<00:01:21.000> front<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.540> back<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.350> doesn't<00:01:22.380> really

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
with front to back so it doesn't really

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.499 
with front to back so it doesn't really
matter<00:01:22.799> which<00:01:23.090> doesn't<00:01:24.090> matter<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:24.450> you

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
matter which doesn't matter you so you

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.359 
matter which doesn't matter you so you
basically<00:01:24.689> have<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.229> block<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:26.009> mean<00:01:26.220> if

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
basically have to block it so I mean if

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.740 
basically have to block it so I mean if
you<00:01:26.490> if<00:01:26.670> you're<00:01:26.820> not<00:01:26.939> able<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.360> counter<00:01:27.600> with<00:01:27.689> a

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
you if you're not able to counter with a

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.330 
you if you're not able to counter with a
normal<00:01:28.140> then<00:01:28.259> it's<00:01:28.380> just<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.560> 50/50<00:01:29.009> mix<00:01:29.189> set

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
normal then it's just a 50/50 mix set

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.039 
normal then it's just a 50/50 mix set
yeah<00:01:29.520> but<00:01:29.790> if<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:29.970> can<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.450> looks<00:01:30.570> like<00:01:30.750> you

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:47.259 
characters have like fast level two one

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:48.689 
characters have like fast level two one
because<00:04:47.619> it<00:04:47.709> base<00:04:47.860> they're<00:04:48.069> basically<00:04:48.429> like

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
because it base they're basically like

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.239

level ones if they're really fast I mean
I<00:04:51.309> feel<00:04:51.459> like<00:04:51.520> it<00:04:51.699> does<00:04:51.819> so<00:04:51.999> little<00:04:52.119> damage

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:54.510 
I feel like it does so little damage
that<00:04:52.990> it's<00:04:53.110> almost<00:04:53.499> not<00:04:53.740> worth<00:04:53.770> like<00:04:54.189> the<00:04:54.339> risk

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
that it's almost not worth like the risk

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.889 
that it's almost not worth like the risk
and<00:04:54.669> actually<00:04:54.939> doing<00:04:55.089> it<00:04:55.209> in<00:04:55.330> the<00:04:55.389> first<00:04:55.599> place

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:55.899 
and actually doing it in the first place

00:04:55.899 --> 00:05:02.969 
and actually doing it in the first place
