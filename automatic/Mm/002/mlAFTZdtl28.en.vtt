00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:27.799 
train journey butter time is now was it

00:06:27.799 --> 00:06:31.789 
train journey butter time is now was it
good<00:06:28.799> sir<00:06:29.069> temp<00:06:29.339> offset<00:06:29.779> the<00:06:30.779> bits<00:06:31.409> where<00:06:31.649> we

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:31.799 
good sir temp offset the bits where we

00:06:31.799 --> 00:06:32.899 
good sir temp offset the bits where we
have<00:06:31.889> an<00:06:31.979> address<00:06:32.129> of<00:06:32.339> time<00:06:32.519> we<00:06:32.639> will<00:06:32.759> probably

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:32.909 
have an address of time we will probably

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:34.579 
have an address of time we will probably
put<00:06:33.149> somewhere<00:06:33.929> in<00:06:34.049> the<00:06:34.139> video<00:06:34.349> at<00:06:34.409> the<00:06:34.499> bottom

00:06:34.579 --> 00:06:34.589 
put somewhere in the video at the bottom

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:37.039 
put somewhere in the video at the bottom
bottom<00:06:35.519> should<00:06:35.939> take<00:06:36.149> about<00:06:36.269> half<00:06:36.389> an<00:06:36.839> hour<00:06:36.899> to

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:37.049 
bottom should take about half an hour to

00:06:37.049 --> 00:06:39.019 
bottom should take about half an hour to
get<00:06:37.110> home<00:06:37.229> and<00:06:37.499> then<00:06:37.739> hopefully<00:06:38.579> we'll<00:06:38.789> try

00:06:39.019 --> 00:06:39.029 
get home and then hopefully we'll try

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:41.629 
get home and then hopefully we'll try
and<00:06:39.179> sort<00:06:39.929> of<00:06:40.019> end<00:06:40.199> it<00:06:40.379> later<00:06:40.589> my<00:06:41.249> trying<00:06:41.519> it's

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 
and sort of end it later my trying it's

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:42.859 
and sort of end it later my trying it's
more<00:06:41.759> gameplay<00:06:41.969> but<00:06:42.209> we'll<00:06:42.539> see<00:06:42.659> how<00:06:42.719> it<00:06:42.779> goes
