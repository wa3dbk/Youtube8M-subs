we<00:00:48.410> chose<00:00:48.649> to<00:00:48.829> develop<00:00:49.100> game<00:00:49.489> for<00:00:49.670> the<00:00:49.760> Wii<00:00:49.850> U

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
we chose to develop game for the Wii U

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.380 
we chose to develop game for the Wii U
because<00:00:50.480> it's<00:00:50.629> a<00:00:50.690> great<00:00:50.870> match<00:00:51.079> for<00:00:51.350> the<00:00:51.440> game

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
because it's a great match for the game

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.849 
because it's a great match for the game
the<00:00:53.390> games<00:00:53.600> originally<00:00:54.249> done<00:00:55.249> for<00:00:55.460> iOS<00:00:56.710> it<00:00:57.710> had

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
the games originally done for iOS it had

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:00.040 
the games originally done for iOS it had
approached<00:00:58.219> us<00:00:58.519> and<00:00:58.819> ancestor<00:00:59.719> we'd<00:00:59.839> like<00:00:59.960> to

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
approached us and ancestor we'd like to

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.809 
approached us and ancestor we'd like to
bring<00:01:00.170> it<00:01:00.319> to<00:01:00.409> the<00:01:00.469> Wii<00:01:00.559> U<00:01:00.739> we<00:01:01.249> thought<00:01:01.699> it

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:01.819 
bring it to the Wii U we thought it

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:03.700 
bring it to the Wii U we thought it
would<00:01:01.879> be<00:01:01.940> a<00:01:01.999> great<00:01:02.300> match<00:01:02.449> for<00:01:02.839> the<00:01:02.989> game

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
would be a great match for the game

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.590 
would be a great match for the game
players<00:01:03.949> in<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:04.250> game<00:01:04.430> because<00:01:05.330> it's<00:01:05.510> all

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
players in the game because it's all

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.930 
players in the game because it's all
based<00:01:05.780> around<00:01:06.020> touch<00:01:06.440> and<00:01:07.190> it's<00:01:07.430> a<00:01:07.520> very<00:01:07.729> kind

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
based around touch and it's a very kind

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.700 
based around touch and it's a very kind
of<00:01:08.060> it's<00:01:08.360> a<00:01:08.420> very<00:01:08.600> different<00:01:08.780> game<00:01:09.050> it's

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
of it's a very different game it's

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.840 
of it's a very different game it's
something<00:01:09.800> that's<00:01:10.070> going<00:01:10.250> usual<00:01:10.670> for<00:01:10.820> a

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
something that's going usual for a

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.490 
something that's going usual for a
Nintendo<00:01:11.270> platform<00:01:11.420> I<00:01:11.750> think<00:01:11.780> it's<00:01:12.229> a<00:01:12.290> very

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
Nintendo platform I think it's a very

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.500 
Nintendo platform I think it's a very
relaxed<00:01:12.920> game<00:01:13.130> suddenly<00:01:13.909> you<00:01:14.090> can<00:01:14.210> just<00:01:14.330> play

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
relaxed game suddenly you can just play

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.149 
relaxed game suddenly you can just play
when<00:01:14.780> you<00:01:14.900> really<00:01:15.170> really<00:01:15.200> kind<00:01:15.680> of<00:01:15.740> relaxing

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
when you really really kind of relaxing

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.770 
when you really really kind of relaxing
on<00:01:16.280> of<00:01:16.430> an<00:01:16.520> evening<00:01:16.670> so<00:01:17.330> we<00:01:17.450> thought<00:01:17.600> it'd<00:01:17.750> be

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
on of an evening so we thought it'd be

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.039 
on of an evening so we thought it'd be
great<00:01:17.960> to<00:01:18.649> bring<00:01:18.770> it<00:01:18.920> to<00:01:19.040> Nintendo's<00:01:19.430> audience

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
great to bring it to Nintendo's audience

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.330 
great to bring it to Nintendo's audience
so<00:01:21.049> the<00:01:21.170> graphical<00:01:21.500> style<00:01:21.770> of<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:21.920> game<00:01:22.070> this

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
so the graphical style of the game this

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.280 
so the graphical style of the game this
is<00:01:22.399> I<00:01:22.969> think<00:01:23.600> it's<00:01:23.689> one<00:01:23.780> of<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:23.930> most<00:01:24.020> unique

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
is I think it's one of the most unique

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.069 
is I think it's one of the most unique
aspects<00:01:24.969> and<00:01:25.969> it's<00:01:26.479> very<00:01:26.659> much<00:01:26.719> based<00:01:26.899> on

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
aspects and it's very much based on

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:29.590 
aspects and it's very much based on
their<00:01:27.229> Japanese<00:01:27.649> traditional<00:01:28.340> aesthetic<00:01:28.790> so

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
their Japanese traditional aesthetic so

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.340 
their Japanese traditional aesthetic so
our<00:01:29.780> artist<00:01:30.200> Ryo<00:01:30.829> is<00:01:31.100> actually<00:01:31.460> Japanese<00:01:32.350> and

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
our artist Ryo is actually Japanese and

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.899 
our artist Ryo is actually Japanese and
we<00:01:33.469> met<00:01:33.649> all<00:01:34.009> three<00:01:34.070> of<00:01:34.310> us<00:01:34.369> met<00:01:34.549> while<00:01:34.729> we<00:01:34.850> were

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
we met all three of us met while we were

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.690 
we met all three of us met while we were

working at a rare together and so he's

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.520 
working at a rare together and so he's
actually<00:01:37.880> living<00:01:38.119> in<00:01:38.360> Japan<00:01:38.659> now<00:01:39.079> you<00:01:39.140> moved

this<00:01:52.960> and<00:01:53.170> we<00:01:53.259> wanted<00:01:53.439> to<00:01:53.500> see<00:01:53.680> if<00:01:53.740> we<00:01:53.830> could

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
this and we wanted to see if we could

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.249 
this and we wanted to see if we could
create<00:01:54.100> a<00:01:54.280> style<00:01:54.610> based<00:01:55.450> around<00:01:55.780> this<00:01:55.990> that

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
create a style based around this that

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:57.300 
create a style based around this that
was<00:01:56.380> really<00:01:56.619> authentic

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
was really authentic

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.190 
was really authentic
so<00:01:57.850> we<00:01:57.939> looked<00:01:58.090> at<00:01:58.180> a<00:01:58.240> lot<00:01:58.270> of<00:01:58.450> traditional

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
so we looked at a lot of traditional

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.370 
so we looked at a lot of traditional
papers<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.939> took<00:02:01.119> probably<00:02:01.509> about<00:02:01.780> six<00:02:02.049> months

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
papers it took probably about six months

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.499 
papers it took probably about six months
to<00:02:02.409> kind<00:02:02.679> of<00:02:02.830> settle<00:02:03.580> on<00:02:03.789> this<00:02:04.000> this<00:02:04.270> style

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
to kind of settle on this this style

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.179 
to kind of settle on this this style
that<00:02:04.750> we<00:02:04.810> wanted<00:02:05.170> it<00:02:05.350> really<00:02:05.710> did<00:02:05.920> a<00:02:05.979> great<00:02:06.159> job

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
that we wanted it really did a great job

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.490 
that we wanted it really did a great job
of<00:02:06.689> figuring<00:02:07.689> out<00:02:07.869> what<00:02:08.019> it<00:02:08.110> was<00:02:08.170> going<00:02:08.319> to<00:02:08.380> be

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
of figuring out what it was going to be

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.960 
of figuring out what it was going to be
and<00:02:08.619> it's<00:02:08.709> almost<00:02:08.950> like<00:02:09.130> a<00:02:09.250> almost<00:02:09.580> like<00:02:09.910> a

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
and it's almost like a almost like a

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.180 
and it's almost like a almost like a
watercolor<00:02:10.360> style<00:02:10.899> as<00:02:11.110> well<00:02:11.290> working<00:02:12.069> at

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
watercolor style as well working at

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.789 
watercolor style as well working at
small<00:02:12.459> team<00:02:12.730> as<00:02:13.690> opposed<00:02:13.989> to<00:02:14.049> a<00:02:14.140> large<00:02:14.319> studios

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
small team as opposed to a large studios

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:17.520 
small team as opposed to a large studios
it's<00:02:15.280> a<00:02:15.400> very<00:02:15.580> different<00:02:15.760> experience<00:02:16.470> I'd<00:02:17.470> say

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
it's a very different experience I'd say

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.080 
it's a very different experience I'd say
when<00:02:17.799> I<00:02:17.830> started<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.340> rare<00:02:18.519> the<00:02:18.700> teams<00:02:18.940> were

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
when I started a rare the teams were

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.509 
when I started a rare the teams were
actually<00:02:19.330> pretty<00:02:19.540> small<00:02:19.870> my<00:02:20.739> first<00:02:20.980> game<00:02:21.160> had

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
actually pretty small my first game had

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.059 
actually pretty small my first game had
about<00:02:21.700> maybe<00:02:22.299> 10<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.630> 12<00:02:22.870> people<00:02:23.049> on<00:02:23.319> it<00:02:23.440> so<00:02:24.010> in

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
about maybe 10 to 12 people on it so in

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.949 
about maybe 10 to 12 people on it so in
some<00:02:24.250> ways<00:02:24.430> it's<00:02:24.640> almost<00:02:24.910> like<00:02:25.120> going<00:02:25.390> back<00:02:25.930> to

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
some ways it's almost like going back to

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.070 
some ways it's almost like going back to
to<00:02:26.769> that<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:28.150> also<00:02:28.450> we<00:02:28.660> worked<00:02:28.840> on<00:02:28.989> the

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
to that and and also we worked on the

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.620 
to that and and also we worked on the
tender<00:02:29.380> mostly<00:02:29.769> and<00:02:29.980> coming<00:02:30.549> so<00:02:31.209> this<00:02:31.360> is<00:02:31.480> kind

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
tender mostly and coming so this is kind

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.150 
tender mostly and coming so this is kind
of<00:02:31.720> like<00:02:31.810> almost<00:02:31.959> like<00:02:32.080> a<00:02:32.290> homecoming<00:02:32.470> for<00:02:32.860> us

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
of like almost like a homecoming for us

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.520 
of like almost like a homecoming for us
coming<00:02:33.519> back<00:02:33.580> to<00:02:33.790> a<00:02:33.850> Nintendo<00:02:34.239> platform<00:02:34.530> and

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
coming back to a Nintendo platform and

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.050 
coming back to a Nintendo platform and
the<00:02:36.010> great<00:02:36.220> thing<00:02:36.400> about<00:02:36.430> having<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:36.819> small

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
the great thing about having a small

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.630 
the great thing about having a small
team<00:02:37.299> is<00:02:37.750> it's<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:38.860> freedom<00:02:39.220> that<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.400> have

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
team is it's the freedom that you have

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.430 
team is it's the freedom that you have
to<00:02:40.030> just<00:02:40.239> do<00:02:40.360> exactly<00:02:40.780> what<00:02:40.959> you<00:02:41.080> want<00:02:41.230> to<00:02:41.319> do

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
to just do exactly what you want to do

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.229 
to just do exactly what you want to do
you<00:02:41.769> can<00:02:41.950> you<00:02:42.220> can<00:02:42.340> visualize<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.970> vision

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
you can you can visualize the vision

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.000 
you can you can visualize the vision
that<00:02:43.330> you<00:02:43.450> have<00:02:43.599> in<00:02:43.720> your<00:02:43.810> head<00:02:44.049> which<00:02:44.709> is<00:02:44.739> very

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
that you have in your head which is very

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.259 
that you have in your head which is very
difficult<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.400> do<00:02:45.519> with<00:02:45.730> a<00:02:45.760> large<00:02:45.970> team

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
difficult to do with a large team

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.060 
difficult to do with a large team
because<00:02:46.720> you<00:02:47.290> know<00:02:47.350> your<00:02:47.530> role<00:02:47.680> gets<00:02:47.890> very

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
because you know your role gets very

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.650 
because you know your role gets very
specialized<00:02:48.609> and<00:02:49.000> you're<00:02:49.120> responsible<00:02:49.600> for

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
specialized and you're responsible for

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.810 
specialized and you're responsible for
only<00:02:49.900> a<00:02:49.959> small<00:02:50.260> part<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:51.370> so<00:02:51.489> that's<00:02:51.670> what<00:02:51.790> I

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
only a small part and so that's what I

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.160 
only a small part and so that's what I
really<00:02:52.090> like<00:02:52.209> about<00:02:52.239> working<00:02:52.570> with<00:02:52.900> a<00:02:52.959> small

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
really like about working with a small

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
really like about working with a small
team

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
team

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.420 
team
I<00:02:54.660> think<00:02:55.660> I<00:02:55.720> would<00:02:55.870> say<00:02:56.020> to<00:02:56.080> the<00:02:56.260> player<00:02:56.440> to

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
I think I would say to the player to

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.430 
I think I would say to the player to
just<00:02:57.790> really<00:02:58.060> relax<00:02:58.390> into<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.960> game<00:02:59.140> it's

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
just really relax into the game it's

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.870 
just really relax into the game it's
it's<00:02:59.680> very<00:02:59.890> but<00:03:00.040> almost<00:03:00.250> like<00:03:00.340> a<00:03:00.460> satellite

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
it's very but almost like a satellite

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.780 
it's very but almost like a satellite
game<00:03:01.240> and<00:03:01.960> when<00:03:02.230> you<00:03:02.320> when<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:02.860> ideally<00:03:03.490> play

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
game and when you when you ideally play

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.790 
game and when you when you ideally play
with<00:03:03.970> headphones<00:03:04.180> on<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:05.260> you<00:03:05.380> just<00:03:05.440> really

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
with headphones on and you just really

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.070 
with headphones on and you just really
sink<00:03:06.070> into<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.400> experience<00:03:06.880> and<00:03:07.540> just<00:03:07.750> enjoy

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
sink into the experience and just enjoy

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.680 
sink into the experience and just enjoy
every<00:03:08.620> kind<00:03:08.860> of<00:03:09.120> every<00:03:10.120> touch<00:03:10.360> and<00:03:10.390> every
