00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.510 
water away from the glove and dries out
as<00:01:36.230> well<00:01:36.380> so<00:01:36.410> pulls<00:01:36.800> the<00:01:36.950> moisture<00:01:37.070> out<00:01:37.340> of<00:01:37.400> the

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
as well so pulls the moisture out of the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.040 
as well so pulls the moisture out of the
glove<00:01:37.700> and<00:01:38.030> allows<00:01:38.330> it<00:01:38.360> to<00:01:38.540> dry<00:01:38.780> really

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
glove and allows it to dry really

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.250 
glove and allows it to dry really
quickly<00:01:39.370> ok<00:01:40.370> so<00:01:40.430> it's<00:01:40.670> a<00:01:40.730> really<00:01:40.880> like

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
quickly ok so it's a really like

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.150 
quickly ok so it's a really like
innovative<00:01:42.260> products<00:01:42.710> or<00:01:42.800> innovative

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
innovative products or innovative

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.620 
innovative products or innovative
material<00:01:43.640> which<00:01:43.760> were<00:01:43.880> color<00:01:44.120> using<00:01:44.360> this

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
material which were color using this

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.450 
material which were color using this
year<00:01:44.900> which<00:01:45.680> is<00:01:45.710> something<00:01:46.040> you're<00:01:46.160> likely<00:01:46.340> to

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
year which is something you're likely to

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.800 
year which is something you're likely to
see<00:01:46.670> and<00:01:46.880> a<00:01:46.910> lot<00:01:46.940> of<00:01:47.120> the<00:01:47.240> suits<00:01:47.450> across<00:01:47.690> the

industry<00:01:48.040> in<00:01:49.040> sort<00:01:49.280> of<00:01:49.310> like<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:49.550> next<00:01:49.730> sort

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
industry in sort of like the next sort

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.640 
industry in sort of like the next sort
of<00:01:49.910> three<00:01:50.090> or<00:01:50.120> four<00:01:50.210> years<00:01:50.390> but<00:01:51.230> at<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.500> moment

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
of three or four years but at the moment

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.070 
of three or four years but at the moment
it's<00:01:51.890> exclusive<00:01:52.340> to<00:01:52.370> Rip<00:01:52.670> Curl<00:01:52.700> and<00:01:53.120> as<00:01:53.840> you

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
it's exclusive to Rip Curl and as you

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.450 
it's exclusive to Rip Curl and as you
can<00:01:54.200> see<00:01:54.290> it's<00:01:54.380> very<00:01:54.410> flurry<00:01:54.830> which<00:01:55.100> makes<00:01:55.340> it

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
can see it's very flurry which makes it

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.220 
can see it's very flurry which makes it
very<00:01:55.490> warm<00:01:55.880> as<00:01:56.120> well<00:01:56.270> so<00:01:56.660> in<00:01:56.780> terms<00:01:56.990> of<00:01:57.170> the

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
very warm as well so in terms of the

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.350 
very warm as well so in terms of the
heat<00:01:57.410> retention<00:01:57.710> within<00:01:58.430> the<00:01:58.640> glove<00:01:58.850> horse<00:01:59.060> or

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
heat retention within the glove horse or

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.240 
heat retention within the glove horse or
boot<00:01:59.630> or<00:01:59.810> sock<00:02:00.050> or<00:02:00.200> anything<00:02:00.350> like<00:02:00.500> that<00:02:00.560> it's

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
boot or sock or anything like that it's

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.710 
boot or sock or anything like that it's
really<00:02:01.670> high<00:02:01.820> with<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.120> soft<00:02:02.330> fleecy

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
really high with the soft fleecy

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.350 
really high with the soft fleecy
material<00:02:03.260> so<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.610> principle<00:02:04.940> benefit<00:02:05.270> is

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
material so the principle benefit is

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.700 
material so the principle benefit is
that<00:02:05.390> you<00:02:05.570> can<00:02:05.690> turn<00:02:05.810> it<00:02:05.960> inside<00:02:06.200> out<00:02:06.230> let<00:02:06.620> it

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
that you can turn it inside out let it

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.830 
that you can turn it inside out let it
to<00:02:06.830> hang<00:02:07.010> and<00:02:07.190> let<00:02:07.790> leave<00:02:08.149> it<00:02:08.269> to<00:02:08.360> hang<00:02:08.539> and<00:02:08.750> let

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
to hang and let leave it to hang and let

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.089 
to hang and let leave it to hang and let
it<00:02:08.929> dry<00:02:09.140> out<00:02:09.289> in<00:02:09.349> 15<00:02:09.619> minutes<00:02:09.890> and<00:02:10.009> you<00:02:10.069> don't

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
it dry out in 15 minutes and you don't

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.100 
it dry out in 15 minutes and you don't
have<00:02:10.369> to<00:02:10.459> put<00:02:10.610> on<00:02:10.640> some<00:02:11.300> wet<00:02:11.510> wet<00:02:11.690> suit<00:02:11.900> boots

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
have to put on some wet wet suit boots

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.210 
have to put on some wet wet suit boots
which<00:02:12.290> is<00:02:12.410> horrible<00:02:12.650> preset

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
which is horrible preset

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.580 
which is horrible preset
therefore<00:02:13.760> for<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.030> day<00:02:14.420> after<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:15.320> it's<00:02:15.530> the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
therefore for the day after and it's the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.830 
therefore for the day after and it's the
same<00:02:15.800> with<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.010> gloves<00:02:16.250> as<00:02:16.400> well<00:02:16.580> but<00:02:17.150> another

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
same with the gloves as well but another

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.570 
same with the gloves as well but another
big<00:02:18.110> sort<00:02:18.380> of<00:02:18.410> like<00:02:18.590> first<00:02:18.890> must<00:02:19.160> point<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:19.430> it

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
big sort of like first must point to it

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.340 
big sort of like first must point to it
is<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.760> fact<00:02:19.910> that<00:02:20.000> it's<00:02:20.210> a<00:02:20.390> really<00:02:21.140> fluffy

can see that they've got a smooth skin
the<00:02:30.260> whole<00:02:30.410> way<00:02:30.530> around<00:02:30.650> makes<00:02:31.310> them<00:02:31.430> very

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
the whole way around makes them very

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.480 
the whole way around makes them very
robust<00:02:31.940> too<00:02:32.090> resistant<00:02:32.510> to<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.720> wind<00:02:32.930> and

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
robust too resistant to the wind and

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.800 
robust too resistant to the wind and
basically<00:02:34.490> gets<00:02:34.850> that<00:02:34.970> nice<00:02:35.120> textured<00:02:35.600> grip

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
basically gets that nice textured grip

basically gets that nice textured grip
so<00:02:36.050> you<00:02:36.080> don't<00:02:36.380> have<00:02:36.590> any<00:02:36.740> sort<00:02:36.890> of<00:02:36.980> compromise

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
so you don't have any sort of compromise

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.790 
so you don't have any sort of compromise
in<00:02:37.580> terms<00:02:37.760> of<00:02:37.910> grip<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.270> handling<00:02:38.800> depending

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
in terms of grip and handling depending

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.860 
in terms of grip and handling depending
on<00:02:39.890> your<00:02:40.040> sort<00:02:40.250> of<00:02:40.280> like<00:02:40.600> tolerance<00:02:41.600> to<00:02:41.780> the

on your sort of like tolerance to the
cold<00:02:42.140> it<00:02:42.650> goes<00:02:42.830> right<00:02:43.070> up<00:02:43.160> to<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.720> 7.75<00:02:44.750> now

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
cold it goes right up to the 7.75 now

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.530 
cold it goes right up to the 7.75 now
interesting<00:02:46.670> thing<00:02:46.820> about<00:02:46.910> these<00:02:47.240> sort<00:02:47.510> of

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
interesting thing about these sort of

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.180 
interesting thing about these sort of
accessories<00:02:48.050> especially<00:02:48.320> the<00:02:48.590> gloves<00:02:48.860> this

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
accessories especially the gloves this

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.500 
accessories especially the gloves this
year<00:02:49.370> is<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:49.700> fact<00:02:49.850> that<00:02:50.060> you've<00:02:50.180> got<00:02:50.209> like

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
year is the fact that you've got like

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.900 
year is the fact that you've got like
three<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.500> five<00:02:51.530> threes<00:02:52.430> and<00:02:52.670> everything

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
three to five threes and everything

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.100 
three to five threes and everything
which<00:02:53.150> sounds<00:02:53.420> a<00:02:53.450> bit<00:02:53.570> confusing<00:02:53.690> because

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
which sounds a bit confusing because

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.720 
which sounds a bit confusing because
it's<00:02:54.290> like<00:02:54.410> a<00:02:54.440> wetsuit<00:02:54.890> but<00:02:55.370> essentially

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
it's like a wetsuit but essentially

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.340 
it's like a wetsuit but essentially
there's<00:02:55.910> two<00:02:56.060> thicknesses<00:02:56.330> of<00:02:56.660> neoprene<00:02:56.900> and

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
there's two thicknesses of neoprene and

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.440 
there's two thicknesses of neoprene and
the<00:02:57.620> reason<00:02:57.890> they've<00:02:58.010> done<00:02:58.190> that<00:02:58.370> is<00:02:59.300> you've

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
the reason they've done that is you've

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.910 
the reason they've done that is you've
got<00:02:59.600> the<00:02:59.720> thinner<00:02:59.930> part<00:03:00.200> around<00:03:00.350> the<00:03:00.590> wrist

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
got the thinner part around the wrist

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.120 
got the thinner part around the wrist
one<00:03:01.459> thing<00:03:01.640> that<00:03:01.670> was<00:03:01.790> common<00:03:02.270> with<00:03:02.630> them<00:03:03.130> wet

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
one thing that was common with them wet

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.640 
one thing that was common with them wet
suit<00:03:04.370> wet<00:03:04.760> suit<00:03:04.940> gloves<00:03:05.200> is<00:03:06.200> that<00:03:06.380> you<00:03:06.440> used<00:03:06.620> to

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
suit wet suit gloves is that you used to

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.710 
suit wet suit gloves is that you used to
have<00:03:06.740> a<00:03:06.830> wet<00:03:07.220> suit<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.910> actual<00:03:08.300> wrist<00:03:08.480> on<00:03:08.630> it

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
have a wet suit the actual wrist on it

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.300 
have a wet suit the actual wrist on it
was<00:03:08.810> quite<00:03:08.990> short<00:03:09.320> because<00:03:09.560> it's<00:03:09.620> Reed<00:03:09.920> chunky

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
was quite short because it's Reed chunky

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.040 
was quite short because it's Reed chunky
if<00:03:10.730> you've<00:03:10.850> got<00:03:10.970> five<00:03:11.209> mil<00:03:11.510> running<00:03:11.810> up<00:03:11.930> your

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
if you've got five mil running up your

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.630 
if you've got five mil running up your
wrist<00:03:12.320> it's<00:03:12.590> really<00:03:12.830> hard<00:03:13.040> to<00:03:13.160> create<00:03:13.310> a<00:03:13.400> fat

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
wrist it's really hard to create a fat

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.250 
wrist it's really hard to create a fat
seal<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.450> so<00:03:14.570> once<00:03:14.750> you've<00:03:14.900> actually<00:03:15.020> got

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
seal and so once you've actually got

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.480 
seal and so once you've actually got
your<00:03:15.290> wet<00:03:15.530> suit<00:03:15.650> going<00:03:15.890> over<00:03:16.070> the<00:03:16.160> top<00:03:16.340> of<00:03:16.370> that

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
your wet suit going over the top of that

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.110 
your wet suit going over the top of that
as<00:03:16.640> well

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
as well

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.820 
as well
you<00:03:17.390> then<00:03:17.570> essentially<00:03:17.989> got<00:03:18.230> eight<00:03:18.410> or<00:03:18.620> nine

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
you then essentially got eight or nine

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.040 
you then essentially got eight or nine
millimeter<00:03:19.310> of<00:03:19.640> neoprene<00:03:20.390> around<00:03:20.780> your<00:03:20.900> wrist

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
millimeter of neoprene around your wrist

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.690 
millimeter of neoprene around your wrist
which<00:03:21.260> is<00:03:21.380> really<00:03:21.830> restrictive<00:03:22.340> really

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
which is really restrictive really

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.100 
which is really restrictive really
chunky<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:23.209> doesn't<00:03:23.510> create<00:03:23.690> a<00:03:23.780> very<00:03:23.959> good

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
chunky and doesn't create a very good

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.199 
chunky and doesn't create a very good
seal<00:03:24.320> so<00:03:25.070> what<00:03:25.220> they've<00:03:25.370> done<00:03:25.400> is<00:03:25.880> they've

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
seal so what they've done is they've

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:27.820 
seal so what they've done is they've
used<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.870> thinner<00:03:27.080> neoprene<00:03:27.470> where<00:03:27.769> you

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
used the thinner neoprene where you

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:28.990 
used the thinner neoprene where you
don't<00:03:28.010> really<00:03:28.160> need<00:03:28.370> walls<00:03:28.580> around<00:03:28.850> your

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
don't really need walls around your

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.290 
don't really need walls around your
wrist

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
wrist

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.370 
wrist
you<00:03:29.420> should<00:03:29.540> doubled<00:03:29.840> up<00:03:29.959> with<00:03:30.140> your<00:03:30.230> wetsuit

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
you should doubled up with your wetsuit

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.380 
you should doubled up with your wetsuit
and<00:03:30.709> walk<00:03:31.370> that<00:03:31.550> right<00:03:31.790> down<00:03:31.910> the<00:03:32.060> wrist<00:03:32.239> to

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
and walk that right down the wrist to

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.390 
and walk that right down the wrist to
create<00:03:32.630> a<00:03:32.660> really<00:03:32.900> good<00:03:33.050> seal<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:33.530> as<00:03:34.190> you<00:03:34.280> can

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
create a really good seal and as you can

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.960 
create a really good seal and as you can
see<00:03:34.640> when<00:03:35.630> you<00:03:35.720> actually<00:03:36.019> slip<00:03:36.290> it<00:03:36.410> off<00:03:36.970> comes

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
see when you actually slip it off comes

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.570 
see when you actually slip it off comes
right<00:03:38.360> up<00:03:38.510> your<00:03:38.630> wrist<00:03:39.160> which<00:03:40.160> i<00:03:40.280> think<00:03:40.340> is

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
right up your wrist which i think is

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.030 
right up your wrist which i think is
fantastic<00:03:40.730> but<00:03:41.570> it's<00:03:41.690> nice<00:03:41.900> and<00:03:42.140> thin<00:03:42.380> so<00:03:42.890> what

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
fantastic but it's nice and thin so what

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.199 
fantastic but it's nice and thin so what
will<00:03:43.130> happen<00:03:43.160> is<00:03:43.519> that<00:03:43.549> with<00:03:43.880> right<00:03:44.060> your

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
will happen is that with right your

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.520 
will happen is that with right your
wrist<00:03:44.390> and<00:03:44.600> then<00:03:44.690> your<00:03:44.840> suit<00:03:45.049> will<00:03:45.170> come<00:03:45.320> over

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
wrist and then your suit will come over

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.620 
wrist and then your suit will come over
here<00:03:45.709> and<00:03:45.890> create<00:03:46.130> a<00:03:46.190> really<00:03:46.400> good<00:03:46.640> seal<00:03:46.940> so

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
here and create a really good seal so

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:48.880 
here and create a really good seal so
you<00:03:47.690> shouldn't<00:03:47.989> actually<00:03:48.260> get<00:03:48.380> any<00:03:48.620> water

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
you shouldn't actually get any water

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.979 
you shouldn't actually get any water

thinner part of newsprint I've been
waiting<00:03:54.380> for<00:03:54.470> someone<00:03:54.590> to<00:03:54.739> do<00:03:54.860> that<00:03:54.890> for<00:03:55.010> quite

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
you've got the taping across there all

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.680 
you've got the taping across there all
the<00:04:02.989> seams<00:04:03.200> as<00:04:03.410> well<00:04:03.560> just<00:04:03.860> runs<00:04:04.070> across<00:04:04.280> here

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
the seams as well just runs across here

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.990 
the seams as well just runs across here
which<00:04:05.690> make<00:04:05.930> them<00:04:06.110> a<00:04:06.140> very<00:04:06.350> robust<00:04:06.769> glove<00:04:07.100> very

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
which make them a very robust glove very

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.699 
which make them a very robust glove very
unlikely<00:04:08.480> unusual<00:04:09.230> that<00:04:09.320> we<00:04:09.440> have<00:04:09.560> any

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
unlikely unusual that we have any

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.740 
unlikely unusual that we have any
problems<00:04:10.160> with<00:04:10.610> rip<00:04:10.820> cold<00:04:11.060> gloves<00:04:11.299> so<00:04:11.510> yeah

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
problems with rip cold gloves so yeah

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.420 
problems with rip cold gloves so yeah
it's<00:04:12.200> a<00:04:12.290> definitely<00:04:12.650> a<00:04:12.709> reliable<00:04:13.070> product<00:04:13.250> it

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
it's a definitely a reliable product it

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.030 
it's a definitely a reliable product it
should<00:04:13.549> last<00:04:13.730> you<00:04:13.910> quite<00:04:14.090> a<00:04:14.180> while<00:04:14.450> and<00:04:15.040> so

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
should last you quite a while and so

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.800 
should last you quite a while and so
that's<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:16.280> three<00:04:16.459> two<00:04:16.669> and<00:04:16.910> that's<00:04:17.419> the<00:04:17.570> sort

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
that's the three two and that's the sort

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.330 
that's the three two and that's the sort
of<00:04:17.870> like<00:04:18.019> flash<00:04:18.320> dry<00:04:18.560> going<00:04:18.799> on<00:04:18.950> inside<00:04:19.190> the

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
and fleecy material and then you've

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.020 
and fleecy material and then you've
obviously<00:04:55.930> got<00:04:56.380> the<00:04:56.440> standard<00:04:57.400> features<00:04:57.760> like

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
obviously got the standard features like

getting so I don't minimize the

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.930 
getting so I don't minimize the
potential<00:07:02.620> for<00:07:02.890> that<00:07:02.950> happening<00:07:03.160> so

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:03.940 
potential for that happening so

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.450 
potential for that happening so
essentially<00:07:04.630> that's<00:07:04.960> the<00:07:05.110> full<00:07:05.460> accessory

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:06.460
