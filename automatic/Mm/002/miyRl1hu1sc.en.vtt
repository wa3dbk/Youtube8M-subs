00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.410
 all this is the thirteenth day of my city 

00:00:11.229 --> 00:00:14.369
 and as you can see, the ban was successful 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:16.820
 because the plants and learning 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.210
 come back upstairs no longer flat 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.309
 so they have survived my wife's pot attempt twice so very happy with it 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.420
 I wanted today 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.669
 the rest also gave the pots 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:33.730
 the spinach kukraak kops after the ice cream 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.350
 I only have a problem today because I don't have enough 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.630
 So tomorrow still has to go to the store quickly 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.690
 so tomorrow I'm going to say all faded 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.580
 and today it was in their own dough I also put it on Facebook and whole 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.430
 nice article 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.950
 about 6 broken and the further course of a vegetable garden 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.470
 and there were still some useful tips in it 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.930
 for example that you because the plants that you actually have to bask in 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.320
 get used to the CLA Buitenhof 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.160
 and that's what they call March making 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.170
 the city is going to say so in the morning 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.860
 nice outside 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.170
 and then at the end of the afternoon already inside 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.210
 there is also a very useful picture and a chart sold separately 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.350
 the long jump 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.409
 I also learned a new word and that is actually 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.340
 what I have done here that says plants makes each other put together 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.450
 once they have emerged so that they have the space to grow 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.270
 played 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.210
 and the article also says 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.210
 bullock the three plants actually fail the most 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.960
 that is forest on ruins nothing with me not even awake 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.320
 and that is temporarily well that grew very difficult for me 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.070
 and otherwise nothing now but not yet awake the city 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.040
 but that is actually the top three 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.730
 well this was day coverage more for today 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.970
 and tomorrow I am going to get started with bottling to see a step more 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.590
 although
