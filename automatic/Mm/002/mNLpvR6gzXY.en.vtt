00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.150
 Hello today, our program to 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.639
 we arrived comes out in a short report 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.170
 Us format that's why on Dmitrovsky 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.600
 avtopoligone Moscow region passes 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.420
 presentation more precisely 1 x new presentation 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.279
 e-mobile around which was very 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.529
 a lot of talk and here he goes 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.420
 brainchild of onexim mihaila 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.789
 Prokhorov and Yarovit were first 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.650
 presented in 2010 and caused 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.510
 A lot of reviews from enthusiastic yes right 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.280
 opposite all for the development of machines 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.690
 and though engineers took it but many of 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.370
 who had no experience in 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.219
 auto industry is such a good saying 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.860
 dog barks caravan goes we try 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.559
 somehow live on it let them scold us 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.000
 we quietly quietly do what 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.469
 we consider it necessary a little bit forced 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.300
 shown that not everything is as bad as 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.300
 draw skeptics 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.670
 here comes the moment of truth and now i'm 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.260
 get behind the wheel of this 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.640
 his mobile and how wonderful he is 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.640
 you learn a little by 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.770
 super look nothing unusual here 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.680
 except that there is no 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.880
 gear lever and in general then 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.480
 that's all 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.440
 but there are a lot of interesting things here 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.590
 wonderful information display 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.090
 which is here brought to the front 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.220
 panel and display with which 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.560
 can be controlled means systems 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.080
 Movement can be climbed on the Internet 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.520
 control the climate control and yet 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.540
 one display which is built into 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.200
 central panel 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.700
 this display it shows the fuel consumption 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.350
 he shows speed and he shows 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.390
 if i understand correctly 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.860
 energy recovery in order to 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.660
 you do not need to touch it 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.760
 have some special knowledge and 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.619
 skills he does not have traditional 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.210
 expensive and traction batteries 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.520
 use large capacitors 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.320
 that charge when braking and 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.890
 give energy a moment of intense 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.050
 acceleration and so with your left hand we shoot with 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.990
 electronic parking is now right 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.110
 hand lever in the drive position and 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.120
 press the accelerator pedal and here 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.930
 ё-mobile smoothly smoothly 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.310
 gently quietly starts to move 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.890
 first impression is enough 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.200
 heavy steering heavy enough steering 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.360
 despite the electric power but let's 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.870
 we will take into account the fact that this car 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.989
 he is still not a serial prototype 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.269
 but you know he rides rides very quietly 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.340
 interesting silence in the car periodically 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.650
 violated by the fact that it turns on 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.140
 internal combustion engine which 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.260
 supplies electricity 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.390
 electric motors 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.350
 thanks to which ё-mobile goes 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.730
 currently under the hood 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.190
 four-cylinder internal engines 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.750
 combustion from fiat but suppliers and mobile 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.940
 not yet approved and everything can 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.410
 change doing even not in the engine which 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.269
 by and large can be any 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.890
 about the electromechanical circuit thanks 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.080
 which crossover can be counted as 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.120
 innovative product to be honest 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.489
 now it is not heard that there is any 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.810
 special insulation new as I have 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.770
 said this type 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.620
 This is a prototype but a prototype that drives and 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:19.550
 and I think that in the future the car will be 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.500
 very quiet and no complaints about the bag 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.720
 to him and will of course be perfect 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.670
 it is not clear how the suspension works 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.110
 especially the rear but the impression is that 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.240
 she will also be in general 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.530
 treason though front strut as far as i am 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.790
 understood from person's taif 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.690
 they generally work perfectly 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.960
 ok and ё-mobile cornering for 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.280
 yourself very well we emphasize that in 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.990
 smooth corners because 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.700
 turns 180 degrees 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.290
 falls on the minimum speed in order 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.030
 the suspension is not separated from the body 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.250
 this procedure was asked to leave for 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.200
 professional testers ema day 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.300
 offers buyers a lot of grace 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.630
 This is primarily the price that is described. 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:59.270
 being small is fuel consumption 7 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.580
 liters in the city and of course the design 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.340
 our car first of all is in 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.440
 In general, it is not even a means of transportation 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.900
 tonic gadget that allow 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.330
 connect as well as the place itself 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.410
 saying get some information and 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.420
 connect it with each other and 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.370
 form a kind of 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.769
 social network 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.419
 she will be seriously different from ordinary 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.530
 networks so that here each staff 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:28.020
 call of his car, then it is in general 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.330
 association of persons it is association 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.310
 individualities from combining letting 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.610
 even somewhere geeks a bunch of people 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:38.940
 who like such information 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.350
 all sorts of interesting bright decisions that 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.180
 while not really 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.470
 must be able to change the wheel 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.050
 in cars and absolutely not 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.630
 wondered what's under his hood and 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:51.960
 In general, of course, and the feeling is curious in 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.030
 the car is quite spacious so you can 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.350
 it's on top it does n't seem so big 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.880
 and here we are sitting now naturally you are not 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.430
 see not operators scroll not 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.410
 instructor tighten armenia here we are three 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.930
 healthy men are placed here 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.270
 completely normal overall owner 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.040
 can accelerate it to 130 kilometers with 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.350
 use up when driving in urban 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.270
 cycle no more than 7 liters of gas for hundreds 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.160
 this is a real figure which is different 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.930
 theoretical calculations big side 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.200
 but it was honestly voiced on 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.000
 press conferences worth noting that 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.810
 the interior he will change and not once 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.820
 what is done now is done for 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.700
 demonstrations and designers 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.830
 will still work though the general concept 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.690
 the interior she will be safe we 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.240
 we hope that the e-mob is waiting for the same 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.229
 fate as Lyovkin vakata to whom 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.789
 erected a monument 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:43.410
 and who lives among the people but because 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:45.539
 we wish good luck to the designer 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:50.210
 designer of ё-mobile by his future 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:50.210
 Good luck to the owners and all the best
