your high-top sneakers with the shots

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.580 
your high-top sneakers with the shots
then<00:01:16.210> what<00:01:16.390> you<00:01:16.509> do<00:01:16.630> is<00:01:16.780> actually<00:01:16.930> fold<00:01:17.320> it

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
then what you do is actually fold it

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.550 
then what you do is actually fold it
here<00:01:17.890> just<00:01:18.400> fold<00:01:18.640> your<00:01:18.700> shorts<00:01:19.290> two<00:01:20.290> rolls

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
here just fold your shorts two rolls

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.630 
here just fold your shorts two rolls
probably<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:23.530> that<00:01:23.680> you<00:01:23.800> know<00:01:23.890> your<00:01:24.070> legs<00:01:24.340> show

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
probably so that you know your legs show

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.620 
probably so that you know your legs show
more<00:01:24.940> and<00:01:25.420> it<00:01:25.990> looks<00:01:26.350> a<00:01:26.530> little<00:01:26.860> better<00:01:27.630> like

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
more and it looks a little better like

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.040 
more and it looks a little better like
this

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
this

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.770 
this

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
here so they need to be slightly low-cut

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.370

yep<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.399> that's<00:02:05.610> my<00:02:05.820> number<00:02:06.000> one<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.780> loafers

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
yep so that's my number one the loafers

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.760 
yep so that's my number one the loafers
now<00:02:08.130> onto<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.610> second<00:02:09.030> one<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.420> suggest<00:02:10.229> a

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
now onto the second one I suggest a

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.460 
now onto the second one I suggest a
low-cut<00:02:11.310> Snickers<00:02:11.790> where<00:02:12.300> these<00:02:12.530> shop<00:02:15.470> again

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
low-cut Snickers where these shop again

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.710 
low-cut Snickers where these shop again
this<00:02:16.650> will<00:02:16.890> show<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.130> ankle<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:18.209> that<00:02:18.239> is<00:02:18.540> what

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
this will show the ankle so that is what

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.449 
this will show the ankle so that is what
I<00:02:18.750> told<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:19.230> about<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.620> thumb<00:02:19.860> rule<00:02:20.069> show

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
I told you about the thumb rule show

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.170 
I told you about the thumb rule show
your<00:02:20.640> ankle

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.229 

so<00:02:23.750> any<00:02:23.959> sneakers<00:02:24.560> that<00:02:24.890> actually<00:02:25.400> cut<00:02:25.700> low<00:02:25.970> on

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
so any sneakers that actually cut low on

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.000 
so any sneakers that actually cut low on
your<00:02:26.390> ankles<00:02:26.900> have<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.200> good<00:02:27.470> chance<00:02:27.769> of

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.789 
your ankles have a good chance of
looking<00:02:28.519> good<00:02:28.549> with<00:02:28.909> your<00:02:29.120> shots<00:02:29.379> this<00:02:30.379> one<00:02:30.650> is

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
cut in a curve whereas you can also

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.229 
cut in a curve whereas you can also
choose<00:02:32.989> this<00:02:33.290> one<00:02:33.530> this<00:02:33.739> one<00:02:33.950> just<00:02:34.700> cuts<00:02:35.030> at

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
choose this one this one just cuts at

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.010 
choose this one this one just cuts at
the<00:02:35.659> ankle

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.200 

now<00:02:39.590> this<00:02:39.800> is<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.040> variation<00:02:40.610> of<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.850> low-cut

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
now this is the variation of the low-cut

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.600 
now this is the variation of the low-cut
with<00:02:41.450> finishes<00:02:42.110> just<00:02:42.140> at<00:02:42.770> the<00:02:42.950> ankle<00:02:43.370> these

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
with finishes just at the ankle these

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.400 
with finishes just at the ankle these
also<00:02:43.910> look<00:02:44.150> really<00:02:44.540> well<00:02:44.720> with<00:02:44.960> the<00:02:45.050> shorts

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
also look really well with the shorts

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.560 
also look really well with the shorts
and<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:45.950> third<00:02:46.190> one<00:02:46.370> is<00:02:46.520> flip-flops<00:02:47.090> they<00:02:47.360> are

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
and the third one is flip-flops they are

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.360 
and the third one is flip-flops they are
a<00:02:47.600> bit<00:02:47.960> casual<00:02:48.410> but<00:02:48.590> still<00:02:48.800> you<00:02:48.920> can<00:02:49.070> wear<00:02:49.220> it

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
a bit casual but still you can wear it

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.400 
a bit casual but still you can wear it
to<00:02:49.460> certain<00:02:49.820> locations<00:02:49.880> with<00:02:50.420> this<00:02:50.690> outfit<00:02:51.170> I

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
to certain locations with this outfit I

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.170 
to certain locations with this outfit I
think<00:02:51.620> white<00:02:52.010> flip-flops<00:02:52.580> will<00:02:52.820> look<00:02:52.940> really

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
think white flip-flops will look really

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.160 
think white flip-flops will look really
nice<00:02:54.700> so<00:02:55.700> it<00:02:55.820> telling<00:02:56.270> me<00:02:56.390> I<00:02:56.420> need<00:02:56.660> to<00:02:56.810> wear<00:02:56.960> all
