00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.449 
down where at the end of the level which
is<00:02:21.610> probably<00:02:21.910> around<00:02:22.060> it<00:02:22.480> somewhere<00:02:23.370> so<00:02:24.370> you

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
is probably around it somewhere so you

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:25.830 
is probably around it somewhere so you
can<00:02:24.580> just<00:02:24.670> do<00:02:24.850> that<00:02:24.880> and<00:02:25.030> you<00:02:25.300> know<00:02:25.360> one<00:02:25.510> every

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
can just do that and you know one every

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.800 
can just do that and you know one every
week<00:02:26.020> instead<00:02:26.920> of<00:02:27.130> waiting<00:02:27.490> if<00:02:28.360> you<00:02:28.480> feel<00:02:28.660> like

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
week instead of waiting if you feel like

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.560 
week instead of waiting if you feel like
waiting<00:02:29.170> in<00:02:29.260> game<00:02:29.500> time<00:02:29.740> for<00:02:30.280> seven<00:02:30.880> days<00:02:31.000> I'm

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
waiting in game time for seven days I'm

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.560 
waiting in game time for seven days I'm
pretty<00:02:31.900> sure<00:02:32.100> that<00:02:33.100> one<00:02:33.430> or<00:02:34.060> you<00:02:34.239> can<00:02:34.300> just

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
pretty sure that one or you can just

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.960 
pretty sure that one or you can just
fast<00:02:35.200> travel<00:02:35.770> like<00:02:36.400> a<00:02:36.430> whole<00:02:36.640> bunch<00:02:38.820> which<00:02:39.820> I

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
fast travel like a whole bunch which I

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:51.820 
fast travel like a whole bunch which I
think<00:02:40.209> probably<00:02:40.480> be<00:02:40.780> easier<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:43.690> I'm<00:02:43.810> just

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.890 

you
