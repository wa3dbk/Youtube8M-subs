you<00:04:31.740> because<00:04:32.430> it<00:04:32.550> says<00:04:32.760> on<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.090> website<00:04:33.210> that

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
you because it says on the website that

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.350 
you because it says on the website that
it<00:04:33.930> doesn't<00:04:34.620> overheat<00:04:34.800> which<00:04:35.400> is<00:04:35.610> awesome

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
it doesn't overheat which is awesome

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.070 
it doesn't overheat which is awesome
so<00:04:36.570> I<00:04:36.870> really<00:04:37.710> like<00:04:37.890> that<00:04:38.720> and<00:04:39.720> then<00:04:39.930> I'm<00:04:40.050> just

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
so I really like that and then I'm just

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:47.560 
so I really like that and then I'm just
going<00:04:40.530> to<00:04:40.590> go<00:04:41.070> over<00:04:41.720> the<00:04:42.720> other<00:04:42.930> lashes

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:58.760 

and<00:04:52.880> doing<00:04:53.880> that<00:04:54.180> and<00:04:56.930> this<00:04:57.930> is<00:04:58.139> how<00:04:58.320> my<00:04:58.500> lashes

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
and doing that and this is how my lashes

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.270 
and doing that and this is how my lashes
look<00:04:59.190> with<00:04:59.610> the<00:04:59.850> lash<00:05:00.120> wand<00:05:00.449> as<00:05:00.889> much<00:05:01.889> as<00:05:02.100> they

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
look with the lash wand as much as they

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.360 
look with the lash wand as much as they
are<00:05:02.460> curl<00:05:03.120> they<00:05:03.630> do<00:05:03.690> have<00:05:04.050> that<00:05:04.080> curl<00:05:04.680> but<00:05:05.160> they

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
are curl they do have that curl but they

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.870 
are curl they do have that curl but they
don't<00:05:05.550> have<00:05:05.790> the<00:05:06.150> lift<00:05:06.630> that<00:05:07.260> I<00:05:07.729> would<00:05:08.729> have

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
don't have the lift that I would have

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.860 
don't have the lift that I would have
expected<00:05:09.389> and<00:05:10.160> this<00:05:11.160> is<00:05:11.430> a<00:05:11.690> difference<00:05:12.690> so

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
expected and this is a difference so

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.240 
expected and this is a difference so
this<00:05:13.080> is<00:05:13.229> the<00:05:13.350> last<00:05:13.500> one<00:05:13.650> as<00:05:13.770> you<00:05:13.860> can<00:05:13.979> see<00:05:14.130> the

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
this is the last one as you can see the

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.250 
this is the last one as you can see the
curl<00:05:14.460> starting<00:05:14.790> to<00:05:14.910> go<00:05:15.030> down<00:05:15.210> on<00:05:15.419> this<00:05:15.600> side<00:05:15.660> so

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
curl starting to go down on this side so

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.310 
curl starting to go down on this side so
that's<00:05:16.860> kind<00:05:17.130> of<00:05:17.160> disappointing<00:05:17.810> actually<00:05:18.810> I

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
that's kind of disappointing actually I

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.990 
that's kind of disappointing actually I
think<00:05:19.650> I'll<00:05:19.770> zoom<00:05:20.010> in<00:05:20.190> so<00:05:20.370> you<00:05:20.430> guys<00:05:20.550> can<00:05:20.820> see

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
think I'll zoom in so you guys can see

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.520 
think I'll zoom in so you guys can see
this<00:05:21.180> better<00:05:22.250> okay<00:05:23.250> there<00:05:23.460> we<00:05:23.520> go

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
this better okay there we go

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:33.820 
this better okay there we go
so<00:05:25.530> let's<00:05:25.770> take<00:05:26.039> the<00:05:26.250> lash<00:05:26.490> wand

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.559 

and<00:05:34.370> that's<00:05:35.180> the<00:05:35.690> curl<00:05:36.289> pretty<00:05:36.800> much<00:05:37.389> I'm<00:05:38.389> not

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:38.569 
and that's the curl pretty much I'm not

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:41.260 
and that's the curl pretty much I'm not
really<00:05:38.750> seeing<00:05:39.169> any<00:05:39.620> difference<00:05:40.460> leaving<00:05:41.150> it

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
really seeing any difference leaving it

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.800 
really seeing any difference leaving it
on<00:05:41.419> longer<00:05:42.099> this<00:05:43.099> is<00:05:43.220> pretty<00:05:43.430> much<00:05:43.729> it<00:05:43.970> so<00:05:44.360> this

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
on longer this is pretty much it so this

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.619 
on longer this is pretty much it so this
is<00:05:44.870> the<00:05:45.050> lash<00:05:45.470> wand<00:05:45.800> eye<00:05:46.069> and<00:05:46.400> then<00:05:46.849> this<00:05:47.060> is<00:05:47.330> my

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:14.830 
cons go as you can see in the video it
took<00:06:10.580> me<00:06:10.819> a<00:06:10.849> while<00:06:11.150> to<00:06:11.949> curl<00:06:12.949> my<00:06:13.099> lashes<00:06:13.129> I<00:06:13.840> had

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
took me a while to curl my lashes I had

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.260 
took me a while to curl my lashes I had
to<00:06:15.370> use<00:06:16.370> the<00:06:16.580> wand

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
to use the wand

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.570 
to use the wand
maybe<00:06:17.569> two<00:06:17.930> or<00:06:18.110> three<00:06:18.139> times<00:06:18.379> just<00:06:19.219> on<00:06:19.400> that

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
maybe two or three times just on that

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.360 
maybe two or three times just on that
one<00:06:19.879> eye<00:06:20.090> I<00:06:20.419> did<00:06:20.780> have<00:06:20.960> a<00:06:20.990> curl<00:06:21.469> but<00:06:21.949> it<00:06:22.099> didn't

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 
one eye I did have a curl but it didn't

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.249 
one eye I did have a curl but it didn't
have<00:06:22.520> the<00:06:22.729> lift<00:06:23.030> that<00:06:23.180> I<00:06:23.300> was<00:06:23.419> looking<00:06:23.750> for<00:06:24.020> and

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:24.259 
have the lift that I was looking for and

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:26.800 
have the lift that I was looking for and
you<00:06:24.860> didn't<00:06:25.190> see<00:06:25.340> it<00:06:25.370> in<00:06:25.550> the<00:06:25.669> video<00:06:25.969> but<00:06:26.210> after

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810 
you didn't see it in the video but after

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.959 
you didn't see it in the video but after
I<00:06:26.840> used<00:06:27.289> the<00:06:27.409> wand<00:06:27.710> I<00:06:27.949> did<00:06:28.159> get<00:06:28.310> some<00:06:28.520> clumping

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:28.969 
I used the wand I did get some clumping

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:31.869 
I used the wand I did get some clumping
on<00:06:29.180> my<00:06:29.330> lashes<00:06:29.539> and<00:06:29.990> I<00:06:30.530> don't<00:06:30.800> like<00:06:30.949> clumps<00:06:31.669> of

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:31.879 
on my lashes and I don't like clumps of

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:35.499 
on my lashes and I don't like clumps of
mascara<00:06:32.659> on<00:06:32.870> my<00:06:32.930> lashes<00:06:33.759> another<00:06:34.759> thing<00:06:35.090> was

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:35.509 
mascara on my lashes another thing was

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:38.649 
mascara on my lashes another thing was
that<00:06:35.870> I<00:06:36.650> noticed<00:06:37.550> that<00:06:37.729> some<00:06:37.909> of<00:06:38.000> the<00:06:38.090> mascara

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:38.659 
that I noticed that some of the mascara

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:41.830 
that I noticed that some of the mascara
came<00:06:38.990> off<00:06:39.310> so<00:06:40.310> a<00:06:40.580> lot<00:06:40.909> of<00:06:40.940> lashes<00:06:41.449> look<00:06:41.569> really

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 
came off so a lot of lashes look really

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.170 
came off so a lot of lashes look really
that<00:06:41.960> and<00:06:42.110> even<00:06:42.500> like<00:06:42.650> in<00:06:42.830> some<00:06:43.159> areas<00:06:43.580> it<00:06:43.819> was

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180 
that and even like in some areas it was

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.809 
that and even like in some areas it was
thick<00:06:45.080> and<00:06:45.349> then<00:06:45.830> on<00:06:46.039> some<00:06:46.250> areas<00:06:46.610> they<00:06:46.759> were

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:46.819 
thick and then on some areas they were

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:50.980 
thick and then on some areas they were
just<00:06:47.060> my<00:06:47.180> thin<00:06:47.479> bare<00:06:48.229> lashes<00:06:48.860> and<00:06:49.659> as<00:06:50.659> you

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:50.990 
just my thin bare lashes and as you

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.140 
just my thin bare lashes and as you
could<00:06:51.199> see<00:06:51.440> that<00:06:51.710> it<00:06:51.979> started<00:06:52.580> to<00:06:52.759> lose<00:06:52.940> its

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.150 
could see that it started to lose its

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.450 
could see that it started to lose its
curl<00:06:53.419> and<00:06:53.659> my<00:06:53.810> lashes<00:06:54.229> we're<00:06:54.469> back<00:06:54.620> to<00:06:55.099> being

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:55.460 
curl and my lashes we're back to being

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.809

straight<00:06:55.789> on<00:06:55.969> the<00:06:56.539> ends<00:06:57.199> so<00:06:57.610> what<00:06:58.610> I<00:06:58.639> recommend

00:06:58.809 --> 00:06:58.819 
straight on the ends so what I recommend

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:02.589 
straight on the ends so what I recommend
this<00:06:59.330> product<00:06:59.690> to<00:06:59.840> a<00:06:59.900> friend<00:07:00.289> not<00:07:01.250> really<00:07:01.909> this

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:02.599 
this product to a friend not really this

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:05.320 
this product to a friend not really this
is<00:07:02.810> just<00:07:03.080> one<00:07:03.469> of<00:07:03.500> those<00:07:03.770> I<00:07:03.830> guess<00:07:04.120> items<00:07:05.120> that

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:05.330 
is just one of those I guess items that

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.279 
is just one of those I guess items that
collect<00:07:05.659> dust<00:07:06.050> in<00:07:06.349> my<00:07:06.469> drawer<00:07:07.090> but<00:07:08.090> other<00:07:09.020> than

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:09.289 
collect dust in my drawer but other than

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:12.399 
collect dust in my drawer but other than
that<00:07:09.349> I<00:07:09.889> didn't<00:07:10.490> really<00:07:10.879> find<00:07:11.629> this<00:07:11.930> product

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:12.409 
that I didn't really find this product

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:14.890 
that I didn't really find this product
too<00:07:12.650> unique<00:07:13.099> or<00:07:13.400> something<00:07:14.389> that<00:07:14.539> I<00:07:14.690> would

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:14.900 
too unique or something that I would

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.980 
too unique or something that I would
swear<00:07:15.289> by<00:07:15.560> but<00:07:16.460> that's<00:07:16.699> just<00:07:16.969> my<00:07:17.210> opinion

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:17.990 
swear by but that's just my opinion

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.930 
swear by but that's just my opinion
I<00:07:18.020> guess<00:07:18.740> this<00:07:18.919> product<00:07:19.370> would<00:07:19.550> work<00:07:19.729> better

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:19.940 
I guess this product would work better

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.580 
I guess this product would work better
for<00:07:20.150> people<00:07:20.210> that<00:07:20.509> have<00:07:20.659> naturally<00:07:21.199> curly
