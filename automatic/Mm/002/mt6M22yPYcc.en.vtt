there<00:02:02.500> that<00:02:03.179> enables<00:02:04.179> you<00:02:04.299> to<00:02:04.330> lift<00:02:04.630> off<00:02:05.159> the

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
there that enables you to lift off the

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.400 
there that enables you to lift off the
connector<00:02:07.080> as<00:02:08.080> such<00:02:08.440> and<00:02:08.890> there<00:02:09.160> you<00:02:09.250> go<00:02:10.410> now

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
connector as such and there you go now

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.880 
connector as such and there you go now
replacing<00:02:12.069> a<00:02:12.160> new<00:02:13.000> keyboard<00:02:13.269> in<00:02:13.720> there<00:02:13.959> is<00:02:14.170> as

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
replacing a new keyboard in there is as

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.930 
replacing a new keyboard in there is as
simple<00:02:15.400> as<00:02:15.489> reversing<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.450> whole<00:02:16.630> procedure

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
simple as reversing the whole procedure

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.370 
simple as reversing the whole procedure
so<00:02:18.940> first<00:02:19.239> of<00:02:19.420> all<00:02:19.510> we<00:02:19.690> put<00:02:19.930> back<00:02:20.170> the

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
so first of all we put back the

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.069 
so first of all we put back the
connector<00:02:20.829> just<00:02:21.010> by<00:02:21.819> pressing<00:02:22.269> it<00:02:22.390> down<00:02:22.600> nice

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.079 
connector just by pressing it down nice

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:23.610 
connector just by pressing it down nice
and<00:02:23.109> gently

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
and gently

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.210 
and gently
and<00:02:24.510> then<00:02:25.510> placing<00:02:26.049> that<00:02:26.200> tab<00:02:26.590> back<00:02:26.829> where<00:02:27.100> it

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
and then placing that tab back where it

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.750 
and then placing that tab back where it
belongs

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
belongs

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.150 
belongs
and<00:02:28.440> closing<00:02:29.440> that<00:02:29.620> safety<00:02:30.100> catch

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.190 

all<00:02:34.670> right<00:02:34.790> and<00:02:35.060> we<00:02:35.270> simply<00:02:35.690> slide<00:02:35.900> the

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
all right and we simply slide the

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.800 
all right and we simply slide the
keyboard<00:02:36.680> back<00:02:36.920> down<00:02:37.460> towards<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.510> front<00:02:38.750> of

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
keyboard back down towards the front of

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.470 
keyboard back down towards the front of
the<00:02:38.900> computer<00:02:39.050> and<00:02:39.590> lay<00:02:40.520> that<00:02:40.550> back<00:02:41.000> and<00:02:41.270> all

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
the computer and lay that back and all

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.510 
the computer and lay that back and all
those<00:02:41.690> three<00:02:42.110> holes<00:02:42.350> along<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.740> top<00:02:43.040> should

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
those three holes along the top should

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.050 
those three holes along the top should
line<00:02:43.730> up<00:02:43.760> again<00:02:44.980> then<00:02:45.980> it's<00:02:46.160> a<00:02:46.250> case<00:02:46.460> of<00:02:46.490> simply

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
line up again then it's a case of simply

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.480 
line up again then it's a case of simply
screwing<00:02:47.420> those<00:02:47.750> three<00:02:48.200> screws<00:02:48.530> back<00:02:49.250> in

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
screwing those three screws back in

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.130 
screwing those three screws back in
probably<00:02:50.030> not<00:02:50.300> a<00:02:50.330> good<00:02:50.480> idea<00:02:50.540> to<00:02:50.870> leave<00:02:50.990> the

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
probably not a good idea to leave the

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:59.130 
probably not a good idea to leave the
screws<00:02:51.410> on<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.650> screen<00:02:51.950> though<00:02:52.100> like<00:02:52.340> I<00:02:52.490> did

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.690 

it's<00:03:00.140> a<00:03:00.170> very<00:03:00.379> simple<00:03:00.799> process<00:03:01.069> as<00:03:01.430> you<00:03:01.549> can

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
it's a very simple process as you can

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.580 
it's a very simple process as you can
see<00:03:01.939> to<00:03:02.209> simply<00:03:03.670> change<00:03:04.670> over<00:03:04.909> a<00:03:05.000> keyboard

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
see to simply change over a keyboard

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.160 
see to simply change over a keyboard
this<00:03:06.590> process<00:03:07.099> is<00:03:07.280> also<00:03:07.689> enables<00:03:08.689> you<00:03:08.840> to<00:03:08.870> gain

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
this process is also enables you to gain

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.699 
this process is also enables you to gain
access<00:03:09.500> to<00:03:09.829> the<00:03:10.129> internal<00:03:10.819> RAM<00:03:11.060> that's<00:03:11.709> inside

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
access to the internal RAM that's inside

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.399 
access to the internal RAM that's inside
the<00:03:12.859> inside<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.939> computer<00:03:14.420> so<00:03:15.079> if<00:03:15.140> you<00:03:15.230> want

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:15.409 
the inside the computer so if you want

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:17.050 
the inside the computer so if you want
to<00:03:15.470> take<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.769> machine<00:03:16.099> from<00:03:16.340> a<00:03:16.519> standard<00:03:16.849> to

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
to take the machine from a standard to

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.349 
to take the machine from a standard to
gigabytes<00:03:17.359> up<00:03:17.900> to<00:03:18.220> four<00:03:19.220> gigabytes<00:03:19.700> in<00:03:19.879> the<00:03:19.939> d6

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
gigabytes up to four gigabytes in the d6

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.360 
gigabytes up to four gigabytes in the d6
30s<00:03:20.810> what<00:03:21.379> we<00:03:21.439> have<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:21.680> do<00:03:21.829> is<00:03:21.950> remove<00:03:22.310> the

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
30s what we have to do is remove the

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.339 
30s what we have to do is remove the
keyboards<00:03:23.000> so<00:03:23.150> that<00:03:23.269> you<00:03:23.390> can<00:03:23.569> gain<00:03:23.780> access<00:03:24.079> to

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
keyboards so that you can gain access to

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:25.629 
keyboards so that you can gain access to
the<00:03:24.620> internal<00:03:25.250> Ram

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:25.639 
the internal Ram

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.869 
the internal Ram
there's<00:03:26.090> also<00:03:26.290> RAM<00:03:27.290> on<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:27.769> other<00:03:27.950> side<00:03:28.250> now

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
there's also RAM on the other side now

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:30.429 
there's also RAM on the other side now
as<00:03:29.030> you<00:03:29.150> can<00:03:29.299> see<00:03:29.480> there<00:03:29.750> I'm<00:03:29.870> just<00:03:30.049> replacing

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:30.439 
as you can see there I'm just replacing

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:33.789 
as you can see there I'm just replacing
back<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.159> power<00:03:32.120> strip<00:03:32.480> and<00:03:32.780> that<00:03:33.500> just

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
back the power strip and that just

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.069 
back the power strip and that just
simply<00:03:34.159> slides<00:03:34.549> in<00:03:34.819> on<00:03:35.239> to<00:03:35.450> the<00:03:35.569> left-hand

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
simply slides in on to the left-hand

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.039 
simply slides in on to the left-hand
side<00:03:36.200> and<00:03:36.680> then<00:03:37.519> it<00:03:37.879> just<00:03:38.090> pushes<00:03:38.329> back<00:03:38.659> in<00:03:38.900> it

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
side and then it just pushes back in it

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.720 
side and then it just pushes back in it
will<00:03:39.200> make<00:03:39.379> a<00:03:39.409> few<00:03:39.709> funny<00:03:39.950> sounds<00:03:40.459> as<00:03:40.609> it

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
will make a few funny sounds as it

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.449 
will make a few funny sounds as it
crunches<00:03:41.329> back<00:03:41.510> in<00:03:41.659> this<00:03:41.810> place<00:03:42.139> but<00:03:42.560> it

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
crunches back in this place but it

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.640 
crunches back in this place but it
shouldn't<00:03:44.000> do<00:03:44.090> any<00:03:44.269> damage<00:03:44.659> so<00:03:44.930> just<00:03:45.470> press

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
shouldn't do any damage so just press

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.770 
shouldn't do any damage so just press
that<00:03:45.709> down<00:03:45.919> nice<00:03:46.280> and<00:03:46.340> gently<00:03:46.579> until<00:03:47.269> it<00:03:47.389> sits

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
that down nice and gently until it sits

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.699 
that down nice and gently until it sits
flat<00:03:48.079> and<00:03:49.150> then<00:03:50.150> you<00:03:50.299> should<00:03:50.359> be<00:03:50.689> done<00:03:50.900> it

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
flat and then you should be done it

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.409 
flat and then you should be done it
should<00:03:51.769> be<00:03:51.950> a<00:03:52.040> case<00:03:52.370> of<00:03:52.400> then<00:03:52.730> putting<00:03:53.209> the

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:53.419 
should be a case of then putting the

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:55.420 
should be a case of then putting the
battery<00:03:53.780> back<00:03:53.930> into<00:03:54.439> position<00:03:54.590> on<00:03:55.069> the<00:03:55.189> front
