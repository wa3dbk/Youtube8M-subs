00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 and so the first thing to start with is 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.930
 Of course landing landing is very important 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.970
 why because if you are wrong 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.500
 you sit on your movement you are shackled 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.540
 limited in your actions and you're in 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.690
 principle can not adequately play 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.340
 something either legs or hands 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.410
 everything starts directly from the chair 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.720
 that is, I'm sitting a little higher than 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.609
 speak in books and in various there 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.350
 give me my thighs now 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.080
 located just above the floor parallel 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.060
 but is it so bad or good 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.650
 what difference is just convenient for me 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.079
 play accordingly you must 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.250
 experiment with landing on a chair 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.690
 and understand define for yourself comfortable. 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.860
 maybe you'll sit a little lower 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.690
 maybe a little higher maybe 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.829
 right with the floor is absolutely everything 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.440
 Equally important that you feel comfortable 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.140
 here next is of course the back 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.160
 straighten your back and sit down, put your hands straight and 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.600
 now just lift your forearm and 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.239
 relax your brushes i mean they are just 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.030
 in a relaxed position hang lowered 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.430
 hands and raised your hands it's all your main 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.780
 position when you sit behind 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.390
 you don't need a drum set like that 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.670
 strain does not need to squeeze hands 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.100
 you just relaxed them and accordingly 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.909
 sit like that on let's talk about 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.100
 how you strike initially 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.680
 you can just try to play by 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.930
 hand drums i.e. do for example 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.810
 Here are the actions that is to 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.780
 a little bit to understand the mechanics of the blow as 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.579
 would it not look funny yes but it 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.470
 very useful exercise 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.540
 feature never worked before 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.570
 let's talk on the drums now 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.079
 a little bit about grabs for sure you saw that 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.090
 There are such grip and what grip and 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.280
 such grip and and 1 drummer 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.079
 American him on the stomach so I play 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.229
 as a child I thought that I grab thought 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.840
 It turns out I'm not just that convenient 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.140
 really play with your fingers that's why 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.250
 principle difference in grips 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:01.400
 I will touch only one aspect 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.140
 maximum sound dynamics and that is in 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.909
 one grip for example here is his 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.929
 called g-man type did not set that is 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:11.120
 american german style 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.950
 German is the maximum 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.650
 so let's say grip when you can 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.320
 as strong as possible 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.120
 get the strongest powerful sound possible 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.459
 rather than when you play like that 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.590
 more when so here you left 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.270
 arm of course can achieve heavy 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.760
 sound but already quite complicated and 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.920
 most likely that is why in rock he is not 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.280
 very much in demand we will be with you 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:38.030
 come from the German grip since he 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.610
 firstly easier for beginner levels and 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.950
 he is very powerful we need to do 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.470
 we proceed from our position which is for you 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.410
 already shown we raise our hand and here in 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.370
 this brush we put between the middle and 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.130
 thumb 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.040
 drumstick it looks like this 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.549
 that is, I just take the middle and 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.290
 index and middle and thumb 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.510
 by the wand and I hold it 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.420
 I just wrap my fingers around 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.390
 and my hand is not strong clamped and 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.880
 relaxed here this is German 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.709
 watt is the main point many 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.750
 make 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.260
 the lock is not between middle and y and large 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.310
 finger 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.450
 and between the index and thumb 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.329
 can you imagine that you have here 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.970
 we drilled your two fingers 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:29.450
 secured and she here you like this 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:32.989
 here is also fixed in principle option 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.450
 also use define yourself can I 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.739
 clamping and so and so all using these 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:43.250
 two two techniques if you can call it that 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:46.820
 next you took the second hand wand with not 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.320
 did the same thing you sat behind the drum 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.390
 or for a training pad 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.450
 what was at your fingertips just hanging there 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.430
 for the pillow as I did in my childhood 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.799
 accordingly, we have a position in the center 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.430
 the drum roughly makes up a triangle 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:03.769
 90 degrees is about 90 degrees that is 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.450
 so here you are sitting behind the shock 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.280
 installation accordingly from such 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:13.190
 position as simple as possible 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:15.140
 strike blows and you already 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:19.120
 can, in principle, this is the start 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.120
 your launch pad
