a<00:00:24.510> part<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.080> in<00:00:25.260> fact<00:00:25.439> it's<00:00:25.710> one<00:00:25.890> reason

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
a part of you in fact it's one reason

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.950 
a part of you in fact it's one reason
why<00:00:26.279> it's<00:00:26.460> really<00:00:26.699> hard<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.119> make<00:00:27.300> robots<00:00:27.570> that

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
why it's really hard to make robots that

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.050 
why it's really hard to make robots that
walk<00:00:28.199> like<00:00:28.410> humans<00:00:28.830> because<00:00:29.519> when<00:00:29.699> we<00:00:29.820> walk

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
walk like humans because when we walk

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.620 
walk like humans because when we walk
our<00:00:30.630> body<00:00:30.929> bounces<00:00:31.590> itself<00:00:31.980> out<00:00:32.189> by<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.030> torso

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
our body bounces itself out by the torso

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.069 
our body bounces itself out by the torso
moving<00:00:34.050> against<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:35.219> leg<00:00:35.460> movement<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.870> this

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
moving against the leg movement so this

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.930 
moving against the leg movement so this
is<00:00:37.290> kind<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.590> body<00:00:37.770> motion<00:00:37.980> if<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.550> stand<00:00:38.820> in

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
is kind of body motion if I stand in

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.880 
is kind of body motion if I stand in
front<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.329> if<00:00:39.750> we<00:00:39.899> can<00:00:40.050> exaggerate<00:00:40.410> this

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
front of you if we can exaggerate this

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.130 
front of you if we can exaggerate this
motion<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:42.090> if<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.329> step<00:00:42.510> with<00:00:42.690> my<00:00:42.840> right<00:00:42.870> foot

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
motion so if I step with my right foot

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.869 
motion so if I step with my right foot
forward<00:00:43.890> I'm<00:00:44.100> going<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.340> take<00:00:44.460> my<00:00:44.640> right

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
forward I'm going to take my right

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:54.920 
forward I'm going to take my right
shoulder<00:00:45.360> back<00:00:53.570> so<00:00:54.570> here's<00:00:54.750> what<00:00:54.899> that

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
shoulder back so here's what that

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.540 
shoulder back so here's what that
counter<00:00:55.320> body<00:00:55.500> motion<00:00:55.890> looks<00:00:56.070> like<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.460> our

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
counter body motion looks like in our

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:07.520 
counter body motion looks like in our
basics<00:01:05.210> I'm<00:01:06.210> just<00:01:06.420> exaggerating<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.200> little

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
basics I'm just exaggerating it a little

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:24.610 
basics I'm just exaggerating it a little
bit<00:01:07.650> not<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.920> whole<00:01:08.159> up

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.840 

so<00:01:25.620> now<00:01:25.740> we're<00:01:25.830> going<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:25.979> talk<00:01:26.130> about<00:01:26.250> torso

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
so now we're going to talk about torso

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.230 
so now we're going to talk about torso
