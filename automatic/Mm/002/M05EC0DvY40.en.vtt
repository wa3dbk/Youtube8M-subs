00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.559 
modes sorry if I got about half the
combined<00:02:38.069> modes<00:02:38.370> are<00:02:38.760> usually<00:02:39.599> really<00:02:39.959> bad<00:02:40.409> um

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
combined modes are usually really bad um

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.990 
combined modes are usually really bad um
they<00:02:42.620> they<00:02:43.620> don't<00:02:43.769> I<00:02:43.980> mean<00:02:44.340> they're<00:02:44.640> not<00:02:44.790> I

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
they they don't I mean they're not I

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.990 
they they don't I mean they're not I
mean<00:02:45.510> combine<00:02:45.900> modes<00:02:46.530> are<00:02:46.890> always<00:02:47.250> really

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
mean combine modes are always really

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.280 
mean combine modes are always really
badly<00:02:48.299> articulated<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:50.180> there's<00:02:51.180> no<00:02:51.750> lag

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
badly articulated and there's no lag

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.000 
badly articulated and there's no lag
articulation<00:02:53.159> because<00:02:53.549> these<00:02:53.730> are<00:02:53.909> pegged<00:02:54.150> in

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
articulation because these are pegged in

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.770 
articulation because these are pegged in
you<00:02:56.010> can't<00:02:56.280> mean<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.639> board<00:02:57.030> otherwise

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
you can't mean the board otherwise

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.569 
you can't mean the board otherwise

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
they'll become unpacked his arms this

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:07.520 
they'll become unpacked his arms this
arm<00:03:02.909> to<00:03:03.269> move<00:03:03.680> forward<00:03:05.120> but<00:03:06.120> bend<00:03:06.810> at<00:03:07.470> the

arm to move forward but bend at the

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.890 
arm to move forward but bend at the
elbow<00:03:08.129> and<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:08.760> can<00:03:08.940> still<00:03:09.209> have<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.629> sword

stones of the way but yeah my arms got
the<00:03:22.940> articulation<00:03:23.940> this<00:03:24.389> arm<00:03:24.720> can<00:03:25.109> move<00:03:25.379> aside

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
the articulation this arm can move aside

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.949 
the articulation this arm can move aside
or<00:03:27.030> convert<00:03:27.540> inside<00:03:27.989> can<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.319> forward<00:03:28.739> back

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
or convert inside can you forward back

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.129 
or convert inside can you forward back
it<00:03:30.959> can<00:03:31.230> bend<00:03:31.560> at<00:03:31.889> the<00:03:31.919> elbow<00:03:32.459> a<00:03:32.900> bit<00:03:33.900> and

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
it can bend at the elbow a bit and

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:38.270 
it can bend at the elbow a bit and
that's<00:03:34.650> it<00:03:34.949> and<00:03:35.449> it<00:03:36.449> can<00:03:36.930> still<00:03:37.379> watch<00:03:38.250> it

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
that's it and it can still watch it

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.170 
that's it and it can still watch it
can't<00:03:38.879> rotate<00:03:39.150> because<00:03:39.750> in<00:03:39.900> sword<00:03:40.819> he<00:03:41.819> still

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
can't rotate because in sword he still

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.220 
can't rotate because in sword he still
has<00:03:42.389> had<00:03:42.840> articulation<00:03:43.799> a<00:03:44.660> huge<00:03:45.660> behind<00:03:46.019> that

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
has had articulation a huge behind that

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.599 
has had articulation a huge behind that
and<00:03:47.099> that's<00:03:47.609> it<00:03:48.260> but<00:03:49.260> you<00:03:49.410> can't<00:03:49.680> modify<00:03:50.099> it<00:03:50.340> if

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
and that's it but you can't modify it if

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.220 
and that's it but you can't modify it if
there's<00:03:50.849> any<00:03:51.030> consolation<00:03:51.569> you<00:03:51.900> can<00:03:52.049> move

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.430 
there's any consolation you can move
these<00:03:52.410> out<00:03:53.209> you<00:03:54.209> can<00:03:54.389> position<00:03:54.720> these<00:03:55.169> because

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
these out you can position these because

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.430 
these out you can position these because
they're<00:03:55.530> on<00:03:55.650> board<00:03:55.829> rooms<00:03:56.840> but<00:03:57.840> and<00:03:58.139> you<00:03:58.290> can

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
they're on board rooms but and you can

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.379 
they're on board rooms but and you can
still<00:03:58.680> position<00:03:59.220> these<00:03:59.400> these<00:04:00.359> panels<00:04:01.049> here

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
as flying itself or jet fire itself but

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.460 
as flying itself or jet fire itself but
still<00:04:10.949> he<00:04:11.129> looks<00:04:11.340> really<00:04:11.669> awesome<00:04:12.290> so<00:04:13.290> this
