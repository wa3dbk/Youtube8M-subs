00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:56.659 
sometimes when you're trapping these

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:00.670 
sometimes when you're trapping these
channels<00:03:58.269> you'll<00:03:59.269> stop<00:03:59.599> making<00:04:00.110> catches

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
channels you'll stop making catches

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.220 
channels you'll stop making catches
because<00:04:01.159> you've<00:04:01.340> lost<00:04:01.610> your<00:04:01.970> edge<00:04:02.209> I<00:04:02.629> mean

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
because you've lost your edge I mean

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.869 
because you've lost your edge I mean
when<00:04:03.409> you<00:04:03.530> lost<00:04:03.709> your<00:04:03.890> edge<00:04:04.129> now<00:04:04.430> you<00:04:04.489> forgot

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
when you lost your edge now you forgot

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.809 
when you lost your edge now you forgot
how<00:04:05.090> to<00:04:05.150> trap<00:04:05.540> muskrats<00:04:06.409> but<00:04:06.709> you<00:04:07.489> make<00:04:07.700> the

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
how to trap muskrats but you make the

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:13.809 
how to trap muskrats but you make the
catch<00:04:08.090> in<00:04:08.360> that<00:04:08.540> muskrat<00:04:10.060> fighting<00:04:11.060> it<00:04:12.819> they

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
catch in that muskrat fighting it they

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.930 
catch in that muskrat fighting it they
all<00:04:14.030> lose<00:04:14.599> the<00:04:14.870> edge<00:04:15.019> there<00:04:15.379> hillo<00:04:15.769> hollo<00:04:16.669> it

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
all lose the edge there hillo hollo it

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.050 
all lose the edge there hillo hollo it
out<00:04:17.120> so<00:04:17.959> I<00:04:18.019> had<00:04:18.260> the<00:04:18.470> Provost<00:04:19.190> yeah<00:04:19.519> that's

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
out so I had the Provost yeah that's

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.600 
out so I had the Provost yeah that's
what<00:04:20.180> happened<00:04:20.720> here<00:04:22.630> she<00:04:23.630> still<00:04:24.250> otherwise<00:04:25.250> I

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
what happened here she still otherwise I

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.990 
what happened here she still otherwise I
think<00:04:26.000> other<00:04:26.630> muskrats<00:04:27.320> might<00:04:27.620> come<00:04:27.889> a<00:04:28.250> lot<00:04:28.910> of

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
think other muskrats might come a lot of

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.300 
think other muskrats might come a lot of
times<00:04:29.180> I<00:04:29.330> think<00:04:29.539> you<00:04:29.600> don't<00:04:29.780> get<00:04:29.960> a<00:04:30.130> catch<00:04:31.130> on

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
times I think you don't get a catch on

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.370 
times I think you don't get a catch on
the<00:04:31.490> other<00:04:31.639> side<00:04:32.000> because<00:04:32.539> there's<00:04:32.870> a<00:04:32.960> muskrat

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
the other side because there's a muskrat

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.260 
the other side because there's a muskrat
over<00:04:33.830> here<00:04:34.010> dad<00:04:34.310> and<00:04:34.580> they<00:04:34.669> come<00:04:34.850> over<00:04:35.150> and

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
over here dad and they come over and

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.540 
over here dad and they come over and
check<00:04:35.479> it<00:04:35.539> out<00:04:35.810> what's<00:04:36.800> wrong<00:04:36.979> with<00:04:37.220> him<00:04:37.340> you

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
check it out what's wrong with him you

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.060 
check it out what's wrong with him you
know<00:04:37.610> and<00:04:37.699> then<00:04:38.000> a<00:04:38.150> swim<00:04:38.210> through<00:04:39.039> well<00:04:40.039> I

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
know and then a swim through well I

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.860 
know and then a swim through well I
think<00:04:40.280> that's<00:04:40.580> why<00:04:40.850> I<00:04:40.880> don't<00:04:41.330> get<00:04:41.570> a<00:04:41.600> lot<00:04:41.810> of

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
think that's why I don't get a lot of

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.790 
think that's why I don't get a lot of
doubles<00:04:42.410> sometimes<00:04:42.979> they<00:04:43.160> do<00:04:43.270> but<00:04:44.270> um<00:04:44.710> and<00:04:45.710> I

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
doubles sometimes they do but um and I

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.800 
doubles sometimes they do but um and I
think<00:04:45.860> sometimes<00:04:46.250> they'll<00:04:46.639> swim<00:04:46.940> around<00:04:47.240> or

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
think sometimes they'll swim around or

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.710 
think sometimes they'll swim around or
dig<00:04:48.350> around<00:04:48.500> and<00:04:48.979> so<00:04:49.280> nuts<00:04:49.729> that<00:04:50.000> was<00:04:50.270> the<00:04:50.510> case

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
dig around and so nuts that was the case

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.480 
dig around and so nuts that was the case
here<00:04:51.199> so<00:04:51.710> that's<00:04:51.860> something<00:04:52.100> you<00:04:52.220> want<00:04:52.340> to
