00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.430
 Explain how much 109% equals shading 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.760
 Let's start with a quick review, if you want to type 109% 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.910
 Or 109 percent, the equivalent 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:25.330
 109 of, and I will write a hundred more times, but 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.270
 To rest a bit 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.540
 A hundred means 100, and what we want literally 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.850
 109 percent 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.400
 If we have 100 percent, in this case we are dealing with one true, but 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.040
 Now we have more 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.850
 We have 109 percent 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.460
 We can write this as a ratio, or as a fraction 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.730
 It is the same as 10.9 percent 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.220
 It is the same as 10.9 percent 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.260
 Now let's do this 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.720
 If we have a full format here, what we mean can be considered 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.300
 One true or true form 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.150
 In the last presentation, we used the counting method 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.830
 These are 10 boxes 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.460
 This box is divided into 100 equal parts 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.510
 If we want 109 of the 100 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.660
 What does this mean? 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.130
 This means that we will shade the whole shape 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.350
 100 square 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.950
 Let me do this with another color 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.090
 So now I will shading all the shape 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.550
 I will shading every shape 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.740
 So our 100% 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:28.410
 Ie 100/100, or 100 percent, or 100% 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.540
 I think you know all these synonyms 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.940
 I do not want you to keep this just without understanding it 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.970
 This means 100 of 100, or all 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.540
 You can also see this 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.010
 This is 100 y from 00 here 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.200
 But the required shade is 109% 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.610
 We already made 100 shading of 100, now we keep 9 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.170
 If we shade another 9 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:55.380
 If now we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.030
 Eight, nine 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.350
 If this part is here 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.090
 Well, that 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.320
 These 9% of the box as a whole 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.700
 This is 100% of the figure 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.620
 This whole shape plus blue space 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:16.920
 This means 109% of the 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.690
 Full box 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.430
 I hope you benefited from this explanation
