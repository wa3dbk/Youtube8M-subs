what we do is take the AP no mana page

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.349 
what we do is take the AP no mana page
since<00:01:01.350> she<00:01:01.469> doesn't<00:01:01.620> use<00:01:01.890> mana<00:01:02.160> we<00:01:02.399> go<00:01:02.550> with<00:01:02.760> 21

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
since she doesn't use mana we go with 21

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.630 
since she doesn't use mana we go with 21
in<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.629> offense<00:01:04.199> pretty<00:01:04.559> normal<00:01:04.920> stuff<00:01:05.280> over

in the offense pretty normal stuff over

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.640 
in the offense pretty normal stuff over
there<00:01:05.760> for<00:01:06.000> damage<00:01:06.360> for<00:01:06.570> her<00:01:06.659> ap<00:01:07.080> scaling<00:01:07.530> and

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
there for damage for her ap scaling and

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.500 
there for damage for her ap scaling and
then<00:01:08.040> we<00:01:08.100> put<00:01:08.280> nine<00:01:08.460> points<00:01:08.820> actually<00:01:09.000> into

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
then we put nine points actually into

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.719 
then we put nine points actually into
the<00:01:09.600> defense<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.260> not<00:01:10.380> into<00:01:10.619> utility<00:01:10.890> helping

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
the defense and not into utility helping

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.550 
the defense and not into utility helping
us<00:01:11.880> with<00:01:12.060> survivability<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:12.900> Lane<00:01:13.140> early

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
us with survivability in Lane early

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.050 
us with survivability in Lane early
which<00:01:13.979> allows<00:01:14.189> us<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.369> actually<00:01:14.520> poke<00:01:14.790> more

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
which allows us to actually poke more

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.370 
which allows us to actually poke more
because<00:01:15.360> we<00:01:15.450> don't<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.780> worry<00:01:15.930> about<00:01:16.020> any

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
because we don't have to worry about any

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.320 
because we don't have to worry about any
man<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.710> problem<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.340> we<00:01:17.460> just<00:01:17.640> get<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.759> poke<00:01:18.030> poke

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
man a problem so we just get a poke poke

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.120 
man a problem so we just get a poke poke
and<00:01:18.509> poke<00:01:18.689> as<00:01:18.900> long<00:01:19.409> as<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:19.680> off<00:01:19.830> cooldown

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
and poke as long as it's off cooldown

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.070 
and poke as long as it's off cooldown
now<00:01:20.790> as<00:01:21.000> for<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.240> items<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.750> I'd<00:01:21.930> like<00:01:22.020> to
