lunges these are difficult lunges

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.330 
lunges these are difficult lunges
because<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.840> have<00:01:22.020> momentum<00:01:22.740> pushing<00:01:23.009> you

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
because you have momentum pushing you

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.490 
because you have momentum pushing you
forward<00:01:23.719> and<00:01:24.719> you<00:01:24.840> need<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.079> stop<00:01:25.350> that

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
forward and you need to stop that
