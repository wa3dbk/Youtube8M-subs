00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.060
 and with us it is best if you 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.750
 Amazon is always on the lookout 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.079
 mostly let support 

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:12.179
 he is a successful member of the Operating Committee on some sort Sol 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.849
 from Dusseldorf Christian 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.849
 he thinks 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.619
 Olympia because you can always talk about other topics Thank God that 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.550
 was my last try week I've been asked what have you got me 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.720
 to Russia then immediately all of a throat doped 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.150
 alone there Places 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.950
 I have sports with them but it was so concentrated this summer 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.220
 the simplified I have since since I am selecting because I'm watching 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.350
 personally prefer events in which Angela Merkel in the stands 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.110
 Philip sits that the Bitkom sometimes targeted just because if so 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.340
 Torjubel for example it is easy 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.840
 it's easy if you look at the investigators for APA 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.769
 who is older 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:55.590
 the motives point upwards 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.450
 Yes, I want to go to the fraternity I'm the first TV screen head no 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.299
 when I'm so easily caught up with the chancellor so much 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.140
 Something easy Buddhist Chelsea is therefore quite in trend more and more 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.160
 German if to Buddhism too 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.840
 with his victories in diverse this simplicity 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.730
 However, the feeling of being in the simplicity is that of the 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.009
 Buddhism that Ikea 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.700
 more 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.830
 it's certainly working on it, too, "said Rath, that's the Dalai 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.729
 Lama that he has so many fans now 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.579
 in Berlin was also on his last tour of Germany yes 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.109
 Aleida was not with us in Dusseldorf he has made station Ingo 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.000
 and Mönchengladbach 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.740
 I have first miracles because I have board in the quite cities 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.450
 maybe some redemption is too meager 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.729
 other than striker people but people can say if you are in 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.240
 well approved of this life 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.479
 because of that maybe even Hamburger Mönchengladbach if their 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.290
 partner 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.840
 that's how Buddhism works, so that's what they mean to you 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.790
 abuse 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.130
 I would never be with thunderstorms 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.409
 Who is really crap he builds with the people then again 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.280
 now it does not simplify greatly simplified tih fat 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.820
 Tibet is meanwhile the aquarium for us Central Europeans 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.839
 it would have made me very well negotiable on this conflict Tibet China 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:15.480
 medial not the good Tibetans the bad Chinese 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.379
 that is not with all conflicts so unfortunately the victims of disasters go 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.010
 and still get far too little attention that they have never been with us 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.979
 ap-news come in 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:27.259
 How much does that go too far goes against tribal conflicts 

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:28.799
 Africa from the 7th 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.019
 is not negotiable for me that already have the us-open back then 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.139
 completely wrong 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:36.799
 Every German pr consultant would have said at once how good you are at a dozen 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.839
 I son with the name 

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:41.629
 first rename for the German news what you do not 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.629
 her name is now Twix something with the Frankfurter 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:49.019
 Georgia with Georgia at the moment for compassion of course think twice 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:49.430
 weeks 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.149
 Plus minus a few days 

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:53.979
 Henk Timmer bit of what else happens in the world I'll tell 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:55.309
 in the next days 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:59.139
 new paparazzi photos from Britney Spears' sound designer sees it for Georgia but 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:00.759
 certainly 

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:04.019
 first of all must come up with something to those interested in the also 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.949
 Plant still a problem I mean yes Urspring prices 

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:10.189
 there class with quite a tune we have non-smoker protection law but hello 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:11.849
 and we are afraid 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.819
 Who is more constantly afraid of all fox has not happened yet but im 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.919
 Office I have people I know people to drive 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.139
 if they meanwhile always a bomb with them 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.449
 HH as a precaution 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:26.579
 Today, two bombs are at the same time, which is extremely unlikely Cairo 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.829
 and that's what the borrower from the barn has to say in principle we have to 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.200
 Protect the rule of law 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.410
 therefore, the rule of law would have to be abolished because no state of law would be anything more 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.559
 happen 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:49.099
 that the idea works but not the Islamists half the distance game 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.790
 Last week we have the Islamists, I mean that's just that 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:52.260
 People 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.080
 the Islamists are armed men frets 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.619
 with religious background 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:58.719
 Such things do not even know Germany 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:01.799
 well protect from a red 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.079
 practically the German answer to Hezbollah can be said Dr 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.039
 but they do not kill each other 

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:09.069
 no fans around her husband 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.389
 and they would be in the country so i tear my tears 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:14.389
 ca 

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:19.519
 a proof that our money but coach 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.419
 the places I prefer to do that if I'm really scared I try 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.360
 really always stay sober me then 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.680
 Risk management becomes clear about where the drivers are and where they are 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.160
 I do not have that in her again 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.720
 who wants extra in the break Google is percent I knew him that he was very clear 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.640
 say the probability that we are here today a terrorist attack victim 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.140
 fall 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.050
 is very low 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.920
 Thank goodness is about as likely 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.999
 important says and earthquake easily says to star 

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:45.039
 what is so stupid as a great one that you can be glad that's just it 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:46.389
 rarely occurs 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:48.889
 most people die in bed anyway 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.680
 another big group in traffic 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.680
 That's why I personally avoid sleeping cars 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.389
 just a risk too much 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:02.069
 The probability of smoking is 1 to 800 relatively high 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:04.620
 that he is the gate when smoking as harmful as that one must Phoenix 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.979
 other serious h 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.169
 What will most likely be reversed if he quits smoking? 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.270
 increases the probability of what to put others 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.499
 for example, lightning so 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:15.460
 But you should think no 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.610
 rjm 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.330
 Percent on a ladder are not dangerous 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.780
 Awareness much more dangerous than climbing a plane 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.050
 Red wine in moderation, on the other hand, is not dangerously prolonged life 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.009
 So a small tip if you have to go to the ladder yes 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:31.009
 Per 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.340
 but easily a sleeping car necessarily some adventures and grapes 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.099
 or not 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:46.080
 about the probability to win a lottery in the lottery in order to be positive 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.819
 to Evalve Inc at one in four million who damned unlikely that 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:53.219
 It's four times as likely to die by lightning 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:55.949
 statistically before they win the lottery once they are four times away 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:57.409
 Lightning hit 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:00.199
 Vedder Lotto plays must be crazy more 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:02.979
 that people win at the same time struck by lightning if it still is 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:04.979
 more likely than a super-gau in the nuclear power plant 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:06.839
 and that should happen 

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:09.349
 Look for enough red wines 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:09.849
 ca
