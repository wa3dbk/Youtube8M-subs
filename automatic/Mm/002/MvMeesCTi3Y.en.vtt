courses right and and a golf course just
playing<00:00:59.280> incredibly<00:01:00.000> difficult<00:01:00.210> because<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
playing incredibly difficult because the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.750 
playing incredibly difficult because the

greens are extra fast and and the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.820 
greens are extra fast and and the
fairways<00:01:03.210> are<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:03.600> long<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.260> know<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.680> it's

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
fairways are so long you know and it's

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.700 
fairways are so long you know and it's
like<00:01:04.949> what<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.820> course<00:01:06.260> this<00:01:07.260> particular

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
like what this course this particular

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.250 
like what this course this particular
one<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.580> it's<00:01:08.760> everything's<00:01:09.360> super<00:01:10.080> big

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
and really hard to skate so it's gonna

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.109 
and really hard to skate so it's gonna
really<00:01:13.439> change<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:14.010> dynamic<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.760> style
