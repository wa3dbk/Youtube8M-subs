00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.910 
gonna do that and I really think it
looks<00:03:53.360> very<00:03:53.600> pretty<00:03:54.230> and<00:03:54.530> I<00:03:54.590> think<00:03:54.620> it's<00:03:54.860> a

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
looks very pretty and I think it's a

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.080 
looks very pretty and I think it's a
good<00:03:55.010> for<00:03:55.190> Valentine's<00:03:55.580> Day<00:03:55.670> because<00:03:55.970> it's

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
good for Valentine's Day because it's

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.240

also very neutral it's not too pink but

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:08.930 
also very neutral it's not too pink but
it's<00:03:58.370> still<00:03:59.030> pink<00:03:59.540> if<00:03:59.930> that<00:04:00.140> makes<00:04:00.380> sense
