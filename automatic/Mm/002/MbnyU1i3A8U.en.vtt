three times in your last chain and
that's<00:01:46.649> going<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.070> make<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.399> turn<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.960> you

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
that's going to make a turn so that you

foundation chain so if it just says SC
three<00:01:54.119> times<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.750> last<00:01:55.049> chain<00:01:56.299> you're<00:01:57.299> just

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
three times in last chain you're just

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.679 
three times in last chain you're just
going<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.929> single<00:01:58.259> crochet<00:01:58.590> into<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.689> very

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
going to single crochet into the very

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.450 
going to single crochet into the very
last<00:02:00.780> chain<00:02:01.079> three<00:02:01.320> times<00:02:01.890> like<00:02:02.280> you're

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
last chain three times like you're

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.029 
last chain three times like you're
increasing<00:02:03.140> and<00:02:04.140> you'll<00:02:04.320> see<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.859> makes

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
increasing and you'll see that it makes

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.570 
increasing and you'll see that it makes
it<00:02:05.219> curve<00:02:05.520> around<00:02:06.829> so<00:02:07.829> it's<00:02:07.979> curved<00:02:08.340> around

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
it curve around so it's curved around

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.330 
it curve around so it's curved around
and<00:02:09.060> it's<00:02:09.179> made<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:10.310> little<00:02:11.959> half<00:02:12.959> circle<00:02:13.500> and

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
and it's made a little half circle and

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.680 
and it's made a little half circle and
now<00:02:14.730> you're<00:02:14.970> going<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.150> start<00:02:15.330> working

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
now you're going to start working

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.960 
now you're going to start working
into<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.620> back<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:16.950> your<00:02:17.250> foundation<00:02:17.400> chain

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
into the back of your foundation chain

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.880 
into the back of your foundation chain
so<00:02:18.630> if<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:18.810> just<00:02:18.960> tells<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.350> to<00:02:19.500> single

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
so if it just tells you to single

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
so if it just tells you to single
crochet<00:02:19.980> in<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.370> back<00:02:20.490> of<00:02:20.670> your<00:02:20.760> foundation

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
crochet in the back of your foundation

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.260 
crochet in the back of your foundation
chain<00:02:21.450> across<00:02:21.840> then<00:02:22.710> you<00:02:23.550> need<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.850> figure<00:02:24.090> out

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
chain across then you need to figure out

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.480 
chain across then you need to figure out
where<00:02:24.660> you're<00:02:24.810> going<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:24.990> put<00:02:25.140> your<00:02:25.320> hook<00:02:25.530> so

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
where you're going to put your hook so

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.160 
where you're going to put your hook so
if<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.820> remember<00:02:26.970> this<00:02:27.210> very<00:02:27.420> last<00:02:27.690> chain<00:02:27.990> you

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
if you remember this very last chain you

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.960 
if you remember this very last chain you
did<00:02:28.350> three<00:02:28.830> you<00:02:29.130> don't<00:02:29.310> need<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.490> put<00:02:29.610> any<00:02:29.760> more

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
did three you don't need to put any more

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.080 
did three you don't need to put any more
in<00:02:30.030> here<00:02:30.720> because<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.890> first<00:02:32.370> of<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.700> three

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
in here because the first of the three

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.880 
in here because the first of the three
was<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.350> stitch<00:02:35.190> for<00:02:35.670> this<00:02:36.000> side<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:37.410> second

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
was the stitch for this side the second

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.670 
was the stitch for this side the second
of<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.100> three<00:02:38.130> made<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:39.060> turn<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:39.720> then<00:02:40.500> the

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
of the three made the turn and then the

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.650 
of the three made the turn and then the
third<00:02:40.980> of<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.340> three<00:02:41.700> is<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:41.910> first<00:02:42.360> stitch

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
third of the three is the first stitch

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.600 
third of the three is the first stitch
for<00:02:42.990> this<00:02:43.080> back<00:02:43.440> side<00:02:43.740> of<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:44.070> foundation

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
for this back side of the foundation

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.450 
for this back side of the foundation
chain<00:02:44.850> so<00:02:45.630> I<00:02:45.660> need<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.260> go<00:02:46.380> into<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.770> very<00:02:46.980> next

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
chain so I need to go into the very next

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.230 
chain so I need to go into the very next
stitch<00:02:48.330> which<00:02:48.870> is<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:49.580> funny-looking<00:02:50.580> kind<00:02:51.150> of

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
stitch which is a funny-looking kind of

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.110 
stitch which is a funny-looking kind of
loop<00:02:51.540> so<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:52.530> can<00:02:52.860> either<00:02:53.010> just<00:02:53.340> catch<00:02:53.700> that

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
loop so you can either just catch that

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.190 
loop so you can either just catch that
back<00:02:54.900> loop<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:56.480> when<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:57.570> do<00:02:57.750> that<00:02:57.930> let<00:02:58.140> me

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
back loop and when you do that let me

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.580 
back loop and when you do that let me
show<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:58.470> what<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.740> effect<00:02:58.770> it<00:02:59.310> gets<00:03:00.350> I'll<00:03:01.350> do

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
show you what the effect it gets I'll do

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.760 
show you what the effect it gets I'll do
a<00:03:01.620> couple<00:03:01.950> so<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:02.430> can<00:03:02.700> see<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.150> difference

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
a couple so you can see the difference

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.300 
a couple so you can see the difference
you're<00:03:04.770> catching<00:03:05.010> just<00:03:05.550> that<00:03:05.760> very<00:03:06.210> back<00:03:06.570> loop

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
you're catching just that very back loop

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.060 
you're catching just that very back loop
that<00:03:08.310> you<00:03:08.520> see<00:03:08.880> so<00:03:09.390> if<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:09.660> work<00:03:09.870> from<00:03:10.740> just

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
that you see so if you work from just

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.040 
that you see so if you work from just
your<00:03:11.220> back<00:03:11.430> loop<00:03:11.730> on<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.090> very<00:03:12.330> first<00:03:12.780> side<00:03:13.020> of

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
your back loop on the very first side of

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.380 
your back loop on the very first side of
the<00:03:13.230> foundation<00:03:13.740> chain<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.310> grab<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.240> back

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
the foundation chain and grab the back

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.260 
the foundation chain and grab the back
loop<00:03:15.750> on<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:17.040> other<00:03:17.070> side<00:03:17.580> of<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.760> foundation

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
loop on the other side of the foundation

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.449 
loop on the other side of the foundation
chain<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:19.260> gives<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:19.590> a<00:03:19.650> pretty<00:03:19.860> closed<00:03:20.250> up

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
chain it gives you a pretty closed up

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.860 
chain it gives you a pretty closed up
hole<00:03:21.830> now<00:03:22.830> you<00:03:22.920> could<00:03:23.340> also<00:03:23.580> insert<00:03:24.420> your<00:03:24.600> hook

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
hole now you could also insert your hook

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:32.240 
hole now you could also insert your hook
under<00:03:28.489> both<00:03:29.489> loops<00:03:30.110> so<00:03:31.110> if<00:03:31.230> I<00:03:31.320> take<00:03:31.560> both<00:03:31.920> loops

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
under both loops so if I take both loops

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.100 
under both loops so if I take both loops
so<00:03:32.760> I'm<00:03:32.820> skipping<00:03:33.180> one<00:03:33.330> here<00:03:33.510> if<00:03:33.600> I<00:03:33.720> take<00:03:33.750> both

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
so I'm skipping one here if I take both

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.360 
so I'm skipping one here if I take both
loops<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:35.270> insert<00:03:36.270> my<00:03:36.300> hook

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
loops and insert my hook

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.770 
loops and insert my hook
so<00:03:38.370> you'll<00:03:38.580> see<00:03:38.730> kind<00:03:38.970> of<00:03:39.060> one<00:03:39.270> that<00:03:39.390> goes<00:03:39.540> down

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
so you'll see kind of one that goes down

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.660 
so you'll see kind of one that goes down
and<00:03:40.050> one<00:03:40.140> that<00:03:40.290> comes<00:03:40.470> across<00:03:40.650> almost<00:03:41.310> like<00:03:41.520> an

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
and one that comes across almost like an

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.780 
and one that comes across almost like an
X<00:03:42.050> bring<00:03:43.050> that<00:03:43.200> close<00:03:43.500> so<00:03:44.310> it<00:03:44.370> kind<00:03:44.550> of<00:03:44.580> looks

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
X bring that close so it kind of looks

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.479 
X bring that close so it kind of looks
like<00:03:44.850> an<00:03:45.060> X<00:03:45.390> I<00:03:45.870> stick<00:03:46.709> my<00:03:46.739> hook<00:03:47.010> through<00:03:47.250> both

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
like an X I stick my hook through both

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.140 
like an X I stick my hook through both
of<00:03:47.519> those<00:03:48.170> the<00:03:49.170> effect<00:03:49.680> that<00:03:50.310> I<00:03:50.340> get<00:03:50.820> is<00:03:51.090> a

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
of those the effect that I get is a

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.970 
of those the effect that I get is a
little<00:03:51.720> bit<00:03:51.870> more<00:03:52.200> open<00:03:52.980> in<00:03:53.420> between<00:03:54.980> both

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
little bit more open in between both

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.890 
little bit more open in between both
sides<00:03:56.250> you'll<00:03:57.030> see<00:03:57.209> more<00:03:57.450> of<00:03:57.540> a<00:03:57.630> hole<00:03:57.870> in

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
sides you'll see more of a hole in

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.580 
sides you'll see more of a hole in
between<00:03:58.340> so<00:03:59.340> I<00:03:59.370> like<00:03:59.640> to<00:03:59.790> do<00:03:59.940> just<00:04:00.080> the<00:04:01.080> back

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
between so I like to do just the back

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.640 
between so I like to do just the back
loop<00:04:02.150> so<00:04:03.150> that<00:04:03.330> I<00:04:03.360> don't<00:04:03.450> have<00:04:03.660> that<00:04:04.170> big<00:04:04.380> open

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
loop so that I don't have that big open

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.280 
loop so that I don't have that big open
hole<00:04:05.100> but<00:04:06.000> whatever<00:04:06.300> is<00:04:06.420> easier<00:04:06.840> for<00:04:07.170> you<00:04:07.260> to

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
hole but whatever is easier for you to

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.640 
hole but whatever is easier for you to
see<00:04:08.239> or<00:04:09.239> whatever<00:04:09.810> is<00:04:09.930> easier<00:04:10.230> for<00:04:10.320> you<00:04:10.620> to

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
see or whatever is easier for you to

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.130 
see or whatever is easier for you to
work<00:04:10.860> into<00:04:11.370> that's<00:04:12.150> what<00:04:12.360> you<00:04:12.450> can<00:04:12.690> do<00:04:12.900> just

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
work into that's what you can do just

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.410 
work into that's what you can do just
