00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.000
HONEY CHAMPIGNONS

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.510
Due to the increasing popularity of Oriental cuisine

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.999
Wok began to appear often in our kitchens.

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:16.419
My kitchen is no exception: I have such dishes too.

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:17.480
Wok by Zepter

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.689
Today I will prepare a dish in it, which is called "Honey champignons".

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.579
We will need 300 grams of fresh champignons (Agaricus bisporus),

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:28.200
1 tbsp of: soy sauce, honey and vegetable oil,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.999
and 1 tsp of sesame oil.

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:33.170
Take the mushrooms.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.100
They need to be cut into small pieces of the same size.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.380
So they will be quickly and evenly roasted in a pan Wok.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.890
Cut the stipes.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.800
I will cut mushrooms into slices.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.900
I will cut the stipes too.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.490
Wok is already hot.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.680
Pour 1 tbsp of vegetable oil.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.000
I use a little oil, because in the preparation of products I will stir constantly.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.070
Therefore, the finished dish has less fat.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.000
Peppered mushrooms.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.074
Lightly fry them, stirring constantly.

00:01:41.074 --> 00:01:45.400
It is necessary that all the mushrooms were in the oil.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.900
Cook on medium heat.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.900
Fry for 1 minute.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.889
Quickly add the honey.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.500
1 tbsp of the soy sauce.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.339
Mix all.

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:23.300
Honey should be dissolved.

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:39.199
Now cover with a lid.

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:42.800
Mushrooms have markedly decreased in volume.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.800
Cover with the lid and leave on low heat for 1 minute.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.900
After 1 minute remove the lid.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:59.169
Fry mushrooms until thick syrup, stirring constantly.

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:04.100
Mushrooms should be caramelized.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.600
I cooked mushrooms 7 minutes over medium heat.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.319
Heat can be turned off.

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.079
Take the sesame oil.

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:25.000
Lightly sprinkle mushrooms.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Enough.

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.309
Dish is cooked very quickly.

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:41.599
It is easy.

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:47.289
It can be served either hot or cold.

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:50.900
Bon Appetite!

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.000
