also<00:00:31.170> like<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.650> new<00:00:31.830> Snickers<00:00:32.399> one<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:33.530> I

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
also like the new Snickers one and I

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.080 
also like the new Snickers one and I
think<00:00:34.770> it's<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.130> same<00:00:35.340> range<00:00:35.550> as<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.760> Mars

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
think it's in the same range as the Mars

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.830 
think it's in the same range as the Mars
and<00:00:36.360> galaxy<00:00:36.809> ones<00:00:37.020> as<00:00:37.290> well<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:38.570> it<00:00:39.570> has<00:00:39.809> a

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
and galaxy ones as well so it has a

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.330 
and galaxy ones as well so it has a
fresh<00:00:40.590> oil<00:00:41.489> cap<00:00:43.969> it's<00:00:44.969> quite<00:00:45.390> firmly<00:00:45.750> on<00:00:46.050> there

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
fresh oil cap it's quite firmly on there

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.930 
fresh oil cap it's quite firmly on there
smells<00:00:48.559> quite<00:00:49.559> free<00:00:50.449> it<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.629> fruit<00:00:51.930> flavor<00:00:52.230> so

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
smells quite free it is fruit flavor so

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.029 
smells quite free it is fruit flavor so
that<00:00:53.940> makes<00:00:54.180> sense

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
that makes sense

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.500 
that makes sense
the<00:00:56.039> color<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.520> mainly<00:00:56.940> like<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.390> quite<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> pale

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
of the quite iconic skittles flavour you

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.520 
of the quite iconic skittles flavour you
can<00:01:30.760> definitely<00:01:30.970> pick<00:01:31.540> out<00:01:31.690> the<00:01:31.900> purpley

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
can definitely pick out the purpley

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.720 
can definitely pick out the purpley
blackcurrant<00:01:33.160> ones<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.900> and<00:01:35.730> the

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:36.730 
blackcurrant ones that and the

strawberry ones I'd say that those are
probably<00:01:40.900> the<00:01:41.230> overriding<00:01:41.650> flavors<00:01:42.250> and

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460
