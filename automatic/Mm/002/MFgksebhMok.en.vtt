00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:05.610
 it seems that lately it is given 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.950
 a lot of importance to the cross game 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.830
 between various platforms is not for 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.349
 less microsoft on this occasion states 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.170
 the following the game crossed between xbox 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.970
 one and pc makes a lot of sense for the company 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.550
 could already be working on it the 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.770
 vice president of microsoft studios the 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.930
 Mr. Phil Spencer has affirmed in a 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.150
 recent interview that for the company 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.570
 it makes a lot of sense to allow the game 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.210
 crossed between an xbox one and users of 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.370
 pc says the following says I can not 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.290
 filter things but I think the game 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.719
 crossed makes a lot of sense 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.690
 So he said remembering that attempt 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.910
 of shadow rand ensuring that despite 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.010
 not having commercial success served to 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.719
 learn many attentive things because 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.579
 they say more things this ecosystem 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.950
 connected through different 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.510
 devices is of course to where 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.210
 I think the future of videogames is going 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.550
 he said it like that and also explained 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.920
 you do not have to do it as a developer 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.619
 but to have the possibility and I think that a 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.539
 system like xbox live is something key 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.860
 for this the truth is that I believe that 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:10.350
 he is absolutely right 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.780
 it is true that console users 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.880
 let's say they could be more limited 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.400
 many times because of not being able to 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.140
 connect with the rest of users by 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.290
 example pc users that you already know that 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.390
 there is a lot of use of the theme of playing 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.370
 through the online mode well I think 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.710
 really that this something more than 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.410
 benefit xbox users because 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.720
 xbox 360 works pretty well with that 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.660
 xbox light would benefit above all to 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.610
 playstation users imagine the 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.800
 playstation 3 users that many 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.930
 sometimes they complain about there being no 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.550
 so many users to play with them or 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.009
 even good about the whole case more 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.810
 highlighted is the case of wii there is hardly 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.240
 people to play through mode 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.570
 online of titles with things 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.869
 how are you trying to put 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.149
 microsoft with his xbox one and pc then I 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.710
 I think this would improve a lot, not like that 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.470
 that we 're left with that cross game 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.320
 between xbox one and pc that for microsoft 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.179
 it makes a lot of sense so it's not 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.530
 wonder that in the near future do 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.530
 much emphasis on it
