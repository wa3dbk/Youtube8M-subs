00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.689 
gotten a little rough it's gotten a
little<00:00:27.420> strange<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:28.260> mean<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.920> moon<00:00:29.099> in<00:00:29.279> Taurus

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
little strange I mean the moon in Taurus

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.299 
little strange I mean the moon in Taurus
is<00:00:29.880> forming<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.570> hard<00:00:30.929> 90-degree<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.740> square

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
is forming a hard 90-degree a square

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.569 
is forming a hard 90-degree a square
with<00:00:33.000> Mars<00:00:33.540> then<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.620> itself<00:00:34.980> just<00:00:35.309> stirs

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
with Mars then that in itself just stirs

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.119 
with Mars then that in itself just stirs
up<00:00:35.820> our<00:00:36.000> emotions<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.690> our<00:00:36.840> anger<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.530> bit<00:00:37.829> then

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
up our emotions and our anger a bit then

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.709 
up our emotions and our anger a bit then
mixes<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.760> two<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.030> them<00:00:39.210> together<00:00:39.360> and

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
mixes the two of them together and

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:40.910 
mixes the two of them together and
that's<00:00:39.899> really<00:00:40.079> just<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.530> starting<00:00:40.860> point

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
that's really just the starting point

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.779 
that's really just the starting point
yeah<00:00:41.640> because<00:00:41.850> Mars<00:00:42.360> which<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.989> in

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
yeah because Mars which is in

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:46.600 
yeah because Mars which is in
experimental<00:00:44.789> Aquarius<00:00:45.600> forms<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.320> 45-degree

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
experimental Aquarius forms a 45-degree

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.310 
experimental Aquarius forms a 45-degree
angle<00:00:47.610> with<00:00:47.730> Aquarius<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.329> key<00:00:48.539> ruling<00:00:48.930> planet

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
angle with Aquarius is key ruling planet

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.400 
angle with Aquarius is key ruling planet
Uranus<00:00:49.770> which<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.610> about<00:00:50.879> being<00:00:51.120> impulsive<00:00:51.690> of

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
Uranus which is about being impulsive of

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.160 
Uranus which is about being impulsive of
about<00:00:53.039> behaving<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.850> ways<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.059> don't<00:00:54.660> follow

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
about behaving in ways that don't follow

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.889 
about behaving in ways that don't follow
the<00:00:55.590> rules<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.730> stresses<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.629> think

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
the rules and that stresses I think

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.959 
the rules and that stresses I think
tourists<00:00:58.440> which<00:00:58.590> likes<00:00:58.949> familiarity<00:00:59.940> and

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
tourists which likes familiarity and

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.090 
tourists which likes familiarity and
consistency<00:01:00.750> yeah<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.170> think<00:01:01.230> normally

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
consistency yeah and I think normally

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.369 
consistency yeah and I think normally
that<00:01:02.489> Mars<00:01:02.850> in<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.180> semi-square<00:01:03.809> Mars<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.350> a

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
that Mars in the semi-square Mars and a

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.980 
that Mars in the semi-square Mars and a
half<00:01:04.559> square<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:05.040> uranus<00:01:05.659> normally<00:01:06.659> we<00:01:06.810> could

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
half square to uranus normally we could

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.630 
half square to uranus normally we could
roll<00:01:07.200> with<00:01:07.229> those<00:01:07.619> kind<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:07.950> punches<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.520> would

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
roll with those kind of punches it would

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.670 
roll with those kind of punches it would
be<00:01:08.820> innovative<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.689> would<00:01:09.810> be<00:01:09.930> exciting<00:01:10.320> it

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
be innovative it would be exciting it

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.859 
be innovative it would be exciting it
would<00:01:10.799> be<00:01:10.979> breaking<00:01:11.700> through<00:01:12.360> normal

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
would be breaking through normal

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.810 
would be breaking through normal
routines<00:01:13.350> into<00:01:13.740> doing<00:01:14.010> things<00:01:14.189> differently

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
routines into doing things differently

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.300 
routines into doing things differently
and<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.570> think<00:01:16.020> you've<00:01:16.170> nailed<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.950> moon<00:01:17.130> in

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
and I think you've nailed it the moon in

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.039 
and I think you've nailed it the moon in
Taurus<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.820> not<00:01:18.030> comfortable<00:01:18.570> with<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
Taurus is not comfortable with that the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.200 
Taurus is not comfortable with that the
moon<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.320> Taurus<00:01:19.619> wants<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.400> do<00:01:20.549> things<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
moon in Taurus wants to do things in the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.240 
moon in Taurus wants to do things in the
same<00:01:21.420> way<00:01:21.659> that's<00:01:21.900> comfortable<00:01:22.140> then<00:01:22.920> there

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
same way that's comfortable then there

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.999 
same way that's comfortable then there
is<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.549> dilemma<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:24.330> one<00:01:24.659> hand<00:01:24.960> we<00:01:25.470> need<00:01:25.799> to

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
is the dilemma in one hand we need to

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.890 
is the dilemma in one hand we need to
have<00:01:26.159> things<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.759> are<00:01:26.820> simple<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.570> same

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
have things that are simple and the same

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.870 
have things that are simple and the same
and<00:01:28.229> on<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.650> other<00:01:28.770> hand<00:01:29.070> we<00:01:29.400> want<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.759> do

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
and on the other hand we want to do

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.520 
and on the other hand we want to do
things<00:01:30.150> differently<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.810> stir<00:01:31.049> things<00:01:31.290> up

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
things differently and stir things up

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.649 
things differently and stir things up
and<00:01:31.740> get<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.100> energy<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.000> anger<00:01:33.299> out

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
and get that energy and that anger out

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.160 
and get that energy and that anger out
yeah<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.950> think<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.310> world<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.759> moving

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
yeah and I think the world is moving

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.480 
yeah and I think the world is moving
regardless<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.350> whether<00:01:37.560> we<00:01:37.740> want<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.220> or

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
regardless of whether we want it to or

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.670 
regardless of whether we want it to or
not<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:39.030> from<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.630> practical<00:01:39.960> point<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.619> view
