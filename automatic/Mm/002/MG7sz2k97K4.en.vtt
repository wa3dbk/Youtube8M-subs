conscious<00:02:30.040> to<00:02:30.550> breathe<00:02:31.300> I<00:02:31.630> mean<00:02:32.500> to<00:02:32.710> break<00:02:32.950> the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
conscious to breathe I mean to break the

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.700 
conscious to breathe I mean to break the
surface<00:02:33.550> in<00:02:33.760> order<00:02:33.910> to<00:02:34.090> breathe<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:35.290> physical

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
surface in order to breathe the physical

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.040 
surface in order to breathe the physical
design<00:02:36.040> of<00:02:36.070> the<00:02:36.370> whale<00:02:36.580> is<00:02:36.820> very<00:02:37.090> complex<00:02:37.570> and

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
design of the whale is very complex and

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.530 
design of the whale is very complex and
it<00:02:38.320> is<00:02:38.410> why<00:02:38.650> they<00:02:38.890> are<00:02:38.920> able<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.760> survive<00:02:40.180> in

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
it is why they are able to survive in

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.290 
it is why they are able to survive in
the<00:02:40.870> water<00:02:41.080> they<00:02:42.040> depend<00:02:42.370> on<00:02:42.520> their<00:02:42.760> flippers

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
the water they depend on their flippers

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.870 
the water they depend on their flippers
and<00:02:43.510> their<00:02:43.990> dorsal<00:02:44.740> fins<00:02:45.040> to<00:02:45.250> help<00:02:45.490> them<00:02:45.670> move

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
and their dorsal fins to help them move

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.900 
and their dorsal fins to help them move
in<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.330> water<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:47.500> stay<00:02:47.800> balanced<00:02:48.520> they

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
in the water and to stay balanced they

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.480 
in the water and to stay balanced they
also<00:02:49.090> have<00:02:49.540> blow<00:02:50.140> holes<00:02:50.470> at<00:02:50.740> the<00:02:50.950> top<00:02:50.980> of<00:02:51.250> them

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
also have blow holes at the top of them

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.230 
also have blow holes at the top of them
where<00:02:51.820> they<00:02:52.210> take<00:02:52.600> and<00:02:52.930> in<00:02:53.680> earth<00:02:54.130> then<00:02:54.610> they

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
where they take and in earth then they

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.540 
where they take and in earth then they
can<00:02:55.570> be<00:02:55.780> submerged<00:02:56.230> under<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:56.860> water<00:02:56.980> for<00:02:57.520> a

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
can be submerged under the water for a

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.940 
can be submerged under the water for a
period<00:02:57.610> of<00:02:58.060> time<00:02:58.450> before<00:02:58.720> they<00:02:59.050> need<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.620> take

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
period of time before they need to take

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.320 
period of time before they need to take
another<00:03:00.520> breath<00:03:00.970> and<00:03:01.330> these<00:03:01.810> characteristics

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
another breath and these characteristics

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.060 
another breath and these characteristics
definitely<00:03:04.330> separates<00:03:04.930> them<00:03:05.260> from<00:03:05.290> the

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
definitely separates them from the

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.020 
definitely separates them from the
majority<00:03:06.640> of<00:03:07.620> aquatic<00:03:08.620> life<00:03:08.830> out<00:03:09.190> there<00:03:09.550> and

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
majority of aquatic life out there and

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.900 
majority of aquatic life out there and
then<00:03:10.720> basically<00:03:11.140> it<00:03:11.290> for<00:03:11.620> wealth<00:03:12.310> facts<00:03:12.760> if

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
then basically it for wealth facts if

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.190 
then basically it for wealth facts if
