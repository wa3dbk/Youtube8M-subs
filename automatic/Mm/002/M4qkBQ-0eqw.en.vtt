00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.470
 in front of me you can see a photo from the 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.540
 garage we worked with the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.369
 neon lights artificially over the model 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.290
 and also with the others 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.580
 other neon lights now you can see 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.010
 clear that the picture of course now 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.689
 was a bit alienated and 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.980
 but looks a bit different than it does 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.590
 was probably recorded 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.050
 I'll show you how it was recorded 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.680
 it came out of the camera, so to speak 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.000
 and yes I have just worked on it 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.220
 I did that in the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.860
 end effect the picture broke landon 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.320
 stains sorry left and flair are that 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.240
 theme flairs and blind spots are yes 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.250
 actually a thing that arise when 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.200
 the objective inside reflects thus 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.480
 against light in the lens drift and 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.550
 there begins the glass and everything in that 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.580
 objectively to shine and reflect 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.070
 flowers I have thus explained sorry 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.790
 league are actually holes in the 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.559
 camera 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.360
 Maybe you can still do that from analog 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.729
 times but more came off partially 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.619
 When filming, it is filmed 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.600
 just did not get to the movie where he 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.369
 actually could not get on it and 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.720
 then there are such spots as here 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.490
 For example, these lower bars 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.159
 made it are all things the 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.840
 Actually mistakes are so regulate the 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.130
 you should not actually do that or 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.299
 things you should not have on 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.999
 but they are extreme 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.979
 atmospheric and how to do that 

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:31.259
 I show now I delete everything first 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.079
 so we start with the basics 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.689
 we need a new level first and 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.179
 put this level in the dec mode 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.130
 negative multiply I do it 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:44.759
 I like to take part in the selection 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.920
 and just start that way a little bit yes 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.539
 to select areas I stick to it 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.280
 the shift key pressed that the 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:51.990
 can take extra and now 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.939
 I start from left and right this 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.130
 select elements so I have now 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.389
 in different areas then get me 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.389
 only one more color 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:09.030
 and paint in these, so to speak 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.039
 Stains with a good selection of this 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.319
 lay animals now it looks like you 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.390
 sees that this now swim over it 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.860
 I can also do such a thing 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.630
 little bit of those things here 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.000
 hide it by hitting it again 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.870
 without having this choice so 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.209
 Get those hard edges and there it was 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.130
 wrong I have to go back to this one 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.790
 Normal brush only wanted to take 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.160
 make bigger 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.019
 So I just paint yellow spots 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.600
 You can also do a little different 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.660
 then in coloring have in the picture 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.660
 in 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.400
 Carefully not too many and now 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.020
 just get a soft spot over it 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.060
 shear blur 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.230
 what would you like with that strength? 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.640
 makes you a little bit more 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.620
 These shapes so I still want 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.010
 Continue to light these bars in it 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.010
 to have 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.980
 so 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.080
 you can also go again 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.959
 hide a bit by the 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.659
 Blur motion blur takes 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.310
 and so oblique to the flyers 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:11.810
 You can do that again 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.810
 hide a bit of the leaks 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.890
 and now you see that I am here 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.840
 bit of left and right in the picture 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.190
 run have painted and there I would now 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.960
 just take it several times 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.450
 different colors 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.920
 get it fast mode again we get 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.280
 maybe here again to the bar purely 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.030
 and maybe we will that again 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.800
 now the selected one 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.160
 where you might still be a pure here 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.640
 below and here comes my again 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.640
 brush 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.430
 there a bit 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.350
 so now comes the again 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.740
 blur shear blur 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.550
 about it 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.950
 now it's going to be a little bit 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.349
 lubricated 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.980
 and so I get these disturbers 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:05.560
 these visual interferers about my photo 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.040
 and that's the first trick 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.120
 how to make these leaks flairs 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.380
 I also have a possibility 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.720
 I am going to a new level 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.639
 Fill the first with the neutral 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:23.310
 Color for the dec mode soft light 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.590
 and then I'm gonna aim 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.939
 markings and with weisweil 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.120
 if I filter this now 

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:31.860
 Blind spots then I see 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.659
 not where to do it and where to go 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.639
 There is even logic in the picture and indeed 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:37.499
 here is a light source that we can 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.740
 take to clarify 

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:44.099
 now it is on edges filter blind 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.560
 stains and you can clearly see I had 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:48.509
 here really only a gray area 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.460
 but because I'm a little bit here 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:52.229
 I know a painted white that I have the 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.529
 blind spot now put on it 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.529
 got to 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.320
 and can do it now in strength 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:02.880
 go up when you 150 and zack 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.470
 Now I go to hard light and 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.689
 can then determine the opacity 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.339
 how strong this flair comes in 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:10.080
 Now one thing is that these flairs 

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:11.309
 from photoshop always rendered anyway 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.259
 to have such a blue tone 

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:15.389
 because I now on an extra level 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:17.669
 have and the extra level looks so im 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.409
 grunde taken like this so that is 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:22.369
 now really only gray and has this 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:26.489
 Flair on this I can just over here 

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:30.849
 the hue saturation slider the hue 

00:05:26.489 --> 00:05:32.649
 change or even color 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:34.479
 I 'm doing that now in the me that 

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:36.429
 lower levels activate again 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:38.409
 Dyeing on this hue controller says 

00:05:36.429 --> 00:05:40.300
 the flair and now I can determine 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:41.649
 how this flair is colored and me 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.219
 made me really nice brown 

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:46.839
 red and have my finished picture here 

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:48.610
 Take that down a bit 

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:50.030
 the dark physical way the dark 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.400
 dress 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.470
 and whatever bothers me animals are 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.950
 At this artificial river photo show 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.790
 to get 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:01.300
 those hard edges of these rings 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:04.090
 nothing easier than that I draw it 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.340
 Just because I'm coming here 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.380
 please say in a smart object 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:13.140
 then convert here comes 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.140
 Blur on it blur 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:18.560
 Oh come on, this form is so easy to see 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:20.270
 so yes 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.060
 and now I have a plane mask 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:27.590
 the smart filter and can me in this 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:30.020
 plain mask just this double 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:32.200
 nice to blush so that I stop 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.970
 do not have this artificial look 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.410
 and voila 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.480
 if I go now you can see that 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.689
 you can almost even down here 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.729
 blur even more 

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:45.339
 that I'm not so aggressive here 

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:48.939
 have points in it and you can see clearly 

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:51.009
 was out of this simple boat in the 

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:52.089
 Tiefgarage I have just a whole 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:53.919
 special picture made 

00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:55.149
 pay attention to these blind spots as well 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:57.249
 always a bit on the logic, then 

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:58.869
 and to insert blind spots only 

00:06:57.249 --> 00:07:00.159
 then really meaningful if you too 

00:06:58.869 --> 00:07:01.329
 somewhere has a light source and 

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:03.579
 That's why I have from the beginning 

00:07:01.329 --> 00:07:05.499
 this destination is painted purely in this 

00:07:03.579 --> 00:07:07.809
 gray level so that I also in the filter 

00:07:05.499 --> 00:07:11.099
 could see where I blind this 

00:07:07.809 --> 00:07:11.099
 stains to put
