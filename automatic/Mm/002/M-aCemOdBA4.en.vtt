00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.940
 receipt which resembles 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.309
 place of 20 euros I had for this euro 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.629

 bought by blistering a controller for riou 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.090
 pro controller so the device superb 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.610
 economy so normally it was 50 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.860
 I paid that varrault always 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.360
 of an offer so here we see m sow 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.950
 to commit these others are the hitman 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.439
 I invite you to see video of the Belgians 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.920
 planned and finally I bought a case 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:23.720
 widely supposed to be quite i 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.979
 bought it's going to heat the steering wheel on xbox 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.170
 who was in pack with for the horizon 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.600
 then you're going to tell me bret has already 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.040
 makes a gameplay from the horizon in 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.890
 did the one I had these lands game 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.000
 that I had been loaned I borrowed that 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.310
 I had to go back there now I 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.659
 I've played with so I want 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.890
 will see well that it gives a tight game 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.409
 it does not sound too bad I made the 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.210
 taken in hand finally I pray them in hand 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.850
 it's great to put it back 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.030
 how a guy or in front of his slice 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.110
 it does not matter I started like that 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.200
 then I went detection 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.439
 movements I'll see you later 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.600
 we're going to do that like that it's more 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.979
 readable 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.219
 so that's all that to say that if 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.750
 you have a game near you and 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.490
 which is not empty robbed you by 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.869
 people because it's madness 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.170
 honestly I was this morning opening 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.170
 besides for the anecdote me in my 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.160
 gamer near my home so in Lille 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.720
 I was opening and opening 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.519
 in fact there was a guy two guys 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.610
 in front of me I think it was 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.049
 orders via resellers because 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.110
 that they bought the whole stock of 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:29.239
 game consoles where I was so they have 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.620
 two months for more than 4000 euros a 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.980
 huge sum 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.769
 they took everything hesitated xbox I find 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.640
 it's a little disgusting for customers 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.340
 because he's a guy who goes 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.099
 buy for example a xbox 250 euros 9 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.690
 zeta 170 I think it's someone 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.220
 who's holding a store something that 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.410
 worth to sell at the price of nine to see 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.690
 a little less but that again 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.120
 a beautiful walk on this point it takes 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.190
 the consoles the resellers do not make themselves 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.980
 almost no step on it's 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.620
 true you have outreau % something like that 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.230
 so it's really nothing - conquered 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.670
 there for that I advise you to go 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.299
 take a little tour on the side of the game to 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.730
 sailing honestly I liked it 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.750
 vintage game especially score game for 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.780
 those who followed me a little on 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.010
 facebook they know what I'm talking about 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.810
 head of a cloud all that stuff 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.030
 so that's it so I just wanted to do 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.700
 a little point on this game I hope 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.620
 that all employees will arrive as 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.780
 they can find work or 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.700
 change of vaud my perso I work 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:34.069
 in the sale also in the same area 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:37.010
 I would say in competition at 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:40.269
 micromania without citing them but I think 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.200
 eventually change your heads 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.760
 soon I do not know yet 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.889
 see well of the future is not 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.319
 sure so that's hello thank you for having 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:51.380
 watched this video think to support a 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.959
 little game 1 sellers even if there is a 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.069
 dispute be cool with how 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.470
 spend the aggression I think they 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.250
 will they are it's in a very 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.020
 bad 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.480
 very bad state of mind right now 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.650
 I think it'll be very disappointed how that 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.870
 ends it's really a shame for 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.700
 s that is and that the media does not 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.260
 speak not at all unlike by 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.730
 example quote 1 virgin 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.620
 we can not stop hearing right now 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.730
 on TV game nothing at all then 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.190
 that it's still put in the 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.239
 thousand employees in France virgin semil 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.430
 I also see no reason why we 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.200
 not talk like account the games would 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.700
 marginalized all this stuff there but me 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.870
 finally short so here I am you 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.520

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.520
