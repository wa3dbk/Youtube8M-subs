00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hello very good to all the kids 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.850
 welcome to the ant channel 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.440
 welcome one more day and good here 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.929
 we are in a video that had many 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.139
 want to do basically for the fact 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.880
 of being able to do it eye because it means 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.130
 Obviously, I have already in my possession 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.289
 playstation 4 as I said in the 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.910
 previous video and good as this is a 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.670
 video that some people have asked me 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.680
 video that good for now I have not seen 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.080
 by nowhere and how good I 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.160
 same I wanted to do it and it's about 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.960
 of something as simple as a 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.500
 comparison face to face between the 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.140
 dualshock 3 and the dualshock 4 and good without 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.030
 get into more rolls we're going to get 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.590
 directly to them because there will be 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.310
 time to talk about other things 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:49.570
 As you can see the controls have a way 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:52.120
 basic pretty similar if it were 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.130
 can notice that we say the grips of 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.220
 down here they are a little more open 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.520
 in the control of playstation 4 with which 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.800
 Well, the thumb is a little less 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.780
 forced let's say when it comes to being 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.110
 putting your hand in a position or in 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.110
 other 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.030
 another one of the changes that are appreciated to 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.910
 simple view as it is the touch zone that 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.860
 we have here on top of the mushrooms that 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.890
 besides being tactile because it has a button 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.810
 to one side and to the other the famous 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.170
 button be of which, well, I think 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.960
 that the truth has to be told 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.450
 we have an options button that is a button 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.200
 that has never really been has always 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.030
 been select but good I think the 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.229
 function that it fulfills is exactly the 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.659
 same as the one that the select or otherwise 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.630
 let's say the ps button itself but good 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.509
 let's say it does not close to little novelty 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.890
 we really also have around here without 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.560
 go from the front that I already 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.920
 was going back the speaker is a speaker 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.860
 it's still not very clear 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.500
 what will it serve 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.480
 until I do not play a little bit because no no 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.400
 I am clear about what uses they are going to give 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.050
 to be for the truth that I do not have 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.240
 idea what uses are you going to give but good 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.400
 I'm intrigued to see it and also 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.210
 we have the connector for the headset 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.550
 that if I'm not wrong is here 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.800
 This type of headphones xbox style a 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.690
 I personally do not like me 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.520
 they like it because of the cables and everything 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.590
 that I like more the wireless ones and 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.140
 that I have all three of the beats that I eat 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.990
 can see today they are going that the games have 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.510
 been a victim of my cursed dog 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.490
 by the way let's put this well 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.050
 again these are the games that I 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.400
 caught in the store the battlefield that 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.260
 He does not feel like to stand and 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.610
 killzone that came with the pack and that 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.020
 well we have already taught you in the other 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:49.810
 video going back to the subject of the controls 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.360
 the controls in addition to the different 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.520
 tactile parts in front and from here 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.640
 behind that good is not appreciated but it is 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.430
 tactile as we also have the mushrooms 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.549
 that are a little different as you see 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.290
 these are completely rounded and 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.719
 these are rounded but around 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.120
 they have a high contour that makes 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:11.920
 basically the finger make better contact 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.200
 with all the joystick and it's harder 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.700
 that you are going away that slips like 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.260
 You can spend many times playing the call 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.770
 of duty and when you are moving your finger 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.020
 very fast, not 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.120
 in my opinion it is a pretty command 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.610
 quality weighs a little more than the 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.490
 dualshock 3 neither much more but it 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.350
 you can appreciate that it weighs a little more 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:34.950
 I still do not know how the battery works and 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.140
 how long will it be, let's say the new led 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.240
 which leads from behind surely consumption 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.220
 a little bit I do not think it consumes too much 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.020
 but command itself is possible 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.130
 also consume a little more otherwise 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:50.880
 it's basically the same as the dualshock 3 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.850
 It has the same motion sensors 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.770
 Y 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.870
 Well I forgot to say that 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.920
 also the buttons themselves have been 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.920
 changed a little 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.019
 the truth is that without having played 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.410
 I still can not tell you how it is 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:09.230
 touch the truth is that 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.910
 they seem familiar no no it's not like 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.200
 was a completely new command with 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:17.620
 a with a completely new touch are 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.620
 practically 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:23.169
 same is the tact that they remit as soon as 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.650
 to the square triangle circle and here it 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.389
 refers however the crosshead and that 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.370
 the crosshead of the dualshock 3 was not for 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:32.080
 nothing for the crosshead this one appeared a 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.229
 little better let's say you can 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.229
 feel 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:39.199
 that the buttons are better insulated 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:40.459
 of each other not although there are times that 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.110
 when I press this one down here 

00:04:40.459 --> 00:04:44.149
 he wiggles the whole set let's say he is 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.729
 easier to squeeze only towards her 

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:49.009
 without also tightening this without wanting to 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:52.249
 it is a classic and mythical error of command 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:54.379
 of xbox 360 and that good of course in 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:56.569
 playstation3 was already fixed but 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:59.449
 here on playstation 4 it has improved 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:00.979
 a step in good quality I hope the 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.539
 video you liked guys I think 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.939
 there is nothing left to comment on if I 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:06.740
 forget something to put me in the comments and 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:08.360
 well as I always say a like favor and 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.069
 gives a lot to the channel I hope the 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.399
 video you liked and good until the 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:12.399
 next
