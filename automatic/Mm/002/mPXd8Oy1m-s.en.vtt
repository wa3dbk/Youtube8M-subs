00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
it's a one-week training where we teach

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.929 
it's a one-week training where we teach
them<00:00:20.730> about<00:00:21.320> basic<00:00:22.320> bioscience<00:00:23.130> techniques

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
them about basic bioscience techniques

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.120 
them about basic bioscience techniques
that<00:00:24.300> they<00:00:24.449> can<00:00:24.630> take<00:00:24.779> into<00:00:25.080> their<00:00:25.380> internship

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130

research we went through an interview
process<00:01:13.729> where<00:01:14.179> we<00:01:14.299> kind<00:01:14.479> of<00:01:14.570> explained<00:01:14.899> like

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:15.109 
process where we kind of explained like

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:17.050 
process where we kind of explained like
what<00:01:15.350> what<00:01:15.710> parts<00:01:16.429> of<00:01:16.579> science<00:01:16.759> we<00:01:16.969> were

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
what what parts of science we were

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.149 
what what parts of science we were
interested<00:01:17.329> in<00:01:17.659> so<00:01:17.990> I<00:01:18.020> expressed<00:01:18.649> interest<00:01:19.069> in

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
interested in so I expressed interest in

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.270 
interested in so I expressed interest in
cancer<00:01:19.579> and<00:01:20.229> more<00:01:21.229> molecular<00:01:21.920> and<00:01:22.069> cellular

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
cancer and more molecular and cellular

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.490 
cancer and more molecular and cellular
biology<00:01:22.490> and<00:01:23.329> this<00:01:23.719> is<00:01:23.869> the<00:01:23.959> lattice<00:01:24.229> placed

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
biology and this is the lattice placed

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.449 
biology and this is the lattice placed
in<00:01:24.649> so<00:01:24.890> I'm<00:01:25.189> very<00:01:25.310> happy<00:01:25.490> about<00:01:25.729> that<00:01:25.969> so<00:01:27.280> if<00:01:28.280> my

00:01:28.449 --> 00:01:28.459 
in so I'm very happy about that so if my

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:30.370 
in so I'm very happy about that so if my
favorite<00:01:28.700> part<00:01:29.119> is<00:01:29.359> working<00:01:29.689> with<00:01:30.020> all<00:01:30.170> the

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
favorite part is working with all the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.679 
favorite part is working with all the
bio<00:01:30.799> technicians<00:01:31.490> and<00:01:31.789> lab<00:01:31.939> managers<00:01:32.420> and

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
bio technicians and lab managers and

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.240 
bio technicians and lab managers and
getting<00:01:32.899> to<00:01:33.049> know<00:01:33.079> them<00:01:33.469> and<00:01:33.770> actually<00:01:33.920> just

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
getting to know them and actually just

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.599 
getting to know them and actually just
working<00:01:35.179> on<00:01:35.450> lab<00:01:36.229> work<00:01:36.259> which<00:01:37.159> is<00:01:37.310> a<00:01:37.340> lot

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
working on lab work which is a lot

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:39.309 
working on lab work which is a lot
different<00:01:38.060> than<00:01:38.090> just<00:01:38.299> learning<00:01:38.780> about<00:01:38.959> it<00:01:39.140> in

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
different than just learning about it in

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:42.910 
different than just learning about it in
school<00:01:39.579> it's<00:01:40.579> in<00:01:40.909> high<00:01:41.179> school<00:01:41.509> science<00:01:41.899> is<00:01:42.380> a

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
school it's in high school science is a

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.069 
school it's in high school science is a
little<00:01:43.399> bit<00:01:43.520> abstract

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
little bit abstract

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:47.240 
little bit abstract
experiments<00:01:46.079> everybody<00:01:46.649> knows<00:01:46.829> how<00:01:47.070> they're

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
experiments everybody knows how they're

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.819 
experiments everybody knows how they're
going<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.549> turn<00:01:47.759> out<00:01:47.969> there<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.439> information

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
going to turn out there the information

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.139 
going to turn out there the information
is<00:01:50.670> seems<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.780> be<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> lot<00:01:52.289> of<00:01:52.320> just<00:01:53.149> memorizing

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
is seems to be a lot of just memorizing

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.170 
is seems to be a lot of just memorizing
information<00:01:55.250> but<00:01:56.250> when<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.549> get<00:01:56.820> into<00:01:56.970> the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
information but when you get into the

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.749 
information but when you get into the
lab<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:57.750> understand<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.610> science<00:01:59.610> is

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
lab and you understand that science is

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.620 
lab and you understand that science is
actually<00:01:59.939> very<00:02:00.329> dynamic<00:02:00.929> and<00:02:01.110> science<00:02:01.649> is

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
actually very dynamic and science is

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.760 
actually very dynamic and science is
discovering<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:04.200> unknown<00:02:04.679> rather

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
discovering the unknown rather

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.260 
discovering the unknown rather
discovering<00:02:06.520> no<00:02:06.880> then<00:02:07.739> the<00:02:08.739> butt<00:02:09.520> of<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:09.819> idea

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
discovering no then the butt of the idea

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.339 
discovering no then the butt of the idea

all the lab members here and I can just
talk<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:29.010> them

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
meeting other students and learning

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.300

about<00:02:34.109> what<00:02:34.170> they're<00:02:34.500> doing<00:02:34.799> in<00:02:34.890> their<00:02:35.099> labs

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
about what they're doing in their labs

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.339 
about what they're doing in their labs
too<00:02:35.640> because<00:02:36.000> there's<00:02:36.209> such<00:02:36.420> a<00:02:36.450> great<00:02:36.629> range

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
too because there's such a great range

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.979 
too because there's such a great range
of<00:02:38.150> interesting<00:02:39.150> like<00:02:39.299> topics<00:02:39.750> that<00:02:39.870> they're

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
of interesting like topics that they're

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.720 
of interesting like topics that they're
researching<00:02:40.349> too<00:02:40.769> so<00:02:41.219> I<00:02:41.280> think<00:02:41.370> it's<00:02:41.609> really

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
researching too so I think it's really

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.880 
researching too so I think it's really
great<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.060> like<00:02:42.659> not<00:02:42.840> only<00:02:42.959> go<00:02:43.379> into<00:02:43.530> depth

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
great to like not only go into depth

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.410 
great to like not only go into depth
about<00:02:44.099> your<00:02:44.400> own<00:02:44.489> research<00:02:44.819> but<00:02:45.030> also<00:02:45.090> learn

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
about your own research but also learn

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.849 
about your own research but also learn
about<00:02:45.569> what<00:02:45.780> other<00:02:45.810> people<00:02:46.019> are<00:02:46.319> doing<00:02:46.379> I

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
about what other people are doing I

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:48.890 
about what other people are doing I
think<00:02:47.159> the<00:02:47.519> students<00:02:47.969> themselves<00:02:48.090> are<00:02:48.599> the

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
think the students themselves are the

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.319 
think the students themselves are the
most<00:02:49.049> surprising<00:02:49.609> seeing<00:02:50.609> how<00:02:50.939> much<00:02:51.060> they're

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
most surprising seeing how much they're

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.319 
most surprising seeing how much they're
capable<00:02:51.540> of<00:02:52.219> that's<00:02:53.219> probably<00:02:54.030> been<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.299> most

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
capable of that's probably been the most

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.089 
capable of that's probably been the most
surprising<00:02:54.930> thing<00:02:55.079> to<00:02:55.109> me<00:02:55.260> about<00:02:55.409> the<00:02:55.680> program

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
surprising thing to me about the program

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.399 
surprising thing to me about the program
and<00:02:57.319> you<00:02:58.319> know<00:02:58.439> just<00:02:58.909> the<00:02:59.909> generosity<00:03:00.269> of<00:03:00.719> the

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
and you know just the generosity of the

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.379 
and you know just the generosity of the
people<00:03:01.530> on<00:03:01.920> campus<00:03:02.310> who<00:03:02.730> take<00:03:02.939> them<00:03:03.090> into<00:03:03.299> the

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
people on campus who take them into the

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:07.010 
people on campus who take them into the
labs<00:03:03.599> and<00:03:04.079> give<00:03:04.560> them<00:03:04.680> those<00:03:04.799> opportunities
