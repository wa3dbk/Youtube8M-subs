vegas we locked ourselves in the bright
light<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.759> wish<00:00:12.690> you<00:00:12.900> could<00:00:13.200> have<00:00:13.620> seen<00:00:16.760> you<00:00:17.760> on

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
light I wish you could have seen you on

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.310 
light I wish you could have seen you on
the<00:00:18.060> brand-new<00:00:19.789> orangutang<00:00:20.789> balloons<00:00:21.320> okay

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
the brand-new orangutang balloons okay

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.950 
the brand-new orangutang balloons okay
specs<00:00:23.119> so<00:00:24.119> this<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.330> 83<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.199> durometer<00:00:26.000> 70<00:00:27.000> 2.5

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
specs so this is 83 a durometer 70 2.5

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.160 
specs so this is 83 a durometer 70 2.5
millimeters<00:00:28.740> tall<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.720> it's<00:00:30.720> got<00:00:31.140> a

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
millimeters tall and it's got a

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.400 
millimeters tall and it's got a
35-millimeter<00:00:31.949> contact<00:00:32.790> patch<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:34.290> is

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
35-millimeter contact patch and it is

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.270 
35-millimeter contact patch and it is
about<00:00:34.649> 44<00:00:35.430> millimeters<00:00:35.969> wide<00:00:37.040> the<00:00:38.040> core

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
about 44 millimeters wide the core

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.110 
about 44 millimeters wide the core
placement<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.000> center<00:00:39.570> set<00:00:39.809> these<00:00:40.559> wheels<00:00:40.920> are

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
placement is center set these wheels are

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.990 
placement is center set these wheels are
completely<00:00:42.200> symmetrical<00:00:43.280> so<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.430> way<00:00:44.640> once

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
completely symmetrical so that way once

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.610 
completely symmetrical so that way once
you<00:00:45.149> start<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.539> wear<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.780> little<00:00:46.200> bit<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:46.440> this

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
you start to wear a little bit on this

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.040 
you start to wear a little bit on this
side<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:46.920> starts<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.579> come<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:48.450> just<00:00:48.660> take<00:00:48.870> it

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
side and starts to come you just take it

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.319 
side and starts to come you just take it
off<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.710> truck<00:00:49.950> flipped<00:00:50.160> around<00:00:50.399> put<00:00:51.120> back

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
off the truck flipped around put back

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.540 
off the truck flipped around put back
script<00:00:51.690> back<00:00:51.840> on<00:00:52.050> boom<00:00:52.739> where's<00:00:53.699> easily<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:55.550> if

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
script back on boom where's easily so if

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.700 
script back on boom where's easily so if
you<00:00:56.820> can<00:00:56.969> see<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.480> can<00:00:57.629> see<00:00:57.780> right<00:00:57.809> here<00:00:58.170> it's

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
you can see you can see right here it's

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.939 
you can see you can see right here it's
got<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> really<00:00:59.460> huge<00:00:59.879> core<00:01:00.350> really<00:01:01.350> big<00:01:01.680> core

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
got a really huge core really big core

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.119 
got a really huge core really big core
so<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.329> pretty<00:01:03.510> much<00:01:03.629> means<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
so that pretty much means that the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.330 
so that pretty much means that the
durometer<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.299> wheel<00:01:06.590> like<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.770> 83<00:01:08.310> a

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
durometer on the wheel like the 83 a

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.700 
durometer on the wheel like the 83 a
it's<00:01:09.240> going<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.570> seem<00:01:09.900> like<00:01:09.930> it's<00:01:10.320> harder

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
it's going to seem like it's harder

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.510 
it's going to seem like it's harder
because<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.490> core<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:12.680> keeping<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.979> rubber

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
because the core is keeping that rubber

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.990 
because the core is keeping that rubber
pretty<00:01:15.299> hard<00:01:15.570> because<00:01:15.869> it's<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.380> close<00:01:17.000> also

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
pretty hard because it's so close also

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.609 
pretty hard because it's so close also
the<00:01:18.210> large<00:01:18.450> core<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.840> going<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.110> make<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.439> to

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
the large core is going to make it to

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.190 
the large core is going to make it to
her<00:01:19.909> initiating<00:01:20.909> slides<00:01:21.299> like<00:01:21.570> thrown<00:01:21.960> out

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
her initiating slides like thrown out

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.620 
her initiating slides like thrown out
the<00:01:22.350> board<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.710> slide<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.580> going<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.000> be<00:01:24.119> so

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
the board the slide is going to be so

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.870 
the board the slide is going to be so
easy<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.560> just<00:01:25.680> like<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.220> will<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.700> only

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
easy it's just like you will you only

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.270 
easy it's just like you will you only
have<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.360> be<00:01:27.479> going<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.990> few<00:01:28.650> miles<00:01:28.860> an<00:01:29.009> hour<00:01:29.130> to

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
have to be going a few miles an hour to

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.550 
have to be going a few miles an hour to
be<00:01:29.400> able<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.670> throw<00:01:30.000> out<00:01:30.180> your<00:01:30.210> board<00:01:30.659> which<00:01:31.409> is

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
be able to throw out your board which is

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.370 
be able to throw out your board which is
really<00:01:31.979> good<00:01:32.250> for<00:01:32.490> beginners<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.210> it's<00:01:34.170> good

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
really good for beginners and it's good

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.609 
really good for beginners and it's good
for<00:01:34.909> intermediate<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.290> upper<00:01:37.290> level

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
for intermediate to upper level

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.190 
for intermediate to upper level
longboarders<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:40.220> these<00:01:41.220> wheels<00:01:41.520> are<00:01:42.200> their

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
longboarders and these wheels are their

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.920 
longboarders and these wheels are their
kind<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.619> chattery<00:01:44.009> not<00:01:44.759> as<00:01:45.119> much<00:01:45.390> as<00:01:45.630> the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
kind of chattery not as much as the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.190 
kind of chattery not as much as the
durians<00:01:46.380> or<00:01:46.909> stimulus<00:01:47.909> they're<00:01:48.780> not<00:01:49.020> quite

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
durians or stimulus they're not quite

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.050 
durians or stimulus they're not quite
that<00:01:49.439> chattering<00:01:49.950> there<00:01:50.159> look<00:01:50.759> they're<00:01:51.030> a

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
that chattering there look they're a

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.370 
that chattering there look they're a
little<00:01:51.180> bit<00:01:51.329> more<00:01:51.450> smoother<00:01:51.750> than<00:01:51.930> as<00:01:52.170> I'm

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
little bit more smoother than as I'm

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.230 
little bit more smoother than as I'm
breaking<00:01:52.710> them<00:01:52.799> in<00:01:52.920> more<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.220> more<00:01:53.310> I've<00:01:54.060> been

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
breaking them in more and more I've been

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.109 
breaking them in more and more I've been
writing<00:01:54.479> them<00:01:54.689> pretty<00:01:55.170> moderately<00:01:55.890> for<00:01:56.850> about

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
writing them pretty moderately for about

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.740 
writing them pretty moderately for about
a<00:01:57.420> week<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.259> half<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:59.030> they've<00:02:00.030> they've

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
a week and a half and they've they've

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.420 
a week and a half and they've they've
actually<00:02:01.020> gotten<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.469> lot<00:02:01.590> smoother

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
actually gotten a lot smoother

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.130 
actually gotten a lot smoother
I've<00:02:02.610> noticed<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:03.060> as<00:02:03.330> i'm<00:02:03.510> doing<00:02:03.630> my<00:02:03.840> slides

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
I've noticed that as i'm doing my slides

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.210 
I've noticed that as i'm doing my slides
they<00:02:04.920> don't<00:02:05.250> leave<00:02:05.490> thane<00:02:05.880> which<00:02:06.420> although

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
they don't leave thane which although

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.850 
they don't leave thane which although
leaving<00:02:08.220> faint<00:02:08.460> lines<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.850> pretty<00:02:09.179> sweet<00:02:09.860> you

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
leaving faint lines is pretty sweet you

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.280 
leaving faint lines is pretty sweet you
kind<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.280> become<00:02:11.640> out<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.240> good<00:02:12.630> because<00:02:12.810> you

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
kind of become out is good because you

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.710 
kind of become out is good because you
won't<00:02:13.530> be<00:02:13.620> losing<00:02:14.100> thane<00:02:14.550> as<00:02:14.850> quick<00:02:15.300> in<00:02:15.540> the

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
won't be losing thane as quick in the

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.250 
won't be losing thane as quick in the
wheels<00:02:15.960> ends<00:02:16.740> up<00:02:16.890> having<00:02:17.460> along<00:02:17.790> their<00:02:17.970> life

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
wheels ends up having along their life

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.090 
wheels ends up having along their life
so<00:02:19.260> I<00:02:20.870> think<00:02:21.870> these<00:02:22.050> wolves<00:02:22.320> are<00:02:22.470> pretty<00:02:22.800> great

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
so I think these wolves are pretty great

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.650 
so I think these wolves are pretty great
they<00:02:23.970> roll<00:02:24.390> so<00:02:25.200> good<00:02:25.550> like<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.850> new<00:02:27.030> urethane

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
they roll so good like the new urethane

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.020 
they roll so good like the new urethane
on<00:02:27.959> these<00:02:28.410> wheels<00:02:28.709> you<00:02:29.340> can<00:02:29.520> tell<00:02:29.820> is

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
on these wheels you can tell is

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.190 
on these wheels you can tell is
different<00:02:30.450> from<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:31.370> stimulus<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.670> durian

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
different from the stimulus and durian

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.640 
different from the stimulus and durian
urethane<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:35.640> roll<00:02:36.030> speed<00:02:36.660> is<00:02:36.870> great<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.440> just

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
urethane the roll speed is great it just

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.540 
urethane the roll speed is great it just
holds<00:02:38.130> its<00:02:38.250> role<00:02:38.489> for<00:02:38.820> as<00:02:39.030> long<00:02:39.390> as<00:02:39.660> it<00:02:39.810> can<00:02:40.050> and

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
holds its role for as long as it can and

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.550 
holds its role for as long as it can and
it's<00:02:41.550> amazing<00:02:41.880> how<00:02:42.239> much<00:02:42.510> more<00:02:42.930> how<00:02:43.380> much

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
it's amazing how much more how much

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.290 
it's amazing how much more how much
farther<00:02:43.770> you're<00:02:44.070> going<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.280> go<00:02:44.459> with<00:02:44.940> a<00:02:45.000> push

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
farther you're going to go with a push

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.180 
farther you're going to go with a push
than<00:02:45.570> one<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.870> would<00:02:46.080> with<00:02:46.290> like<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.650> stimulus

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
than one you would with like a stimulus

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.330 
than one you would with like a stimulus
and<00:02:48.050> they're<00:02:49.050> a<00:02:49.080> good<00:02:49.380> size<00:02:49.709> that<00:02:50.100> are<00:02:50.190> in

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
and they're a good size that are in

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.360 
and they're a good size that are in
between<00:02:50.580> 70<00:02:51.420> and<00:02:51.450> 75<00:02:51.900> so<00:02:52.320> that<00:02:52.470> means<00:02:52.680> you

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
between 70 and 75 so that means you

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.400 
between 70 and 75 so that means you
could<00:02:53.550> probably<00:02:54.000> fit<00:02:54.450> them<00:02:54.600> into<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.870> top<00:02:55.170> mount

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
could probably fit them into a top mount

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.560 
could probably fit them into a top mount
board<00:02:55.709> without<00:02:56.430> having<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:56.970> worry<00:02:57.120> about<00:02:57.150> real

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
board without having to worry about real

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.199 
board without having to worry about real
bite<00:02:57.840> but<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:58.560> could<00:02:58.739> still<00:02:58.920> if<00:02:59.430> you<00:02:59.820> don't

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
bite but you could still if you don't

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.720 
bite but you could still if you don't
want<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:00.840> 70<00:03:01.770> millimeter<00:03:02.160> we<00:03:02.310> hope<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:02.610> feel

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
want a 70 millimeter we hope you feel

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.250 
want a 70 millimeter we hope you feel
like<00:03:02.880> it'll<00:03:03.030> be<00:03:03.120> too<00:03:03.330> small<00:03:03.660> you<00:03:03.959> could<00:03:04.110> just

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
like it'll be too small you could just

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.470 
like it'll be too small you could just
this<00:03:05.040> is<00:03:05.220> just<00:03:05.430> going<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:05.730> do<00:03:05.820> just<00:03:05.850> as<00:03:06.270> fine

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
this is just going to do just as fine

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.640 
this is just going to do just as fine
and<00:03:07.280> so<00:03:08.280> yeah<00:03:08.459> their<00:03:08.700> new<00:03:08.940> wheel<00:03:09.239> it's

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
and so yeah their new wheel it's

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.400 
and so yeah their new wheel it's
definitely<00:03:10.650> impressed<00:03:11.489> me<00:03:11.730> I<00:03:11.940> was<00:03:12.630> kind<00:03:13.019> of<00:03:13.170> on

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
definitely impressed me I was kind of on

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.199 
definitely impressed me I was kind of on
the<00:03:13.470> fence<00:03:13.799> on<00:03:14.100> how<00:03:14.370> i<00:03:14.400> was<00:03:14.700> feeling<00:03:14.760> about

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
the fence on how i was feeling about

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.710 
the fence on how i was feeling about
getting<00:03:15.570> it<00:03:15.750> but<00:03:16.320> I'm<00:03:16.470> really<00:03:16.799> glad<00:03:16.980> I<00:03:17.100> did

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
getting it but I'm really glad I did

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.870 
getting it but I'm really glad I did
it's<00:03:18.720> done<00:03:19.290> everything<00:03:19.769> I've<00:03:19.920> on<00:03:20.100> it<00:03:20.280> too<00:03:20.519> it's

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
it's done everything I've on it too it's

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:27.009 
it's done everything I've on it too it's
a<00:03:21.510> good<00:03:22.230> free<00:03:22.590> ride<00:03:22.799> wheel<00:03:23.510> at<00:03:25.130> moderate

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
a good free ride wheel at moderate

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.350 
a good free ride wheel at moderate
carving<00:03:28.019> wheel<00:03:28.200> it<00:03:29.070> does<00:03:29.459> grip<00:03:29.850> when<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.150> want

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
carving wheel it does grip when you want

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.860 
carving wheel it does grip when you want
it<00:03:30.390> to<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:30.980> slips<00:03:31.980> when<00:03:32.250> you<00:03:32.340> want<00:03:32.549> it<00:03:32.640> to<00:03:32.870> it's

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
it to and slips when you want it to it's

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.199 
it to and slips when you want it to it's
not<00:03:34.170> really<00:03:34.350> downhill<00:03:34.860> wheel<00:03:35.040> I<00:03:35.280> mean<00:03:35.910> you<00:03:36.060> can

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
not really downhill wheel I mean you can

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.780 
not really downhill wheel I mean you can
get<00:03:36.450> it<00:03:36.570> you<00:03:37.230> can<00:03:37.260> get<00:03:37.500> like<00:03:37.680> mid-30s<00:03:38.190> with<00:03:38.549> it

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
get it you can get like mid-30s with it

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.460 
get it you can get like mid-30s with it
but<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.269> wouldn't<00:03:39.570> really<00:03:39.660> take<00:03:39.900> it<00:03:40.049> past<00:03:40.260> that

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
but I wouldn't really take it past that

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.220 
but I wouldn't really take it past that
because<00:03:40.650> that's<00:03:40.860> not<00:03:41.160> really<00:03:41.430> its<00:03:41.549> discipline

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
because that's not really its discipline

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.310 
because that's not really its discipline
but<00:03:43.230> it<00:03:43.440> is<00:03:43.560> a<00:03:43.799> great<00:03:44.280> free<00:03:44.549> ride<00:03:44.730> wheel<00:03:45.320> hold

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
but it is a great free ride wheel hold

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.350 
but it is a great free ride wheel hold
slides<00:03:46.829> of<00:03:47.070> oil<00:03:47.220> doesn't<00:03:47.549> slow<00:03:47.880> you<00:03:48.000> down<00:03:48.150> too

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
slides of oil doesn't slow you down too

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.620 
slides of oil doesn't slow you down too
much<00:03:48.690> like<00:03:49.350> some<00:03:49.709> like<00:03:50.370> a<00:03:50.430> big<00:03:50.880> zigs<00:03:51.180> would<00:03:51.420> do

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
much like some like a big zigs would do

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.590 
much like some like a big zigs would do
they<00:03:52.049> would<00:03:52.130> shop<00:03:53.130> start<00:03:53.820> shopping<00:03:54.090> as<00:03:54.420> you're

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
they would shop start shopping as you're

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.270 
they would shop start shopping as you're
going<00:03:54.780> like<00:03:54.959> seems<00:03:55.350> like<00:03:55.530> it's<00:03:55.709> bouncing<00:03:56.160> it

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
going like seems like it's bouncing it

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.160 
going like seems like it's bouncing it
would<00:03:56.430> slow<00:03:56.549> you<00:03:56.700> down<00:03:56.850> these<00:03:57.090> more<00:03:57.420> just

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
would slow you down these more just

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.360 
would slow you down these more just
quick<00:03:58.829> whip<00:03:59.160> in<00:03:59.340> it<00:03:59.459> and<00:03:59.840> they<00:04:00.840> slide<00:04:01.230> well<00:04:01.950> and

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
quick whip in it and they slide well and

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.420 
quick whip in it and they slide well and
they<00:04:02.850> initiate<00:04:03.360> slides<00:04:03.660> well<00:04:03.900> so<00:04:04.769> yeah<00:04:05.160> I'd

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
they initiate slides well so yeah I'd

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.630 
they initiate slides well so yeah I'd
give<00:04:05.700> these<00:04:05.880> wheels<00:04:06.150> solid<00:04:07.340> eight<00:04:08.340> and<00:04:08.549> a<00:04:08.610> half

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
give these wheels solid eight and a half

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.240 
give these wheels solid eight and a half
nine

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
nine

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.060 
nine

review I hope you pick these up I would

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.670 
review I hope you pick these up I would
recommend<00:04:15.340> getting<00:04:15.940> the<00:04:16.359> orange<00:04:17.290> or<00:04:17.620> the

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
recommend getting the orange or the

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.789 
recommend getting the orange or the
purple<00:04:18.120> because<00:04:19.120> the<00:04:19.450> yellow<00:04:19.870> is<00:04:20.109> going<00:04:20.560> to<00:04:20.620> be

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
purple because the yellow is going to be

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.600 
purple because the yellow is going to be
really<00:04:21.489> hard<00:04:21.970> and<00:04:22.440> it'll<00:04:23.440> just<00:04:23.800> seem<00:04:24.250> a<00:04:24.310> little

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
really hard and it'll just seem a little
