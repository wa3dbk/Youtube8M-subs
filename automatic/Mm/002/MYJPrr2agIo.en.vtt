00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
out on this is a magic idea

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.509 
out on this is a magic idea
really<00:03:38.050> close<00:03:38.290> and<00:03:38.709> once<00:03:38.890> we<00:03:38.950> figure<00:03:39.250> it<00:03:39.400> out

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
really close and once we figure it out

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.250 
really close and once we figure it out
like<00:03:39.819> it'll<00:03:40.180> just<00:03:40.390> know<00:03:40.599> and<00:03:40.989> they're<00:03:41.110> like

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
like it'll just know and they're like

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.300 
like it'll just know and they're like
you<00:03:41.349> think<00:03:41.500> this<00:03:41.590> is<00:03:41.650> part<00:03:41.980> of<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.129> game

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
you think this is part of the game

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.490 
you think this is part of the game
because<00:03:42.610> of<00:03:42.640> how<00:03:42.790> stupid<00:03:43.269> and<00:03:43.360> like<00:03:43.599> just<00:03:44.319> like

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
because of how stupid and like just like

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.160 
because of how stupid and like just like
crazy<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.670> game<00:03:45.819> is<00:03:46.000> like<00:03:46.209> perhaps<00:03:46.750> this<00:03:47.019> is

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
crazy the game is like perhaps this is

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.229 
crazy the game is like perhaps this is
Khloe's<00:03:48.010> in<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.220> game<00:03:48.459> or<00:03:48.790> perhaps<00:03:48.940> they

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
Khloe's in the game or perhaps they

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:50.400 
Khloe's in the game or perhaps they
didn't<00:03:49.450> code<00:03:49.599> the<00:03:49.750> rest<00:03:49.930> of<00:03:50.019> the<00:03:50.080> game<00:03:50.230> so

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
didn't code the rest of the game so

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.290 
didn't code the rest of the game so
they're<00:03:50.530> like<00:03:50.890> it<00:03:50.920> maybe<00:03:51.610> blarg<00:03:51.879> no
