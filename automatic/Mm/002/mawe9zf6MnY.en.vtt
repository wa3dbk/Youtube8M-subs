00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.140 

first<00:02:08.660> you'll<00:02:08.840> do<00:02:08.990> all<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.380> way<00:02:09.440> around<00:02:10.150> the

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
first you'll do all the way around the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:03:56.500 
first you'll do all the way around the
side<00:02:11.360> of<00:02:11.480> her

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.260 

this<00:03:57.510> is<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:58.470> bottom<00:03:58.830> layer<00:03:59.070> of<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.760> back<00:03:59.940> of

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
this is the bottom layer of the back of

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.580 
this is the bottom layer of the back of
her<00:04:00.930> hair<00:04:01.670> you<00:04:02.670> see<00:04:03.180> how<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.450> curls<00:04:04.050> are<00:04:04.260> lower

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
her hair you see how the curls are lower

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.730 
her hair you see how the curls are lower
on<00:04:04.830> the<00:04:04.980> iron<00:04:05.370> because<00:04:05.970> on<00:04:06.210> the<00:04:06.360> back<00:04:06.740> the

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
on the iron because on the back the

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.810 
on the iron because on the back the
curls<00:04:08.070> will<00:04:08.190> still<00:04:08.400> be<00:04:08.580> loose<00:04:08.850> on<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.210> bottom

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
curls will still be loose on the bottom

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.940 
curls will still be loose on the bottom
but<00:04:11.820> they're<00:04:11.970> also<00:04:12.150> a<00:04:12.330> tighter<00:04:12.780> as<00:04:13.500> working

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
but they're also a tighter as working

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.950 
but they're also a tighter as working
our<00:04:14.010> way<00:04:14.040> back<00:04:14.130> they<00:04:14.850> get<00:04:15.000> tighter<00:04:15.390> and<00:04:15.540> then

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
our way back they get tighter and then

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.020 
our way back they get tighter and then
you<00:04:16.109> make<00:04:16.290> them<00:04:16.440> bow<00:04:16.680> looser<00:04:17.310> as<00:04:17.489> you<00:04:17.640> get<00:04:17.790> back

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
you make them bow looser as you get back

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.910 
you make them bow looser as you get back
towards<00:04:18.510> the<00:04:18.600> front<00:04:18.630> and<00:04:19.200> it<00:04:19.620> gives<00:04:19.769> it<00:04:19.890> a

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
towards the front and it gives it a

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.740 
towards the front and it gives it a
better<00:04:20.390> different<00:04:21.390> effect<00:04:21.810> and<00:04:23.420> so<00:04:24.420> I'll<00:04:24.690> be

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
better different effect and so I'll be

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.190 
better different effect and so I'll be
doing<00:04:24.930> this<00:04:25.260> all<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.560> way<00:04:26.570> around<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:27.870> bottom

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
doing this all the way around the bottom

00:04:28.200 --> 00:05:01.469 
doing this all the way around the bottom
there

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.689 

and<00:05:02.050> now<00:05:02.169> I'm<00:05:02.319> doing<00:05:02.559> the<00:05:02.710> top<00:05:03.009> there<00:05:03.370> and

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:03.699 
and now I'm doing the top there and

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:05.879 
and now I'm doing the top there and
these<00:05:03.939> curls<00:05:04.449> will<00:05:04.689> be<00:05:04.870> much<00:05:05.169> tighter<00:05:05.529> than

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
these curls will be much tighter than

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.519 
these curls will be much tighter than
the<00:05:06.069> bottom<00:05:06.400> there<00:05:06.550> as<00:05:06.789> I<00:05:06.999> said<00:05:07.210> before<00:05:07.419> and<00:05:08.129> um

00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:10.529 
the bottom there as I said before and um

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:13.589 
the bottom there as I said before and um
and<00:05:11.529> you<00:05:11.589> can<00:05:12.159> also<00:05:12.339> tell<00:05:12.669> how<00:05:12.909> much<00:05:13.120> higher<00:05:13.360> up

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:13.599 
and you can also tell how much higher up

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:14.309 
and you can also tell how much higher up
and<00:05:13.839> tighter

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:14.319 
and tighter

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:18.329

I<00:05:14.620> mean<00:05:15.129> closer<00:05:15.490> they<00:05:15.789> will<00:05:16.029> they<00:05:16.569> are<00:05:16.870> and<00:05:17.339> it

00:05:18.329 --> 00:05:18.339 
I mean closer they will they are and it

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:21.209 
I mean closer they will they are and it
gives<00:05:18.550> it<00:05:18.699> a<00:05:18.759> much<00:05:18.909> better<00:05:19.439> Prommy<00:05:20.439> look<00:05:21.009> and

00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:21.219 
gives it a much better Prommy look and

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:56.370 
gives it a much better Prommy look and
effect
