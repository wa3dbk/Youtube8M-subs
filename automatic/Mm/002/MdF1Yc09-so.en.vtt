00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.410
 Up 

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:14.679
 Diffusive diffusion 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.679
 Start Asia Tour 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.310
 Kago-chan 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.409
 Actually 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:32.780
 I do not want to do ensemble 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.730
 3 I heard no feeling 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.010
 I found the best 4 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.220
 Counterattack while thinking now 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.240
 It is a fact that you can not follow humans 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.240
 Such a thing 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.020
 The previous year's soil 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.800
 I'm airing and practicing songs 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.800
 The place which is not convinced by all means is decided 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.990
 Misunderstanding 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.650
 It is favorite song of Osaki senior 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.590
 Work on 53 years 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:01.910
 Oh yes 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.000
 by the way 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.160
 On the other hand, it is only to participate in the contest of advance corps sea 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.100
 I also heard 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.730
 I went out at the intersection I was planning to worry about Osaki instead 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.600
 You can say that you are not asking me 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.730
 that's 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.140
 It is an open port commemorative iron 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.140
 Classical concerts for children 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.220
 It is impossible for me to have a cute napkin with volume 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.870
 That's not true 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.620
 It was really 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.950
 I think I will not ask the pumpkin even Osaki senior 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.290
 Enter shopping 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.560
 I commemorate a total of 27 years at the gem auction 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.140
 I stood straight 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.450
 Grew up well 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.450
 That's so important 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.100
 It is the final product 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.100
 I like Kago-chan's performance most 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:15.949
 boxing 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:16.989
 Once 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.090
 Sleeping on the moon
