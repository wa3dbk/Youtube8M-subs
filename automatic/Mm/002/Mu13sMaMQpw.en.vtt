00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
sure of the vintage copper was King here

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.560 
sure of the vintage copper was King here
during<00:04:11.200> that<00:04:11.680> period<00:04:12.010> I<00:04:12.280> guess<00:04:12.520> so<00:04:12.850> it's

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
during that period I guess so it's

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.270 
during that period I guess so it's
probably<00:04:14.050> around<00:04:14.230> the<00:04:14.590> time<00:04:14.620> that<00:04:14.860> it<00:04:15.130> was

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
probably around the time that it was

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.090
