Enderdragon<00:00:18.930> fight<00:00:19.140> because<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:19.740> involves

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
Enderdragon fight because it involves

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.859 
Enderdragon fight because it involves
dragon's<00:00:20.640> breath<00:00:20.789> which<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.150> can<00:00:21.300> now<00:00:21.390> bottle

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
dragon's breath which you can now bottle

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.050 
dragon's breath which you can now bottle
up<00:00:22.020> as<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.769> Dragon<00:00:23.100> spews<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.609> out<00:00:23.730> at<00:00:23.910> you

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
up as the Dragon spews it out at you

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.880 
up as the Dragon spews it out at you
during<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.480> fight<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.230> imagine<00:00:25.560> if<00:00:25.800> you're

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
during the fight so I imagine if you're

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.050 
during the fight so I imagine if you're
on<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.010> multiplayer<00:00:26.369> server<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.730> bunch<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:26.939> you

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
on a multiplayer server a bunch of you

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.429 
on a multiplayer server a bunch of you
will<00:00:27.150> be<00:00:27.240> fighting<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.599> dragon<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.050> somebody

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
will be fighting the dragon and somebody

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.990 
will be fighting the dragon and somebody
else<00:00:28.590> will<00:00:28.740> be<00:00:28.859> on<00:00:29.010> Dragon's<00:00:29.849> Breath

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
else will be on Dragon's Breath

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.910 
else will be on Dragon's Breath

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
collecting detail because if you take

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.830 
collecting detail because if you take
glass<00:00:32.189> bottles<00:00:32.550> with<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.059> you'll<00:00:33.450> be<00:00:33.600> able<00:00:33.719> to

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
glass bottles with you you'll be able to

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.260 
glass bottles with you you'll be able to
bottle<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.230> up<00:00:34.290> as<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.620> go<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.120> brewing<00:00:36.120> it

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
bottle this up as you go and brewing it

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
adding it to a splash potion will create

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.270 
adding it to a splash potion will create
a<00:00:39.300> lingering<00:00:39.989> potion<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.680> these<00:00:40.950> are

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
a lingering potion and these are

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.220 
a lingering potion and these are
fantastic<00:00:41.910> let<00:00:42.570> me<00:00:42.629> just<00:00:42.780> show<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:42.899> how<00:00:43.079> this

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
fantastic let me just show you how this

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.080 
fantastic let me just show you how this
works<00:00:43.290> if<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:43.770> throw<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.579> like<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.789> splash

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
works if you throw it like a splash

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.450 
works if you throw it like a splash
potion<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.690> creates<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:46.260> lingering<00:00:47.129> cloud

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
potion it creates this lingering cloud

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.950 
potion it creates this lingering cloud
and<00:00:47.640> right<00:00:47.789> now<00:00:47.940> there's<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.510> couple<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.809> things

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
and right now there's a couple of things

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.600 
and right now there's a couple of things
that<00:00:49.110> need<00:00:49.140> changing<00:00:49.260> like<00:00:49.800> if<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.129> throw<00:00:50.460> it

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
that need changing like if you throw it

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.819 
that need changing like if you throw it
over<00:00:50.879> there<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.629> seems<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.320> kind<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.680> create

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
over there it seems to kind of create

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.459 
over there it seems to kind of create
the<00:00:53.100> cloud<00:00:53.280> over<00:00:53.520> here<00:00:53.670> but<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.940> depends<00:00:54.469> on

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
the cloud over here but it depends on

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.959 
the cloud over here but it depends on
the<00:00:55.680> players<00:00:55.980> location<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.640> little<00:00:56.850> bit

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
the players location a little bit

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.369 
the players location a little bit
occasionally<00:00:57.570> you'll<00:00:57.719> throw<00:00:57.899> one<00:00:58.050> over<00:00:58.079> there

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
occasionally you'll throw one over there

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.689 
occasionally you'll throw one over there
and<00:00:58.590> then<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.829> cloud<00:00:59.039> will<00:00:59.219> spring<00:00:59.489> up<00:00:59.550> around

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
and then the cloud will spring up around

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.029 
and then the cloud will spring up around
your<00:00:59.910> feet<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.420> they're<00:01:01.050> not<00:01:01.230> quite<00:01:01.500> as<00:01:01.649> exact

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
your feet so they're not quite as exact

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.009 
your feet so they're not quite as exact
as<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.309> would<00:01:02.489> like<00:01:02.670> them<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.910> be<00:01:03.090> right<00:01:03.300> now<00:01:03.480> but

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
as I would like them to be right now but

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.630 
as I would like them to be right now but
this<00:01:04.140> has<00:01:04.439> opened<00:01:04.619> up<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.979> whole<00:01:05.220> lot<00:01:05.610> of

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
this has opened up a whole lot of

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.429 
this has opened up a whole lot of
possibilities<00:01:06.090> for<00:01:06.689> stuff<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.110> can<00:01:07.260> do<00:01:07.409> with

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
possibilities for stuff you can do with

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.770 
possibilities for stuff you can do with
them<00:01:07.710> for<00:01:07.890> example<00:01:08.340> take<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.000> arrow<00:01:09.210> fountain

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
them for example take the arrow fountain

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.210 
them for example take the arrow fountain
that<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:09.960> designed<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.500> my<00:01:10.619> snapshot<00:01:11.040> video

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
that I designed it in my snapshot video

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.880 
that I designed it in my snapshot video
fun<00:01:11.490> with<00:01:11.640> arrows<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:13.140> basically<00:01:13.470> made

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
fun with arrows and it's basically made

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.620 
fun with arrows and it's basically made
that<00:01:14.040> obsolete<00:01:14.520> because<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.880> was<00:01:15.150> just<00:01:15.330> getting

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
that obsolete because I was just getting

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.660 
that obsolete because I was just getting
little<00:01:16.110> particles<00:01:16.680> coming<00:01:16.950> up<00:01:17.100> through<00:01:17.340> here

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
little particles coming up through here

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.820 
little particles coming up through here
one<00:01:18.150> at<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.330> time<00:01:18.600> from<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.170> arrows<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
one at a time from the arrows that the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.770 
one at a time from the arrows that the
dispensers<00:01:20.310> were<00:01:20.430> firing<00:01:20.640> now<00:01:20.970> if<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.600> load

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
dispensers were firing now if you load

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.390 
dispensers were firing now if you load
the<00:01:21.869> dispensers<00:01:22.320> up<00:01:22.439> with<00:01:22.590> splash<00:01:22.860> potions

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
the dispensers up with splash potions

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.789 
the dispensers up with splash potions
this<00:01:23.880> happens<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.689> subtle<00:01:25.259> here<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.470> get<00:01:25.650> all

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
this happens and subtle here you get all

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.230 
this happens and subtle here you get all
these<00:01:25.979> particles<00:01:26.549> which<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:26.909> be<00:01:26.970> used<00:01:27.119> to

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
these particles which can be used to

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.910

there's<00:03:40.260> a<00:03:40.319> bit<00:03:40.440> of<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.590> mouthful<00:03:40.950> I<00:03:41.069> will<00:03:41.190> come

there's a bit of a mouthful I will come

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.860 
there's a bit of a mouthful I will come
up<00:03:41.430> with<00:03:41.549> a<00:03:41.579> better<00:03:41.700> name<00:03:41.850> for<00:03:41.970> it<00:03:42.239> and<00:03:42.480> I'm

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
up with a better name for it and I'm

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.120 
up with a better name for it and I'm
sure<00:03:43.079> this<00:03:43.260> is<00:03:43.380> something<00:03:43.500> people<00:03:43.650> have<00:03:43.980> done

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
sure this is something people have done

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.039 
sure this is something people have done
before<00:03:44.220> with<00:03:44.459> splash<00:03:44.730> potions<00:03:45.180> but<00:03:45.269> with<00:03:45.930> the

leaving the lingering potions sorry it

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.120 
leaving the lingering potions sorry it
it<00:03:50.670> is<00:03:50.970> a<00:03:51.239> lot<00:03:51.630> easier<00:03:51.660> to<00:03:52.109> make<00:03:52.709> sure<00:03:52.950> that

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
it is a lot easier to make sure that

your your intended target gets hit so

your your intended target gets hit so

redstone<00:04:38.500> it's<00:04:39.070> the<00:04:39.160> only<00:04:39.220> advice<00:04:39.580> I<00:04:39.790> can<00:04:39.820> give

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
redstone it's the only advice I can give

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.790 
redstone it's the only advice I can give
them<00:04:40.180> and<00:04:40.390> this<00:04:40.480> circuit<00:04:41.290> can<00:04:41.410> also<00:04:41.560> be

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
them and this circuit can also be

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.590 
them and this circuit can also be
implemented<00:04:42.130> in<00:04:42.430> a<00:04:42.610> few<00:04:42.820> different<00:04:43.120> ways<00:04:43.270> this

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
implemented in a few different ways this

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.020 
implemented in a few different ways this
is<00:04:43.840> one<00:04:44.500> I've<00:04:44.740> kind<00:04:45.040> of<00:04:45.070> worked<00:04:45.280> on<00:04:45.460> it's<00:04:45.640> a<00:04:45.820> bad

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030

the redstone bots which we've got over
there<00:04:50.470> but<00:04:50.560> you<00:04:50.620> could<00:04:50.740> do<00:04:50.860> something<00:04:51.130> similar

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460

ha<00:05:00.790> this<00:05:01.420> is<00:05:01.570> this<00:05:02.260> is<00:05:02.380> a<00:05:02.410> quirk<00:05:02.830> i<00:05:02.980> forgot<00:05:03.250> to

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
ha this is this is a quirk i forgot to

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.130 
ha this is this is a quirk i forgot to
mention<00:05:03.670> this<00:05:03.700> this<00:05:03.940> is<00:05:04.060> a<00:05:04.090> quirk<00:05:04.390> of<00:05:04.630> the

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
mention this this is a quirk of the

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.960 
mention this this is a quirk of the
redstone<00:05:05.560> block<00:05:05.800> update<00:05:06.160> is<00:05:06.370> that<00:05:06.610> it<00:05:06.790> will

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
redstone block update is that it will

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.420 
redstone block update is that it will
also<00:05:07.540> update<00:05:07.750> when<00:05:08.230> the<00:05:08.590> red<00:05:08.740> stone<00:05:08.980> effect

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
also update when the red stone effect

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.780 
also update when the red stone effect
turns<00:05:10.120> off<00:05:10.360> so<00:05:11.050> if<00:05:11.290> you've<00:05:11.470> hit<00:05:11.620> it<00:05:11.650> once<00:05:12.010> it

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
turns off so if you've hit it once it

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.720 
turns off so if you've hit it once it
will<00:05:12.940> activate<00:05:13.420> the<00:05:14.400> dispenser<00:05:15.400> and<00:05:15.550> then

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
will activate the dispenser and then

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.850 
will activate the dispenser and then
when<00:05:16.120> the<00:05:16.420> redstone<00:05:16.780> stops<00:05:17.140> being<00:05:17.410> lit<00:05:17.560> up<00:05:17.710> and

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
when the redstone stops being lit up and

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.260 
when the redstone stops being lit up and
goes<00:05:17.980> back<00:05:18.160> to<00:05:18.220> how<00:05:18.430> it<00:05:18.460> was<00:05:18.550> before<00:05:18.640> it

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
goes back to how it was before it

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.090 
goes back to how it was before it
activates<00:05:19.750> again<00:05:19.900> so<00:05:20.230> if<00:05:20.320> your<00:05:20.440> friend<00:05:20.710> yeah

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
activates again so if your friend yeah

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.830 
activates again so if your friend yeah
and<00:05:21.220> it's<00:05:21.340> just<00:05:21.490> close<00:05:21.670> that<00:05:21.700> door<00:05:22.030> as<00:05:22.180> well<00:05:22.330> so

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
and it's just close that door as well so

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.720 
and it's just close that door as well so
if<00:05:22.960> your<00:05:23.110> friend<00:05:23.440> comes<00:05:24.010> back<00:05:24.130> here<00:05:24.490> and<00:05:24.610> goes

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:24.730 
if your friend comes back here and goes

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.040 
if your friend comes back here and goes
what<00:05:24.910> on<00:05:25.060> earth<00:05:25.210> was<00:05:25.450> that<00:05:25.510> and<00:05:25.840> then<00:05:25.930> it

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
what on earth was that and then it

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.240 
what on earth was that and then it
deactivates<00:05:26.560> they<00:05:26.650> get<00:05:26.770> hit<00:05:26.920> with<00:05:27.010> poison

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
deactivates they get hit with poison

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.570 
deactivates they get hit with poison
again<00:05:27.340> so<00:05:27.940> that's<00:05:28.090> even<00:05:28.330> better<00:05:28.480> but<00:05:29.170> if<00:05:29.350> you

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
again so that's even better but if you

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.920 
again so that's even better but if you
right<00:05:30.580> click<00:05:30.610> on<00:05:30.850> that<00:05:31.000> like<00:05:31.210> I<00:05:31.300> said<00:05:31.450> or<00:05:31.630> punch

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
right click on that like I said or punch

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.810 
right click on that like I said or punch
it<00:05:32.110> if<00:05:32.230> you're<00:05:32.380> in<00:05:32.530> survival<00:05:32.770> mode<00:05:33.100> and<00:05:33.520> you're

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
it if you're in survival mode and you're

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.160 
it if you're in survival mode and you're
not<00:05:33.850> going<00:05:34.000> to<00:05:34.090> break<00:05:34.270> the<00:05:34.480> block<00:05:34.690> then<00:05:34.960> it

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.170 
not going to break the block then it

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.460 
not going to break the block then it
will<00:05:35.260> open<00:05:35.440> this<00:05:35.830> door<00:05:36.160> and<00:05:36.460> I<00:05:37.150> will<00:05:38.140> be<00:05:38.260> happy

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
will open this door and I will be happy

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.530 
will open this door and I will be happy
to<00:05:38.560> do<00:05:38.740> tutorials<00:05:39.280> on<00:05:39.610> any<00:05:39.790> of<00:05:39.940> this<00:05:40.060> stuff<00:05:40.210> if

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540 
to do tutorials on any of this stuff if

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:41.790 
to do tutorials on any of this stuff if
you<00:05:40.660> like<00:05:40.870> but<00:05:41.110> I<00:05:41.200> just<00:05:41.320> wanted<00:05:41.500> to<00:05:41.620> show<00:05:41.770> you

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
you like but I just wanted to show you

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.620 
you like but I just wanted to show you
guys<00:05:41.950> some<00:05:42.670> stuff<00:05:42.910> I've<00:05:43.060> been<00:05:43.210> messing<00:05:43.570> around

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
guys some stuff I've been messing around

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.020 
guys some stuff I've been messing around
with<00:05:43.960> last<00:05:44.650> but<00:05:44.890> not<00:05:44.980> least<00:05:45.040> i<00:05:45.460> have<00:05:45.790> been

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
with last but not least i have been

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.120 
with last but not least i have been
doing<00:05:46.510> stuff<00:05:46.840> with<00:05:46.990> armor<00:05:47.260> stands<00:05:47.530> like<00:05:47.920> I<00:05:48.070> do

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
doing stuff with armor stands like I do

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.010 
doing stuff with armor stands like I do
and<00:05:48.490> I've<00:05:48.970> discovered<00:05:49.330> that<00:05:49.450> you<00:05:49.630> can<00:05:49.780> use<00:05:49.900> an

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
and I've discovered that you can use an

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.260 
and I've discovered that you can use an
armor<00:05:50.260> stand<00:05:50.500> as<00:05:50.710> basically<00:05:51.610> like<00:05:51.880> a<00:05:51.910> water

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
armor stand as basically like a water

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.630 
armor stand as basically like a water
clock<00:05:52.750> so<00:05:53.080> if<00:05:53.230> I<00:05:53.350> throw<00:05:53.920> an<00:05:54.040> understand<00:05:54.460> in

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:54.640 
clock so if I throw an understand in

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.310 
clock so if I throw an understand in
there<00:05:54.910> it's<00:05:55.330> going<00:05:55.510> to<00:05:55.540> go<00:05:55.720> around<00:05:55.960> this<00:05:56.080> water

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
there it's going to go around this water

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.660 
there it's going to go around this water
course<00:05:56.590> and<00:05:56.770> it's<00:05:56.860> set<00:05:57.040> up<00:05:57.070> like<00:05:57.220> a<00:05:57.370> mob

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:57.670 
course and it's set up like a mob

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.180 
course and it's set up like a mob
elevator<00:05:58.060> so<00:05:58.420> that<00:05:58.630> the<00:05:59.140> farmers<00:05:59.800> tan<00:05:59.980> just

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190 
elevator so that the farmers tan just

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.610 
elevator so that the farmers tan just
flows<00:06:00.430> around<00:06:00.610> this<00:06:00.940> course<00:06:01.270> and<00:06:01.540> this<00:06:02.320> is<00:06:02.440> set

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
flows around this course and this is set

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.280 
flows around this course and this is set
up<00:06:02.710> next<00:06:02.890> to<00:06:03.040> a<00:06:03.100> string<00:06:03.490> bird<00:06:03.700> which

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.290 
up next to a string bird which

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.480 
up next to a string bird which
unfortunately<00:06:05.290> it<00:06:05.680> gives<00:06:05.800> you<00:06:05.890> two<00:06:06.040> pulses

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
unfortunately it gives you two pulses

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.010 
unfortunately it gives you two pulses
and<00:06:06.640> not<00:06:06.790> just<00:06:06.970> one<00:06:07.240> but<00:06:07.270> every<00:06:07.660> time<00:06:07.840> the

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
and not just one but every time the

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.360 
and not just one but every time the
armorstand<00:06:08.320> flows<00:06:08.830> through<00:06:09.100> there<00:06:09.250> is

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
armorstand flows through there is

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.460 
armorstand flows through there is
detected<00:06:09.790> by<00:06:09.940> the<00:06:09.970> string<00:06:10.390> and<00:06:10.510> that<00:06:11.020> updates

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
detected by the string and that updates

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.050 
detected by the string and that updates
this<00:06:11.710> piston<00:06:12.130> which<00:06:12.280> thanks<00:06:12.610> to<00:06:12.730> the<00:06:12.850> slime

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
this piston which thanks to the slime

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.300 
this piston which thanks to the slime
block<00:06:13.240> and<00:06:13.360> the<00:06:13.420> redstone<00:06:13.780> block<00:06:14.740> on<00:06:14.950> top<00:06:14.980> of

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
block and the redstone block on top of

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.000 
block and the redstone block on top of
it<00:06:15.450> activates<00:06:16.450> the<00:06:16.600> piston<00:06:16.960> and<00:06:17.170> will

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
it activates the piston and will

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.800 
it activates the piston and will
activate<00:06:18.430> a<00:06:18.490> circuit<00:06:19.000> anything<00:06:19.480> you<00:06:19.570> tie<00:06:19.780> up

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
activate a circuit anything you tie up

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.960 
activate a circuit anything you tie up
to<00:06:20.080> that<00:06:20.230> so<00:06:20.530> basically<00:06:21.370> this<00:06:21.490> could<00:06:21.670> be<00:06:21.760> used

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:21.970 
to that so basically this could be used

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.640 
to that so basically this could be used
to<00:06:22.060> set<00:06:22.330> up<00:06:22.480> a<00:06:22.600> really<00:06:22.750> slow<00:06:23.080> clock<00:06:23.410> if<00:06:23.560> you

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
to set up a really slow clock if you

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.290 
to set up a really slow clock if you
wanted<00:06:23.980> to<00:06:24.130> there<00:06:24.640> are<00:06:24.730> whole<00:06:24.850> variety<00:06:25.000> of

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
wanted to there are whole variety of

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.060 
wanted to there are whole variety of
uses<00:06:25.480> for<00:06:25.630> this<00:06:25.810> again<00:06:26.140> this<00:06:26.320> is<00:06:26.530> just<00:06:26.740> a<00:06:26.860> proof

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.070 
uses for this again this is just a proof

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.100 
uses for this again this is just a proof
of<00:06:27.160> concept<00:06:27.340> so<00:06:27.880> I'm<00:06:28.300> sure<00:06:28.660> I'll<00:06:28.810> be<00:06:28.900> able<00:06:28.930> to

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
of concept so I'm sure I'll be able to

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.260 
of concept so I'm sure I'll be able to
find<00:06:29.290> some<00:06:29.560> way<00:06:29.710> of<00:06:29.740> using<00:06:30.340> these<00:06:30.610> in<00:06:30.910> builds

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
find some way of using these in builds

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.510 
find some way of using these in builds
in<00:06:31.390> future<00:06:31.840> but<00:06:32.110> i<00:06:32.320> thought<00:06:33.010> i'd<00:06:33.160> let<00:06:33.190> you<00:06:33.370> guys

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:36.910

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.820 
fun with lingering potions and redstone
stuff<00:06:37.390> let<00:06:38.229> me<00:06:38.290> know<00:06:38.380> if<00:06:38.470> you<00:06:38.530> want<00:06:38.650> to<00:06:38.710> see<00:06:38.800> a
