00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.369 

so<00:03:10.030> i'm<00:03:10.120> just<00:03:10.180> literally<00:03:10.780> pushing<00:03:11.109> it<00:03:11.319> over

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
so i'm just literally pushing it over

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:12.869 
so i'm just literally pushing it over
the<00:03:11.590> top<00:03:11.769> so<00:03:11.950> you<00:03:12.010> just<00:03:12.159> layering<00:03:12.459> up<00:03:12.700> those

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879

the top so you just layering up those
products<00:03:13.299> and<00:03:13.420> this<00:03:14.319> is<00:03:14.409> going<00:03:14.500> to<00:03:14.590> be<00:03:14.709> more

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
products and this is going to be more

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.229 
products and this is going to be more
comfortable<00:03:15.219> and<00:03:15.489> actual<00:03:15.819> glitter<00:03:16.030> on<00:03:16.180> your

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
lips because it probably is going to

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.959 
lips because it probably is going to
hurt<00:03:18.640> well<00:03:19.950> maybe<00:03:20.950> not<00:03:21.129> he'll<00:03:21.340> just<00:03:21.609> be<00:03:21.730> really

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:21.969 
hurt well maybe not he'll just be really

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:30.089 
hurt well maybe not he'll just be really
uncomfortable<00:03:27.989> so<00:03:28.989> just<00:03:29.230> pushing<00:03:29.560> that<00:03:29.650> in<00:03:29.829> so

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
uncomfortable so just pushing that in so

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.030 
uncomfortable so just pushing that in so
you've<00:03:30.219> got<00:03:30.430> more<00:03:31.299> of<00:03:31.359> a<00:03:31.510> glittery<00:03:32.019> effect<00:03:32.680> and

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
you've got more of a glittery effect and

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.740 
you've got more of a glittery effect and
now<00:03:33.310> I've<00:03:33.459> got<00:03:33.639> some<00:03:33.879> a<00:03:34.060> sample<00:03:34.480> pot<00:03:34.629> of

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
now I've got some a sample pot of

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:42.000 
now I've got some a sample pot of
reflects<00:03:35.230> pearl<00:03:40.200> then<00:03:41.200> I'm<00:03:41.349> pushing<00:03:41.829> more

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.530 

so<00:03:55.870> literally<00:03:56.440> just<00:03:56.770> through<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:57.100> center<00:03:57.540> so

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
so literally just through the center so

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.420 
so literally just through the center so
that<00:03:58.570> is<00:03:59.020> going<00:03:59.140> to<00:03:59.260> give<00:03:59.290> you<00:03:59.650> the<00:03:59.680> effective

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
that is going to give you the effective

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.880 
that is going to give you the effective
and<00:04:00.670> even<00:04:01.630> more<00:04:01.810> 3d<00:04:02.200> because<00:04:02.380> it's<00:04:02.620> kind<00:04:02.800> of

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
and even more 3d because it's kind of

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.940 
and even more 3d because it's kind of
highlighting<00:04:03.520> and<00:04:03.670> bringing<00:04:03.940> that<00:04:04.090> the

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
highlighting and bringing that the

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.680 
highlighting and bringing that the
center<00:04:05.950> of<00:04:05.980> the<00:04:06.100> lips<00:04:06.280> forward<00:04:06.760> so<00:04:07.420> maybe<00:04:07.630> i

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
center of the lips forward so maybe i

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.750 
center of the lips forward so maybe i
should<00:04:07.900> say<00:04:08.050> these<00:04:08.230> are<00:04:08.260> so<00:04:08.710> sparkly<00:04:09.220> lips<00:04:09.550> for

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
should say these are so sparkly lips for

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.660 
should say these are so sparkly lips for
christmas<00:04:10.210> maybe<00:04:10.450> not<00:04:10.660> glittery<00:04:11.050> because<00:04:11.440> i

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
christmas maybe not glittery because i

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.910 
christmas maybe not glittery because i
don't<00:04:12.670> need<00:04:12.910> to<00:04:13.090> kind<00:04:13.510> of<00:04:13.540> think<00:04:13.750> that<00:04:14.050> I've

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
don't need to kind of think that I've

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.670 
don't need to kind of think that I've
quand<00:04:15.400> you<00:04:15.640> because<00:04:16.450> I<00:04:16.630> said<00:04:16.870> glittery<00:04:17.320> not

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
quand you because I said glittery not

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.680 
quand you because I said glittery not
sparkly<00:04:18.160> they<00:04:18.310> are<00:04:18.430> I<00:04:18.459> guess<00:04:18.790> more<00:04:19.060> sparkly

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
sparkly they are I guess more sparkly

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.810 
sparkly they are I guess more sparkly
than<00:04:19.989> glittery<00:04:20.410> because<00:04:20.920> I<00:04:21.100> mean<00:04:21.549> I<00:04:21.640> don't

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
than glittery because I mean I don't

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.250
