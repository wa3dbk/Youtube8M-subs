00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.330 
because it's more like a classic ghost
of<00:03:48.720> dark<00:03:48.900> spectres<00:03:49.380> like<00:03:49.530> a<00:03:49.560> big<00:03:49.770> cloud<00:03:50.070> with

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
of dark spectres like a big cloud with

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.800 
of dark spectres like a big cloud with
lots<00:03:50.520> of<00:03:50.610> tendrils<00:03:51.120> coming<00:03:51.420> towards<00:03:51.690> you

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
lots of tendrils coming towards you

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.300 
lots of tendrils coming towards you
which<00:03:51.960> is<00:03:52.140> a<00:03:52.170> bit<00:03:52.350> harder<00:03:52.710> to<00:03:52.740> deal<00:03:52.980> with<00:03:53.130> in<00:03:53.250> a

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
which is a bit harder to deal with in a

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.810 
which is a bit harder to deal with in a
way<00:03:53.600> packed<00:03:54.600> lunch<00:03:54.960> or<00:03:55.260> school<00:03:55.680> dinner<00:03:56.300> hmm<00:03:57.710> I

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.480 
in my case the problem is the ghosts
without<00:05:41.980> that<00:05:42.190> there<00:05:42.400> wouldn't<00:05:42.580> be<00:05:42.640> a<00:05:42.700> series

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
without that there wouldn't be a series

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.540 
without that there wouldn't be a series
reading<00:05:45.490> or<00:05:45.610> writing<00:05:47.310> that's<00:05:48.310> a<00:05:48.370> really

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
reading or writing that's a really

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.240 
reading or writing that's a really
tricky<00:05:48.700> one<00:05:49.260> I've<00:05:50.260> now<00:05:50.470> realised<00:05:50.950> that

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
tricky one I've now realised that

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.520 
tricky one I've now realised that
writing<00:05:52.060> is<00:05:52.240> actually<00:05:52.390> like<00:05:52.780> an<00:05:52.870> extension<00:05:53.290> of

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
writing is actually like an extension of

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.710 
writing is actually like an extension of
reading<00:05:53.890> you<00:05:54.100> don't<00:05:54.880> write<00:05:55.150> unless<00:05:55.420> you've

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
reading you don't write unless you've

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.690 
reading you don't write unless you've
already<00:05:55.810> been<00:05:56.110> reading<00:05:56.470> so<00:05:56.950> reading<00:05:57.190> has<00:05:57.550> to

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
already been reading so reading has to

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.280 
already been reading so reading has to
come<00:05:57.850> first<00:05:58.120> I<00:05:58.300> guess<00:05:58.510> that's<00:05:58.840> probably<00:05:59.200> the

00:05:59.280 --> 00:05:59.290 
come first I guess that's probably the

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.620 
come first I guess that's probably the
most<00:05:59.410> important<00:05:59.890> one<00:05:59.920> but<00:06:00.880> for<00:06:01.060> me<00:06:01.210> for<00:06:01.510> a<00:06:01.570> lot

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630 
most important one but for me for a lot

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.690 
most important one but for me for a lot
of<00:06:01.750> people<00:06:02.020> when<00:06:02.680> you<00:06:02.710> read<00:06:03.040> you<00:06:03.280> then<00:06:03.430> want<00:06:03.580> to

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:03.700 
of people when you read you then want to

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.330 
of people when you read you then want to
go<00:06:03.850> and<00:06:04.000> write<00:06:04.150> your<00:06:04.300> own<00:06:04.420> story<00:06:04.690> so<00:06:05.160> the<00:06:06.160> two

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
go and write your own story so the two

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.240 
go and write your own story so the two
are<00:06:06.490> really<00:06:06.670> closely<00:06:07.030> connected<00:06:08.250> either

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
are really closely connected either

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:14.730 
are really closely connected either
light<00:06:09.880> or<00:06:10.120> death<00:06:10.750> glow<00:06:12.240> I<00:06:13.530> suppose<00:06:14.530> other

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
light or death glow I suppose other

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.250 
light or death glow I suppose other
light<00:06:15.010> can<00:06:15.280> be<00:06:15.370> quite<00:06:15.550> beautiful<00:06:15.760> but<00:06:16.260> it's

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:17.260 
light can be quite beautiful but it's

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.950 
light can be quite beautiful but it's
kind<00:06:17.440> of<00:06:17.470> eerie<00:06:17.740> a<00:06:18.010> death<00:06:18.430> glow<00:06:18.700> is<00:06:18.940> maybe<00:06:19.870> a

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
kind of eerie a death glow is maybe a

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.450 
kind of eerie a death glow is maybe a
death<00:06:20.140> glow<00:06:20.380> I<00:06:20.650> think<00:06:20.800> a<00:06:20.830> deaf<00:06:20.980> clothes<00:06:21.250> is

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
death glow I think a deaf clothes is

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.250 
death glow I think a deaf clothes is
it's<00:06:21.790> not<00:06:22.000> actually<00:06:22.150> connected<00:06:22.660> to<00:06:22.690> a<00:06:22.780> ghost

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
it's not actually connected to a ghost

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.680 
it's not actually connected to a ghost
so<00:06:23.610> specifically<00:06:24.610> so<00:06:24.850> death<00:06:25.270> glow<00:06:25.420> is<00:06:25.510> not

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
so specifically so death glow is not

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:26.370 
so specifically so death glow is not
going<00:06:25.840> to<00:06:25.900> hurt<00:06:26.020> you

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.380 
going to hurt you

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.140 
going to hurt you
whereas<00:06:26.650> other<00:06:26.890> light<00:06:27.130> is<00:06:27.340> always<00:06:27.850> connected

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
whereas other light is always connected

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:34.110 
whereas other light is always connected
to<00:06:28.510> some<00:06:28.780> kind<00:06:29.050> of<00:06:29.140> nasty<00:06:29.800> spirit<00:06:31.950> hmm<00:06:33.090> would<00:06:34.090> I

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
to some kind of nasty spirit hmm would I

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.000 
to some kind of nasty spirit hmm would I
like<00:06:34.330> to<00:06:34.450> write<00:06:34.660> in<00:06:34.870> my<00:06:34.960> pajamas<00:06:35.500> or<00:06:36.370> in<00:06:36.730> a<00:06:36.820> suit

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.010 
like to write in my pajamas or in a suit

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 
to probably be a little bit drafty I

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.170 
to probably be a little bit drafty I
think<00:06:43.900> pyjamas<00:06:44.440> be<00:06:44.560> more<00:06:44.710> comfortable<00:06:45.130> but<00:06:46.120> I

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
think pyjamas be more comfortable but I

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.460 
think pyjamas be more comfortable but I
