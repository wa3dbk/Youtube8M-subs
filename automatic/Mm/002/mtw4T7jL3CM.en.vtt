right here because

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.209 
right here because
I<00:02:32.840> decided<00:02:33.840> that<00:02:33.989> I<00:02:34.349> was<00:02:34.530> going<00:02:34.769> to<00:02:34.920> do<00:02:35.040> my<00:02:35.159> very

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:35.219 
I decided that I was going to do my very

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.530 
I decided that I was going to do my very
first<00:02:35.700> modding<00:02:36.180> which<00:02:36.480> was<00:02:36.870> ear<00:02:37.620> piercing

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
first modding which was ear piercing

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.319 
first modding which was ear piercing
which<00:02:39.540> was<00:02:40.049> very<00:02:40.680> scary<00:02:41.129> to<00:02:41.370> me<00:02:41.400> because<00:02:41.549> I<00:02:41.939> had

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
which was very scary to me because I had

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.440 
which was very scary to me because I had
never<00:02:42.750> ever<00:02:43.230> drilled<00:02:44.159> the<00:02:44.400> resin<00:02:44.760> before<00:02:45.150> and

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
never ever drilled the resin before and

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.849 
never ever drilled the resin before and
so<00:02:46.230> I<00:02:46.560> was<00:02:47.340> freaking<00:02:47.909> out<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.239> whole<00:02:48.420> time

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:48.859 
so I was freaking out the whole time

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.559 
so I was freaking out the whole time
wondering<00:02:49.859> if<00:02:49.950> I<00:02:50.040> was<00:02:50.159> doing<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.459> right<00:02:50.760> I<00:02:51.209> mean

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
wondering if I was doing it right I mean

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.899 
wondering if I was doing it right I mean
I'd<00:02:51.720> read<00:02:51.930> some<00:02:52.140> things<00:02:52.470> here<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.129> there<00:02:53.250> and

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
I'd read some things here and there and

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:57.920 
I'd read some things here and there and
it<00:02:54.750> was<00:02:55.200> just<00:02:55.379> a<00:02:55.700> terrifying<00:02:56.700> experience<00:02:56.970> for

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
it was just a terrifying experience for

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.710 
it was just a terrifying experience for
me<00:02:58.049> to<00:02:58.260> do<00:02:58.620> that<00:02:58.829> so<00:02:59.639> anyway<00:02:59.909> so<00:03:00.000> I'm<00:03:00.299> drilling

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
me to do that so anyway so I'm drilling

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.690 
me to do that so anyway so I'm drilling
away<00:03:00.930> at<00:03:01.170> his<00:03:01.290> ear<00:03:01.590> with<00:03:01.859> the<00:03:01.980> little<00:03:02.250> doll

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
away at his ear with the little doll

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.640 
away at his ear with the little doll
more<00:03:02.969> drill<00:03:03.269> that<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.510> have<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.230> I'm<00:03:04.290> going

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
more drill that I have and I'm going

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.160 
more drill that I have and I'm going
going<00:03:04.980> going<00:03:05.129> and<00:03:05.400> then<00:03:05.879> I<00:03:06.150> noticed<00:03:06.420> that<00:03:06.959> the

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
going going and then I noticed that the

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.160 
going going and then I noticed that the
drill<00:03:07.409> stops<00:03:07.799> like<00:03:08.489> I<00:03:08.909> can't<00:03:09.629> twist<00:03:09.930> it

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
drill stops like I can't twist it

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.009 
drill stops like I can't twist it
anymore<00:03:10.680> and<00:03:10.980> I<00:03:11.609> could<00:03:11.909> have<00:03:12.060> sworn<00:03:12.389> at<00:03:12.659> that

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
anymore and I could have sworn at that

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.949 
anymore and I could have sworn at that
moment<00:03:13.319> that<00:03:13.620> I<00:03:13.799> broke<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.760> drill<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.419> I<00:03:15.659> was

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
moment that I broke the drill and I was

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.860 
moment that I broke the drill and I was
like<00:03:16.609> sweating<00:03:17.609> bullets<00:03:17.970> because<00:03:18.359> I<00:03:18.569> could

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
like sweating bullets because I could

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.069 
like sweating bullets because I could
not<00:03:19.079> believe<00:03:19.290> that<00:03:19.609> here<00:03:20.609> I<00:03:20.639> was<00:03:20.909> I<00:03:21.299> had<00:03:21.810> my

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
not believe that here I was I had my

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.039 
not believe that here I was I had my
very<00:03:22.739> expensive<00:03:23.459> to<00:03:24.090> me<00:03:24.269> because<00:03:24.510> it<00:03:24.780> takes<00:03:24.930> a

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
very expensive to me because it takes a

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.559 
very expensive to me because it takes a
while<00:03:25.139> for<00:03:25.200> me<00:03:25.439> to<00:03:25.530> raise<00:03:25.620> money<00:03:25.829> like<00:03:26.579> 230

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
while for me to raise money like 230

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
dollar whatever doll and I just broke a

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.780 
dollar whatever doll and I just broke a
drill<00:03:31.109> in<00:03:31.349> his<00:03:31.500> ear<00:03:31.739> and<00:03:31.769> I<00:03:31.950> was<00:03:32.069> like<00:03:32.189> oh<00:03:32.370> my

drill in his ear and I was like oh my
gosh<00:03:33.000> what<00:03:33.209> do<00:03:33.329> i<00:03:33.419> do<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:33.840> know<00:03:33.959> it's<00:03:34.109> stuck

gosh what do i do you know it's stuck

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.110 
gosh what do i do you know it's stuck
and<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:34.620> haven't<00:03:34.980> pulled<00:03:35.159> it<00:03:35.280> out<00:03:35.400> and<00:03:35.430> like

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
and I haven't pulled it out and like

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.580 
and I haven't pulled it out and like
it's<00:03:36.329> not<00:03:36.450> moving<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:37.079> uh<00:03:37.889> I<00:03:38.849> panicked<00:03:39.590> but

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
it's not moving and uh I panicked but

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.770 
it's not moving and uh I panicked but
then<00:03:40.769> I<00:03:40.799> realized<00:03:41.430> that<00:03:41.729> it<00:03:42.299> was<00:03:42.419> just<00:03:42.629> because

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
then I realized that it was just because

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.869 
then I realized that it was just because
I<00:03:43.260> just<00:03:43.889> needed<00:03:44.159> to<00:03:44.250> pull<00:03:44.489> it<00:03:44.579> out<00:03:44.639> and<00:03:44.699> then

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
I just needed to pull it out and then

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.399 
I just needed to pull it out and then
just<00:03:45.150> put<00:03:45.419> it<00:03:45.510> back<00:03:45.629> in<00:03:45.780> because<00:03:45.989> I<00:03:46.049> had<00:03:46.199> so

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:46.409 
just put it back in because I had so

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.309 
just put it back in because I had so
much<00:03:46.470> resin<00:03:46.979> clogged<00:03:47.310> up<00:03:47.519> into<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.329> drill

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
much resin clogged up into the drill

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.409 
much resin clogged up into the drill
that<00:03:49.709> therefore<00:03:49.949> wasn't<00:03:50.519> spinning<00:03:50.849> it<00:03:51.180> wasn't

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
that therefore wasn't spinning it wasn't

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:53.420 
that therefore wasn't spinning it wasn't
drilling<00:03:51.690> anymore<00:03:52.079> so<00:03:52.709> I<00:03:52.769> needed<00:03:53.040> to<00:03:53.159> take<00:03:53.280> it
