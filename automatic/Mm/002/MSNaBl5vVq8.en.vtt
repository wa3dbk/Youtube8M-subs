00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
on what are the developers thinking and

on what are the developers thinking and
when<00:00:20.910> are<00:00:21.000> we<00:00:21.060> likely<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.510> see<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.810> jailbreak<00:00:22.350> so

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
when are we likely to see a jailbreak so

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.980 
when are we likely to see a jailbreak so
first<00:00:23.070> off<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.670> jailbreak<00:00:24.090> summit<00:00:24.420> event<00:00:24.720> did

first off the jailbreak summit event did
happen<00:00:25.230> we<00:00:25.619> were<00:00:25.769> never<00:00:25.980> guarantee<00:00:26.670> to

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820

jailbreak<00:00:27.269> there<00:00:27.539> was<00:00:27.720> some<00:00:27.930> speculation<00:00:28.109> by

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
jailbreak there was some speculation by

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.250 
jailbreak there was some speculation by
comics<00:00:29.189> by<00:00:29.369> ionic<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.330> jailbreak<00:00:30.900> could

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
comics by ionic that a jailbreak could

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.430 
comics by ionic that a jailbreak could
happen<00:00:31.740> on<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:31.949> was<00:00:32.309> 8.2<00:00:33.090> after<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:33.899> event<00:00:34.079> on

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
happen on I was 8.2 after this event on

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.740 
happen on I was 8.2 after this event on
March<00:00:34.710> 27th<00:00:35.340> yet<00:00:35.610> we<00:00:35.850> haven't<00:00:36.030> seen<00:00:36.329> one<00:00:36.570> today

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
March 27th yet we haven't seen one today

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.200 
March 27th yet we haven't seen one today
so<00:00:37.410> it's<00:00:37.710> very<00:00:37.920> unlikely<00:00:38.250> will<00:00:38.670> be<00:00:38.790> released

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
so it's very unlikely will be released

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.970 
so it's very unlikely will be released
today<00:00:39.629> tomorrow<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.260> know<00:00:40.469> anytime<00:00:40.800> around

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
today tomorrow you know anytime around

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.520 
today tomorrow you know anytime around
now<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.360> leaves<00:00:42.540> two<00:00:42.719> options<00:00:43.379> one

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
now so that leaves two options one

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.010 
now so that leaves two options one
either<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.610> iOS<00:00:44.969> 8<00:00:45.149> points<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.480> jailbreak<00:00:45.840> is

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
either the iOS 8 points you jailbreak is

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.470 
either the iOS 8 points you jailbreak is
complete<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.910> jailbreak<00:00:47.910> team<00:00:48.149> known<00:00:48.450> as

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
complete and the jailbreak team known as

complete and the jailbreak team known as
taiji<00:00:49.020> chooses<00:00:49.829> not<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.370> release<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.879> at<00:00:51.000> the

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
taiji chooses not to release it at the

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.250 
taiji chooses not to release it at the
moment<00:00:51.360> now<00:00:51.719> there<00:00:51.870> could<00:00:51.960> be<00:00:52.020> several

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
moment now there could be several

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.439 
moment now there could be several
reasons<00:00:52.590> for<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:52.980> for<00:00:53.309> one<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.699> was<00:00:54.210> eight

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
reasons for this for one I was eight

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.150 
reasons for this for one I was eight
point<00:00:54.690> two<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> follow-up<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.739> eight<00:00:55.949> point

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
point two is a follow-up to eight point

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.250 
point two is a follow-up to eight point
one<00:00:56.280> point<00:00:56.460> three<00:00:56.789> there's<00:00:57.360> really<00:00:57.570> not<00:00:58.109> much

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
one point three there's really not much

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.900 
one point three there's really not much
that's<00:00:58.530> changed<00:00:59.010> other<00:00:59.219> than<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> Apple

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
that's changed other than the Apple

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.700 
that's changed other than the Apple
watch<00:01:00.059> support<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.079> them<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.440> doesn't

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
watch support and to them it doesn't

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.380 
watch support and to them it doesn't
make<00:01:01.890> sense<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.190> release<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:02.730> jailbreak<00:01:03.180> on

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
make sense to release this jailbreak on

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.910 
make sense to release this jailbreak on
this<00:01:03.480> version<00:01:04.019> when<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.229> was<00:01:04.530> eight<00:01:04.710> point

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
this version when I was eight point

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.250 
this version when I was eight point
three<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.400> right<00:01:05.640> around<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.939> corner<00:01:06.260> 8.3

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
three is right around the corner 8.3

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.320 
three is right around the corner 8.3
being<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.650> firmware<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.520> includes<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:09.119> ton

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
being the firmware that includes a ton

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.270 
being the firmware that includes a ton
of<00:01:09.360> new<00:01:09.510> features<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.930> lot<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.320> emojis<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.920> lot<00:01:11.159> of

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
of new features a lot of emojis a lot of

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.340 
of new features a lot of emojis a lot of
bug<00:01:11.520> fixes<00:01:11.720> definitely<00:01:12.720> better<00:01:12.810> fluid

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
bug fixes definitely better fluid

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.050 
bug fixes definitely better fluid
animations<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:13.979> did<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.189> full<00:01:14.430> review<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:14.760> that

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
animations I did a full review on that

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.730 
animations I did a full review on that
few<00:01:15.509> days<00:01:15.659> ago<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.170> if<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.350> guys<00:01:16.470> want<00:01:16.680> to

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
few days ago so if you guys want to

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.050 
few days ago so if you guys want to
check<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:17.009> out<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.430> can<00:01:17.549> see<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.729> right

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
check that out you can see that right

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.020 
check that out you can see that right
there<00:01:18.119> but<00:01:18.960> 8.3<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.860> much<00:01:20.340> more<00:01:20.549> likely<00:01:20.820> to

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
there but 8.3 is much more likely to

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.450 
there but 8.3 is much more likely to
receive<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.390> jailbreaker<00:01:21.869> than<00:01:22.049> 8.2<00:01:22.680> now<00:01:23.400> the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
receive a jailbreaker than 8.2 now the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.770 
receive a jailbreaker than 8.2 now the
other<00:01:23.610> reason<00:01:24.060> they<00:01:24.210> might<00:01:24.509> not<00:01:24.659> have

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
other reason they might not have

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.410 
other reason they might not have
released<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.590> they<00:01:25.979> don't<00:01:26.220> have<00:01:26.580> one<00:01:26.880> Apple

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
released it is they don't have one Apple

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.840 
released it is they don't have one Apple
did<00:01:27.630> patch<00:01:27.900> one<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.470> major<00:01:28.770> exports<00:01:29.549> used

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
did patch one of the major exports used

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.480 
did patch one of the major exports used
in<00:01:30.030> iOS<00:01:30.390> 8.1<00:01:30.990> point<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.619> jailbreak<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.340> there

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
in iOS 8.1 point to jailbreak so there

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.160 
in iOS 8.1 point to jailbreak so there
could<00:01:32.670> be<00:01:32.700> complications<00:01:32.970> with<00:01:33.659> making<00:01:34.049> an

could be complications with making an

there's no jailbreak today and it's

there's no jailbreak today and it's
unknown<00:02:50.220> there<00:02:50.580> is<00:02:50.700> literally<00:02:51.060> no<00:02:51.390> word<00:02:51.600> from

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
at I GGO break team they haven't set a

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.700 
at I GGO break team they haven't set a
thing<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:54.120> it's<00:02:54.510> all<00:02:54.690> speculation<00:02:55.050> at<00:02:55.680> this

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
thing so it's all speculation at this

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.950 
thing so it's all speculation at this
point<00:02:56.010> but<00:02:56.550> hopefully<00:02:57.360> we<00:02:57.510> could<00:02:57.750> see<00:02:57.930> a

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
point but hopefully we could see a

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.170 
point but hopefully we could see a
jailbreak<00:02:58.410> with<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.740> release<00:02:58.980> of<00:02:59.160> iOS<00:02:59.430> 8.3

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
jailbreak with the release of iOS 8.3

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.700 
jailbreak with the release of iOS 8.3
but<00:03:00.690> then<00:03:00.810> again<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:01.110> really<00:03:01.230> doesn't<00:03:01.620> make

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
but then again it really doesn't make

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.380 
but then again it really doesn't make

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
for 8.2 because there will always be

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.550
