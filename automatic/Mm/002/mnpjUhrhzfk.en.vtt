Malignaggi<00:01:06.369> tonight<00:01:06.720> well<00:01:07.720> I<00:01:07.750> think<00:01:07.930> he

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
Malignaggi tonight well I think he

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.380 
Malignaggi tonight well I think he
believes<00:01:08.680> it<00:01:08.890> helped<00:01:09.190> him<00:01:09.340> a<00:01:09.550> in<00:01:09.940> the<00:01:10.090> sense

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
believes it helped him a in the sense

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.810 
believes it helped him a in the sense
that<00:01:10.540> he<00:01:11.500> showed<00:01:11.770> he<00:01:11.920> could<00:01:12.100> hang<00:01:12.310> in<00:01:12.520> there

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
that he showed he could hang in there

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.540 
that he showed he could hang in there
with<00:01:13.480> a<00:01:13.510> really<00:01:13.930> serious<00:01:14.260> top<00:01:14.830> great<00:01:15.160> fighter

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
with a really serious top great fighter

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.440 
with a really serious top great fighter
and<00:01:15.820> that<00:01:16.810> he<00:01:17.050> could<00:01:17.260> maintain<00:01:17.680> his<00:01:18.670> poise<00:01:19.030> in

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
and that he could maintain his poise in

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.440 
and that he could maintain his poise in
the<00:01:19.510> big<00:01:20.140> event<00:01:20.470> and<00:01:20.830> I<00:01:21.460> think<00:01:21.730> perhaps<00:01:22.000> it<00:01:22.330> was

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
the big event and I think perhaps it was

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.340 
the big event and I think perhaps it was
reflected<00:01:23.110> tonight<00:01:23.470> in<00:01:23.740> the<00:01:24.400> poise<00:01:24.670> he<00:01:25.000> showed

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
reflected tonight in the poise he showed

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.410 
reflected tonight in the poise he showed
with<00:01:26.350> a<00:01:26.650> fighter<00:01:27.130> who<00:01:27.250> was<00:01:27.610> trying<00:01:27.910> to<00:01:28.030> get<00:01:28.210> to

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
call a hot title now it's a kind of a

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.990
