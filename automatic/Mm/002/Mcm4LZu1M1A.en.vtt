00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.310
 how are you before, welcome to another 

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.069
 chapter my channel my name is minister 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.630
 in I do this kind of video 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:10.520
 informative we could call it for 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.440
 tell them a little about what the 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.150
 channel changes and to have a 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.790
 more human contact is also always 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.390
 good to talk face to face not these 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:22.220
 changes that I'm doing is something 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.140
 what I wanted to do a long time ago 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.660
 but since I never had the internet to 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.449
 do it or the desire I guess or the order 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.900
 or the idea of ​​how well you two do not 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.940
 never carry it out but the wave is 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.680
 well this channel where you are watching 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.420
 this video will only be for 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.600
 league of legends this is the most 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.120
 big is going to be a channel is going to be a 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.309
 main channel if I already have a channel 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.130
 secondary that they will be able to see it 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.500
 here 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.290
 if they click they will go to the channel 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.860
 secondary where for now the idea 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:58.170
 main is to only make strings 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.880
 random of what comes out for example came 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.360
 of work I just finished a 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:06.450
 stream the run I stayed at the stage of the 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.740
 I work a friend called me I said list 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.750
 of you want to do duet duo ranker stream 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.910
 you are bored you can pass not 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.190
 they have nothing to do the mister is 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.310
 writing a startup is not going to be a 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.140
 hyper stream serious for obviously not 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.119
 I am a serious person neither those that already 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.420
 they know me but that's the main idea 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.009
 that the things that come out at the moment 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.960
 put all the possible wave to take a 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.000
 stream and do with a secondary channel 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.090
 not for pissing the main channel 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.580
 that in the main channel are series is 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.430
 another day on the long road to chichi 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.520
 Recorded 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.800
 good game that is worth seeing in 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.020
 change in a stream the game depends 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.700
 as much as it leaves a game that the 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.890
 win at 20 minutes because someone else has 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.760
 an efe here can be a game in which 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:59.990
 rally be so king be that I disgust you this 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.300
 why that is very linked to the 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.860
 very situational situation I do not know how 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.170
 say the fucking mother 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.910
 instead the robots you yes already know 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.310
 which are games that are worth seeing 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.380
 that on the one hand they are expected with 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.940
 subscribers and so on is the channel 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:19.310
 main the real mrl in 751 is the channel 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.920
 main is the series channel of 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.020
 hyper edited videos boom is the channel 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.510
 main thing is not that I will stop rising 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.940
 this things to the main channel to do 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.739
 material for the secondary 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.600
 completely the opposite when I can 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.940
 do more 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.490
 or is it enough for the main one 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.130
 explains is going to go to the secondary so it's not 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.930
 to look at the main that one side 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.640
 so I explained to you that the 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.260
 secondary is going to be from strings to 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.220
 closing this or a great gift of 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.840
 absolutely everything can be what it is now 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.950
 same 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.990
 I have the streams so random the run that 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.890
 this 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:03.220
 the age of empires alive portal 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:07.480
 what truly emerges borderlands 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:10.209
 warcraft against anything that I 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.530
 is playing at that moment and say this 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.000
 way guys here so they like 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.660
 watch 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.420
 secondary channel so that's the 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:23.739
 biggest change in the first place 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.630
 in second place this time I was 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.300
 uploading very few videos I think it makes 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.340
 a week that I do not upload a video I ask 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.840
 thousand apologies as always to those who 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.290
 follow long ago are already accustomed 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.550
 to have no day or time to 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.660
 upload videos 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.850
 neither margin nor anything add an adjective 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.910
 there 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.190
 but 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.070
 I promise you that I will put 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.600
 very much the batteries we are going to make a 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.060
 incredible effort with all those who 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:58.710
 recorded of doing another day in the lol by 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:01.560
 day by day hopefully by week and not another 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.390
 day in the sun per week with the shell and 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.070
 maybe some more duo maybe just maybe 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.390
 what comes out in principle with al eat 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:13.020
 this because we are going up together 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.060
 make the best road to sisi that we record 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:19.110
 in the whole week things that I did road 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:23.370
 to see if it's the crème de la crème me 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:28.260
 I explain this and maybe two times and if 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:30.990
 week finally and one or two streams this one 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.910
 also per week 12 subscribers would be 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.650
 the idea to obviously always play 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.120
 with you this is my main 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:41.390
 livelihood of my fucking gray life 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.390
 transition to gray 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.570
 and others playing team against ortín against 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.990
 subscribers 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.970
 we put together the team bronze hates and we do 5 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.889
 versus 5 prosody or we put together the team of 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.229
 another day in the lol we just talk 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:01.510
 boludeces as we always do and for 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:05.260
 On the other hand, I think I ran out of 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.850
 changes and things to say I think that 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.419
 had said that he had many things to 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:12.430
 say but mistral in says many things 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.240
 so in the end these are the most changes 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.610
 big 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.979
 in general to give order to the 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.350
 main channel situation another day in the 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.600
 long road to chichi another day in the 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.460
 yankees are great I love them 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.020
 do it without seeing it every so often I join 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.650
 they would enter the confessions of mistral 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:32.289
 the chichi time is going to be the post because 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.749
 is selected 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:37.830
 you know and the strings already know that 

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:40.930
 we are the best streamer in my neighborhood 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:43.539
 so that and in the secondary channel 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.639
 everything for the people who have 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:46.960
 more time to spare you want to see 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:50.469
 some other game that is not league of 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.669
 legends and nothing attentive to facebook and 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:54.399
 twitter as always links in the 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:57.009
 description that there are my networks and it 

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:59.050
 find out when I do the streaming 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:00.309
 that without much more to tell you and if this 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.559

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:05.169

 sister who is almost the same 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.940
 If you are already on the subject of which surely 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:23.100
 What do I have and need in the first place? 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.930

 protective
