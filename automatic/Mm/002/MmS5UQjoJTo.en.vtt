00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.380
 So friends welcome to the next 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.519
 Information video hard that now 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.740
 really do that more often 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.360
 get information videos on the topic 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.430
 league of legends the problems tournament 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.869
 on the subject of some data is mine 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.580
 of course that will also be clear on the 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.840
 small page and not here then upload 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.910
 I will leave you here alone 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.199
 this theme is minecraft now 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.910
 look in the background and have now 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.220
 times a few topics for minecraft 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.579
 prepared because I get a lot 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.290
 ask what the minecraft publics or the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.450
 catching wireless server concerns us 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.719
 Let's say the most common question was how 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.850
 I come to your whitelist server because 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.230
 I was then papic myself 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.910
 and did not want that many anymore 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.590
 let in because we have a lot of letters 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.090
 had a lot of hackers and had 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.280
 other therefore the trunk of the 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.079
 man further server out and lexmark the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.690
 a few people you trust 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.640
 so now you know that 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.079
 At the moment I really have it at the time 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.750
 image uploaded on facebook 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.760
 whitelist member registration that's it 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.899
 writes a comment under penalty 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.299
 I will not do it this time 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.729
 will run everything on the forum 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.799
 about the some open forum resp 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.909
 on the clear page it has nothing to do with it 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.650
 i also do news again 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.729
 I have to get the clan join around 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.990
 the whitelist to come no, of course 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.310
 not that's a shooter 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.290
 at the same time in action 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.540
 you have to look at it on the homepage 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.189
 Registered is free of course 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.720
 and then there's a minecraft picture 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.850
 I will let a dazzle here 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.049
 click on it or just in the forum ever 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.520
 after how he wanted to get on it and 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.350
 then you have a minecraft department 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.040
 Of course you have to register one and 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.780
 be logged in 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.579
 and in the minecraft department 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.079
 then somewhere whitelist registration there 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.250
 you look it may look 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.500
 what the others wrote and 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.090
 then you do that after her you write 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.590
 are if you already have home there because 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.180
 we have made a new white read 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.070
 because of inactivity we had, I think 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.020
 200 users on the whitelist and ten 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.490
 That 's why they played a new one 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.810
 that means you have to go back then 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.250
 Write on it you were already on the 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.710
 old or you are not on the old one 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.090
 you are new and then you wait 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.189
 a few times that means few minutes 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.820
 few days and then right on the 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.650
 whitelist 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.120
 is the same as before 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.710
 nothing protests that means you can 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.479
 but letters will be put out 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.610
 but are directly banned so 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.340
 just ignore it the next one 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.660
 point means old app 152 we dare 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.370
 but the whole time but think about it 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.260
 we raushauen a new map 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.690
 following reason the 162 has yes 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.280
 horses added and we have none 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.590
 horses found on the map we have 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.480
 let all horse drill are 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.830
 then someday disappeared and it has 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.720
 just does not work for the reason 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.330
 We wanted new 1.6 point two 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.220
 match balls and you see it so that we 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.540
 down there again the category 1 point 6 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.709
 point 2 1 have beaten 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.790
 or I have added 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.340
 think about it will say nothing because 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.080
 I want that now 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.700
 we left the old one with where still 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.140
 your village has what it is here in the 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.270
 background sees where this pitbull 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.739
 the village is still standing and we have 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.910
 another 1.6.2010 or hold the 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.650
 old ones do not bother anymore on the old one 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.330
 map have a new start I also start there 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.890
 personally new as soon as the shader 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.420
 Updated because it's more fun for me 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.950
 was with the tailor to gamble 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.260
 I'm back to playing actively 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.000
 there is a command you can also in 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.480
 Read the description how you like it 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.410
 it works 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.940
 with / world map or nume app you can 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.310
 switch between the maps 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.840
 the net is not working yet 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.850
 we still have to make new maps 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.620
 so much for the topic two new maps old 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.970
 and new ones are definitely still both 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.299
 so do not be scared anyways 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.860
 euerdorf has disappeared or something else 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.329
 dynamic map I look here says two 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.320
 insert pictures 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.760
 I also have a link in the 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.280
 description packed under the category 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.390
 dynamic map is on the small page 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.079
 somewhere on the left I believe in that 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.840
 purchase sign 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:37.239
 it's just a live map of one 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.010
 live webpage from our web the 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.930
 means you see everything you ask 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.239
 has on the side that is if 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.500
 staff ran very far away 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.730
 but a house built there that you can 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.900
 then see on the website 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.940
 just a small point that you can 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.820
 may be able to see where his 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.040
 friends yes where your friends your house 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.780
 have built because we have no 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.430
 teleport we do not have any flies up 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.250
 the service really one 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.659
 like picture server without admin rights itself 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.829
 Andy and I have the admin 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:04.739
 Rights thus taken little on the 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:07.209
 Idea come to go the game mode 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.769
 that means there are no admin servers there 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.180
 There are no idiots here mine 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.469
 give me first game and breathe 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.760
 probably one or the other 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:14.079
 hacker will exist but that would be us 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.690
 Stop it again sometime 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.739
 come and you can definitely 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.789
 you then click on the link then you 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.889
 you see every time what the people 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:23.830
 claims to have built both of them could Maps 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:25.720
 see the new and the old so new maps 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.860
 We'll just be instant 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.360
 We already have skip over that 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.759
 we go directly to letters and 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.080
 hacker to the last point as well 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:33.970
 just mentioned we have 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.110
 no breath on the server means you 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.180
 does not need to ask every time 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.060
 breathe online who is online where is 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.699
 An admin will pick you open , please 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.650
 you go then as usual in the forum there 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.870
 where you put you on the whitelist 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.090
 have there is then even like this 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.740
 whitelist login area is then too 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.300
 Interference hacker area clicks her 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.860
 just write it and write there already 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.130
 you can just look at two entries 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.479
 my house in the world eu dzb we have 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.039
 the new world is called the old one 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.930
 men means old map believes that means 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:03.520
 world just write down 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.250
 which world it happens is old or 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.139
 new you can also write course 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.960
 the coordinates are very important 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:13.289
 where the house is what was checked and where 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.220
 Then write something else became 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:16.840
 that was it and then you go 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.669
 or I 'll do it then 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.229
 to breathe again over the console and 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:21.400
 then look the city and train the 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:22.449
 types and then do it again 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.639
 Undo and the thing is then 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:25.599
 Eaten so that were all the topics 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:26.560
 if you have to ask, she writes 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:28.000
 in the comments 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.050
 I watch the video yet only if you 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.330
 ask again for any questions 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.440
 have you already answered and then 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.759
 see what I would say on the 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.759
 servers make it good
