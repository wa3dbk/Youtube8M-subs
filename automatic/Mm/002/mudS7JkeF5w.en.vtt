 I'm bringing you one today. 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.890
 trying to get a doubt that many 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.740
 players have the time to be using the 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:30.539
 joystick on the control to play the game 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:34.800
 of pc and some games is the favor 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.450
 of control it is very big rush 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.370
 I really like the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.260
 yen staff each 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.329
 but I know most like to take a 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.610
 control in a racing game by 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.210
 example is better to control my 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.820
 opinion than help on the keyboard mouse and 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.590
 fps first person shooter on the mouse 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.289
 keyboard is a big difference has a 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.539
 big advantage on new mouse keyboard 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.359
 I 'll show you here two ways 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.589
 From ItaipulÃ¢ndia I use ooo 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:09.479
 usb adapter for ps2 control and 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:12.720
 We'll put that in this control 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.070
 the same way as the 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.170
 Xbox 360 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.470
 So you can play the game, who? 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.720
 knows the content enough to give 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.360
 walk quietly also known I 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.799
 I really like it and I'll show you 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:35.659
 first form a running program 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:43.140
 and I have here the program he is the 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:45.930
 ex emo controller 360 and inputs the squid 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.610
 control 300 for tics of 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:53.250
 computer in my case told of ps2 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.170
 he is very simple to install the 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.460
 I'll be there for you to see what it's like 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.229
 how can 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.890
 two clicks will ask 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.890
 run 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.260
 it will appear in the last part of 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.220
 installation in the case here is the last 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:12.550
 My computer's installation is on the 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:16.239
 game change that is a motocross game 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:19.470
 you will put look to locate where 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.470
 Did you say your game? 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.920
 I was in the video folder head is 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.090
 there on my computer now to make a 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.959
 test 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.510
 resident evil operation raccoon city 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.790
 the guys will always be there where 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.470
 is the executable all the game talent 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.810
 have to know where it is 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.909
 if two old already noticed a 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.280
 executable of the game the x is that the people 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:48.159
 call him he's in the main square 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.150

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.420
 soon this method is that way 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.500
 works here it's like I use the 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.360
 control now 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.060
 You will not be able to enter the game already. 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.610
 used normal you will not have to do 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.530
 a process 11 a step by step before 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.650
 I'll show you now how it is that 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:21.550

 control connected it will already be 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:44.890
 self-knowledge is already there, you leave 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.500
 this open file can close everything 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.390
 now and you will start the new beginning 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.970

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.120
 and if this little problem is open you can 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.460
 minimize you will enter the game and your 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.490
 control will normally respond as 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.830
 if an xbox 360 control 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.350
 guys this is an executable is a 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.270
 program that I downloaded is five days and 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.220
 that the 2.5 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.020
 I just found the net now I do not 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.020
 I put link no rating because it has 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:17.020
 a lot of antivirus you will make one 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.570
 download and I have got caught as if 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.260
 whether evil is a trojan or horse of 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.720
 troy 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.460
 so I will not cite any links to 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.530
 you download and not there it's up to you 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.930
 You guys I found it easy. 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:32.229
 The other way that I told you is 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.810
 putting it is you download it already installed 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:38.890
 I have the folder that already installed 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.850
 you will copy all these items 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.169
 on here 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.379
 the choice of our dreams 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:49.039
 principles will copy everything 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:52.250
 copy can close and you will roll in 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:54.889
 folder of the game as with exactly one with 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:58.310
 others did the installation where the 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:59.780
 executed do not smoke and put there galera 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.750
 That's it 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:05.000
 I hope this has helped you and okay 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.710

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.680
