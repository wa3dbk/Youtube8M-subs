00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
very common teenage experiences so he's

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.430 
very common teenage experiences so he's
someone<00:03:08.099> to<00:03:08.940> admire<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:09.569> to<00:03:09.660> look<00:03:09.840> up<00:03:09.989> to<00:03:10.230> and

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
someone to admire and to look up to and

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.870 
someone to admire and to look up to and
it's<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.799> ultimate<00:03:11.040> symbol<00:03:11.489> of<00:03:11.670> wish

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
it's the ultimate symbol of wish

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.270 
it's the ultimate symbol of wish
fulfillment<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.690> getting<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.349> you<00:03:14.130> know

defend<00:03:15.239> yourself<00:03:15.750> even<00:03:16.530> when<00:03:16.709> you<00:03:16.799> feel<00:03:17.040> that

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
defend yourself even when you feel that

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.789 
defend yourself even when you feel that
you<00:03:17.310> can't<00:03:17.609> so<00:03:18.120> I<00:03:19.049> think<00:03:19.470> that's<00:03:19.650> what's

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
you can't so I think that's what's

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.199 
you can't so I think that's what's
always<00:03:19.920> separated<00:03:20.400> spider-man<00:03:20.910> from<00:03:21.060> other

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
always separated spider-man from other

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.870 
always separated spider-man from other
superheroes<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:22.070> hopefully<00:03:23.070> will<00:03:23.609> continue

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
superheroes and hopefully will continue

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.739 
superheroes and hopefully will continue
to<00:03:24.299> do<00:03:24.480> that<00:03:24.510> for<00:03:24.959> many<00:03:25.290> years<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.709> come
