00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.799
 Yes 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.120
 and of course world these stormy leaks 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.010
 and so I find you today 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.490
 for a new tutorial to find out 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:22.000
 how to update the sims 4 in 1 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.830
 point 0 point 797 points 20 otherwise 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.560
 says the update including the 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.380
 ghosts big additions that was promised 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.960
 by electronic art and of course maxi ce 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.149
 which of course has been done just as 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.040
 the pools where you can of course 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.829
 find the link in the registration 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.109
 so before you start the tutorial 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.929
 you know as usual that you 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:45.309
 have a link in the description gifts 

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:47.559
 for those who do not know it according to 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.269
 you know it's a flight link 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.309
 so you wait five seconds you 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.899
 click in the box young at the top where 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.949
 there will be marked the message after well 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:56.980
 sure the past five seconds 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:59.739
 announce it then interested you on 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.070
 this page then for those who do not 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.830
 do not know it's an update like 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.550
 I said at the beginning so you need the 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.950
 basic game 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.810
 I invite you to go see our 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.729
 tutorial to get the sims cats 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:18.190
 free basic without origin so 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.300
 you will not have any problem on it 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.910
 you must know that it is an update 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.920
 can cause some problems in 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.680
 I have seen this in several 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.540
 comments the cs update there so 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.760
 I invite you if you are dealing 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:35.200
 also the update for the pool 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.790
 finally for the pools so after if 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.680
 had no problem you want 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.940
 no pools no problem you 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.080
 are not obligated and for those who 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.830
 want the pools you are forced to 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.000
 do this update there then as 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.070
 usually we have the editor and the 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.720
 developer the release date so this 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.940
 this time it's from the maj so it's up to 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.100
 say it's out on October 21st, 2014 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.500
 you can test your configuration 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.440
 but hey that will not serve so much 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.150
 if you ever had sims 4 you know 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.560
 if you turn it or not you 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.420
 have subtitle languages 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.290
 download links software 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.000
 required whether or not there are the walls the 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.540
 multiplayer where the features in 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.310
 line 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.350
 so that's not saying you do not have 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.970
 not the gallery but you can of course 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.890
 always install third-party content 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.940
 in other words, for example, the mode 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.170
 sims and sims 4l the sims resources 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.610
 etc. 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.220
 you then have the installation that 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.650
 will of course be partially modified as each 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.900
 team doing so then we're going 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.320
 jump directly to the tutorial 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.709
 himself 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.930
 you have kick ass and d411 in connection with 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.239
 download and before downloading 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.890
 you need the software so if you 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.380
 do not have micro torrent or software 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.840
 torrent ie peter hahn suz or 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.030
 others you will need to download a 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.100
 so for that we offer you micro 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.720
 torrent 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.240
 once on the page you make gates 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.010
 micro torrent for windows once 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.160
 this is done and you download yourself 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.840
 install 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.100
 here 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.990
 so for kick ass 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.640
 seen you have to know that these two links on 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.700
 monetize otherwise you'll have to 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.350
 fly then once you clicked on 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.520
 kick ass you have no fly good you 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.920
 not without distinction does not make these 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.410
 announcements here you land then 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.780
 on this page then on kick ass 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.160
 then what is practical is that 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.260
 update is not very very heavy 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.190
 and that there are forty-six people who 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.980
 share for 5 who ask so 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.910
 this is going to go pretty fast 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.920
 you do not need to count 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.870
 need of ratio is totally free 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.850
 you just have to do in the aude 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.850
 torrent up recorded 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.710
 or so it would load directly 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:46.940
 worn 411 well you have to log in 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:48.610
 before the ratio of 0 75 minimum 0.115 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.770
 those who misunderstood 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.860
 you then go down and get late 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.660
 I had you 46 who share for 2 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.420
 who asks to know that the updates 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.480
 day you better not fight 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.520
 surgery on these four years since 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.860
 some 24 its ratio just for a 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.020
 update so for these four years 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.270
 you do download up registered 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.190
 or so it was unmanageable of course 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.780
 directly 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.940
 then once that's done we get 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.800
 found in the location where you have 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.290
 desired been loaded and place your 

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.570
 torrent 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.190
 we double- click on a 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.920
 just right and alto rensou true us 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.940
 asks whether or not we wish to 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.090
 added this rate is for download 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:35.000
 we will of course do yes 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.710
 then once that is done and 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.630
 that your download is complete 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.970
 you will have noticed in source statue 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.120
 and so make a crime right open the 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:49.570
 reception folder continue 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.000
 obama without closing earlier and here we are 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.590
 let's go in a double date 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.969
 click on setup 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.220
