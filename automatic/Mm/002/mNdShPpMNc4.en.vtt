 thank you pauli so goodbye goodbye 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:19.060
 that's a lot of cars they are 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:29.400
 well on the street it's me 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:29.400
 seventeen times that sounded the attention 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.780
 Oh 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.780

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.300
 you have nothing okay 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:55.140
 kevin doug you know well that it does not take 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.900
 never run in the middle of the street we do not 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.400
 remake more we are sorry do you know that 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.560
 when you run between cars 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.150
 you have exactly 18 times more 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.830
 chances of provoking or having a 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.069
 accident 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.120
 eighteen times yes when a child popped up 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.010
 between two parked cars 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.780
 it's almost impossible for a 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.500
 driver to see him in time and that's 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.450
 the insured accident if you have to 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.760
 go on the road that you are in 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.070
 parking where next to car you 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.810
 must first look well then move forward 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.580
 by walking slowly and doing well 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.350
 Warning 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.000
 even if there is a pedestrian crossing you do not 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.390
 must not run in front of a bus 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.980
 or between cars 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.870
 and since we never know when a 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.310
 car will start the safest it is from 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.240
 do not play next even if it is 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.470
 parked 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.470
 we will remember it polite 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.139
 we ended up finding one 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.259
 and now we can go back more 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:58.199

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:58.199
