natural organic material really one of
the<00:00:50.059> key<00:00:50.360> things<00:00:50.750> about<00:00:51.340> compost<00:00:52.340> and<00:00:52.820> in

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
the key things about compost and in

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.200 
the key things about compost and in
particularly<00:00:53.840> this<00:00:54.140> compost<00:00:54.790> it's<00:00:55.790> not<00:00:56.030> it's

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
particularly this compost it's not it's

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.240 
particularly this compost it's not it's
on<00:00:56.480> realistic<00:00:56.809> compost<00:00:57.440> which<00:00:57.649> means<00:00:57.950> that

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
on realistic compost which means that

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.580 
on realistic compost which means that
any<00:00:58.700> organic<00:00:59.120> farmer<00:00:59.600> can<00:00:59.780> use<00:00:59.930> it<00:01:00.050> you<00:01:00.140> use<00:01:00.230> in

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
any organic farmer can use it you use in

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.660 
any organic farmer can use it you use in
any<00:01:00.739> organic<00:01:01.700> farm<00:01:01.940> application<00:01:03.369> it's<00:01:04.369> really

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
any organic farm application it's really

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.020 
any organic farm application it's really
kind<00:01:04.940> of<00:01:05.000> a<00:01:05.119> procedure<00:01:05.600> and<00:01:05.930> a<00:01:05.990> quality

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
kind of a procedure and a quality

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.400 
kind of a procedure and a quality
designation<00:01:08.740> driven<00:01:09.740> by<00:01:09.920> how<00:01:11.410> aggressively

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
designation driven by how aggressively

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.710 
designation driven by how aggressively
you<00:01:12.560> manage<00:01:12.979> it<00:01:13.160> the<00:01:13.700> number<00:01:14.060> of<00:01:14.180> times<00:01:14.509> you

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
you manage it the number of times you

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.370 
you manage it the number of times you
turn<00:01:14.960> it<00:01:15.200> really<00:01:16.070> careful<00:01:17.200> documentation<00:01:18.200> of

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
turn it really careful documentation of

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.960 
turn it really careful documentation of
the<00:01:18.619> temperatures<00:01:19.310> and<00:01:19.580> the<00:01:19.640> amount<00:01:19.910> of

oxygen you might have 10 to 12 weeks at
one<00:01:23.660> stage<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:24.380> then<00:01:25.069> another<00:01:25.340> you<00:01:25.850> know<00:01:25.940> 10

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
one stage and then another you know 10

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.040 
one stage and then another you know 10
to<00:01:26.330> 12<00:01:26.600> weeks

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050

very stages of the manufacturing process

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.490 
very stages of the manufacturing process
the<00:01:31.100> first<00:01:32.100> end<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.370> the<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.850> process<00:01:33.300> is<00:01:33.540> high

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
the first end of the the process is high

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.200 
the first end of the the process is high
temperatures<00:01:35.010> break<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.580> down<00:01:35.760> break<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.090> down

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
temperatures break it down break it down

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.510 
temperatures break it down break it down
break<00:01:36.510> it<00:01:36.630> down<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.110> then<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.470> turn<00:01:37.800> it<00:01:37.830> in

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
break it down and then you turn it in

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.190 
break it down and then you turn it in
this<00:01:38.790> stage<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.360> lower<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.840> temperature

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
this stage to lower the temperature

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.940 
this stage to lower the temperature
because<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.440> want<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.620> keep<00:01:40.800> the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
because you want to keep the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.460 
because you want to keep the
temperatures<00:01:41.430> low<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.660> you're<00:01:43.140> growing

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
temperatures low so that you're growing

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.440 
temperatures low so that you're growing
the<00:01:43.710> amount<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.040> biology<00:01:44.550> that's<00:01:44.760> in<00:01:44.910> that's

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
the amount of biology that's in that's

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.660 
the amount of biology that's in that's
in<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.900> compost<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.680> then<00:01:47.010> up<00:01:47.160> here

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
in the compost and then up here

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.240 
in the compost and then up here
we're<00:01:48.120> kind<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.750> cultivating<00:01:49.290> biology<00:01:49.710> so

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
we're kind of cultivating biology so

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.240 
we're kind of cultivating biology so
what<00:01:50.370> you'll<00:01:50.490> see<00:01:50.550> is<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.690> know<00:01:51.810> different

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
what you'll see is you know different

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.910 
what you'll see is you know different
levels<00:01:53.250> or<00:01:53.430> different

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
levels or different

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.590 
levels or different
windrows<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.310> are<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.610> different<00:01:56.790> stages<00:01:57.240> of

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
windrows that are in different stages of

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.790 
windrows that are in different stages of
production<00:01:58.040> and<00:01:59.900> compost<00:02:01.640> finishes<00:02:03.770> with<00:02:04.770> the

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
production and compost finishes with the

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.470 
production and compost finishes with the
help<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.400> moisture<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.960> oxygen<00:02:07.650> and<00:02:08.220> time<00:02:08.670> so

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:09.480 
help of moisture and oxygen and time so

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.740 
help of moisture and oxygen and time so
compost<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.710> way<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:11.090> putting<00:02:12.090> back<00:02:12.360> into

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
compost is a way of putting back into

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.960 
compost is a way of putting back into
the<00:02:12.870> soil<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:13.470> that<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.130> plants<00:02:14.220> can<00:02:14.520> get<00:02:14.730> what

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
the soil so that the plants can get what

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.390 
the soil so that the plants can get what
they<00:02:15.000> need<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.480> get<00:02:15.630> where<00:02:15.810> they<00:02:15.900> need<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.110> get

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
they need to get where they need to get

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.670 
they need to get where they need to get
using<00:02:17.400> mother<00:02:17.880> nature<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:18.690> what<00:02:18.840> she's<00:02:19.080> given

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
using mother nature and what she's given

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.270 
using mother nature and what she's given
to<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:21.380> fixing<00:02:22.380> it<00:02:22.500> up<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.710> little<00:02:22.920> bit<00:02:23.130> and

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
to you fixing it up a little bit and

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.110 
to you fixing it up a little bit and
then<00:02:23.550> giving<00:02:23.850> it<00:02:23.940> back
