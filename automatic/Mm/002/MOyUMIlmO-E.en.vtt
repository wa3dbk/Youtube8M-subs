normally on or closed push-button so as
soon<00:02:19.750> as<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.079> ignition<00:02:20.530> is<00:02:20.680> turned<00:02:20.709> on<00:02:21.219> the

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
soon as the ignition is turned on the

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.660 
soon as the ignition is turned on the
relay<00:02:21.969> deactivates<00:02:22.689> the<00:02:23.019> starter<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:24.310> only

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
relay deactivates the starter the only

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.759 
relay deactivates the starter the only
way<00:02:24.849> to<00:02:24.909> disable<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.840> relay<00:02:26.109> and<00:02:26.290> make<00:02:26.560> the

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
way to disable the relay and make the

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.920 
way to disable the relay and make the
engine<00:02:27.159> starts<00:02:27.609> is<00:02:27.819> by<00:02:28.000> pressing<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.599> button

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
engine starts is by pressing the button

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.610 
engine starts is by pressing the button
to<00:02:29.049> activate<00:02:29.319> the<00:02:29.920> system<00:02:30.450> again<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:32.109> nicer

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
to activate the system again the nicer

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.800 
to activate the system again the nicer
fact<00:02:32.980> about<00:02:33.280> this<00:02:33.519> circuit<00:02:34.030> is<00:02:34.209> that<00:02:34.269> it<00:02:34.629> is

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
fact about this circuit is that it is

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.080 
fact about this circuit is that it is
normally<00:02:35.319> on<00:02:35.470> so<00:02:36.069> any<00:02:36.220> issues<00:02:36.400> with<00:02:36.909> the

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
normally on so any issues with the

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.089 
normally on so any issues with the
button<00:02:37.420> or<00:02:37.599> the<00:02:37.870> circuit<00:02:38.230> itself<00:02:38.379> will<00:02:38.890> not

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
button or the circuit itself will not

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.160 
button or the circuit itself will not
disable<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.909> starter<00:02:40.299> and<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.569> engine<00:02:40.959> will

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
disable the starter and the engine will

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.010 
disable the starter and the engine will
still<00:02:41.560> start
