00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
that thing lumped up and we were both in

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.729 
that thing lumped up and we were both in
kind<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.539> position<00:00:54.870> for<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.289> we<00:00:55.410> just<00:00:55.590> both

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
kind of position for it so we just both

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.049 
kind of position for it so we just both
started<00:00:56.010> scratching<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.640> know<00:00:56.760> he<00:00:56.910> was<00:00:57.030> just

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
started scratching you know he was just

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.299 
started scratching you know he was just
probably<00:00:57.390> from<00:00:57.660> me<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.309> scratching

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309

scratching<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.969> then<00:01:00.170> I<00:01:01.170> guess<00:01:01.590> he<00:01:01.739> wanted<00:01:01.949> to

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039
