00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 i am ariana today's fair 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.440
 reporter at antenne bavaria 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.510
 okay that's now we are happy now 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:15.480
 and interviews today and I always do that 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:18.990
 evil radio shine how are you 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.400
 today, we are doing very well today, we 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.900
 are glad that we are in Bavaria and 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.320
 antenna bavaria is why 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.580
 However, to the favorite station and yes it 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.349
 of course, weather was not so nice though 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.420
 otherwise concerns us you go along very well because 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.070
 We just got a whole new record 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.200
 be limitless way and have already 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.600
 very curious so everything else comes 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.280
 and corrected I already have that today 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.739
 traditional bavarian breakfast 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.640
 white sausage with profile and sweet mustard i 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.379
 loved that and was very good at what 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.149
 her earlier in the holidays everything like that 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.760
 made 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:52.649
 We live on Lake Constance and there you are 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.329
 In any case, if the weather is nice 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.550
 was always right to the lake and 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.899
 nice with air mattress or with us can 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.980
 you also swim well in the rhine 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.230
 Then let it drift again 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.739
 so always run back in any case 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.270
 down to the water and my vacation 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.770
 definitely a lot of grilled me too 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.210
 I'm a passionate killer that 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.409
 is really a lifestyle and 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.060
 I somehow get everything I put in 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.560
 gets the fingers and somehow 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.830
 so the first sunbeam is outside 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:21.420
 the grill is unpacked and sigrid that 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:25.799
 you used to suspect in music that is 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.270
 very interesting questions every day therefore 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.680
 mostly in the musical subjects 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.570
 So initially this is so because 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.259
 then he does not do much music anymore 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.150
 is requested 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.829
 I was kind of like that 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.530
 it actually became musical 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.610
 I was very good then that was 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:43.470
 everything was there, I was always so 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.240
 opener 2 or so once I have him 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.780
 I think we had to sing there 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.740
 single also in the duo singh in the me 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.990
 do not even in the tenth class 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.670
 or so and there were some of my 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.290
 classmates better 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.690
 if I 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.150
 they got such a one where 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.920
 I somehow had such a 2+ or 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.190
 so where I as really annoyed me 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.110
 a new song is never forgotten 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.950
 ever forgotten what what brecht 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.950
 not important 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:16.110
 I have my birthday 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.360
 Therefore, my uni forgot a bit 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.780
 funny then i am so i am so too 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.130
 He himself on the day and then have 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.750
 always asked why do you always have it? 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.430
 baked a lot of cake 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.920
 why is so much delicious food 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.600
 rum and then sometime is me one 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.760
 Feel like she has birthday today 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.260
 it was so a bit embarrassing that 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.880
 forget the birthday of my uni 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.900
 but then I still have to 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.400
 guilty yes indeed we are there very much 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.500
 on the way you can not believe it 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.510
 comes very much lost so that 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.200
 is on tour so what we already everything 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.420
 actually lost 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.550
 unbelievable that i believe i have 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.890
 now my sixth 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.120
 bought macbook power supply because that is 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.830
 What that lets you succumb sometimes 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.709
 you have already written many 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.220
 It's hard and how do you do something like that 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.330
 they already write songs 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.830
 that is always very different so 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.510
 there is no way for it 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.250
 So we always like to leave 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.630
 Inspire everyday life or things 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.690
 just things that matter to us 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.880
 are and that is really 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.160
 nature suggests the text finished he the 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.360
 musical part and that's what I'm doing 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.980
 then so very good in the middle so 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.720
 but sometimes comes with one 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.459
 text line around the corner or I'll come with you 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.989
 a musical idea around the corner 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.549
 can happen to me too 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.650
 a text line around the corner comes the 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.510
 he is so rare but so very 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.160
 in the end, in any case, quite well and it 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.019
 is always fun and you let yourself 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.239
 of course, of all kinds 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.620
 so inspire everyday things 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.320
 if you can be in the supermarket 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.549
 you get a great idea and if you are 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.750
 it then actually gentlemen already 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.010
 she says today sits down and 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.330
 can also be written that there 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.380
 why does not come that is really 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.380
 very different
