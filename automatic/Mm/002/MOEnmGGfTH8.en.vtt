pokemon gold and silver kuru Sue was a

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.939 
pokemon gold and silver kuru Sue was a
water-type<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.020> its<00:00:52.260> design<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.739> rather

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
water-type and its design is rather

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.529 
water-type and its design is rather
plain<00:00:53.309> but<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.610> think<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:53.940> could<00:00:54.090> make<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> cool

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
plain but I think it could make a cool

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.450 
plain but I think it could make a cool
pokémon<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:55.199> know<00:00:55.530> them<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.770> was<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.949> fire-type

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
pokémon I know them I was a fire-type

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.189 
pokémon I know them I was a fire-type
and<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.879> looks<00:00:57.059> similar<00:00:57.300> too<00:00:57.629> right<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:57.989> only

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
and it looks similar too right you only

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.290 
and it looks similar too right you only
red<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.590> fuzzy<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.520> also<00:00:59.670> think<00:01:00.000> he'd<00:01:00.180> make

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
red and fuzzy and I also think he'd make

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.430 
red and fuzzy and I also think he'd make
a<00:01:00.359> pretty<00:01:00.449> cool<00:01:00.809> pokeball

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
a pretty cool pokeball

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.900 
a pretty cool pokeball
maybe<00:01:01.739> these<00:01:01.949> Pokemon<00:01:02.399> will<00:01:02.489> see<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.730> light

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
maybe these Pokemon will see the light
