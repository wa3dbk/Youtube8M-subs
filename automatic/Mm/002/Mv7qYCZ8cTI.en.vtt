00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
you might well ask what I'm doing but

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.609 
you might well ask what I'm doing but
this<00:00:22.250> is<00:00:22.460> a<00:00:22.490> scientific<00:00:23.029> instrument<00:00:23.619> it's

called<00:00:24.950> a<00:00:25.070> sling<00:00:25.490> psychrometer<00:00:26.619> we're

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
called a sling psychrometer we're

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.550 
called a sling psychrometer we're
getting<00:00:27.919> an<00:00:28.070> average<00:00:28.250> of<00:00:28.730> the<00:00:29.289> wet<00:00:30.289> and<00:00:30.529> dry

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
getting an average of the wet and dry

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.410 
getting an average of the wet and dry
bulb<00:00:31.310> temperature<00:00:31.430> in<00:00:32.150> this<00:00:32.450> room<00:00:32.780> right<00:00:33.200> now

bulb temperature in this room right now

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.290 
bulb temperature in this room right now
once<00:00:35.420> we<00:00:35.600> stop<00:00:35.900> swinging<00:00:36.290> this<00:00:36.620> around<00:00:37.090> we<00:00:38.090> can

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
once we stop swinging this around we can

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.530 
once we stop swinging this around we can
then<00:00:38.510> read<00:00:38.870> off<00:00:39.140> the<00:00:40.040> wet<00:00:40.309> and<00:00:40.550> the<00:00:40.580> dry<00:00:41.030> bulb

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
then read off the wet and the dry bulb

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.170 
then read off the wet and the dry bulb
temperature<00:00:41.739> if<00:00:42.739> we<00:00:42.830> look<00:00:43.160> very<00:00:43.400> carefully<00:00:43.699> on

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
temperature if we look very carefully on

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.680 
temperature if we look very carefully on
the<00:00:44.660> wet<00:00:44.870> bulb<00:00:45.170> we're<00:00:46.160> reading<00:00:46.640> 19<00:00:47.300> degrees

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
the wet bulb we're reading 19 degrees

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.149 
the wet bulb we're reading 19 degrees
Celsius<00:00:49.960> at<00:00:50.960> the<00:00:51.199> moment<00:00:51.559> the<00:00:51.650> dry<00:00:51.860> bulb

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:52.159 
Celsius at the moment the dry bulb

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:56.770 
Celsius at the moment the dry bulb
temperature<00:00:52.280> is<00:00:52.970> reading<00:00:53.449> 24<00:00:54.049> degrees<00:00:55.720> why<00:00:56.720> is

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
temperature is reading 24 degrees why is

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:57.820 
temperature is reading 24 degrees why is
there<00:00:57.080> a<00:00:57.110> difference

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
there a difference

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.700 
there a difference
well<00:00:58.729> the<00:00:58.909> moisture<00:00:59.479> that's<00:00:59.839> on<00:01:00.110> this<00:01:00.290> cloth

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
well the moisture that's on this cloth

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.020 
well the moisture that's on this cloth
is<00:01:02.140> evaporating<00:01:03.140> of<00:01:03.290> the<00:01:04.250> surface<00:01:04.699> of<00:01:04.850> this

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
is evaporating of the surface of this

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.070 
is evaporating of the surface of this
thermometer<00:01:05.720> as<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:07.850> water<00:01:08.060> evaporates<00:01:08.780> off

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
thermometer as the water evaporates off

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.969 
thermometer as the water evaporates off
it's<00:01:09.920> taking<00:01:10.520> heat<00:01:10.820> with<00:01:11.330> it<00:01:11.510> and<00:01:11.979> so

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
it's taking heat with it and so

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.740 
it's taking heat with it and so
therefore<00:01:13.549> there<00:01:14.180> is<00:01:14.390> this<00:01:16.540> lowering<00:01:17.540> of<00:01:17.689> the

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
therefore there is this lowering of the

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
therefore there is this lowering of the
temperature<00:01:21.070> the<00:01:22.070> 19<00:01:22.549> degrees<00:01:22.789> in<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:24.560> wet

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
temperature the 19 degrees in the wet

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.940 
temperature the 19 degrees in the wet
bulb<00:01:25.299> means<00:01:26.299> that<00:01:26.869> there<00:01:27.079> is<00:01:27.109> a<00:01:27.259> difference

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
bulb means that there is a difference

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.569 
bulb means that there is a difference
which<00:01:28.820> we<00:01:29.119> record<00:01:29.600> as<00:01:29.869> the<00:01:30.109> relative<00:01:30.950> humidity

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
which we record as the relative humidity

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.410 
which we record as the relative humidity
the<00:01:33.039> other<00:01:34.039> advantage<00:01:34.640> of<00:01:34.759> this<00:01:34.939> instrument

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
the other advantage of this instrument

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.209 
the other advantage of this instrument
is<00:01:35.719> that<00:01:36.710> we<00:01:36.859> can<00:01:37.070> turn<00:01:37.369> straight<00:01:38.270> away<00:01:38.570> and

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 
is that we can turn straight away and

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:42.700 
is that we can turn straight away and
dial<00:01:40.219> up<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:40.909> wet<00:01:41.119> bulb<00:01:41.359> temperature<00:01:41.710> which

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
dial up the wet bulb temperature which

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.719 
dial up the wet bulb temperature which
was<00:01:42.950> 19<00:01:43.490> degrees<00:01:43.670> and<00:01:44.270> we<00:01:45.229> can<00:01:45.439> slide<00:01:45.829> and<00:01:46.429> show

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
was 19 degrees and we can slide and show

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.569 
was 19 degrees and we can slide and show
the<00:01:47.509> dry<00:01:48.200> bulb<00:01:48.530> temperature<00:01:49.539> which<00:01:50.539> was<00:01:51.579> 24

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
the dry bulb temperature which was 24

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:59.200 
the dry bulb temperature which was 24
degrees<00:01:53.770> so<00:01:54.770> 19<00:01:55.460> and<00:01:56.469> 24<00:01:57.469> degrees<00:01:57.850> we<00:01:58.850> can<00:01:58.999> read

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
degrees so 19 and 24 degrees we can read

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.109 
degrees so 19 and 24 degrees we can read
off<00:01:59.420> the<00:01:59.600> scale<00:01:59.990> that<00:02:00.889> the<00:02:01.039> relative<00:02:01.520> humidity

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
off the scale that the relative humidity

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:08.529 
off the scale that the relative humidity
is<00:02:02.630> 60<00:02:03.560> percent<00:02:05.560> older<00:02:06.560> instruments<00:02:07.539> still

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
is 60 percent older instruments still

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.930 
is 60 percent older instruments still
scientific<00:02:09.319> instruments<00:02:09.920> used<00:02:10.550> to<00:02:10.670> look<00:02:10.910> like

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
scientific instruments used to look like

scientific instruments used to look like
this<00:02:11.530> we<00:02:12.530> have<00:02:12.710> the<00:02:12.890> wet<00:02:13.130> cloth<00:02:13.810> around<00:02:14.810> the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
this we have the wet cloth around the

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
this we have the wet cloth around the
thermometer<00:02:16.520> and<00:02:16.670> we<00:02:16.730> have<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.810> dry<00:02:19.540> bulb

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
thermometer and we have the dry bulb

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.920 
thermometer and we have the dry bulb
temperature<00:02:20.690> as<00:02:21.380> well<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:23.510> difference

of the problems in modern buildings is

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.400 
of the problems in modern buildings is
that<00:02:48.060> we<00:02:48.180> talk<00:02:48.450> about<00:02:48.620> dry<00:02:49.620> eye<00:02:49.950> syndrome<00:02:51.410> dry
