00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.750
 implementation of imitation from opening the door 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:11.450
 implemented through the gap green 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:19.199
 purple wires in the passenger door 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:32.130
 We look as or acts muffled 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:40.829
 we start cars with buttons we put on 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:46.230
 the handbrake on the key fobs we have auto start 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:01:01.289
 went we go out type we go out din 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:01:03.629
 car radio 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.750
 she turned off strangely but it 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.470
 can be implemented 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:13.430
 look again we start the car already 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.430
 true software start 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:27.580
 as you can see the radio is playing 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:44.810
 turn off the car also use 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:51.530
 all this is done we are looking at 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:02:03.440
 mannitol receiver goes dead again 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:02:05.270
 let's see this moment looking for some 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.510
 make sure I make this discovery 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.730
 the door when opening the door changes 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.260
 backlight 

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:21.490
 driver's door accordingly 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:21.490
 Look carefully Gushma car 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.960
 now of course it turned out but clearly visible 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.680
 that the radio is turned off by itself 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.680
 thank
