00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
the fish that they sell for quite a bit

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:14.470 
the fish that they sell for quite a bit
of<00:04:13.160> money<00:04:13.340> and<00:04:13.459> that's<00:04:13.700> part<00:04:14.060> of<00:04:14.090> the<00:04:14.209> process

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
of money and that's part of the process

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.719 
of money and that's part of the process
of<00:04:14.959> having<00:04:15.440> a<00:04:15.680> coin<00:04:15.889> that's<00:04:16.100> worth<00:04:16.280> so<00:04:16.549> much

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
of having a coin that's worth so much

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:18.670 
of having a coin that's worth so much
because<00:04:17.150> it<00:04:17.299> takes<00:04:17.510> a<00:04:17.630> long<00:04:17.900> time<00:04:17.930> to<00:04:18.440> do<00:04:18.650> this

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
because it takes a long time to do this

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.580 
because it takes a long time to do this
many<00:04:19.639> many<00:04:19.910> years<00:04:20.180> in<00:04:20.359> the<00:04:20.450> process<00:04:20.720> so<00:04:21.410> that's

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
many many years in the process so that's

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.370 
many many years in the process so that's
why<00:04:21.769> it's<00:04:22.190> it's<00:04:22.639> really<00:04:23.360> really<00:04:23.930> a<00:04:23.960> shot<00:04:24.289> in

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
why it's it's really really a shot in

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.500 
why it's it's really really a shot in
the<00:04:24.440> dark<00:04:24.620> to<00:04:24.889> find<00:04:25.340> a<00:04:25.430> grand<00:04:25.700> champion<00:04:25.970> quite

fourth fifth year you see what I'm

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:49.810 
fourth fifth year you see what I'm
saying<00:04:47.900> so<00:04:48.080> they<00:04:48.680> you're<00:04:49.220> gonna<00:04:49.340> pay<00:04:49.550> a<00:04:49.580> whole

saying so they you're gonna pay a whole
lot<00:04:49.940> more<00:04:50.120> for<00:04:50.360> that<00:04:50.479> so<00:04:50.690> it's<00:04:51.140> not<00:04:51.320> real

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
lot more for that so it's not real

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.770 
lot more for that so it's not real
likely<00:04:51.979> that<00:04:52.130> you're<00:04:52.250> gonna<00:04:52.340> find<00:04:52.669> a<00:04:52.880> fish<00:04:53.120> for

fourteen or fifteen dollars and you

take it home and raise it yourself to be

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.500 
take it home and raise it yourself to be
really<00:04:57.830> big<00:04:58.040> and<00:04:58.280> have<00:04:58.550> it<00:04:58.700> worth<00:04:58.850> thousands

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
really big and have it worth thousands

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.150 
really big and have it worth thousands
of<00:04:59.570> dollars<00:04:59.630> it<00:05:00.440> might<00:05:00.470> be<00:05:00.740> worth<00:05:00.920> a<00:05:01.010> hundred

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
of dollars it might be worth a hundred

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.010 
of dollars it might be worth a hundred
hundred<00:05:01.730> bucks<00:05:02.120> maybe<00:05:02.450> two<00:05:02.660> hundred<00:05:02.690> bucks

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
hundred bucks maybe two hundred bucks

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.350 
hundred bucks maybe two hundred bucks
maybe<00:05:03.290> maybe<00:05:04.040> not<00:05:04.280> have<00:05:04.520> much<00:05:04.700> value<00:05:05.090> at<00:05:05.210> all

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
maybe maybe not have much value at all

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.760 
maybe maybe not have much value at all
because<00:05:05.600> maybe<00:05:05.990> it<00:05:06.170> just<00:05:06.320> doesn't<00:05:06.530> have<00:05:06.650> the

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
because maybe it just doesn't have the

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.490 
because maybe it just doesn't have the
right<00:05:06.920> shape<00:05:07.190> so<00:05:07.820> that's<00:05:08.030> kind<00:05:08.300> of<00:05:08.330> the<00:05:08.510> logic

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
right shape so that's kind of the logic

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.520 
right shape so that's kind of the logic
behind<00:05:09.890> that<00:05:10.430> and<00:05:10.970> I<00:05:11.150> hope<00:05:11.270> that<00:05:11.540> you<00:05:11.690> have<00:05:11.870> an

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
behind that and I hope that you have an

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.700 
behind that and I hope that you have an
idea<00:05:12.920> of<00:05:13.220> how<00:05:13.310> that<00:05:13.460> goes<00:05:13.640> now<00:05:13.910> so<00:05:14.680> before<00:05:15.680> I

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
idea of how that goes now so before I

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:16.810 
idea of how that goes now so before I
get<00:05:15.830> to<00:05:15.920> the<00:05:16.010> question<00:05:16.280> day<00:05:16.400> I<00:05:16.430> want<00:05:16.610> to<00:05:16.670> throw

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
get to the question day I want to throw

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.570 
get to the question day I want to throw
out<00:05:16.880> a<00:05:16.970> tip<00:05:17.240> to<00:05:17.360> everyone<00:05:17.840> and<00:05:18.320> I<00:05:19.250> come<00:05:19.430> back

from the aquarium world and the tip is

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.540 
from the aquarium world and the tip is
about<00:05:23.530> calculating<00:05:24.530> the<00:05:24.740> pond<00:05:24.950> volume<00:05:25.400> how

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
about calculating the pond volume how

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:26.920 
about calculating the pond volume how
much<00:05:25.670> water<00:05:25.940> you<00:05:26.120> have<00:05:26.240> in<00:05:26.270> your<00:05:26.480> pond<00:05:26.690> and

much water you have in your pond and
back<00:05:26.960> from<00:05:27.800> the<00:05:27.890> aquarium<00:05:28.160> world<00:05:28.460> I<00:05:28.730> would<00:05:29.120> do

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
back from the aquarium world I would do

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.450 
back from the aquarium world I would do
length<00:05:29.450> times<00:05:29.750> width<00:05:30.080> times<00:05:30.350> depth<00:05:31.190> of<00:05:31.370> the

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
length times width times depth of the

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.210 
length times width times depth of the
aquarium<00:05:32.120> in<00:05:32.410> inches<00:05:33.410> and<00:05:33.680> then<00:05:34.010> we<00:05:34.100> would

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
aquarium in inches and then we would

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.300 
aquarium in inches and then we would
divide<00:05:34.880> by<00:05:35.090> 231<00:05:35.990> so<00:05:36.680> that's<00:05:36.860> the<00:05:37.010> inches

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
divide by 231 so that's the inches

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.440 
divide by 231 so that's the inches
formula<00:05:37.760> and<00:05:37.880> that<00:05:37.970> would<00:05:38.060> give<00:05:38.240> you<00:05:38.330> the

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
formula and that would give you the

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.330 
formula and that would give you the
volume<00:05:38.900> length<00:05:39.200> times<00:05:39.530> width<00:05:39.770> times<00:05:40.040> height

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
volume length times width times height

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.870 
volume length times width times height
or<00:05:40.820> depth<00:05:41.060> in<00:05:41.330> inches<00:05:42.290> divided<00:05:43.040> by<00:05:43.100> 231<00:05:43.610> that

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
or depth in inches divided by 231 that

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.400 
or depth in inches divided by 231 that
will<00:05:43.970> give<00:05:44.060> you<00:05:44.150> the<00:05:44.240> volume<00:05:44.660> if<00:05:44.870> you<00:05:45.260> have

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
will give you the volume if you have

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.330 
will give you the volume if you have
just<00:05:45.650> a<00:05:45.740> cube<00:05:46.130> okay<00:05:47.120> now<00:05:47.750> in<00:05:48.620> in<00:05:48.980> the<00:05:49.130> pond

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
just a cube okay now in in the pond

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.730 
just a cube okay now in in the pond
world<00:05:49.640> they<00:05:50.270> do<00:05:50.330> length<00:05:50.810> times<00:05:51.140> width<00:05:51.710> times

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
world they do length times width times

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.700 
world they do length times width times
depth<00:05:52.400> in<00:05:52.610> feet<00:05:53.030> they<00:05:53.570> multiply<00:05:54.110> it<00:05:54.230> by<00:05:54.350> seven

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
depth in feet they multiply it by seven

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.980 
depth in feet they multiply it by seven
point<00:05:55.040> four<00:05:55.280> eight<00:05:55.610> and<00:05:55.850> that<00:05:56.480> will<00:05:56.690> give<00:05:56.870> you

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
point four eight and that will give you

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.930 
point four eight and that will give you
the<00:05:57.110> volume<00:05:57.530> of<00:05:57.710> your<00:05:57.740> pond<00:05:58.100> now<00:05:58.520> keep<00:05:58.790> in<00:05:58.910> mind

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
the volume of your pond now keep in mind

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.420 
the volume of your pond now keep in mind
if<00:05:59.270> you<00:05:59.390> have<00:05:59.420> any<00:05:59.780> shelves<00:06:00.350> any<00:06:00.740> shapes<00:06:01.130> any

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
if you have any shelves any shapes any

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.320 
if you have any shelves any shapes any
twists<00:06:01.910> this<00:06:02.390> is<00:06:02.570> for<00:06:02.840> very<00:06:04.030> linear<00:06:05.030> like

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
twists this is for very linear like

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.140 
twists this is for very linear like
rectangle<00:06:06.160> that<00:06:07.160> would<00:06:07.340> give<00:06:07.550> you<00:06:07.640> the<00:06:07.730> volume

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
rectangle that would give you the volume

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.970 
rectangle that would give you the volume
so<00:06:08.390> I<00:06:08.630> think<00:06:09.320> a<00:06:09.410> lot<00:06:09.560> of<00:06:09.590> people<00:06:09.830> make<00:06:09.950> a

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:09.980 
so I think a lot of people make a

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.200 
so I think a lot of people make a
mistake<00:06:10.070> when<00:06:10.520> they<00:06:10.610> do<00:06:10.670> the<00:06:10.820> length<00:06:11.000> times

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
mistake when they do the length times

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.090 
mistake when they do the length times
width<00:06:11.450> and<00:06:11.720> they<00:06:11.780> do<00:06:11.840> that<00:06:12.110> times<00:06:12.530> seven<00:06:12.860> point

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.100 
width and they do that times seven point

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.010 
width and they do that times seven point
four<00:06:13.310> eight<00:06:13.550> and<00:06:13.730> then<00:06:14.270> they<00:06:14.420> think<00:06:14.900> their

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
four eight and then they think their

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.870 
four eight and then they think their
pond<00:06:15.260> is<00:06:15.380> bigger<00:06:15.590> than<00:06:15.740> it<00:06:15.800> is<00:06:15.890> but<00:06:16.400> that's<00:06:16.550> a

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
pond is bigger than it is but that's a

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.030 
pond is bigger than it is but that's a
little<00:06:17.720> tip<00:06:17.960> for<00:06:18.080> you<00:06:18.140> on<00:06:18.320> how<00:06:18.440> to<00:06:18.470> figure<00:06:18.920> your
