00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.300 
seven of his goals corrupted but so I've
only<00:02:56.270> got<00:02:56.450> like<00:02:56.570> five<00:02:57.050> or<00:02:57.320> so<00:02:57.530> to<00:02:57.590> show<00:02:57.920> you<00:02:57.980> but

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
only got like five or so to show you but

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.100 
only got like five or so to show you but
there<00:02:58.970> was<00:02:59.060> something<00:02:59.239> about<00:02:59.390> these<00:02:59.630> two<00:02:59.870> like

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
there was something about these two like

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.900 
there was something about these two like
in<00:03:00.350> comparison<00:03:00.890> like<00:03:01.040> Messi<00:03:01.370> I<00:03:01.400> think<00:03:01.730> he<00:03:01.790> was

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
in comparison like Messi I think he was

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.880 
in comparison like Messi I think he was
getting<00:03:02.150> basically<00:03:02.450> a<00:03:02.570> Golic<00:03:02.930> game<00:03:03.110> cirrhotic

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
getting basically a Golic game cirrhotic

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.070 
getting basically a Golic game cirrhotic
I<00:03:03.920> think<00:03:04.160> ended<00:03:04.459> up<00:03:04.580> with<00:03:04.760> like<00:03:04.940> 12<00:03:05.270> in<00:03:05.540> 7<00:03:05.930> which

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
I think ended up with like 12 in 7 which

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.540 
I think ended up with like 12 in 7 which
is<00:03:06.110> brilliant<00:03:06.410> that's<00:03:06.680> basically<00:03:07.010> two<00:03:07.280> goals

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
is brilliant that's basically two goals

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.160 
is brilliant that's basically two goals
a<00:03:07.670> game<00:03:07.850> and<00:03:08.270> he<00:03:08.450> was<00:03:08.540> just<00:03:08.600> why<00:03:08.780> those<00:03:08.930> players

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170
