00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.779
 hi everyone with you crash 47 and today I will 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.939
 review monster hunter 3 ultimate 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.890
 nintendo 3ds versions 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.419
 Let's start with the fact that monster hunter is 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.610
 hardcore hunter simulator 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:26.470
 monsters that seem to be clear from the name 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.540
 but why did the game become a phenomenon 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.579
 which is selling frantic runs in 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.529
 Japan do and and social functions 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.120
 the main of which is local 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.430
 cooperative for four people 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.260
 ask well in this particular well, 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.640
 Firstly, this is the very possibility of four 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.500
 bring down huge monsters acting 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.449
 one player goes well together 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.579
 through the second covers from afar and 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.710
 so on secondly that's all that 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.810
 accompanies this exchange process 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.940
 items or experiences in general when 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.739
 the first part became a bomb strong understood 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.750
 what's what and started to do on release in 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.790
 year that is, you release the number part 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.350
 then rush to the portable console in 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.040
 end doing a reissue with new 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.170
 content 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.869
 this is the reprint i am reviewing 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.820
 monster hunter 3 ultimate has a long 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.710
 the way it all started monster hunter 3 for 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.079
 nintendo we which were then ported 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.909
 apis a song on playstation 3 well and then 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:14.829
 also on young 3d 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.299
 in a year and a half and released in the west 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:18.340
 subtitled altima 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:21.369
 Well what can I say the game on the portable 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.079
 from nintendo feels great in 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.819
 general standard formula nowhere 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:27.130
 gone we give under control 

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:28.779
 new hunter arrived village 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.549
 movado to help local people in every way 

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:32.439
 residents that is not only to kill 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.509
 monsters but also collect weed to mine 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.999
 minerals catch a row of chickens after a long 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.399
 learning we understand three things first 

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:41.409
 the village is the center in general of everything here we are 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.389
 take the quest and save buy 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.639
 we create equipment second 

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:47.679
 there is no open world taking quests coming out 

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:50.170
 from the village you automatically get to 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:52.240
 location from the limits of 50 minutes follow 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.399
 task as you want the main thing to invest in 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.889
 limit and not die more than twice otherwise 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.079
 mission failed third here everything will have 

00:01:56.889 --> 00:02:00.639
 make yourself armor and weapons even 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:02.859
 medicinal drugs require collection 

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:04.359
 material is sometimes extremely rare for example 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:07.359
 need to cut off the tail of a certain 

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:09.429
 monster to do yourself boots quests 

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:11.260
 not that much complicated just requires 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.819
 patience after the first pass 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.200
 quest you can repeat it not agro 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.510
 exact number of times for prey 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.879
 materials from the monster and the process itself 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.920
 monotonous but crazy with 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:23.900
 every mined thing and you feel 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.090
 how is your character improving what is he 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.219
 but it becomes a little bit harder and 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.870
 enduring this feeling with nothing 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:32.900
 compare probably this is one of 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.000
 reasons franchise popularity kill 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.280
 Monsters can be all different ways 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.019
 depends on your choice of weapon you can 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.060
 clumsily carry a big sword and 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.099
 infrequently strike a crazy lesson 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.079
 you can walk with a standard sword and 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.540
 shield can take two blades or even 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.250
 huge shotguns in every weapon of their own 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.389
 charms so choose based on 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.370
 own preferences 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:54.379
 the weapon is dulled so you need it 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.870
 regularly undermine sometimes even in the heat 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:59.269
 besides the main weapon you can fight 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.040
 carry grenades bomb traps all that 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.769
 my heart desires the most important thing 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.629
 create management at first seems 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.099
 inconvenient to blame for this absence 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.680
 second stick you can either 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:12.469
 adapt to this as me or buy 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.359
 the second verse is all just in this version in 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:16.519
 Unlike the port, no piquis was cut out. 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.379
 terribly uncomfortable and sometimes exhausting 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.180
 battles underwater that forces yet 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:22.790
 think more about buying this 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.919
 accessory with a cooperative we all 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.650
 the harder thing is that it is exclusively 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:28.819
 local and for playing on 3ds our country 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.769
 it's almost potal 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.180
 so what is the value of the game for remote 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.069
 regions sharply pads 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.569
 unless you have a version for value 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.579
 which will provide an opportunity not 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.319
 only play online with the world but 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.299
 and flip saving between two 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.340
 versions so if you decide to take 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:45.859
 game find friends with whom you can 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.259
 it would be common in general this 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:50.090
 extremely volume beautiful and enjoyable game 

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:51.859
 which will take a couple of hundred hours 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.389
 can monotonous but extremely 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:56.780
 addictive gameplay 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:58.459
 is it worth buying a certain newbie 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.469
 may get lost in a heap of functions not 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.259
 see all the charm of the game need only 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:06.199
 let her open up need patience 

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:08.780
 my final score is 8 and 5 of 10 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:10.880
 with you would be 47 subscribe put
