actually my new tree farm each one of
these<00:04:35.990> will<00:04:36.440> have<00:04:36.560> a<00:04:36.590> tree<00:04:36.919> grow<00:04:37.130> in<00:04:37.340> it<00:04:37.430> we<00:04:37.520> can

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
these will have a tree grow in it we can

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
grow I've tested it out on each single

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:47.529 
grow I've tested it out on each single
spot<00:04:42.430> put<00:04:43.430> a<00:04:43.479> sapling<00:04:44.479> right<00:04:44.660> here<00:04:46.300> use<00:04:47.300> some

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
spot put a sapling right here use some

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.339 
spot put a sapling right here use some
bone<00:04:47.780> meal<00:04:48.130> there<00:04:49.130> you<00:04:49.310> go<00:04:49.520> and<00:04:49.870> we<00:04:50.870> can<00:04:51.020> chop
