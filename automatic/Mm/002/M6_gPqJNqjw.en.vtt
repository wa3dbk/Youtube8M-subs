 welcome once again to sonic 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:15.110
 by trying more 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:18.770
 Well nothing guys today I bring enough 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:21.200
 good in my simple opinion but a 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.670
 chub of childhood neither more nor less children 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.160
 that put that 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.180
 the truth guys has only appeared in a 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.820
 game 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.489
 I wanted to remember and well the truth is that 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.490
 It's a character that I like a lot 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.260
 since 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.120
 good to play are and that for the first time 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.199
 Well I do not know if the guard appears 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.199
 there we have it 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.160
 finally this character ignore the info of 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:55.180
 sonic attention for the first time and last 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.880
 in sonic r then appeared the comics and 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.270
 all those things but with that part already 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.090
 you know 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:05.360
 it has appeared good because being the metal 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.100
 or na that says the name and being the 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.990
 character more without fast even that is 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.810
 super sonic of the whole sonic game 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.580
 ernest and the truth is that I liked 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.890
 a lot as a character I always thought that 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.330
 metals metal sonic could 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.710
 form here pons choose the use the 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.940
 proximity 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.940
 I have a little problem 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.260
 for your person 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.409
 and good such sound returned 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.409
 well guys 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.590
 what to say today we are going to try this 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.329
 small boat in a few modifications 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:48.450
 skies sanctuary here we have it hello 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.450
 Raquel 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.259
 good too 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.509
 it seems sky sanctuary normal guys but 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:00.140
 it's not the same sky sanctuary is a 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.960
 rare species a remix the skies antoine 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.510
 and as we see it is not total it is totally 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.590
 different 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.100
 and there we have a cross method 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.770
 OK 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.430
 Well, the song that I've put in the background 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.340
 it's okay, it's gone 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.050
 the song that I have put in the background is 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.240
 good 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.640
 that does not even want but it's a remix that made 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.890
 a channel called I think it was 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.890
 I went and almost bring me 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.080
 good you are in what looked like metal 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.690
 knuckles 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.210
 of not being considered a kind of 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.740
 factory I do not remember now the name if 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.290
 they want to know that like all the tricks 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.600
 of the loner I know that the name of the 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.860
 song to walk it out and I just fell 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.490
 again go for god 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.490
 I will do it 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.599
 but I already told you it's a way 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.940
 simple but it is quite polished I have 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:04.140
 asked for it to make a mod 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:07.890
 to a mountain 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.890
 the rest of my hatsune or enemy of 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.970
 vocaloid which I already have in the mountains 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.410
 charged do you worry us 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.410
 and from place I 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.660
 of pokemon since I do not think there's another 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.790
 that is the same 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.610
 and well, they are already on the list if 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.320
 you want I can comment 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.180
 I can put a character in 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.670
 special that you want to put you or 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.370
 something and if not already to go putting me for my 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.960
 account but in the end you tell me low of this 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.960
 mode if I find the download link 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.850
 OK 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.950
 and in such a case that he can not therefore in it 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:50.569
 what would be the order of the list then 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.599
 I would go up saying that I have not found 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.709
 I'm not in it 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.090
 because sometimes not because the links of 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.159
 download and I have to get into the 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.489
 page of the boy girl who has already created 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.489
 the mod 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.650
 Y 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.650
 whether you want it or not 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.750
 ok I did not kill myself I 'm alive 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.290
 we have a life 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.910
 I like it even though 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.650
 in this dying in every half hour 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.300
 nothing happens 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.759
 I love tracing with eyes 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.659
 my mother how is she today sent me everything 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:29.659
 This is because sent me 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.270
 is more or less deformed so it's very 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.070
 already I turn to play is doing 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:42.240
 problems today it's worth it guys 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.770
 good video I ask patience for him and nothing 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.440
 well 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.569
 I'm here only in my room like 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.410
 habit 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:51.410
 I've cheated 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:58.979
 and god the rays of the sky sanctuary the 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.099
 truth is that it is quite changed 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:04.800
 It is not that you notice that it is edited 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:06.389
 from the original guys what 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.590
 who has plays to income 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.449
 perfectly I will see that a 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.560
 gameplay of the game will know perfectly 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:15.700
 how it is and you will see the changes if not then 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.680
 you can go to look at it or not 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.920
 of people and sometimes what you want 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.920
 do 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.700
 we are approaching the goal guys 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.919
 I'm going to make a description of this but 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.919
 I do not think it's necessary since 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.400
 be infinite what you want 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:55.900
 well, we have nothing already completed 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.370
 with mere mccaw 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:03.610
 I have nothing because I 've fallen for 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:05.500
 our mail robert gates and I want 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.500
 guys check one thing to see what I 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:11.910
 says knuckles the eln original action a 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.910
 note that you knew you would get 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:19.789
 but one thing that takes hard to you oh god 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:22.280
 dyslexic like me my god but like that 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:25.879
 once I know but this guy who says god 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.289
 mine let's see how it stays is that the 

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:28.460
 sec sonic to see metal mark in 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:30.830
 the scene I think it does appear 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:34.460
 it should look like graciela write 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:36.889
 it's here we have it alone when 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:40.639
 we have winters 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:42.139
 in short enough but I think I started 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:44.810
 give tails classes that I have a lot of disgust 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:46.220
 because there is not going to kind of sonic and if 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:49.639
 he spoke 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:51.350
 classic tails I did not like 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:55.350
 but anyway 

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:57.870
 and I can also look for stage 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:59.640
 de sainz generations in mods for the 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.320
 classic if you like the classic 

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.580
 obviously I can do it also in 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.110
 I love playing with classic song 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.420
 and cheese 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:09.600
 it's like my childhood orgasm is worth 

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:11.040
 I should not have said that with the 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.569
 guys let's go leaving here I would 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.220
 I stay with him if his dyslexia 

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:18.240
 the best thing is that 

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:22.590
 but to me you tell me 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:25.250
 in order then the series are not and says goodbye 

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.250
 see you soon
