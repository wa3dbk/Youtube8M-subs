00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.139
 today I'm going to introduce the 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.639
 barbecue mode that is written by a 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.650
 Japanese so they are on a 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.619
 Japanese forum so to read the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.410
 Japanese you must have a translator 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.789
 before seriously so today I 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.740
 find you for the presentation of the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.230
 barbecue mode so as I wanted to 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.060
 switch to a mode that was created by a 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.880
 Japanese so the forum unfortunately 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.200
 will be Japanese and here I am 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.710
 would calm the link can be that I 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.809
 will do a tutorial too I know that balla 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.160
 1.4 is coming out in not very long 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.360
 it's just because I really 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.710
 want to introduce you to this mode because 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.260
 that he is really really good 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.940
 it is super well done that's why 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.610
 I will show you right away 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.500
 how does it work so as you can 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.390
 see bass really has the mouth of a 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.219
 barbecue 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.199
 it really works like an oven so 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.370
 you put the meat you expect and 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.039
 his thigh except that there is no 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.799
 interface it's directly like a 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.090
 true barbecue then to show you 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:07.590
 first of all you need charcoal 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.140
 wood and not coal it means 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.700
 what you need you have to do 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.840
 to cook charcoal so log so 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.750
 to have charcoal so that 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.360
 it's normal because it does not work 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.740
 at the real charcoal mouths you mouth the 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.689
 music because the name is called 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.220
 yes so the barbecue does not work or 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.720
 coal found in mines 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.000
 that's why we need coal 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.250
 wood then you take what wanted 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.700
 so not fulfilled here is your chops 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.690
 pork your fish your raw chicken 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.370
 as well as your raw steak 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.070
 finally what you need to cook 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.020
 you right click on the 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.060
 barbecue you see lit and you ask 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.880
 your barback for quite a while we 're going 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.800
 ask two that we will dig a little bit of 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.850
 all we could see that frankly 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.590
 it's very good plus there is a small 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.180
 noise when you ask it as if you 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.200
 also accuse him you can see that that 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.820
 becomes brown 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.350
 when it starts to be cooked and then 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.270
 after that direct deposit and you do not have 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.860
 more than to recover and you can 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.170
 invite all your friends to make a 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.910
 barbeque and dancing naked around the 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.770
 table and do things not very 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.910
 few catholics you want and 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.620
 there is no seriously we see there 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.850
 frankly it's a game mode I 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.290
 traveled multiple and forms 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.960
 Japanese and the Japanese really do 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.340
 modes but extraordinary and it is 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.600
 pity that is to say that it is 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.190
 unfortunately in Japanese because 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.620
 frankly there are modes that is 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.560
 really deserve to really be 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.180
 recognized as that one here is good I 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.490
 really find that it should be 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.500
 known if he is really great 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.280
 look and we'll cook 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.520
 do not know if you hear the noise 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.780
 behind closed here is frankly it's 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.030
 a really beautiful fashion 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.040
 and that's all he adds 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.000
 then I'll finally you it's also 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.020
 already very good so we pick up and I 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.270
 let me show you how 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.150
 we will craft it before I will recover my 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.530
 food it will serve me for my adventure 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.560
 solo later because yes that's my 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.300
 solo adventure I decided to do good 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.760
 except for the roof okay I left 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.980
 my 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.989
 because here I wanted a nice thing 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.010
 huh so also if you see that because 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.269
 that the house in the world she was 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.159
 made in shortlist list we do not care 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.510
 so how to make the barbecue is 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:18.420
 very simple just plug it in 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.860
 of a thicket of ingots to do you 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.120
 put excuse me implied that 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.140
 the action you put lenovo to do 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.670
 like this as to a 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.780
 pants and the oven in the middle but 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.799
 power that it gives you the barbecue 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.670
 by the way you can see that that's the 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.489
 barbeque shape 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.609
 finally you have the barbecue you 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.959
 can you put your catch and I know 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.569
 not but we can do a barbecue 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.000
 indoor a barbecue of verandas 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.769
 like here here I am but the voice 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.299
 recovers the charcoal did 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:46.340
 clear added that we invite all our 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:48.629
 friends creepers and pigs to party 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.250
 So that's all for this mode it's 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.010
 really a very good fashion that deserves 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.510
 to be known frankly good even though 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.780
 here I know that the 1.4 as I have 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.799

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.670
 he still deserved to be present 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.290
 and so we will wait and we will 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.650
 the arrange deserved anyway to be 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.180
