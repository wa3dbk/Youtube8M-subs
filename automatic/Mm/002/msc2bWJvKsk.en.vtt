00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
distraction I don't think meant to but

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.780 
distraction I don't think meant to but
it<00:01:01.489> does<00:01:01.820> it<00:01:02.239> Reavers<00:01:02.719> the<00:01:02.839> structure<00:01:03.790> so

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
it does it Reavers the structure so

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.880 
it does it Reavers the structure so
let's<00:01:04.970> get<00:01:05.089> a<00:01:05.150> quick<00:01:05.330> look<00:01:05.900> at<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:06.110> game<00:01:06.320> in

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
let's get a quick look at the game in

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:23.160 
let's get a quick look at the game in
action<00:01:07.190> there<00:01:07.610> let's<00:01:07.880> get<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:08.120> sound<00:01:08.330> on

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.140 

so<00:01:24.170> as<00:01:24.260> you<00:01:24.350> can<00:01:24.470> see<00:01:24.619> from<00:01:24.740> a<00:01:24.860> clip<00:01:25.070> its<00:01:25.340> shapes

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
so as you can see from a clip its shapes

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.850 
so as you can see from a clip its shapes
flying<00:01:26.750> in<00:01:26.900> from<00:01:27.049> the<00:01:27.110> side<00:01:27.320> to<00:01:27.530> press<00:01:27.710> the

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
button to get points that's basically

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.780 
button to get points that's basically
the<00:01:30.170> idea<00:01:30.560> of<00:01:30.680> the<00:01:30.800> game<00:01:31.100> now<00:01:31.490> you<00:01:31.550> may<00:01:31.760> be
