00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
this one on that one and so this one's

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.410 
this one on that one and so this one's
got<00:03:41.780> a<00:03:41.840> high<00:03:42.020> speed<00:03:42.350> a<00:03:42.670> little<00:03:43.670> more<00:03:43.910> power<00:03:44.120> to

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
got a high speed a little more power to

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.940 
got a high speed a little more power to
it<00:03:44.450> I<00:03:44.810> don't<00:03:45.440> know<00:03:45.500> though<00:03:45.620> it's<00:03:45.740> pretty

horsepower this is a 1978 that's a

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.270 
horsepower this is a 1978 that's a
two-horse<00:04:31.130> motor<00:04:31.430> what<00:04:31.640> it<00:04:31.760> came<00:04:31.910> with<00:04:32.200> but<00:04:33.200> I

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
two-horse motor what it came with but I

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.640 
two-horse motor what it came with but I
have<00:04:34.280> a<00:04:34.340> feeling<00:04:34.580> he<00:04:35.030> said<00:04:35.060> he<00:04:35.270> changed<00:04:35.720> it<00:04:35.900> so

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
have a feeling he said he changed it so

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.650 
have a feeling he said he changed it so
I<00:04:36.680> bet<00:04:37.280> he<00:04:37.400> took<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:37.729> two<00:04:37.910> horse<00:04:38.120> put<00:04:38.360> on<00:04:38.479> so<00:04:38.600> I

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
I bet he took the two horse put on so I

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.740 
I bet he took the two horse put on so I
melts<00:04:39.020> and<00:04:39.169> he's<00:04:39.890> probably<00:04:40.100> a<00:04:40.250> one<00:04:40.460> in<00:04:40.580> a

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
melts and he's probably a one in a

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.930 
melts and he's probably a one in a
quarter<00:04:41.750> one<00:04:41.960> and<00:04:42.080> a<00:04:42.110> half<00:04:42.160> or<00:04:43.160> one<00:04:43.190> I<00:04:43.640> don't
