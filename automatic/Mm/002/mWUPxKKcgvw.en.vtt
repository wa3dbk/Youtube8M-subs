which<00:03:54.290> was<00:03:54.470> good<00:03:56.770> so<00:03:57.770> I<00:03:58.160> realized<00:03:59.030> after<00:03:59.450> a

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
which was good so I realized after a

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.480 
which was good so I realized after a
while<00:03:59.900> I<00:04:00.200> was<00:04:00.380> like<00:04:00.500> holy<00:04:00.710> crap<00:04:00.860> I<00:04:01.040> making<00:04:01.370> so

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
while I was like holy crap I making so

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.370 
while I was like holy crap I making so
much<00:04:01.580> money<00:04:01.640> here<00:04:02.060> so<00:04:02.240> I<00:04:02.270> think<00:04:02.540> after<00:04:03.080> my

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
much money here so I think after my

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.030 
much money here so I think after my
brutalizer<00:04:03.800> usually<00:04:04.489> I<00:04:04.820> get<00:04:05.150> last<00:04:05.450> whisper<00:04:06.040> to

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
brutalizer usually I get last whisper to

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.229 
brutalizer usually I get last whisper to
stack<00:04:07.340> my<00:04:08.440> stack<00:04:09.440> my<00:04:09.680> armor<00:04:10.250> piercing<00:04:10.400> but<00:04:10.970> I

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
stack my stack my armor piercing but I

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:12.460 
stack my stack my armor piercing but I
decided<00:04:11.510> to<00:04:11.690> aim<00:04:11.810> for<00:04:11.840> the<00:04:12.020> infinity<00:04:12.440> edge

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
decided to aim for the infinity edge

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.090 
decided to aim for the infinity edge
instead<00:04:13.420> usually<00:04:14.420> I<00:04:14.450> go<00:04:14.750> more<00:04:15.170> attacks<00:04:15.860> be

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
instead usually I go more attacks be

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.539 
instead usually I go more attacks be
critical<00:04:16.489> strike<00:04:16.760> you<00:04:17.000> know<00:04:18.160> with<00:04:19.160> like<00:04:19.250> zeal

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
critical strike you know with like zeal

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.940 
critical strike you know with like zeal
and<00:04:19.730> things<00:04:19.970> but<00:04:20.330> this<00:04:21.169> time<00:04:21.290> as<00:04:21.470> I<00:04:21.590> just<00:04:21.770> be

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
and things but this time as I just be

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.220 
and things but this time as I just be
straight<00:04:22.220> up

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
straight up

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.230 
straight up
managed<00:04:23.470> a<00:04:23.740> name<00:04:24.400> for<00:04:24.580> the<00:04:24.640> critical<00:04:25.000> strike

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
managed a name for the critical strike

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.880 
managed a name for the critical strike
so<00:04:25.480> I<00:04:25.540> think<00:04:25.600> by<00:04:26.020> the<00:04:26.080> end<00:04:26.170> of<00:04:26.380> the<00:04:26.470> game<00:04:26.500> I<00:04:26.650> was

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
so I think by the end of the game I was

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.810 
so I think by the end of the game I was
hidden<00:04:27.070> like<00:04:27.340> I<00:04:27.940> think<00:04:28.300> I<00:04:28.480> was<00:04:28.600> hitting<00:04:28.750> about

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
hidden like I think I was hitting about

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.560 
hidden like I think I was hitting about
600-700<00:04:32.130> damage<00:04:33.130> the<00:04:33.550> critical<00:04:33.970> strike<00:04:34.270> and

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
600-700 damage the critical strike and

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.120 
600-700 damage the critical strike and
then<00:04:34.660> against<00:04:35.170> meaning<00:04:35.530> of<00:04:35.680> doing<00:04:35.980> like<00:04:36.070> a

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
then against meaning of doing like a

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.590 
then against meaning of doing like a
thousand<00:04:36.780> with<00:04:37.780> the<00:04:37.900> infinity<00:04:38.350> edge<00:04:39.210> but<00:04:40.210> this

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
thousand with the infinity edge but this

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.240 
thousand with the infinity edge but this
one<00:04:40.750> here<00:04:40.960> I<00:04:40.990> was<00:04:41.170> like<00:04:41.290> after<00:04:41.590> I<00:04:41.740> died<00:04:42.010> I<00:04:42.040> was

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
possible that's like the best thing

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.930 
possible that's like the best thing
since<00:05:30.610> sliced<00:05:30.700> bread<00:05:30.990> you<00:05:31.990> know<00:05:32.460> so

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.660 

I<00:05:36.380> think<00:05:37.380> this<00:05:37.530> one<00:05:37.740> I<00:05:37.770> tried<00:05:38.070> to<00:05:38.190> save<00:05:38.430> me<00:05:38.460> on

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:38.670 
I think this one I tried to save me on

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.760 
I think this one I tried to save me on
if<00:05:38.910> I<00:05:39.060> catch<00:05:39.300> up<00:05:39.330> to<00:05:39.510> kill<00:05:39.840> a<00:05:40.050> week<00:05:40.260> on<00:05:40.500> but

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
if I catch up to kill a week on but

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.970 
if I catch up to kill a week on but
obviously<00:05:41.070> diesel<00:05:41.900> running<00:05:42.900> away<00:05:43.170> it<00:05:43.620> doesn't

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:43.980 
obviously diesel running away it doesn't

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.880 
obviously diesel running away it doesn't
move<00:05:44.100> and<00:05:44.430> I<00:05:45.420> don't<00:05:45.660> die<00:05:45.900> in<00:05:45.960> there<00:05:46.290> but<00:05:46.620> it's

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
move and I don't die in there but it's

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.520 
move and I don't die in there but it's
okay<00:05:47.220> obviously<00:05:47.970> 7<00:05:48.390> 12<00:05:48.600> and<00:05:48.660> 7<00:05:49.080> he<00:05:49.200> looked<00:05:49.350> kind

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
okay obviously 7 12 and 7 he looked kind

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.410 
okay obviously 7 12 and 7 he looked kind
of<00:05:49.620> dicking<00:05:49.920> around<00:05:50.010> I<00:05:50.490> think<00:05:51.030> I<00:05:51.090> tried<00:05:51.270> to

Baron once twice but but it was quite an

Baron once twice but but it was quite an
is<00:05:57.030> it<00:05:57.270> was<00:05:57.930> obvious<00:05:58.350> that<00:05:58.380> we're<00:05:58.590> gonna<00:05:58.680> win

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.890

is it was obvious that we're gonna win
anyways<00:05:59.190> because<00:05:59.580> obviously<00:05:59.970> we<00:06:00.270> already

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.480 
anyways because obviously we already

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.200 
anyways because obviously we already
pushed<00:06:00.720> two<00:06:00.930> sides<00:06:01.200> and<00:06:01.910> you<00:06:02.910> know<00:06:03.030> the<00:06:03.180> other

pushed two sides and you know the other
team<00:06:03.540> only<00:06:03.930> had<00:06:04.170> well<00:06:05.100> actually<00:06:05.190> we<00:06:05.460> were<00:06:05.550> even

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:05.730 
team only had well actually we were even

team only had well actually we were even
on<00:06:05.940> kills<00:06:06.270> but<00:06:07.190> we<00:06:08.190> just<00:06:08.370> had<00:06:08.520> my<00:06:09.030> team<00:06:09.210> just

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
on kills but we just had my team just

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:10.850 
on kills but we just had my team just
had<00:06:09.480> a<00:06:09.510> lot<00:06:09.660> better<00:06:09.810> gameplay<00:06:10.110> action<00:06:10.650> going

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
had a lot better gameplay action going

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.560 
had a lot better gameplay action going
on<00:06:10.980> so<00:06:11.340> we<00:06:11.580> were<00:06:11.670> able<00:06:11.760> to<00:06:11.940> do<00:06:12.330> a<00:06:12.360> lot<00:06:12.450> more

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
on so we were able to do a lot more

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.590 
on so we were able to do a lot more
pushing<00:06:12.990> well<00:06:13.290> after<00:06:13.590> we<00:06:13.680> got<00:06:13.800> the<00:06:13.950> gangs<00:06:14.600> but

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 
pushing well after we got the gangs but

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.840 
pushing well after we got the gangs but
I<00:06:16.020> just<00:06:16.470> thought<00:06:16.560> it<00:06:16.710> was<00:06:16.770> so<00:06:17.040> funny<00:06:17.070> that<00:06:17.610> Jax

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850

kept<00:06:18.090> trying<00:06:18.390> to<00:06:18.450> give<00:06:18.600> here<00:06:18.780> this<00:06:18.930> is<00:06:19.020> one

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.230 
kept trying to give here this is one

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.400 
kept trying to give here this is one
time<00:06:19.410> after<00:06:20.340> he<00:06:20.520> he<00:06:21.480> killed<00:06:21.720> me<00:06:21.930> I<00:06:22.110> don't<00:06:22.350> know

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 
if he got an assist and Soraka killed me

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.600 
if he got an assist and Soraka killed me
