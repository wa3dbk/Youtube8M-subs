them to cut your fabric and literally

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.640 
them to cut your fabric and literally
sometimes<00:05:49.599> you<00:05:49.870> have<00:05:49.990> to<00:05:50.050> stand<00:05:50.259> there<00:05:50.319> for

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
sometimes you have to stand there for

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.550

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:30.699 
I'll get them so I got this for my

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:33.300 
I'll get them so I got this for my
gaming<00:06:31.149> channel<00:06:31.649> because<00:06:32.649> the<00:06:32.830> sound<00:06:33.069> can<00:06:33.250> be

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
gaming channel because the sound can be

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.950 
gaming channel because the sound can be
a<00:06:33.399> little<00:06:33.639> sketchy<00:06:33.879> on<00:06:34.149> that<00:06:34.300> sometimes<00:06:34.719> so<00:06:34.930> I

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
a little sketchy on that sometimes so I

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.269 
a little sketchy on that sometimes so I
figured<00:06:35.259> this<00:06:35.349> would<00:06:35.500> help<00:06:35.649> out<00:06:35.860> the<00:06:36.039> sound

00:06:36.269 --> 00:06:36.279 
figured this would help out the sound

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:38.399 
figured this would help out the sound
quite<00:06:36.520> a<00:06:36.550> bit<00:06:36.779> to<00:06:37.779> have<00:06:37.930> a<00:06:37.960> speaker<00:06:38.229> and

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:38.409 
quite a bit to have a speaker and

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:40.100 
quite a bit to have a speaker and
everything<00:06:38.740> right<00:06:38.949> like<00:06:39.189> next<00:06:39.580> to<00:06:39.669> my<00:06:39.789> faith
