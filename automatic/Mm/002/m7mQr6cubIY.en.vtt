00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:06.030
 them to all the drama that I am with a 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:08.310
 folder much more and good 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:12.889
 I have to say so they do not know that 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.889
 each principal has been eliminated 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.779
 they put me three strikes and then I do not have 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.759
 very clear why but good the 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.820
 removed so I'm going to have to continue 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:27.750
 with this I will have all the activity 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.289
 in this and good we will see for now that 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.480
 are you going to play 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.080
 the fact is that I'm here done in the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:39.000
 folder with mods and have forts 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:42.930
 helium for it have created star wars 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 conservative too many maps goes with its web 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.579
 think to mention a little 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.190
 and to see 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.820
 well this is from the humanism 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.360
 autonomic and good talking about him we're going 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.090
 to put some 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.050
 for example we know bars and a little to 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.050
 see this is a life 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.620
 this is one of these 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.620
 to see this is a comedian 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.869
 a polar bear 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.540
 I kill her 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.130
 two 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.130
 the days period 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.400
 you see it 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.400
 do not 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.660
 the band 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:53.560
 and anibal 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.560
 we do it like in a creative sense 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:03.719
 the love life bar 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:11.390
 because the cannibal point to teach it 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:11.390
 now it brings lightsabers like it is not 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.640
 of everything 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:40.780
 it's a beast but there are weapons to make 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.780
 this new units this is what it is 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:51.370
 then there is the most 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.990
 It's pretty flux like you see 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:08.450
 if logic bitch where not 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.450
 at work 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.010
 two 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.269
 quite 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.269
 Bogota 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.720
 if you load it 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:34.340
 it kills enough tomás that it has a time 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.030
 of recovery until to be able to 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.550
 use a more gun condom around here the 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:44.330
 katana I will see the following way to 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:47.020
 teach what the ocean is and it's a goal 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:50.860
 which brings with decoration and things 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:52.770
 different in the ocean 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.710
 or the most because there 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:58.130
 if you fear evictions you see acesa plants and 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.860
 luminous birds and we saw some 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.180
 look over here there are luminous buds 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.330
 You can also catch coral and do things 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:10.350
 of coral although I do not know very well if it is 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:13.770
 ok ok the yum pads that is this have 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.380
 basically a few blocks or like 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.930
 want to call or have different 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.010
 things or do different things 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.010
 these for example are to jump 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.050
 how many more 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:28.610
 plus of your highest aunts 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:32.240
 the green that less then was blue 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:35.090
 and now 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.020
 then there is this one that is to burn it not 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:44.760
 is that right now like this one 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:47.129
 I know it's fast like that 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.260
 not that 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:52.640
 blatter 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.640
 full speed 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:03.050
 only during the blocks that you're there 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.930
 the we pink angels that see you later and 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:09.350
 podés basically good find 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:11.120
 around the world these and these statues that 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.010
 right now they are like flea games and 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.560
 that's why if you look at them, they do not 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:18.639
 can move 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:22.440
 more than me when I know why they are there 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:22.440
 in manifestation plan 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:36.120
 supposedly if you look at them softly do not 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.120
 can move 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:43.120
 but good looks to have updated something 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.760
 and now he 's watching when you turn 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.370
 they look is the one that when you put yourself like that 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:52.630
 they can not turn and they can jump but 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:57.750
 good and that 's it 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.750
 and this did not happen lens and versions 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.940
 it 's good that you come 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:06.270
 see if nothing happens you do not turn around and you must 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:10.470
 attack there's a lot here to kill him alone 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:12.900
 then kill with a spike I do not know I think that 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.000
 of diamond or whatever it serves not 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.560
 I have no idea but try with what 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.030
 try it with dynamite with whatever 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.630
 will be able to kill us unless 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:23.250
 complicated and good as this as quite 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:26.260
 because he's always outgoing from the night 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:29.590
 of 31 and say you're worth 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:32.410
 still and insane for a hundred poet if you 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:35.160
 it kills because more removed enough life and 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:38.530
 well I think I've already taught everything 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:41.350
 But the statue is looked when 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:43.510
 active not going to put up no 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.100
 I understand why good in the case 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.300
 As I'm done, I'm going to 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.890
 say goodbye to me here I am happy 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.990
 folder you already know you have subscribed 

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.990
 for more and until the next video bye bye
