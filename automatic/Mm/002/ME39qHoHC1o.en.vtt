00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.839 
how to say this in English but in
Portuguese<00:02:15.959> is<00:02:16.080> kurosu<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.830> then<00:02:17.519> you<00:02:17.640> just

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
Portuguese is kurosu and then you just

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.789 
Portuguese is kurosu and then you just
cut<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.180> in<00:02:18.269> three<00:02:18.420> ways<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.080> then<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.650> go

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
cut it in three ways and then you go

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.559 
cut it in three ways and then you go
vertically<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.549> then<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:20.760> go<00:02:20.850> horizontally

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
vertically and then you go horizontally

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.660 
vertically and then you go horizontally
