there's 800 milligrams of that now the
downfall<00:01:27.250> that<00:01:27.460> ingredient<00:01:27.940> is<00:01:28.030> it<00:01:28.240> does<00:01:28.450> have

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
downfall that ingredient is it does have

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.120 
downfall that ingredient is it does have
a<00:01:28.720> very<00:01:28.900> short<00:01:29.080> half-life<00:01:29.560> in<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:29.800> body<00:01:29.980> it

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
a very short half-life in the body it

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.230 
a very short half-life in the body it
gets<00:01:30.280> cleared<00:01:30.550> out<00:01:30.670> of<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:30.760> body<00:01:30.910> pretty

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
gets cleared out of the body pretty

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.600 
gets cleared out of the body pretty
rapidly<00:01:31.660> so<00:01:32.020> you<00:01:32.530> could<00:01:32.740> take<00:01:32.770> a<00:01:32.950> good<00:01:33.220> dose<00:01:33.400> of

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
rapidly so you could take a good dose of

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.100 
rapidly so you could take a good dose of
it<00:01:33.790> and<00:01:33.970> then<00:01:34.060> with<00:01:34.180> it<00:01:34.330> within<00:01:34.510> 15<00:01:34.930> minutes

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
it and then with it within 15 minutes

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.080 
it and then with it within 15 minutes
the<00:01:35.230> effects<00:01:35.740> just<00:01:36.010> our<00:01:36.190> felt<00:01:36.460> anymore<00:01:36.700> so

the effects just our felt anymore so

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.300 
the effects just our felt anymore so
what<00:01:37.660> they<00:01:37.840> did<00:01:37.900> is<00:01:38.140> they<00:01:38.290> add<00:01:38.530> an<00:01:38.710> ingredient

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
what they did is they add an ingredient

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.650 
what they did is they add an ingredient
and<00:01:39.490> I'm<00:01:39.670> going<00:01:39.820> to<00:01:39.850> butcher<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.300> name<00:01:40.450> but<00:01:40.600> I

think it's called panel pae ONOO and

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.130 
think it's called panel pae ONOO and
that's<00:01:45.220> 300<00:01:45.820> milligrams<00:01:46.330> of<00:01:46.570> that<00:01:46.750> that<00:01:46.990> is

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
that's 300 milligrams of that that is

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.210 
that's 300 milligrams of that that is
shown<00:01:47.410> to<00:01:47.650> be<00:01:47.830> an<00:01:48.070> emmy<00:01:48.580> OB<00:01:49.090> inhibitor<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:50.680> what

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
shown to be an emmy OB inhibitor so what

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.760 
shown to be an emmy OB inhibitor so what
that<00:01:51.250> means<00:01:51.610> is<00:01:51.760> that<00:01:51.820> it<00:01:52.330> can<00:01:52.510> allow<00:01:52.630> for<00:01:53.500> the

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
that means is that it can allow for the

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.790 
that means is that it can allow for the
peña<00:01:54.120> to<00:01:55.120> stay<00:01:55.900> in<00:01:56.050> the<00:01:56.140> body<00:01:56.320> or<00:01:56.440> think<00:01:56.740> of

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
peña to stay in the body or think of

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.010 
peña to stay in the body or think of
what's<00:01:56.950> room<00:01:57.100> longer<00:01:57.670> so<00:01:58.210> you<00:01:58.270> may<00:01:58.450> get<00:01:58.630> more

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
what's room longer so you may get more

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.270 
what's room longer so you may get more
or<00:01:59.700> prolonged<00:02:00.700> effect<00:02:01.300> of<00:02:01.480> the<00:02:01.570> peña<00:02:02.280> increase

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
or prolonged effect of the peña increase

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.610 
or prolonged effect of the peña increase
in<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:03.790> mood<00:02:04.120> enhancement<00:02:04.630> energy<00:02:05.140> mental

focus<00:02:05.800> things<00:02:06.370> like<00:02:06.520> that<00:02:06.700> so<00:02:07.210> that's<00:02:07.330> the

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
focus things like that so that's the

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.139 
focus things like that so that's the
reason<00:02:07.720> for<00:02:08.110> that<00:02:08.140> pay<00:02:08.440> at<00:02:08.560> all<00:02:08.709> ingredient<00:02:09.220> so

reason for that pay at all ingredient so

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.880 
reason for that pay at all ingredient so

the peña is salvia meter oh he's a--

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.610 
the peña is salvia meter oh he's a--
which<00:02:15.790> is<00:02:15.970> called<00:02:16.150> salvia<00:02:16.659> not<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.500> be

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
which is called salvia not to be

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.770 
which is called salvia not to be
confused<00:02:17.769> with<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.489> street<00:02:18.909> drugs<00:02:19.209> salvia

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
confused with the street drugs salvia

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.830 
confused with the street drugs salvia
that<00:02:19.960> people<00:02:20.230> use<00:02:20.380> to<00:02:20.410> get<00:02:20.830> trippy<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.460> stuff

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
that people use to get trippy and stuff

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.710 
that people use to get trippy and stuff
that<00:02:22.050> that<00:02:22.230> is<00:02:22.379> not<00:02:22.620> this<00:02:22.860> ingredient<00:02:23.720> those

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
that that is not this ingredient those

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.960 
that that is not this ingredient those
500<00:02:25.200> milligrams<00:02:25.500> in<00:02:25.620> there<00:02:25.769> so<00:02:26.129> this<00:02:26.519> version

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
500 milligrams in there so this version

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.699 
500 milligrams in there so this version
of<00:02:27.090> salvia<00:02:27.450> shouldn't<00:02:27.810> have<00:02:27.930> antioxidant

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
of salvia shouldn't have antioxidant

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.490 
of salvia shouldn't have antioxidant
effects<00:02:28.980> which<00:02:29.190> is<00:02:29.370> great<00:02:30.230> other<00:02:31.230> than<00:02:31.440> that

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
effects which is great other than that

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.509 
effects which is great other than that
though<00:02:31.739> it's<00:02:31.860> also<00:02:31.980> been<00:02:32.160> shown<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.340> improve

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
though it's also been shown to improve

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.250 
though it's also been shown to improve
lipid<00:02:33.269> metabolism<00:02:33.420> or<00:02:34.280> fat<00:02:35.280> metabolism<00:02:36.260> and

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
lipid metabolism or fat metabolism and

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.289 
lipid metabolism or fat metabolism and
there's<00:02:37.500> also<00:02:37.730> nice<00:02:38.730> thing<00:02:38.910> about<00:02:38.940> this

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
there's also nice thing about this

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.539 
there's also nice thing about this
because<00:02:39.540> this<00:02:39.810> is<00:02:40.019> a<00:02:40.049> fat<00:02:40.680> burner<00:02:40.920> stimulant

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
because this is a fat burner stimulant

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.100 
because this is a fat burner stimulant
product<00:02:41.910> it's<00:02:42.390> actually<00:02:42.540> been<00:02:42.840> shown<00:02:43.080> to

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
product it's actually been shown to

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.670 
product it's actually been shown to
decrease<00:02:43.500> blood<00:02:44.430> pressure<00:02:44.959> which<00:02:45.959> is<00:02:45.989> nice<00:02:46.410> so

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
decrease blood pressure which is nice so

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.500 
decrease blood pressure which is nice so
if<00:02:46.920> you're<00:02:47.040> improving<00:02:47.310> lipid<00:02:47.790> metabolism<00:02:47.910> or

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
if you're improving lipid metabolism or

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.720 
if you're improving lipid metabolism or
fat<00:02:48.810> metabolism<00:02:49.379> increasingly<00:02:49.890> pollicis

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
fat metabolism increasingly pollicis

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.030 
fat metabolism increasingly pollicis
which<00:02:50.910> is<00:02:51.060> fat<00:02:51.239> burning<00:02:51.599> and<00:02:51.750> reducing<00:02:52.530> blood

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
has a lot of research on Cuban showing

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.650 
has a lot of research on Cuban showing
that<00:03:12.750> it<00:03:12.870> does<00:03:13.049> work<00:03:13.500> basically<00:03:14.510> one<00:03:15.510> of<00:03:15.540> the

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
that it does work basically one of the

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.119 
that it does work basically one of the
mechanisms<00:03:15.840> though<00:03:16.319> it<00:03:16.530> works<00:03:16.709> is<00:03:16.920> that<00:03:16.950> if

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
mechanisms though it works is that if

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.640 
mechanisms though it works is that if
you<00:03:17.250> take<00:03:17.489> it<00:03:17.810> it<00:03:18.810> can<00:03:19.049> actually<00:03:19.200> when

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
you take it it can actually when

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.250 
you take it it can actually when
carbohydrates<00:03:20.010> reached<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:20.959> intestines<00:03:21.959> and

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
carbohydrates reached the intestines and

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.900 
carbohydrates reached the intestines and
normally<00:03:23.190> they<00:03:23.310> be<00:03:23.370> broken<00:03:23.760> down<00:03:23.790> into

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
normally they be broken down into

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.940 
normally they be broken down into
glycogen<00:03:24.299> and<00:03:24.780> then<00:03:25.349> they<00:03:25.500> would<00:03:25.590> get<00:03:25.739> into

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
glycogen and then they would get into

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.770 
glycogen and then they would get into
the<00:03:26.040> bloodstream<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.700> be<00:03:26.850> either<00:03:27.090> stored<00:03:27.510> as

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
the bloodstream to be either stored as

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.539 
the bloodstream to be either stored as

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
glycogen or if you have an excess

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.220 
glycogen or if you have an excess
tortoise<00:03:29.819> body<00:03:30.030> fat<00:03:30.299> they<00:03:30.959> can<00:03:31.109> actually

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
tortoise body fat they can actually

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.080 
tortoise body fat they can actually
inhibit<00:03:31.620> them<00:03:31.920> reaching<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.579> the

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
inhibit them reaching the the

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.870

nice<00:03:36.840> effect<00:03:37.200> of<00:03:37.319> that<00:03:37.500> plus<00:03:38.690> it<00:03:39.690> does<00:03:39.840> have<00:03:40.019> a

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
nice effect of that plus it does have a

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.160 
nice effect of that plus it does have a
lot<00:03:40.349> of<00:03:40.380> antioxidant<00:03:41.250> effects<00:03:41.489> so<00:03:41.639> many<00:03:41.910> other

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
lot of antioxidant effects so many other

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.580 
lot of antioxidant effects so many other
anti-inflammatory<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:43.290> things<00:03:43.440> like<00:03:43.530> that

effects<00:03:44.519> that<00:03:44.670> it<00:03:44.730> has<00:03:44.819> but<00:03:45.239> I<00:03:45.269> think<00:03:45.510> in<00:03:45.630> here

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
effects that it has but I think in here

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.949 
effects that it has but I think in here
it's<00:03:45.989> for<00:03:46.200> that<00:03:46.319> main<00:03:46.500> fat-burning<00:03:47.010> mechanism

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
it's for that main fat-burning mechanism

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.140 
it's for that main fat-burning mechanism
next<00:03:48.959> is<00:03:49.109> die<00:03:49.260> caffeine<00:03:49.769> melly<00:03:50.040> three<00:03:50.370> hundred

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
next is die caffeine melly three hundred

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.420 
next is die caffeine melly three hundred
milligrams<00:03:51.540> this<00:03:52.169> is<00:03:52.349> caffeine<00:03:52.829> bonded<00:03:53.310> to

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
milligrams this is caffeine bonded to

milligrams this is caffeine bonded to
mal<00:03:53.609> gases<00:03:54.230> this<00:03:55.230> should<00:03:55.650> yield<00:03:56.040> about<00:03:56.340> 225

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
mal gases this should yield about 225

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.930

milligrams of pure caffeine now the

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.280 
milligrams of pure caffeine now the
reason<00:04:00.120> why<00:04:00.269> they've<00:04:00.450> added<00:04:00.780> this<00:04:00.900> inside

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
reason why they've added this inside

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.979 
reason why they've added this inside
here<00:04:01.500> is<00:04:01.530> that<00:04:01.829> caffeine<00:04:02.430> can<00:04:03.090> have<00:04:03.120> some<00:04:03.780> side

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
here is that caffeine can have some side

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.190 
here is that caffeine can have some side
effects<00:04:04.639> jitters<00:04:05.639> restlessness<00:04:06.480> maybe

your<00:04:09.269> tolerance<00:04:09.540> to<00:04:09.959> simones<00:04:10.290> so<00:04:10.530> they<00:04:11.099> added

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
your tolerance to simones so they added

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
they bonded mal gas into the caffeine to

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.050 
they bonded mal gas into the caffeine to
prolong<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:16.979> release<00:04:17.250> of<00:04:17.400> caffeine<00:04:17.849> and
