00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:16.329
 the pelagic net and a big heckling 

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.329
 fearing too many working days of trawlers fishing in progress 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.880

 the bank of which he is a member of the order 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.970
 but despite the Ontario law back 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.090
 with pana 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.810
 we are here and there 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.810
 the given down per month 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.450
 when you go back up the trawl the precious commodity is there 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.000
 the good day when conditions are mild several tons of 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 fish can be grouped together in one trick 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.870

 the battle of the Marne 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.490
 on 29 occasions 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.490
 despite their work with a varied range 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.090
 the adventure started 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.260
 did he say 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.310
 now we must go forward 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.500
 where is the first step of the day under a dignified sun in the 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.500
 areas where we are going 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.090
 buyers in crisis and are present to cover the costs 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.040
 here a wholesaler just bought tons of sardines at the price of a euro goes 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.840
 the kilo 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.310
 two tons which will be resold without difficulty to the 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.110
 fishmongers 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.390
 in my opinion this is a first step in the season for the reputation of the 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.680
 balance of his account 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.050
 very very important 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.160
 but more like meeting by speech compose it 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.760
 last year Pascal and his crew sinned and sold near 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.050
 250 tons of sardines over the three months of the season 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.030
