machine is thread the Machine one of the
very<00:00:41.360> nice<00:00:41.600> features<00:00:42.079> that<00:00:42.110> this<00:00:42.469> machine<00:00:42.890> has

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
very nice features that this machine has

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.459 
very nice features that this machine has
is<00:00:45.070> it<00:00:46.070> has<00:00:46.309> the<00:00:46.670> capability<00:00:46.850> of<00:00:47.570> using<00:00:47.809> comb

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
is it has the capability of using comb

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.750 
is it has the capability of using comb
thread<00:00:50.379> you<00:00:51.379> can<00:00:51.410> use<00:00:51.739> regular<00:00:52.010> spools<00:00:52.519> of

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
thread you can use regular spools of

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.090 
thread you can use regular spools of
thread<00:00:52.899> but<00:00:53.899> it's<00:00:54.019> nice<00:00:54.289> that<00:00:54.320> you're<00:00:54.800> able<00:00:54.920> to

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
thread but it's nice that you're able to

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.549 
thread but it's nice that you're able to
use<00:00:55.370> these<00:00:55.579> large<00:00:55.910> cones<00:00:56.359> and<00:00:56.960> I<00:00:57.079> happen<00:00:57.530> to

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
use these large cones and I happen to

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.009 
use these large cones and I happen to
have<00:00:57.829> a<00:00:58.219> variety<00:00:58.640> of<00:00:58.940> colors<00:00:59.390> in<00:00:59.539> these<00:00:59.659> cones

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
have a variety of colors in these cones

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:02.229 
have a variety of colors in these cones
so<00:01:00.440> this<00:01:00.649> is<00:01:00.859> a<00:01:01.010> very<00:01:01.280> nice<00:01:01.519> thing<00:01:01.820> for<00:01:01.850> me<00:01:02.149> to

so this is a very nice thing for me to
be<00:01:02.359> able<00:01:02.480> to<00:01:02.659> use<00:01:03.019> without<00:01:03.469> a<00:01:03.499> separate<00:01:03.980> thread

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
be able to use without a separate thread

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.170 
be able to use without a separate thread
stand<00:01:05.170> another<00:01:06.170> nice<00:01:06.530> feature<00:01:06.830> is<00:01:07.430> if<00:01:08.030> you

bobbin<00:01:14.510> winder<00:01:14.960> so<00:01:15.620> you<00:01:15.710> don't<00:01:15.979> have<00:01:16.130> to

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
bobbin winder so you don't have to

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.970 
bobbin winder so you don't have to
unthread<00:01:16.700> your<00:01:17.000> machine<00:01:17.390> in<00:01:17.750> order<00:01:18.410> to<00:01:18.530> wind<00:01:18.860> a

bobbin which is nice if you're in a

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.230 
bobbin which is nice if you're in a
hurry<00:01:21.530> and<00:01:21.950> you<00:01:22.070> want<00:01:22.250> to<00:01:22.340> keep<00:01:22.460> on<00:01:22.670> going<00:01:22.970> you

hurry and you want to keep on going you
don't<00:01:23.630> have<00:01:23.810> to<00:01:23.990> unthread<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.440> machine

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
don't have to unthread the machine

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.230 
don't have to unthread the machine
thread<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:26.210> bobbin<00:01:26.360> and<00:01:26.960> then<00:01:28.210> unthread<00:01:29.210> the

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
thread the bobbin and then unthread the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.100 
thread the bobbin and then unthread the
bobbin<00:01:29.870> and<00:01:30.080> rethread<00:01:30.680> your<00:01:30.860> machine<00:01:32.110> the

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
bobbin and rethread your machine the

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.050 
bobbin and rethread your machine the
first<00:01:33.380> step<00:01:33.680> in<00:01:33.890> threading<00:01:34.280> your<00:01:34.310> machine<00:01:34.760> is

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
first step in threading your machine is

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.840 
first step in threading your machine is
to<00:01:35.660> place<00:01:35.870> the<00:01:36.140> cone<00:01:36.410> on<00:01:36.800> the<00:01:37.040> left<00:01:37.280> hand<00:01:37.610> spool

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
to place the cone on the left hand spool

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.000 
to place the cone on the left hand spool
pull<00:01:40.850> your<00:01:41.060> thread<00:01:41.240> up<00:01:41.570> through<00:01:42.500> this<00:01:42.650> first

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
pull your thread up through this first

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.930 
pull your thread up through this first
guide<00:01:43.310> in<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:43.970> top<00:01:44.210> of<00:01:44.360> the<00:01:44.420> thread<00:01:44.660> stand

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
guide in the top of the thread stand

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.330 
guide in the top of the thread stand
then<00:01:46.940> you<00:01:47.150> will<00:01:47.330> see<00:01:47.600> that<00:01:48.560> there<00:01:48.800> is<00:01:48.890> a<00:01:48.920> small

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
then you will see that there is a small

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.810 
then you will see that there is a small
silver<00:01:49.790> hook<00:01:50.030> marked<00:01:50.840> number<00:01:51.200> one<00:01:51.820> you'll

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
silver hook marked number one you'll

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.610 
silver hook marked number one you'll
pull<00:01:53.120> your<00:01:53.360> thread<00:01:53.540> through<00:01:53.660> that

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.410 

the<00:01:58.620> next<00:01:58.920> step<00:01:59.160> is<00:01:59.400> bringing<00:01:59.940> your<00:02:00.090> threads

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
the next step is bringing your threads

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.650 
the next step is bringing your threads
straight<00:02:00.870> across<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.470> top<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.920> machine

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
straight across the top of the machine

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:09.470 
straight across the top of the machine
around<00:02:03.660> the<00:02:03.990> silver<00:02:04.380> hook<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:05.130> number<00:02:05.400> two<00:02:08.480> the

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:09.480 
around the silver hook to number two the

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.240 
around the silver hook to number two the
next<00:02:09.660> step<00:02:10.050> is<00:02:10.290> to<00:02:10.560> bring<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.980> thread

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
next step is to bring the thread

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.420 
next step is to bring the thread
straight<00:02:11.640> down<00:02:11.880> through<00:02:12.060> your<00:02:12.210> tension<00:02:12.660> disk

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
straight down through your tension disk

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.360 
straight down through your tension disk
down<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.670> number<00:02:14.940> three<00:02:15.710> up<00:02:16.710> to<00:02:17.070> number<00:02:17.340> four

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
down to number three up to number four

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.930 
down to number three up to number four
which<00:02:17.850> is<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.180> take-up<00:02:18.510> lever<00:02:18.570> and<00:02:19.940> straight

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
which is the take-up lever and straight

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.850 
which is the take-up lever and straight
down<00:02:23.210> continuing<00:02:24.210> straight<00:02:24.570> down<00:02:24.930> from<00:02:25.440> four

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
down continuing straight down from four

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.540 
down continuing straight down from four
to<00:02:26.190> number<00:02:26.370> five<00:02:27.170> there<00:02:28.170> is<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.410> silver<00:02:29.070> thread

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
to number five there is a silver thread
