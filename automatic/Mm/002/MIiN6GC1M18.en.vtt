00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
was was given the transmission tunnel

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.040 
was was given the transmission tunnel
project<00:04:34.740> and<00:04:34.980> way<00:04:35.580> this<00:04:35.790> is<00:04:35.910> quite<00:04:36.660> quite

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
project and way this is quite quite

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.140 
project and way this is quite quite
