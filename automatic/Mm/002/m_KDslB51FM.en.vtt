00:00:03.077 --> 00:00:09.046
 The glass hole is very easy if you use the correct basics, and the appropriate technique 

00:00:09.071 --> 00:00:12.240
 We will make a hole in this piece of glass 

00:00:12.265 --> 00:00:15.552
 Using drill tools pointed in the form of lanyards 

00:00:15.577 --> 00:00:17.183
 You notice that I have done a vibration-resistant job 

00:00:17.208 --> 00:00:20.522
 It keeps the glass where it is during its hole 

00:00:20.547 --> 00:00:24.039
 To stop moving we'll make a hole here 

00:00:24.064 --> 00:00:29.601
 Before you start piercing the glass, you have to put a lubricant on the glass, so we will put some 

00:00:29.626 --> 00:00:33.488
 Paste the glass around the hole to hold the liquid 

00:00:33.752 --> 00:00:38.204
 If you do not have this putty you can make it 

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:41.895
 Using plastic parts 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.666
 And install it 

00:00:48.617 --> 00:00:52.347
 We have installed this well in the place where we will drill 

00:00:52.796 --> 00:00:56.050
 Now we will put gloves, to protect us from glass 

00:00:56.075 --> 00:00:59.282
 There are many blades that can be used during the hole in the glass 

00:00:59.307 --> 00:01:04.419
 This diamond tool is very suitable for holes with large diameter 

00:01:04.444 --> 00:01:08.520
 For smaller holes, you can use arrow-shaped blades 

00:01:08.545 --> 00:01:10.421
 We will use this 

00:01:10.446 --> 00:01:14.145
 Before you start drilling you will need some lubricant 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.115
 Paraffin is recommended, though you do not have, enough water 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.302
 I put some paraffin and now I'll do the hole 

00:01:22.327 --> 00:01:27.298
 You have to pierce the medium speed, and whatever happens do not push hard 

00:01:27.323 --> 00:01:29.417
 Otherwise the glass will break 

00:01:29.442 --> 00:01:31.893
 And now never 

00:01:52.417 --> 00:01:55.583
 You can see now that he started punching in the glass 

00:01:55.608 --> 00:01:58.224
 So I will put more lubricant 

00:02:23.208 --> 00:02:25.732
 Now you dig the glass 

00:02:25.757 --> 00:02:29.571
 And we lost all lubricant because it was carried through the hole 

00:02:30.214 --> 00:02:32.468
 You can remove the installer 

00:02:32.493 --> 00:02:35.335
 Turn the glass over 

00:02:40.004 --> 00:02:43.853
 Now start by completing the hole on the other side 

00:03:07.462 --> 00:03:09.454
 Clean it 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.482
 You can clearly see that we have a wonderful hole through that glass piece
