00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
here's the thing about drifting it's not

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.790 
here's the thing about drifting it's not
particularly<00:00:33.750> great<00:00:33.960> because<00:00:34.380> it's<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.590> very

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
particularly great because it's a very

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.250 
particularly great because it's a very

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
about all over the place and sometimes

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.100 
about all over the place and sometimes
can<00:00:38.969> get<00:00:39.059> difficult<00:00:39.270> when<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.780> comes<00:00:39.960> to

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
can get difficult when it comes to

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.959 
can get difficult when it comes to
drifting<00:00:40.559> when<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.219> compare<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.700> the

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
drifting when you compare it to the

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.729 
drifting when you compare it to the
Stinger<00:00:42.450> classic<00:00:42.870> cover<00:00:43.050> but<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:43.410> car<00:00:43.710> is

it very easy for you guys drift out

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.020 
it very easy for you guys drift out
there<00:00:49.860> for<00:00:50.190> those<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.610> struggle<00:00:50.940> to

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
drift normally with the car but this can

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.500 
drift normally with the car but this can
do<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.340> many<00:00:53.520> different<00:00:53.670> maneuvers

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
do so many different maneuvers

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.689

absolutely<00:00:55.199> amazing<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:55.590> anyway<00:00:56.010> surely<00:00:56.610> a

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
absolutely amazing so anyway surely a

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.099 
absolutely amazing so anyway surely a
few<00:00:56.730> examples<00:00:57.270> depth<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.539> handling<00:00:57.989> this

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
few examples depth of handling this

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.660 
few examples depth of handling this
thing<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.379> GT<00:00:58.590> definitely<00:00:59.100> dominates<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
thing the GT definitely dominates the

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
scene when it comes to all sorts of

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.039 
scene when it comes to all sorts of

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
executions of different sort angles and

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.719 
executions of different sort angles and
corners<00:01:04.170> at<00:01:04.470> very<00:01:04.619> high<00:01:04.680> speeds<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.460> will

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
corners at very high speeds you will

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.490 
corners at very high speeds you will
lose<00:01:05.939> minimum<00:01:06.330> speed<00:01:06.570> at<00:01:06.720> sharp<00:01:06.990> corners<00:01:07.350> when

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
lose minimum speed at sharp corners when

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.960 
lose minimum speed at sharp corners when

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
classic you will end up losing a lot of

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.340 
classic you will end up losing a lot of
speed<00:01:11.010> around<00:01:11.220> sharp<00:01:11.670> corners<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.900> know<00:01:13.049> when

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
speed around sharp corners you know when

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.140 
speed around sharp corners you know when
you're<00:01:13.560> when<00:01:14.250> they<00:01:14.340> trying<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.670> go<00:01:14.820> at<00:01:14.970> high

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
you're when they trying to go at high

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.149 
you're when they trying to go at high
speeds<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.720> do<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.380> happen<00:01:16.740> right<00:01:16.920> know

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
speeds and do and that happen right know

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.679 
speeds and do and that happen right know
that<00:01:17.369> handling<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:17.909> very<00:01:17.939> important<00:01:18.479> at<00:01:18.570> those

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
that handling is very important at those

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.300 
that handling is very important at those
kind<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:18.960> situations<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.680> anyway<00:01:20.009> moving<00:01:20.159> on

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
kind of situations so anyway moving on

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.859 
kind of situations so anyway moving on

Wow<00:01:37.110> maybe<00:01:37.619> it's<00:01:37.860> distance<00:01:38.220> yeah<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.549> course

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759

literally made my jaw drop when I tried

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.370 
literally made my jaw drop when I tried

two cars were side by side and I wasn't
even<00:02:18.360> sure<00:02:18.420> what<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.720> hell<00:02:18.840> was<00:02:18.930> happening

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
even sure what the hell was happening

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.720 
even sure what the hell was happening
until<00:02:19.560> this<00:02:20.520> thing<00:02:20.730> of<00:02:20.820> GT<00:02:21.090> took<00:02:21.330> off<00:02:21.510> with<00:02:22.500> its

fastest car you can see evidently is

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.440 
fastest car you can see evidently is
actually<00:02:28.350> distinct<00:02:28.740> GT<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.790> classic<00:02:30.330> you

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
actually distinct GT the classic you

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.960 
actually distinct GT the classic you

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
know short um you know it did show good

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.330 
know short um you know it did show good
sportsmanship<00:02:33.210> it<00:02:34.080> tried<00:02:34.350> its<00:02:34.500> best<00:02:34.770> but<00:02:35.160> it

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
sportsmanship it tried its best but it

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.170 
sportsmanship it tried its best but it
just<00:02:35.490> couldn't<00:02:35.790> do<00:02:35.910> it

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
just couldn't do it

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.790 
just couldn't do it
it<00:02:36.540> was<00:02:36.660> getting<00:02:36.900> pretty<00:02:37.020> close<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:37.470> wasn't

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
it was getting pretty close I wasn't

it was getting pretty close I wasn't
sure<00:02:37.950> you<00:02:38.070> know<00:02:38.190> it's<00:02:38.310> difficult<00:02:38.820> to<00:02:38.940> test<00:02:39.180> it

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
sure you know it's difficult to test it
