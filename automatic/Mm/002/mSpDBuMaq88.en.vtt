00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
that your grow mixture which is one for

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.000 
that your grow mixture which is one for
Bloom<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.350> one<00:01:02.250> that's<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.670> grow<00:01:02.850> formula<00:01:04.010> so

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
Bloom and one that's a grow formula so

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.800 
Bloom and one that's a grow formula so
and<00:01:05.280> then<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.489> get<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.760> little<00:01:06.060> lot<00:01:06.270> this

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
and then you get this little lot this

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.710 
and then you get this little lot this
little<00:01:07.080> contraption<00:01:07.380> here<00:01:07.830> which<00:01:08.720> you

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
little contraption here which you

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.320 
little contraption here which you
basically<00:01:09.900> love<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.470> water<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.210> there's<00:01:12.210> your

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
basically love of water and there's your

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.420 
basically love of water and there's your
aerator<00:01:13.340> inside<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.640> actually<00:01:15.890> it<00:01:16.890> has<00:01:16.920> this

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
aerator inside and actually it has this

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.399 
aerator inside and actually it has this
little<00:01:17.700> lot<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:20.119> guess<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.420> like<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.689> an<00:01:22.020> air

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
little lot I guess this is like a an air

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.140 
little lot I guess this is like a an air
brick<00:01:22.740> or<00:01:22.950> whether<00:01:23.100> they<00:01:23.280> call<00:01:23.490> no<00:01:23.880> they<00:01:24.000> call

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
brick or whether they call no they call

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.480 
brick or whether they call no they call
these<00:01:24.299> things<00:01:24.590> but<00:01:25.590> yeah<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.009> I'm<00:01:26.100> gonna<00:01:26.220> get

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
started with this and just try it out I

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.499 
started with this and just try it out I
don't<00:01:28.110> know<00:01:28.200> I've<00:01:28.350> never<00:01:28.560> grown<00:01:28.740> anything

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
don't know I've never grown anything

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.030 
don't know I've never grown anything
hydroponically<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:30.780> we'll<00:01:31.530> see<00:01:31.680> how<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.890> works

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
hydroponically so we'll see how it works

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.660 
hydroponically so we'll see how it works
and<00:01:34.220> see<00:01:35.220> if<00:01:35.579> it's<00:01:35.880> actually<00:01:36.770> you<00:01:37.770> know<00:01:37.799> what

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
and see if it's actually you know what

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.789 
and see if it's actually you know what
it's<00:01:38.790> all<00:01:38.850> cracked<00:01:39.090> up<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.329> be

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
it's all cracked up to be

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.020 
it's all cracked up to be
so<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:40.829> got<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.610> had<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.119> grill<00:01:42.360> light<00:01:42.570> from

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.469 
so I got I had this grill light from
last<00:01:45.030> year<00:01:45.439> during<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.530> winter<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.490> kept<00:01:48.270> one

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479

last year during the winter I kept one
of<00:01:48.570> my<00:01:48.630> plants<00:01:49.049> inside<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.680> kept<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.640> alive

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
of my plants inside and kept it alive

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.920 
of my plants inside and kept it alive
for<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.590> next<00:01:52.619> year<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.850> ended<00:01:54.119> up<00:01:54.270> doing

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
for the next year and it ended up doing

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.649 
for the next year and it ended up doing
really<00:01:55.049> well<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.979> have<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:56.670> just<00:01:57.329> grow

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659

then<00:02:11.019> grow<00:02:11.290> a<00:02:11.319> little<00:02:11.560> bit<00:02:11.769> and<00:02:12.010> then<00:02:12.280> we're

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
then grow a little bit and then we're

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.309 
then grow a little bit and then we're
gonna<00:02:12.579> transplant<00:02:13.120> them<00:02:13.329> into<00:02:13.599> the<00:02:13.720> into<00:02:14.230> the

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
gonna transplant them into the into the

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.280 
gonna transplant them into the into the
system<00:02:14.349> here<00:02:15.720> basically<00:02:16.720> I<00:02:16.750> already<00:02:17.019> got<00:02:17.110> the

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
system here basically I already got the

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.319 
system here basically I already got the
nutrients<00:02:17.860> set<00:02:18.040> up<00:02:18.159> in<00:02:18.310> here<00:02:18.670> so<00:02:19.120> I'm<00:02:19.209> gonna

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:19.329 
nutrients set up in here so I'm gonna

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:21.420 
nutrients set up in here so I'm gonna
leave<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.540> pump<00:02:20.260> on<00:02:20.500> that's<00:02:20.860> off<00:02:21.010> right<00:02:21.250> now

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
leave the pump on that's off right now

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.720 
leave the pump on that's off right now
but<00:02:22.030> I<00:02:22.329> need<00:02:22.629> to<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:23.530> grow<00:02:23.739> nutrient<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:24.549> then

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
but I need to the grow nutrient and then

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.929 
but I need to the grow nutrient and then
I<00:02:24.819> soaked<00:02:25.349> this<00:02:26.349> in<00:02:26.560> there<00:02:26.829> and<00:02:27.129> then<00:02:27.819> we're

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:27.939 
I soaked this in there and then we're

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.640 
I soaked this in there and then we're
gonna<00:02:28.030> start<00:02:28.299> seeds<00:02:28.569> in<00:02:28.780> here<00:02:28.810> once<00:02:29.349> they<00:02:29.470> get

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
gonna start seeds in here once they get

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.559 
gonna start seeds in here once they get
kind<00:02:30.340> of<00:02:30.400> growing<00:02:30.609> we'll<00:02:30.909> transplant<00:02:31.450> them

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
kind of growing we'll transplant them

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.179 
kind of growing we'll transplant them
into<00:02:31.629> this<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.290> then<00:02:32.590> we<00:02:32.680> should<00:02:32.739> be<00:02:32.980> good<00:02:33.129> to

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:33.189 
into this and then we should be good to

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:34.520 
into this and then we should be good to
go

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
go

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.819 
go
all<00:02:35.530> right<00:02:35.799> so<00:02:36.239> we<00:02:37.239> started<00:02:37.810> we'll<00:02:38.109> see<00:02:38.379> I'll

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
all right so we started we'll see I'll

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.270 
all right so we started we'll see I'll
do<00:02:38.980> a<00:02:39.010> update<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:40.799> kind<00:02:41.799> of<00:02:41.890> keep<00:02:42.040> you<00:02:42.159> up<00:02:42.250> to

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
do a update and kind of keep you up to

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.530 
do a update and kind of keep you up to
date<00:02:42.430> on<00:02:42.609> how<00:02:43.389> it's<00:02:43.629> going<00:02:45.420> should<00:02:46.420> be

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
date on how it's going should be

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.360 
date on how it's going should be
interesting<00:02:47.079> I've<00:02:47.260> never<00:02:47.500> gone<00:02:47.799> anything

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
interesting I've never gone anything

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.990 
interesting I've never gone anything
hydroponically<00:02:49.299> so<00:02:49.690> we<00:02:50.470> will<00:02:50.620> see<00:02:50.879> we<00:02:51.879> are

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
hydroponically so we will see we are

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.190 
hydroponically so we will see we are
growing<00:02:52.239> winter<00:02:52.690> lettuce<00:02:53.139> so<00:02:54.810> once<00:02:55.810> I<00:02:55.900> get<00:02:55.959> it

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
growing winter lettuce so once I get it

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.710 
growing winter lettuce so once I get it
going<00:02:56.530> good<00:02:56.829> I<00:02:57.220> can<00:02:57.609> either<00:02:57.909> leave<00:02:58.180> it<00:02:58.299> in<00:02:58.450> here

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
going good I can either leave it in here

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.110 
going good I can either leave it in here
take<00:02:59.349> it<00:02:59.470> out<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.799> the<00:02:59.950> greenhouse<00:03:00.370> and<00:03:00.849> let<00:03:01.000> it

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
take it out to the greenhouse and let it

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.979 
take it out to the greenhouse and let it
grow<00:03:02.099> so<00:03:03.099> I'd<00:03:03.189> like<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:03.489> get<00:03:03.760> like<00:03:03.819> two<00:03:04.720> setups

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
grow so I'd like to get like two setups

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.550 
grow so I'd like to get like two setups
like<00:03:05.200> this<00:03:05.560> for<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.430> greenhouse<00:03:06.849> and<00:03:07.439> let<00:03:08.439> it

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
like this for the greenhouse and let it

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:18.500 
like this for the greenhouse and let it
roll<00:03:08.709> that<00:03:08.950> way<00:03:09.159> I<00:03:10.109> haven't<00:03:11.109> you<00:03:11.200> guys<00:03:11.319> take<00:03:11.590> it

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.569
