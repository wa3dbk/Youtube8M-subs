00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
a design class and start out because we

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.810 
a design class and start out because we
were<00:00:19.080> kind<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.350> inspired<00:00:19.770> by<00:00:20.010> calfee<00:00:20.520> design

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
were kind of inspired by calfee design

were kind of inspired by calfee design
out<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.150> California<00:00:21.740> we<00:00:22.740> made<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:22.949> bamboo<00:00:23.519> bike

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
out of California we made a bamboo bike

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.670 
out of California we made a bamboo bike
and<00:00:24.029> it's<00:00:24.449> actually<00:00:24.660> still<00:00:25.050> being<00:00:25.289> ridden<00:00:25.560> in

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
and it's actually still being ridden in

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.220 
and it's actually still being ridden in
Manhattan<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.310> then<00:00:27.240> we<00:00:27.900> got<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.080> little

specialize in bamboo think his quote was
like<00:00:45.300> I'm<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.539> bamboo<00:00:45.989> master

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.190 

it's<00:00:52.100> about<00:00:52.280> seventy<00:00:52.820> percent<00:00:52.940> bamboo<00:00:53.570> by

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
it's about seventy percent bamboo by

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.160 
it's about seventy percent bamboo by
weight<00:00:54.470> so<00:00:55.390> you<00:00:56.390> know<00:00:56.480> everyone's<00:00:56.809> like<00:00:56.989> well

what about hold of carbon and all the
metal<00:00:59.270> and<00:00:59.420> all<00:00:59.540> this<00:00:59.720> and<00:00:59.989> I'm<00:01:00.079> like<00:01:00.260> you<00:01:00.410> know

metal and all this and I'm like you know

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.830 
metal and all this and I'm like you know
I'm<00:01:01.070> not<00:01:01.220> promoting<00:01:01.460> it<00:01:01.730> as<00:01:02.000> a<00:01:02.030> green<00:01:02.390> product

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
I'm not promoting it as a green product

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.219 
I'm not promoting it as a green product
like<00:01:03.290> I<00:01:03.670> don't<00:01:04.670> think<00:01:04.940> you<00:01:05.869> need<00:01:06.020> to<00:01:06.050> be

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
like I don't think you need to be

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:07.930 
like I don't think you need to be
convinced<00:01:06.500> it's<00:01:06.920> green<00:01:07.250> I<00:01:07.280> think<00:01:07.729> that<00:01:07.910> just

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
convinced it's green I think that just

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.010 
convinced it's green I think that just
riding<00:01:08.509> your<00:01:08.600> bike<00:01:08.840> is<00:01:09.110> green<00:01:09.410> anyway<00:01:09.830> so<00:01:11.020> but

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
riding your bike is green anyway so but

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.540 
riding your bike is green anyway so but
yeah<00:01:12.200> if<00:01:12.440> you<00:01:12.680> want<00:01:12.860> to<00:01:12.950> think<00:01:13.130> of<00:01:13.250> it<00:01:13.310> that<00:01:13.369> way

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
yeah if you want to think of it that way

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.120 
yeah if you want to think of it that way
it<00:01:13.909> definitely<00:01:14.420> bike<00:01:14.869> is<00:01:15.110> much<00:01:15.409> smoother<00:01:15.950> than

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
it definitely bike is much smoother than

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.340 
it definitely bike is much smoother than
any<00:01:16.369> bike<00:01:16.610> I've<00:01:16.820> ever<00:01:16.850> written<00:01:17.270> I've<00:01:17.960> been<00:01:18.200> on

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
any bike I've ever written I've been on

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.719 
any bike I've ever written I've been on
BMC<00:01:18.920> time<00:01:19.490> cervelo<00:01:20.409> giant<00:01:21.409> and<00:01:21.560> their<00:01:22.520> top

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
BMC time cervelo giant and their top

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.080 
BMC time cervelo giant and their top
model<00:01:23.149> and<00:01:24.039> this<00:01:25.039> is<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:25.399> best<00:01:25.550> handling

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
model and this is the best handling

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.050 
model and this is the best handling
smoothest<00:01:26.600> bike<00:01:26.960> I've<00:01:27.170> ever<00:01:27.200> used<00:01:27.700> so<00:01:28.700> it's

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
smoothest bike I've ever used so it's

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.719 
smoothest bike I've ever used so it's
not<00:01:29.720> as<00:01:29.960> stiff<00:01:30.229> as<00:01:30.410> the<00:01:30.649> top<00:01:30.860> end<00:01:31.070> carbon<00:01:31.490> bikes

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
not as stiff as the top end carbon bikes

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.969 
not as stiff as the top end carbon bikes
it's<00:01:32.060> not<00:01:32.660> as<00:01:32.810> light<00:01:33.050> but<00:01:33.619> it's<00:01:33.770> very

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
it's not as light but it's very

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.430 
it's not as light but it's very
comparable<00:01:34.520> on<00:01:34.850> both<00:01:35.060> of<00:01:35.090> those<00:01:35.390> but<00:01:36.289> it's

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
comparable on both of those but it's

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.160 
comparable on both of those but it's
really<00:01:36.649> more<00:01:36.920> durable<00:01:37.340> and<00:01:37.550> much<00:01:38.000> smoother<00:01:38.450> so

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
really more durable and much smoother so

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.320 
really more durable and much smoother so
it's<00:01:39.920> it's<00:01:40.280> an<00:01:40.429> investment<00:01:40.670> it's<00:01:41.149> not

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
it's it's an investment it's not

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.389 
it's it's an investment it's not
something<00:01:41.750> that's<00:01:41.899> going<00:01:41.990> to<00:01:42.229> break<00:01:42.440> you<00:01:43.310> know

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
something that's going to break you know

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.570 
something that's going to break you know
if<00:01:43.520> you<00:01:43.640> crash<00:01:43.880> it<00:01:44.149> it's<00:01:44.840> really<00:01:45.320> a<00:01:45.920> piece<00:01:46.550> of

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
if you crash it it's really a piece of

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.130 
if you crash it it's really a piece of
art<00:01:46.940> that<00:01:47.000> you<00:01:47.179> can<00:01:47.330> hang<00:01:47.509> on<00:01:47.600> your<00:01:47.630> wall<00:01:47.899> but

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
art that you can hang on your wall but

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.400 
art that you can hang on your wall but
