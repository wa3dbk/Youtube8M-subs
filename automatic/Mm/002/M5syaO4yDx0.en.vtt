00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.659
 I do not know why everyone gets so complicated 

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.659
 life cooking 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:17.250
 and so good in the theme of the week is 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.259
 cook something I put it on the topic well without 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.980
 be asked during the days 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:25.160
 past I did not choose the themes and I liked it 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.710
 the most 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.960
 what I'm in my kitchen and what we're going 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.870
 to learn to prepare today is a bread that 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.660
 apple is super rich are you and 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.540
 foundling and you only need four 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.160
 ingredients and your oven the first thing that 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.410
 let's do is preheat our 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.510
 200 degree centigrade oven since 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.330
 Preheat this your oven to 200 degrees 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.680
 centigrade you need a bowl or a place 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.680
 where you can mix things 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.990
 you also need three eggs 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.620
 but 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:07.060
 three eggs or that the first thing that you have to 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:09.880
 do is put the three eggs and 3 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:14.009
 and the half cup of sugar 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.009
 and this we are going to beat with a blender 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.939
 ok after about two 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:26.060
 minutes this is how you will see what follows 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:29.390
 is to incorporate little by little into the 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.520
 flour but you have to put a little 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.649
 and we're going to beat it with a spatula with 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.229
 a spoon ok we are not going to occupy the 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:39.649
 blender it is important that this is done 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:42.020
 I walk with my hand and I like that without 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.000
 blender I do not know why that's the way 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.600
 recipe and then it always looks good 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.600
 doing 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.730
 Of flour 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.460
 this is the consistency that should 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.660
 have our mix ok now we're going to 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.660
 add the apples 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.990
 and we beat a little 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.790
 remember that while doing all this 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.249
 our oven is preheating to 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.840
 200 degrees ok let's grab the mold 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:20.329
 where are you going to put sponge cake on and go to 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.400
 Take a little butter and you're going 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:24.400
 to smear everywhere ok 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.530
 because since you put butter 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.530
 on all sides 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:39.490
 we are going to put a little flour 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.100
 here and you're going to grab your mold and you're going to 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.380
 paste and you will scatter everywhere 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.270
 of the urine ok since it's like this already 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.780
 we can empty our mix of our 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.780
 mold ok 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.760
 and that's it, now we're going to take it to 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.380
 oven for 20 minutes at 200 degrees and 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.930
 after 20 minutes we are going to lower the 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.580
 temperature at 180 degrees centigrade and 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.950
 let's cook until it is doubled 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.380
 complete the top part and ready this 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.080
 is the nice result is like 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.380
 crispy on top but fluffy 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.750
 I'm going to cut a little bit so they can see 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.820
 how is it inside sponge cake with a 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.820
 pancake though 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.830
 what 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.050
 see how it is if it is left is like super 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.569
 spongy and I do not know if they see there 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.459
 small pieces of apple and we know rich 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.920
 because that tastes crispy and inside 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:42.099
 it's super soft then that was 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.019
 everything is a very simple bread to make 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:48.640
 As you saw, life is not complicated 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:50.650
 in the kitchen and better watch my videos and 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.540
 well that was my recipe cortita 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.519
 short and super easy here in the central 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.260
 give me tell me if you liked it that way 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:01.049
