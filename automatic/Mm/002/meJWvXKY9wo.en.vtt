00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello guys well found in this 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.990
 new video by iphoneitalia.com 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.940
 today I have two covers of the 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.570
 same family of cable technologies 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.150
 they are the ultra-durable covers made 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.470
 to protect our iphone really 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.400
 in any situation 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.400
 let's find out together 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.739
 yes yes guys these are the strong 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:38.800
 keys of cable technologies are 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.379
 new cases for iphone 6 and also for 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.210
 iphone 6 plus designed to protect 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.610
 at best our device 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.739
 protection with strong cases 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.320
 assured because they are thin 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.840
 enveloping and fully functional 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.089
 right at the technical level that is the cover 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.489
 works well even in the event of a fall 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.420
 I could sadly try it with the 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.339
 my iphone 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.809
 regarding access to the doors 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:03.190
 clearly these are left 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.989
 all free in the lower part 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.530
 we don't even have our own 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.960
 full coverage in the two custodians 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.240
 the situation is practically identical 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.000
 the power button is instead protected by 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.340
 a junta in plastic the same speech 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.920
 for the plus and minus volume keys while 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.080
 the vibration button remains instead 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.640
 discovered and this maybe a little against 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.350
 because the case is still a bit 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.049
 deep and difficult to be able to 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.240
 bloom from silent mode to 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.799
 sound mode with regard to the 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.439
 camera comes instead is kept in 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:38.619
 considering the ledge we have 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:40.659
 on iphone 6 with 6 plus and indeed not there 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.429
 are problems during both use 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.439
 of the camera of both flash and in 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:48.189
 many cases as we know go to create 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.689
 also of the bad shades of its own 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.340
 light so instead in this case I have 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.810
 tried there is no problem a 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.100
 design level clearly the 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.219
 cases do not give the best of them 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.229
 why not they are not made to be 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:00.369
 beautiful are made to be 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.590
 resistant 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.109
 the all black model all in plastic 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.869
 black if you want is maybe less 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:10.179
 elegant because you notice the most 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.800
 difference once made to wear the 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.770
 custody life ie you notice this 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.990
 small piece or plastic on the back nice 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.240
 often beautiful evident while the other 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.430
 aluminum case if we want 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.300
 with colors very similar to those 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.760
 iPhone's 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.130
 there may be no such effect 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.610
 negative on design like the other if 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.740
 we want 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.569
 in any case, these guys are custodians 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.370
 made to resist yours 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.260
 iphone really any kind of shock 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.260
 fall clearly hoping that not 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.340
