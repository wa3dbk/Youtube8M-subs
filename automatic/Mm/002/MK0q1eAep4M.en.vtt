00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.799
 Hello friends of mine today 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.469
 I bring this makeup that is very 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:15.960
 simple to do and can occupy it 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.840
 to put it daily 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.020
 and start applying a base of shadows 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.550
 skin color on the upper eyelid e 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.759
 lower and blur it until you have a 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.720
 surface completely smooth and what 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:36.600
 Follow with a shade of skin color to 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.680
 make it even smoother for the application 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.680
 of the shadows 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.450
 then I took a shade of brown 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.120
 dark matt which is what he used to 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:53.220
 eyebrows and apply it with a brush 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:57.530
 flat around the eye and I drew a c 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:00.750
 inverted or a moon to say it so 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.000
 it will reach half of the eye as much 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.150
 in the upper part as in the part 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.150
 lower 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:21.250
 then I took a brush to blur and what 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:24.640
 use to eliminate any line 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.740
 strong you have on that moon that 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.650
 we draw and I will blur it 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:34.120
 perfectly then I took a shadow from 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:36.820
 white color and use it to illuminate 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:41.260
 the eyebrow bone this is going to give us 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:44.940
 a wider dimension of the eye 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:50.320
 then I took a shade of copper color 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:53.300
 of salinger and I used it to apply it 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.560
 in the center of the eyelid 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.600
 and this is going to be to give a tonality between 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.950
 Copper and the red that will melt with 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.200
 the coffee 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.409
 then I took a shade of color 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:10.009
 champagne that looks pretty golden and 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:14.060
 take a little to light up the tear 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.069
 I will degrade the color until it is integrated 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.180
 both with the coffee below and with the 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.769
 copper from above 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:25.530
 then I took a brush moistened with 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:28.049
 matte black shade and use 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.939
 to delineate the upper lashes of 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:36.409
 way very very diffuse taps and this 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:41.310
 will only give us an outline 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:44.730
 soft but pronounced after and for 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.090
 last apply mascara on the 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:51.599
 lower and upper part of 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:55.769
 tabs the number of layers that that 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.930
 I occupied two or three is to your liking and 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.849
 this is the final result I hope that 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.849

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.599

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:18.390

 what the degradation of coffee looks like 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.080
 the copper and getting to the champagne that you see 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.570
 more golden 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.940
