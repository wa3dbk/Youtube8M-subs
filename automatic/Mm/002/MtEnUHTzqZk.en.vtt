00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Then we come to Nordderby 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.819
 hansa rostock vs werder bremen 2 it 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.160
 was very close last season only 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.740
 hansa saved herself on the last day of the match 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.990
 thanks to the protection of the erfurter the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.660
 unterhaching 1 to 0 thus defeated the 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.100
 Bavaria shot in the fourth league 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.859
 Rostock's defeat in Dresden was with it 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.289
 without luck and after this 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.810
 everything should be better this season 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.519
 also because the new investor the 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.859
 then millions of debts of the club 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.269
 takes over as announced in the squad 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.730
 However, little money was put 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.550
 Nevertheless, there were many new faces alex 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.230
 cooper on him friends here 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.910
 especially the longtime rostocker 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.890
 tobias jänicke is in after three years 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.050
 dresden and wiesbaden back in rostock 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.300
 and may his fc hansa as new 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.620
 captain on the field he should lead 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.870
 He wants to take responsibility 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.930
 assume responsibility and that shows 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.460
 he drives jesaja jaenicke from the beginning 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.770
 the ball and pulls the other new access 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.149
 he even gives that back to jaenicke and 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.559
 the one with the huge possibility for 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.620
 early 1 0 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.850
 Jaenicke misses the absolute dream 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.470
 Comeback just barely 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.060
 the newcomers from bremen needed one 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.010
 scarce half an hour around for the first time 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.590
 to become dangerous 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.909
 then co- balance everyone tries out 16 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.119
 few are missing 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.950
 centimeter to 10 0 balance key already has 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.070
 Bundesliga played for a boy 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.590
 with potential for higher werders 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.119
 against gladbach 2 after extension 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.880
 ascended further on the pusher already 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.619
 comes out completely unmotivated and helps 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.439
 tries the art shot puts the 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.740
 art bullet to the latte cross subsequent payment 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.860
 from novarra the second time really lucky 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.400
 the second time alu luck for hansa 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.400
 Rostock 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.130
 coach karsten baumann with seven 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.400
 new arrivals in the start formation with 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.530
 from zero to zero until here 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.050
 but served his boys against it 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.120
 40 minutes played group plays 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.430
 suddenly the dream pass on jaenicke the 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.910
 is free by comes to fall and gets 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.700
 The eleven- meter referee thorben 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.350
 Siewer shows Oelschlegel yellow card 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.150
 a hard but correct decision 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.140
 Jaenicke wants the elfmeter but will 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.910
 easily hit 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.220
 you can give that and 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.110
 standard situations and eleven meters are 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.070
 at hansa rostock a thing for 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.870
 christian bickel bickel for 1 0 for 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.630
 Hansa Rostock 41 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.440
 minute christian bickel last year 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:35.370
 best template now ice cold to 1 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.370
 0 for hansa 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.750
 relief in rostock and one 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.530
 happy half-time tour in front of the eyes 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.940
 by hansa noble-fan materia purely in the 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.640
 second half and that starts similarly 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.650
 as turbulent as the first has stopped there 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.150
 that goes through and the schlitzohr wants 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.920
 Just put the ball in the short corner 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.920
 push the whole world expects the 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.330
 Gardawski we do not enter 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.540
 ball on the post hansas 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.720
 hit in the ranking three 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.180
 minutes later hanser gets the ball 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.319
 not away there is a grill player post 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.569
 This time it's leveling out one to one 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.129
 57 minutes grillitsch this has me in 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.769
 This year already with the professionals in the 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:22.200
 Training camp trained hereby would be 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.640
 the third time u hit this time with 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.660
 happy end hansa shocked hansa 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.340
 unfocused just three minutes later 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.569
 the hosts run in the counterattacks 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.750
 substitutes are available before shoes 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:42.410
 leaves no possibility for defense 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.410
 21 and shock in the baltic sea stadium 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.160
 now the short corner offers, says thank you 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.840
 hansa has the last such season like this 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.940
 just survived now threatens the 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.430
 defeat against the riser 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.060
 but then again hansa rostock the 780th 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.290
 minute and she guessed it had again 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.870
 incredibly unbelievable 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.630
 shortly before closing , the highest rises 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.700
 meets again only aluminum unfortunate 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.470
 defeat for hansa rostock thorsten 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:17.130
 Rhein can with a bruised 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:21.010
 returnees yes I'm at a loss 2 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.080
 standard what can happen and easy 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.659
 badly defend and 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.060
 there we have to analyze well because that 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:29.680
 may not happen like that 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.780
 Hanging heads in rostock hansa and 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.090
 tobias jänicke start with decent 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.659
 performance but with zero points in the 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.889
 season 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:37.889
