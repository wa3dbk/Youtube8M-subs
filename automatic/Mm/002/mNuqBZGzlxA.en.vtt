 redness of the cheeks on 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.100
 all possible changes of 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.220
 temperature and exposure very 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.140
 prolonged to heat apart are used 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.630

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.159
 antibiotics that are used as 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.409
 unique treatment in 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.210
 very mild cases and in treatment 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:29.109
 combined in cases that are a bit more 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.390
 Severe oral treatment consists of 

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:33.909
 especially in antibiotics and also 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.829
 isotretinoin can be used which is the 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.229
 same medication that is used for the 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:41.799
 acne although in the case of rosacea is 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.899
 somewhat less effective there may be these two 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.840
 things both the topical treatment as 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:49.240
 oral treatment help improve the 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.009
 inflammatory lesions the granites but 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.109
 do not affect the redness of the 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.420
 cheeks this redness there is that

 treat it later you have to treat it with 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.329
 applying laser usually tend to need 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:04.149
 two or three sessions and it is advised not 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:06.310
 do it in summer and after 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.610
 treatment is very important that the 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.950
 patient does not avoid exposure to heat 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.230
 or sudden temperature changes because 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.239
 if not, even if it looks like it's cured 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.629
 could reappear some of the
