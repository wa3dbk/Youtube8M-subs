guys let's talk about the designing
field<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:53.579> as<00:00:53.789> expected<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.690> does<00:00:54.960> have<00:00:55.140> a

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
field so as expected it does have a

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.830 
field so as expected it does have a
plastic<00:00:55.410> it's<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.070> polycarbonate<00:00:56.640> plastic<00:00:57.180> so

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
plastic it's a polycarbonate plastic so

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.470 
plastic it's a polycarbonate plastic so

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
as many parts have been reduced to make

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.630 
as many parts have been reduced to make
the<00:01:00.690> plastic<00:01:01.230> fit<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.680> just<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.309> look<00:01:02.430> good
