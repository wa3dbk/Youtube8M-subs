00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.800
 Greeks would have been faltering again 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.560
 but I'll tell I'm in the drugstore he recommends the blanket 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.980
 «Today I have searched and found other interests assortment 

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:17.359
 Now I have also slammed at Redcoon Furniture Wittstocker one 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:18.800
 this is a market 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.200
 this shows i believe 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.749
 a year or so did not touch 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:26.939
 simply because my first experiences with it would not be so positive 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.019
 At that time I believe that Kramer USD 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.120
 and around and the chancellor 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.530
 and I was not very excited about both things 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.020
 That's why I left first 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.390
 Aabar came out of this on Stella today and I thought so 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.659
 Actually you have to come through again 

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:48.770
 a major drawback with LPR would have honestly high 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.200
 I like this 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.110
 nothing i believe that smells like forecast i dont hit me 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.530
 to drop him 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.160
 the not in sight does not like the smell and I think that will be synonymous 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.600
 The big thing is the use of these products 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.010
 really now it is first what I bought 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.010
 Wants to promote 50 years better 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.610
 which it was after my g2 raise 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.430
 the two elevator into overtime had written the work will too 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.600
 has moved a lot 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.000
 and then she really wanted to try it, "she says 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.150
 People also wear 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.890
 and I have to honestly admit the ACE 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.920
 the first impression AP this is not better than that of 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.390
 p2 and gratitude and watermelon Stuke around 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.020
 then I also bought a building and that is totally cool and think 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.940
 I can already do that a success 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.430
 if you see now then 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.050
 the broken go 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.160
 Comedian has when you sit inside then get the go 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.490
 and that is a mechanic, frankly 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.470
 the consumption would not have expected 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.510
 I thought it was guaranteed that way 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.610
 at the tables both at the same time gets or son but he has 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.030
 already mastered 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.470
 after that, choose the bottle that came earlier 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.889
 that's not stuck on 

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.299
 The ear 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.590
 Winston shutter speed and it came thereby world-wide in her childhood 

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:17.209
 I do not sink into myself either 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.169
 Erkrath sang an index finger 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:23.169
 and above it percent 

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:25.170
 that was the trend 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.219
 the certificated come means can use 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:31.259
 Percent had last in Hamburg also lies at night I have to say 

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:33.659
 I already like it very much 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:37.489
 then I took the camouflage because everyone said that would be one 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.939
 you can play really well 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:44.169
 and I do not have it any complacency a largely coach Christian Gross 

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:47.620
 I also heard that was also the number six 1 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:51.709
 percent 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.319
 because the leash 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.549
 the white-tailed eagle as they are in the new packaging i dont know how new this one 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.929
 Packaging is obviously not going to turn me off 

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:02.319
 Obama 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.359
 I know that 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.579
 which you actually part of a once again been revised because many people 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.799
 criticized they would have dried up like a stiller or even the 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.189
 Packaging has not closed properly 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:15.840
 You can not quite get this packaging 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.109
 that's adidas 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.129
 can see there 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:22.819
 That and Planus I have the feeling you get it is not completely understood 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.819
 she is completely back 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:29.349
 percent 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.359
 That's how he looks from September 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.709
 used and it really is 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.380
 this is the first in the target a unified meeting of the ISU 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.759
 here it is 

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:43.189
 This really shows how the Licher offered to buy the right empty 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.009
 the clou that's okay 

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:49.319
 I never liked Bobby Brown's warmth 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.680
 For the first time since a year in a daycare the scanners you can really quite 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.469
 wants to work precisely 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:57.589
 That's why I want to think I've already made mistakes for him 

00:03:57.589 --> 00:04:01.709
 Altingen Christin Schene does not work this way is called the inner Bobby Brown came 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.159
 rarely do I find much better 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.739
 clear that the price also confirmed serious 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.909
 so if you do not have one then you can take it with you percent that stuff is 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:12.209
 really 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.229
 Really how do I go have to say I find the nettles false alarm turned out to be 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.019
 Animation work with it 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.780
 simply because they are consistent 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.669
 to 10 little suspected 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.539
 Liquid is 2 of the Circus AK for themselves 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:26.409
 APA 

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:31.439
 you could wear it well too pounds I would watch it so what 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:32.979
 I think I can explain 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:34.990
 Although the block has passed 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.740
 in the next 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.280
 Weeks of space next two weeks or so I would still have things to test and 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.580
 I would have to write Antje Taufenbach poster 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.800
 In any case, the line compelling a kind 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.800
 deceptive percent Tian 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.729
 So personally, I am still very relaxed, I do not know if I am 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:54.360
 absolutely wants to make a video or will 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.460
 let's see 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.849
 but definitely for Medias 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:00.849
 so on the block and easier because firstly 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.379
 me stop this gear stays addressed part is pick up week 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.270
 not on but on 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.379
 the rest quite bizarre sometimes looks important I come out 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:17.819
 and then in sunlight he has so climbed 4 the impact 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:21.729
 and suddenly totally excited was therefore too correct as I says in the 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:22.669
 load 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:26.499
 but I have to say honestly Sunlight I like Lavender and Frieda 

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:27.469
 and so 

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:28.819
 not at all 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:32.219
 and I have to look and really see this 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:35.219
 the person is on the rent 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:40.189
 OK and then there were also nine food rations that means I mean 

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:42.930
 believe that criticism is Gogol and that 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.100
 To day the number of vehicles that is a really properly warm do 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.620
 I scharinger 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.360
 the hall bit like a good one that I already had that the pop star 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.070
 let me take a record now 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.449
 So do not be surprised if their handy 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:04.099
 same skin fat in the same hairstyle same complains the same again 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:08.710
 Band widths Dieter Münch bring and dance opens on the PS level and that 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:09.380
 it is not like this
