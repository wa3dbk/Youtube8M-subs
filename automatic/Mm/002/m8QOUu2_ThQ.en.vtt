00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:07.580 
today I'm going to show you how to tie

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.270 
today I'm going to show you how to tie
your<00:00:07.609> shoes<00:00:08.020> so<00:00:09.020> I'm<00:00:09.559> gonna<00:00:09.710> run<00:00:09.920> this<00:00:10.070> on<00:00:10.250> a

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280 
your shoes so I'm gonna run this on a

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.890 
your shoes so I'm gonna run this on a
continuous<00:00:10.910> loop<00:00:11.120> so<00:00:11.420> that<00:00:11.450> you<00:00:11.629> don't<00:00:11.780> have

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
continuous loop so that you don't have

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.589 
continuous loop so that you don't have
to<00:00:12.080> stop<00:00:12.320> and<00:00:12.559> restart<00:00:12.790> but<00:00:13.790> to<00:00:13.910> start<00:00:14.210> you're

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:14.599 
to stop and restart but to start you're

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.109 
to stop and restart but to start you're
gonna<00:00:14.690> cross<00:00:15.080> over<00:00:15.320> here<00:00:15.650> to<00:00:15.920> your<00:00:16.610> two<00:00:16.849> shoe

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
gonna cross over here to your two shoe

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.070 
gonna cross over here to your two shoe
strings<00:00:18.460> you're<00:00:19.460> gonna<00:00:19.610> take<00:00:19.939> one<00:00:20.840> shoe

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
strings you're gonna take one shoe

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.609 
strings you're gonna take one shoe
string<00:00:21.380> under<00:00:21.770> the<00:00:21.890> bridge<00:00:22.130> and<00:00:23.470> then<00:00:24.470> you're

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
string under the bridge and then you're

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.089 
string under the bridge and then you're
gonna<00:00:24.710> pull<00:00:25.070> these<00:00:25.250> tight<00:00:26.199> now<00:00:27.199> create<00:00:27.800> a<00:00:27.859> loop

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
gonna pull these tight now create a loop

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.220 
gonna pull these tight now create a loop
on<00:00:28.279> one<00:00:28.519> side<00:00:29.769> just<00:00:30.769> like<00:00:30.949> that<00:00:32.019> take<00:00:33.019> your

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
on one side just like that take your

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.840 
on one side just like that take your
other<00:00:33.320> string<00:00:33.940> go<00:00:34.940> around<00:00:35.480> and<00:00:36.489> then<00:00:37.489> under

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
other string go around and then under

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.979 
other string go around and then under
this<00:00:38.000> bridge<00:00:38.299> with<00:00:38.690> another<00:00:38.989> loop<00:00:40.750> pinch<00:00:41.750> it

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
this bridge with another loop pinch it

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:43.660 
this bridge with another loop pinch it
and<00:00:42.379> pull<00:00:43.220> it<00:00:43.370> through

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
and pull it through

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.660 
and pull it through
and<00:00:44.290> that's<00:00:45.290> how<00:00:45.470> you<00:00:45.530> tie<00:00:46.309> your<00:00:46.519> shoe<00:00:48.670> cross

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
and that's how you tie your shoe cross

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.039 
and that's how you tie your shoe cross
over<00:00:50.089> here<00:00:50.180> to<00:00:50.510> your<00:00:51.170> two<00:00:51.440> shoe<00:00:51.710> strings

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:53.049 
over here to your two shoe strings

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:56.350 
over here to your two shoe strings
you're<00:00:54.049> gonna<00:00:54.199> take<00:00:54.530> one<00:00:55.430> shoe<00:00:55.670> string<00:00:55.970> under

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
you're gonna take one shoe string under

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.619 
you're gonna take one shoe string under
the<00:00:56.479> bridge<00:00:57.010> and<00:00:58.059> then<00:00:59.059> you're<00:00:59.210> gonna<00:00:59.299> pull

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
the bridge and then you're gonna pull

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.100 
the bridge and then you're gonna pull

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
these tight now create a loop on one

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.899 
these tight now create a loop on one
side<00:01:03.409> just<00:01:04.540> like<00:01:05.540> that<00:01:06.610> take<00:01:07.610> your<00:01:07.760> other

then<00:06:10.250> you're<00:06:10.430> going<00:06:10.520> to<00:06:10.580> pull<00:06:10.849> these<00:06:11.030> tight

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:11.979 
then you're going to pull these tight

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:16.719 
then you're going to pull these tight
now<00:06:12.979> create<00:06:13.610> a<00:06:13.639> loop<00:06:13.910> on<00:06:14.090> one<00:06:14.300> side<00:06:14.599> just<00:06:15.729> like

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:16.729 
now create a loop on one side just like

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:21.279 
now create a loop on one side just like
that<00:06:17.800> take<00:06:18.800> your<00:06:19.010> other<00:06:19.130> string<00:06:19.720> go<00:06:20.720> around

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:21.289 
that take your other string go around

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:24.760 
that take your other string go around
and<00:06:22.270> then<00:06:23.270> under<00:06:23.630> this<00:06:23.780> bridge<00:06:24.110> with<00:06:24.470> another

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
and then under this bridge with another

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:30.060 
and then under this bridge with another
loop<00:06:26.560> pinch<00:06:27.560> it<00:06:27.770> and<00:06:28.070> pull<00:06:29.030> it<00:06:29.150> through<00:06:29.180> and

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:30.070 
loop pinch it and pull it through and

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.860 
loop pinch it and pull it through and
that's<00:06:31.070> how<00:06:31.250> you<00:06:31.340> tie<00:06:32.090> your<00:06:32.300> shoe

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.850 

crossover<00:06:35.870> your<00:06:36.050> to<00:06:36.319> your<00:06:36.979> to<00:06:37.249> shoestrings

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 
crossover your to your to shoestrings

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.739 
crossover your to your to shoestrings
you're<00:06:39.860> going<00:06:40.009> to<00:06:40.069> take<00:06:40.339> one<00:06:41.240> shoestring

00:06:41.739 --> 00:06:41.749 
you're going to take one shoestring

00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:45.100 
you're going to take one shoestring
under<00:06:42.169> the<00:06:42.289> bridge<00:06:42.529> and<00:06:43.870> then<00:06:44.870> you're<00:06:45.020> gonna

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110 
under the bridge and then you're gonna

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.700 
under the bridge and then you're gonna
pull<00:06:45.439> these<00:06:45.650> tight<00:06:46.599> now<00:06:47.599> create<00:06:48.199> a<00:06:48.259> loop<00:06:48.499> on

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:48.710 
pull these tight now create a loop on

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:53.709 
pull these tight now create a loop on
one<00:06:48.919> side<00:06:50.169> just<00:06:51.169> like<00:06:51.349> that<00:06:52.419> take<00:06:53.419> your<00:06:53.599> other

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 
string go around and then under this

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.610 
string go around and then under this
bridge<00:06:58.729> with<00:06:59.089> another<00:06:59.389> loop<00:07:01.150> pinch<00:07:02.150> it<00:07:02.389> and

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:02.620 
bridge with another loop pinch it and

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.700 
bridge with another loop pinch it and
pull<00:07:03.620> it<00:07:03.770> through<00:07:03.800> and<00:07:04.659> that's<00:07:05.659> how<00:07:05.839> you<00:07:05.930> tie

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:06.710 
pull it through and that's how you tie

pull it through and that's how you tie
your<00:07:06.919> shoe

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:16.780
