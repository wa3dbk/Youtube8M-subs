 "Milk estrogens and male fertility" 

00:00:07.271 --> 00:00:13.857
 Why is high intake of saturated fat in the diet associated with reduced sperm quality? 

00:00:13.857 --> 00:00:15.537
 What is the connection? 

00:00:15.537 --> 00:00:18.398
 Well, a substantial percentage of saturated fat intake 

00:00:18.398 --> 00:00:20.524
 the study was derived from dairy products and residues 

00:00:20.524 --> 00:00:26.807
 industrial chemicals that can bioaccumulate in the food chain to fat cows. 

00:00:26.807 --> 00:00:33.358
 Some of these lipophilic (ie, fat loving) chemicals may have the ability 

00:00:33.358 --> 00:00:38.192
 disrupt hormones. CEPOL has conducted a National Persistent, Bioaccumulative, 

00:00:38.192 --> 00:00:41.325
 and toxic pollutants in the US milk supply. 

00:00:41.325 --> 00:00:46.524
 Since milk fat is probably one of the food sources for which it is exposed 

00:00:46.524 --> 00:00:48.626
 it is important to understand their levels. 

00:00:48.626 --> 00:00:57.125
 Scientists examined milk from across the country and found ready-made chemical "witch potions". 

00:00:57.125 --> 00:00:59.691
 According to their estimation, dairy products themselves seem to contribute 

00:00:59.691 --> 00:01:02.658
 about 30% to 50% of our total dioxin exposure. 

00:01:02.658 --> 00:01:06.455
 And like dioxin, other toxic pollutants tend to be abundant in the environment 

00:01:06.455 --> 00:01:09.489
 widespread and bioaccumulate in the food chain, resulting in 

00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:13.326
 at least a low degree of contamination of most animal fats. 

00:01:13.326 --> 00:01:18.511
 This may explain the higher concentrations of pollutants in those who eat fish. 

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:22.854
 Xenoestrogens, such as PCBs, bind to fat in fish or to animal meat 

00:01:22.854 --> 00:01:25.446
 and cannot be completely removed by washing or cooking, 

00:01:25.446 --> 00:01:29.388
 so they can accumulate in our body fat. 

00:01:29.388 --> 00:01:35.219
 Xenoestrogens are chemicals with demasculination or feminization effects 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:42.920
 but even in the unpolluted world, animal fats contain a real estrogen, not xenoestrogens, 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.750
 but estrogen estrogens, which are an inevitable part of non-vegetarian nutrition. 

00:01:49.752 --> 00:01:53.650
 All food of animal origin contains estradiol, 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.320
 which is at least 10,000 times more potent than most xenoestrogens. 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.780
 Nutritional exposure - meat, dairy products and eggs - to these natural sexes 

00:02:02.785 --> 00:02:07.430
 thus, steroids are highly relevant because the hormones in these animals are identical to ours. 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.680
 Estrogen in cows works just like human estrogen. 

00:02:10.686 --> 00:02:14.960
 Estrogens are also contained in meat and eggs, 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.150
 but the main sources are milk and dairy products. 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.330
 Drinking one glass of milk increases the intake of estradiol in the child 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.820
 4,000 times compared to the intake of xenoestrogens produced by normal hormonal activity. 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:33.280
 Modern, genetically enhanced dairy cows are able to give milk even during pregnancy. 

00:02:33.285 --> 00:02:38.240
 The problem is that estrogen levels can jump up to 30 times. 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.440
 Although cheese intake was associated with lower sperm concentration, 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.070
 dairy intake was also associated with abnormal sperm shape and movement. 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.430
 This suggests that milk intake may cause direct testicular damage, 

00:02:53.433 --> 00:02:56.970
 not only by the potential suppression of estrogen-induced sperm production. 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.770
 While dairy products are the source of most external female sex steroids, 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.890
 eggs are also their important source, 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.800
 when they contribute approximately the same as meat or fish in this respect. 

00:03:10.802 --> 00:03:16.100
 I think you could expect it because eggs are produced directly in the hen's ovaries. 

00:03:16.101 --> 00:03:20.160
 Hormones can also be enriched with meat. 

00:03:20.162 --> 00:03:24.140
 In the US, anabolic steroids may be given to animals to promote growth, 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.570
 which is a practice that has been banned in Europe 25 years ago. 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.700
 This study in New York found a gradual loss of sperm 

00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:32.970
 associated with the consumption of processed meat. 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.570
 However, similar studies in Europe, after the ban was announced, found the same thing. 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.290
 so they may not be implanted hormones 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.340
 but rather a consequence of the influence of other things that meat contains, 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.780
 such as saturated fat, possibly cholesterol. 

00:03:46.781 --> 00:03:49.750
 For ten years we have known that men with high cholesterol levels 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.950
 show abnormalities in their spermiograms, decreased sperm concentration, 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.950
 about one third of normal sperm movement and half of normal sperm shape. 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.790
 25 years later we found the same thing. 

00:04:03.794 --> 00:04:06.060
 Cholesterol is bad for sperm. 

00:04:06.062 --> 00:04:08.180
 In the largest study to date, there were higher levels of cholesterol in our blood 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.320
 associated with significantly lower percentages of normal sperm. 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:17.280
 Cholesterol has also been associated with decreased sperm volume and live sperm count. 

00:04:17.282 --> 00:04:23.210
 These findings highlight the role of fats in the blood in addressing male fertility issues. 

00:04:23.214 --> 00:04:29.310
 Due to the increasing incidence of obesity and cholesterol problems 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.550
 we should be concerned. Although a healthier diet appears to be associated with a healthier number 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:43.540
 spermatozoa, the cholesterol-lowering statins did not seem to help in this regard.
