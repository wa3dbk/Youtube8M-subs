tutorial today I will show you how to

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.349 
tutorial today I will show you how to
model<00:00:04.770> and<00:00:04.859> internal<00:00:05.400> and<00:00:05.549> external<00:00:05.640> threat

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
model and internal and external threat

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.129 
model and internal and external threat
according<00:00:06.899> to<00:00:06.930> ISO<00:00:07.649> 68<00:00:08.309> one<00:00:08.880> using<00:00:09.630> equations

so<00:02:53.720> now<00:02:54.079> we<00:02:54.140> have<00:02:54.470> a<00:02:54.500> plane<00:02:54.799> which<00:02:55.099> is<00:02:55.280> normal

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
so now we have a plane which is normal

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.920 
so now we have a plane which is normal

sketch<00:05:06.850> now<00:05:07.850> in<00:05:07.910> features<00:05:08.479> choose<00:05:08.960> swept<00:05:09.500> cut

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
sketch now in features choose swept cut

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.250 
sketch now in features choose swept cut
and<00:05:10.120> profile<00:05:11.120> you<00:05:11.389> should<00:05:11.419> choose<00:05:11.690> this<00:05:12.020> one

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
and profile you should choose this one

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.159 
and profile you should choose this one
and<00:05:12.530> then<00:05:13.070> path<00:05:13.370> you<00:05:13.729> choose<00:05:14.000> your<00:05:14.330> curve<00:05:14.570> like

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
and then path you choose your curve like

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:26.559 
and then path you choose your curve like
so<00:05:16.780> click<00:05:17.780> OK<00:05:18.050> for<00:05:18.110> this<00:05:18.380> one

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:26.569 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:29.889 

so<00:05:27.259> now<00:05:27.589> we<00:05:27.649> have<00:05:27.830> our<00:05:28.219> threat<00:05:28.520> this<00:05:29.119> is<00:05:29.270> an<00:05:29.449> m8

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:29.899 
so now we have our threat this is an m8

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:33.700 
so now we have our threat this is an m8
r8<00:05:30.169> m8<00:05:30.849> threat<00:05:31.849> let's<00:05:32.599> say<00:05:32.869> we<00:05:33.110> will<00:05:33.289> change

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
r8 m8 threat let's say we will change

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.339 
r8 m8 threat let's say we will change
the<00:05:34.159> size<00:05:34.429> of<00:05:34.639> the<00:05:34.729> threat<00:05:35.029> to<00:05:35.059> an<00:05:35.419> m12<00:05:36.020> threat

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:36.349 
the size of the threat to an m12 threat

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:39.040 
the size of the threat to an m12 threat
this<00:05:36.949> is<00:05:37.159> easily<00:05:37.580> done<00:05:37.819> by<00:05:38.300> right-clicking
