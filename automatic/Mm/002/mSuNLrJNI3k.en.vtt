00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.309 

so<00:00:01.800> this<00:00:02.010> is<00:00:02.100> the<00:00:02.160> first<00:00:02.399> run<00:00:02.580> with<00:00:02.850> the<00:00:03.319> well

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
so this is the first run with the well

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.039 
so this is the first run with the well
second<00:00:04.650> run<00:00:04.770> with<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:04.950> glass<00:00:05.190> bed<00:00:05.490> so<00:00:06.270> I'm

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
second run with a glass bed so I'm

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.680 
second run with a glass bed so I'm
already<00:00:07.230> seeing<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.980> heck<00:00:08.250> of<00:00:08.280> a<00:00:08.430> difference<00:00:08.690> I

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
already seeing a heck of a difference I

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.570 
already seeing a heck of a difference I
was<00:00:10.590> able<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.920> get<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.130> bed<00:00:11.310> level<00:00:11.660> and<00:00:13.580> it's

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
was able to get the bed level and it's

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.700 
was able to get the bed level and it's
still<00:00:14.820> not<00:00:14.970> perfectly<00:00:15.420> level<00:00:15.840> there's<00:00:16.290> a<00:00:16.379> warp

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
still not perfectly level there's a warp

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.480 
still not perfectly level there's a warp
to<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.370> right<00:00:17.970> rear<00:00:18.180> corner<00:00:19.190> it's<00:00:20.190> always

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
to the right rear corner it's always

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.700 
to the right rear corner it's always
been<00:00:20.730> there<00:00:20.910> it's<00:00:21.240> actually<00:00:21.450> worse<00:00:22.290> than<00:00:22.320> I

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
been there it's actually worse than I

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.300 
been there it's actually worse than I
thought

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
thought

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.210 
thought
it's<00:00:24.120> a<00:00:24.360> even<00:00:25.080> with<00:00:25.200> the<00:00:25.320> glass<00:00:25.500> bed<00:00:25.770> I<00:00:25.800> can't

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
it's a even with the glass bed I can't

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.510 
it's a even with the glass bed I can't
compensate<00:00:26.910> for<00:00:27.450> it

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
compensate for it

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.550 
compensate for it
so<00:00:29.520> actually<00:00:29.940> without<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.810> clip<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.380> that

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
so actually without the clip in that

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.310 
so actually without the clip in that
corner<00:00:32.039> holding<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.550> bed<00:00:32.790> on<00:00:33.030> actually<00:00:33.720> helps

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
corner holding the bed on actually helps

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.050 
corner holding the bed on actually helps
it<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.590> little<00:00:34.829> bit<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.400> was<00:00:35.610> able<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.880> get<00:00:36.000> a

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.060 
it a little bit so I was able to get a

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.810 
it a little bit so I was able to get a
pretty<00:00:36.390> damn<00:00:36.600> level<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:40.190> to<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.280> back<00:00:41.520> there

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
pretty damn level and to the back there

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.590 
pretty damn level and to the back there
for<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.149> bit<00:00:42.410> get<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.470> shot<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:43.980> third<00:00:44.310> one<00:00:44.600> got

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
for a bit get a shot of it third one got

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.580 
for a bit get a shot of it third one got
a<00:00:45.630> mirror<00:00:46.940> that's<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.360> first<00:00:48.630> layer<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.559> I

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
a mirror that's the first layer so I

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.380 
a mirror that's the first layer so I
always<00:00:49.920> print<00:00:50.130> the<00:00:50.220> same<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.700> always<00:00:50.940> squish

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
always print the same I always squish

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.120 
always print the same I always squish
the<00:00:51.600> first<00:00:51.809> layer<00:00:52.050> right<00:00:52.260> into<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.620> bed<00:00:52.860> I

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 
the first layer right into the bed I

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.430 
the first layer right into the bed I
never<00:00:54.030> have<00:00:54.239> sticking<00:00:54.660> problems<00:00:55.079> you'll

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
never have sticking problems you'll

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.280 
never have sticking problems you'll
notice<00:00:56.040> that<00:00:56.309> there<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.300> no<00:00:57.630> hairspray<00:00:57.840> on

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
notice that there is no hairspray on

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.220 
notice that there is no hairspray on
here<00:00:58.730> I've<00:00:59.730> always<00:01:00.030> done<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.360> same<00:01:00.570> thing<00:01:00.899> I

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
here I've always done the same thing I

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.340 
here I've always done the same thing I
always<00:01:01.260> set<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.930> z-axis<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.170> home

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
always set the the z-axis the home

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.459 
always set the the z-axis the home
position<00:01:04.649> and<00:01:05.219> then<00:01:05.939> program<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.869> an<00:01:06.990> offset

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:07.469 
position and then program in an offset

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:11.209 
position and then program in an offset
bit<00:01:07.740> by<00:01:07.920> bit<00:01:07.950> until<00:01:08.789> I<00:01:08.819> get<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:10.350> style<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:11.039> a

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:11.219 
bit by bit until I get this style of a

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:14.449 
bit by bit until I get this style of a
squish<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:12.709> admittedly<00:01:13.709> the<00:01:13.979> first<00:01:14.189> layer

00:01:14.449 --> 00:01:14.459 
squish and admittedly the first layer

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:16.969 
squish and admittedly the first layer
will<00:01:14.789> squish<00:01:15.209> out<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.840> sides<00:01:16.109> a<00:01:16.529> little<00:01:16.829> bit

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
will squish out the sides a little bit

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.090 
will squish out the sides a little bit
kind<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.429> like<00:01:17.609> a<00:01:17.639> brim<00:01:18.029> but<00:01:18.499> for<00:01:19.499> most<00:01:19.619> prints

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
kind of like a brim but for most prints

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.419 
kind of like a brim but for most prints
it<00:01:20.459> simply<00:01:21.209> doesn't<00:01:21.630> matter<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.649> take<00:01:23.130> a

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:23.429 
it simply doesn't matter you take a

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:25.120 
it simply doesn't matter you take a
little<00:01:23.670> bit<00:01:23.789> of<00:01:23.880> sandpaper<00:01:24.179> and<00:01:24.659> take<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.959> off

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
little bit of sandpaper and take it off

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.889 
little bit of sandpaper and take it off
so<00:01:26.749> that's<00:01:27.749> what<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.170> looks<00:01:28.439> like

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
so that's what it looks like

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:33.499 
so that's what it looks like
might<00:01:30.899> help<00:01:31.020> someone<00:01:31.529> to<00:01:31.740> get<00:01:31.859> an<00:01:31.950> idea<00:01:32.509> that

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
might help someone to get an idea that

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.629 
might help someone to get an idea that
is<00:01:33.869> what<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.079> always<00:01:34.200> consider<00:01:34.889> a<00:01:34.950> perfect

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:35.639 
is what I always consider a perfect

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:38.029 
is what I always consider a perfect
squish<00:01:36.060> for<00:01:36.479> those<00:01:37.229> are<00:01:37.409> two<00:01:37.560> side<00:01:37.770> by<00:01:38.009> side

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
squish for those are two side by side

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.319 
squish for those are two side by side
layers<00:01:38.849> or<00:01:39.359> paths<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.740> in<00:01:41.609> a<00:01:41.700> minute<00:01:42.029> when

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
layers or paths and in a minute when

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.010 
layers or paths and in a minute when
this<00:01:42.630> thing's<00:01:42.929> done<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.439> first<00:01:44.009> layer<00:01:45.020> panel

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
this thing's done the first layer panel

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.409 
this thing's done the first layer panel
turned<00:01:46.259> on<00:01:46.469> also<00:01:47.009> you'll<00:01:47.549> notice<00:01:47.789> I<00:01:48.090> turned

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:48.419 
turned on also you'll notice I turned

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:51.919 
turned on also you'll notice I turned
the<00:01:48.569> first<00:01:48.749> layer<00:01:49.049> speed<00:01:49.469> way<00:01:50.069> down<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:51.689> takes

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
the first layer speed way down it takes

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:53.809 
the first layer speed way down it takes
longer<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.499> print<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.859> first<00:01:53.039> layer<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.369> most

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
longer to print the first layer of most

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:57.010 
longer to print the first layer of most
prints<00:01:54.209> than<00:01:54.539> the<00:01:54.689> subsequent<00:01:55.319> 20<00:01:55.919> layers<00:01:56.369> I

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
prints than the subsequent 20 layers I

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.839 
prints than the subsequent 20 layers I
always<00:01:58.020> found<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.679> this<00:01:58.919> solves<00:01:59.669> my

00:01:59.839 --> 00:01:59.849 
always found that this solves my

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:01.639 
always found that this solves my
sticking<00:02:00.270> problem<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.810> print<00:02:01.049> bed<00:02:01.200> right<00:02:01.409> now

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
sticking problem the print bed right now

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.729 
sticking problem the print bed right now
is<00:02:01.859> at<00:02:02.039> 98.6<00:02:02.909> degrees<00:02:03.239> took<00:02:04.139> a<00:02:04.169> while<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.409> get

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:04.739 
is at 98.6 degrees took a while to get

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:05.340 
is at 98.6 degrees took a while to get
there

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
there

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.850 
there
new<00:02:05.500> glass<00:02:05.740> but<00:02:06.540> well<00:02:07.540> worth<00:02:07.750> it<00:02:08.259> I<00:02:08.289> do<00:02:08.470> really

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
new glass but well worth it I do really

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:16.229 
new glass but well worth it I do really
slow<00:02:09.310> first<00:02:09.759> layer<00:02:10.090> and<00:02:13.650> really<00:02:14.650> well<00:02:15.520> good<00:02:15.700> in

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
slow first layer and really well good in

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.000 
point to slow speed real close high
temperature<00:02:23.440> and<00:02:23.709> this<00:02:24.250> is<00:02:24.459> what<00:02:24.670> I<00:02:24.910> get<00:02:25.180> and

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
temperature and this is what I get and

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.890 
temperature and this is what I get and
no<00:02:27.010> I'll<00:02:27.340> see<00:02:27.520> if<00:02:27.580> I<00:02:27.640> can<00:02:27.790> pause<00:02:28.000> this<00:02:28.420> and<00:02:28.480> then

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
no I'll see if I can pause this and then

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.229 
no I'll see if I can pause this and then
cut<00:02:29.410> back<00:02:29.440> in<00:02:29.830> when<00:02:30.069> we<00:02:30.190> get<00:02:30.370> a<00:02:30.400> bit<00:02:30.610> more<00:02:30.760> model

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
cut back in when we get a bit more model

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.350 
cut back in when we get a bit more model
this<00:02:31.360> is<00:02:31.510> an<00:02:31.600> Arduino<00:02:32.430> bumper<00:02:33.430> for<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.090> board

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
this is an Arduino bumper for the board

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.840 
this is an Arduino bumper for the board
so<00:02:34.810> we'll<00:02:35.110> let<00:02:35.260> this<00:02:35.440> go<00:02:36.220> because<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.610> first

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
so we'll let this go because the first

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.430 
so we'll let this go because the first
layer<00:02:37.030> is<00:02:37.150> gonna<00:02:37.330> take<00:02:37.600> quite<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:37.930> little<00:02:38.110> while

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.400 

so<00:02:41.440> here's<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:42.010> print<00:02:42.250> continuing<00:02:43.410> looking

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
so here's the print continuing looking

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.150 
so here's the print continuing looking
good<00:02:44.500> so<00:02:44.800> far<00:02:45.360> a<00:02:46.360> couple<00:02:47.019> little<00:02:47.140> globs<00:02:47.530> again

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
good so far a couple little globs again

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.900 
good so far a couple little globs again
they<00:02:48.370> got<00:02:48.519> it

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
they got it

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.449 
they got it
doing<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.810> retraction<00:02:50.350> settings<00:02:50.950> just<00:02:51.310> a

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
doing the retraction settings just a

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.590 
doing the retraction settings just a
little<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:52.030> think<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:53.530> I<00:02:54.280> noticed<00:02:54.850> I<00:02:55.120> have<00:02:55.390> one

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
little I think and I noticed I have one

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.870 
little I think and I noticed I have one
corner<00:02:55.959> at<00:02:56.050> the<00:02:56.140> back<00:02:56.410> there<00:02:56.769> that<00:02:57.040> did<00:02:57.580> try

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
corner at the back there that did try

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.449 
corner at the back there that did try
and<00:02:58.060> lift<00:02:58.239> a<00:02:58.450> little<00:02:58.600> bit<00:02:59.100> we'll<00:03:00.100> see<00:03:00.280> whether

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
and lift a little bit we'll see whether

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.070 
and lift a little bit we'll see whether
that<00:03:00.700> wrecks<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.239> brand<00:03:01.510> or<00:03:01.660> whether<00:03:01.840> that

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
that wrecks the brand or whether that

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.860 
that wrecks the brand or whether that
sticks<00:03:02.680> back<00:03:02.890> down<00:03:03.190> or<00:03:03.580> how<00:03:04.269> that<00:03:04.480> works<00:03:04.660> out

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
sticks back down or how that works out

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.309 
sticks back down or how that works out
but<00:03:06.390> yeah<00:03:07.390> so<00:03:07.720> far<00:03:07.930> so<00:03:08.110> good

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
but yeah so far so good

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.890 
but yeah so far so good
glass<00:03:08.860> bed<00:03:09.160> working<00:03:09.549> like<00:03:09.700> a<00:03:09.730> treat<00:03:10.000> no

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
glass bed working like a treat no

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.729 
glass bed working like a treat no
problem<00:03:11.380> so<00:03:11.850> we'll<00:03:12.850> surprise<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:14.019> fan<00:03:14.290> hasn't

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
problem so we'll surprise the fan hasn't

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.150 
problem so we'll surprise the fan hasn't
come<00:03:14.920> on<00:03:16.170> must<00:03:17.170> have<00:03:17.320> decided<00:03:17.620> that<00:03:17.799> didn't

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
come on must have decided that didn't

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.349 
come on must have decided that didn't
need<00:03:18.280> it<00:03:18.459> so<00:03:18.730> I'm<00:03:19.030> just<00:03:19.269> gonna<00:03:19.450> override<00:03:19.900> it

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
need it so I'm just gonna override it

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:32.900 
need it so I'm just gonna override it
what<00:03:22.359> I<00:03:22.510> want<00:03:22.660> to<00:03:22.930> come<00:03:23.200> on<00:03:23.410> and<00:03:23.739> hopefully

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.420 

that's<00:03:33.910> one<00:03:34.450> of<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.980> tricky<00:03:35.980> things<00:03:36.190> with

that's one of the tricky things with

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.210 
that's one of the tricky things with
slicer<00:03:36.940> it<00:03:37.230> sometimes<00:03:38.230> decides<00:03:38.710> it<00:03:38.890> doesn't

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
slicer it sometimes decides it doesn't

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.120 
slicer it sometimes decides it doesn't
need<00:03:39.400> fan<00:03:39.700> when<00:03:40.120> we<00:03:40.630> know<00:03:40.810> full<00:03:41.080> well<00:03:41.140> it<00:03:41.980> will

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
need fan when we know full well it will

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.510 
need fan when we know full well it will
help

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
help

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.450 
help
so<00:03:42.790> you<00:03:43.570> override<00:03:43.840> it<00:03:43.990> and<00:03:44.350> then<00:03:44.470> if<00:03:45.310> the

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.460 
so you override it and then if the

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.400 
so you override it and then if the
g-code<00:03:45.790> decides<00:03:46.240> it<00:03:46.450> needs<00:03:46.480> it<00:03:46.870> and<00:03:47.110> then

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
g-code decides it needs it and then

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.940 
g-code decides it needs it and then
turns<00:03:47.650> it<00:03:47.890> on<00:03:48.010> or<00:03:48.790> off<00:03:48.850> it<00:03:49.690> will<00:03:49.900> override<00:03:50.530> your

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
turns it on or off it will override your

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.190 
turns it on or off it will override your
manual<00:03:51.460> and<00:03:51.490> shut<00:03:52.150> that<00:03:52.180> off<00:03:52.510> against<00:03:53.050> all

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
manual and shut that off against all

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.090 
manual and shut that off against all
it's<00:03:53.800> kind<00:03:54.010> of<00:03:54.160> either<00:03:55.120> gonna<00:03:55.270> let<00:03:55.450> it<00:03:55.480> run<00:03:56.100> on

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
it's kind of either gonna let it run on

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.840 
it's kind of either gonna let it run on
its<00:03:57.430> own<00:03:57.610> or<00:03:58.740> babysit<00:03:59.740> it<00:03:59.890> and<00:04:00.220> fire<00:04:00.610> it<00:04:00.640> back

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
its own or babysit it and fire it back

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.360 
its own or babysit it and fire it back
on<00:04:01.090> and<00:04:01.270> off<00:04:01.420> depending<00:04:02.010> usually<00:04:03.010> on<00:04:03.130> its<00:04:03.250> own

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
on and off depending usually on its own

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.199 
on and off depending usually on its own
it<00:04:03.490> does<00:04:03.640> a<00:04:03.670> pretty<00:04:03.910> darn<00:04:04.240> good<00:04:04.450> job<00:04:04.510> so<00:04:06.209> catch

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
it does a pretty darn good job so catch

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.890 
it does a pretty darn good job so catch
a<00:04:07.330> glimpse<00:04:07.630> of<00:04:07.780> that<00:04:07.959> back<00:04:08.140> corner<00:04:09.510> yeah<00:04:10.510> it

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
a glimpse of that back corner yeah it

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.020 
a glimpse of that back corner yeah it
didn't<00:04:11.230> lift<00:04:11.530> just<00:04:11.890> a<00:04:12.010> tiny<00:04:12.310> bit<00:04:12.670> and<00:04:12.880> it's

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
didn't lift just a tiny bit and it's

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.520 
didn't lift just a tiny bit and it's
causing<00:04:13.390> a<00:04:13.450> little<00:04:13.570> bit<00:04:13.690> of<00:04:13.900> globbing<00:04:14.350> in<00:04:14.440> the

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
causing a little bit of globbing in the

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.479 
causing a little bit of globbing in the
corner<00:04:14.980> but<00:04:15.250> you<00:04:16.060> know<00:04:16.150> I<00:04:16.930> don't<00:04:17.919> likelihood

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
corner but you know I don't likelihood

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:19.800 
corner but you know I don't likelihood
this<00:04:18.700> prints<00:04:19.000> are<00:04:19.090> actually<00:04:19.299> gonna<00:04:19.419> be<00:04:19.570> fine

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
this prints are actually gonna be fine

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.530 
this prints are actually gonna be fine
so<00:04:20.200> I'm<00:04:20.799> thinking<00:04:21.130> the<00:04:21.370> the<00:04:21.790> hairspray<00:04:22.300> might

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
so I'm thinking the the hairspray might

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:30.930 
so I'm thinking the the hairspray might
be<00:04:22.690> a<00:04:22.720> good<00:04:22.870> idea<00:04:24.690> try<00:04:25.690> it<00:04:25.750> yet<00:04:27.210> for<00:04:28.210> now<00:04:29.940> well

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
be a good idea try it yet for now well

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:37.260 
be a good idea try it yet for now well
finished<00:04:31.360> up<00:04:31.510> the<00:04:32.820> you<00:04:33.820> know<00:04:34.200> bumper<00:04:35.970> case<00:04:36.970> of

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
finished up the you know bumper case of

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.230 
finished up the you know bumper case of
sorts<00:04:37.720> and<00:04:38.190> turned<00:04:39.190> it<00:04:39.310> that<00:04:39.490> corner<00:04:39.940> didn't

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
sorts and turned it that corner didn't

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.900

I'm<00:04:45.310> not<00:04:45.460> sure<00:04:45.640> how<00:04:45.790> this<00:04:45.940> is<00:04:46.060> gonna<00:04:46.120> work<00:04:46.300> on

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
I'm not sure how this is gonna work on

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.070 
camera but no whatever um I heard the
little<00:04:53.650> pop<00:04:54.100> so<00:04:54.580> I'm<00:04:55.090> pretty<00:04:55.390> sure<00:04:55.510> it<00:04:55.870> should

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
little pop so I'm pretty sure it should

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.610 
little pop so I'm pretty sure it should
be<00:04:56.310> let<00:04:57.310> go<00:04:57.630> and<00:04:58.740> that<00:04:59.740> is<00:05:00.370> what<00:05:01.270> we<00:05:01.600> get<00:05:01.900> a

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
be let go and that is what we get a

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.070 
be let go and that is what we get a
little<00:05:03.160> bit<00:05:03.370> of<00:05:03.460> slop<00:05:03.700> on<00:05:03.970> there<00:05:04.240> I<00:05:04.510> already

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
little bit of slop on there I already

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.960 
little bit of slop on there I already
backed<00:05:05.350> up<00:05:05.650> or<00:05:05.890> actually<00:05:06.340> increased<00:05:06.790> the
