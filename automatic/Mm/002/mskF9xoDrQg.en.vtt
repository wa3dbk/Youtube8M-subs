00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.700 

as<00:00:16.970> gaming<00:00:17.240> franchises<00:00:17.750> go<00:00:18.020> it<00:00:18.230> gets<00:00:18.470> no

as gaming franchises go it gets no

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.940 
as gaming franchises go it gets no
bigger<00:00:18.980> than<00:00:19.130> the<00:00:19.670> call<00:00:19.850> of<00:00:20.000> duty<00:00:20.029> series<00:00:20.449> and

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:20.950 
bigger than the call of duty series and

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.660 
bigger than the call of duty series and
even<00:00:21.950> though<00:00:22.070> there's<00:00:22.279> been<00:00:22.340> some

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
even though there's been some

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.030 
even though there's been some
controversy<00:00:22.910> about<00:00:23.330> the<00:00:23.539> development<00:00:24.320> of<00:00:24.470> the

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:25.040 
controversy about the development of the

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.720 
controversy about the development of the
newest<00:00:25.340> episode<00:00:25.810> it<00:00:26.919> supposedly<00:00:27.919> is<00:00:28.279> really

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
newest episode it supposedly is really

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.420 
newest episode it supposedly is really
good<00:00:28.910> and<00:00:29.090> you've<00:00:29.689> been<00:00:29.840> playing<00:00:30.110> it<00:00:30.430> but

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
good and you've been playing it but

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.000 
good and you've been playing it but
before<00:00:32.119> going<00:00:32.599> into<00:00:32.870> the<00:00:33.080> overall<00:00:33.290> I<00:00:33.559> think<00:00:33.620> we

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
before going into the overall I think we

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.590 
before going into the overall I think we
should<00:00:34.040> divide<00:00:34.790> it<00:00:34.970> up<00:00:35.059> into<00:00:35.180> sections

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
should divide it up into sections

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.420 
should divide it up into sections
because<00:00:35.930> Call<00:00:36.440> of<00:00:36.470> Duty<00:00:36.830> is<00:00:37.010> pretty<00:00:37.309> much

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
because Call of Duty is pretty much

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.259 
because Call of Duty is pretty much
single-player<00:00:38.300> and<00:00:38.480> multiplayer<00:00:39.519> so<00:00:40.519> start

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:41.269 
single-player and multiplayer so start

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:44.200 
single-player and multiplayer so start
off<00:00:41.360> with<00:00:41.690> the<00:00:41.720> single<00:00:42.260> player<00:00:42.350> mmm<00:00:42.910> it's<00:00:43.910> a

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
off with the single player mmm it's a

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.820 
off with the single player mmm it's a
direct<00:00:44.600> continuation<00:00:44.780> of<00:00:45.199> modern<00:00:45.440> warfare<00:00:45.559> 2

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
direct continuation of modern warfare 2

picks<00:00:46.190> up<00:00:46.339> pretty<00:00:46.640> much<00:00:46.730> right<00:00:46.940> where<00:00:46.970> that

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
picks up pretty much right where that

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.750 
picks up pretty much right where that
left<00:00:47.449> off<00:00:47.600> which<00:00:48.410> means<00:00:48.440> some<00:00:48.860> obviously<00:00:49.549> that

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
left off which means some obviously that

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.560 
left off which means some obviously that
the<00:00:49.909> story<00:00:50.150> is<00:00:50.239> a<00:00:50.360> load<00:00:50.750> of<00:00:50.870> crap<00:00:51.760> very<00:00:52.760> model

everything<00:02:01.520> is<00:02:01.700> at<00:02:01.909> eleven<00:02:02.479> problem<00:02:02.929> yeah<00:02:03.229> it

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
everything is at eleven problem yeah it

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.789 
everything is at eleven problem yeah it
is<00:02:03.799> it's<00:02:04.729> like<00:02:05.119> you<00:02:05.420> know<00:02:05.539> that<00:02:06.350> they<00:02:06.530> have<00:02:06.679> the

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
is it's like you know that they have the

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.469 
is it's like you know that they have the
sign<00:02:06.979> of<00:02:07.069> the<00:02:07.159> character<00:02:07.609> less<00:02:08.270> is<00:02:08.450> more

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
sign of the character less is more

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.320 
sign of the character less is more
philosophy<00:02:09.080> but<00:02:09.259> most<00:02:09.619> is<00:02:09.890> more<00:02:10.210> you<00:02:11.210> know

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
philosophy but most is more you know

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.820 
philosophy but most is more you know
every<00:02:11.600> anything<00:02:11.960> that's<00:02:12.110> worth<00:02:12.260> doing<00:02:12.530> is

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
every anything that's worth doing is

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.710 
every anything that's worth doing is
worth<00:02:13.069> overdoing<00:02:13.670> at<00:02:14.090> least<00:02:14.270> that's<00:02:14.510> how

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
worth overdoing at least that's how

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.370 
worth overdoing at least that's how
they've<00:02:15.050> decided<00:02:15.380> so<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:17.270> story<00:02:17.600> ends<00:02:18.080> up<00:02:18.200> the

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
they've decided so the story ends up the

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.150 
they've decided so the story ends up the
you<00:02:18.530> know<00:02:18.709> and<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.400> actual<00:02:19.640> campaign<00:02:19.910> is<00:02:20.240> such

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
you know and the actual campaign is such

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.440 
you know and the actual campaign is such
becomes<00:02:22.160> rather<00:02:22.340> silly<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:23.090> whole<00:02:23.120> narrative

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
becomes rather silly the whole narrative

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.420 
becomes rather silly the whole narrative
is<00:02:23.810> you<00:02:24.050> you<00:02:24.350> end<00:02:24.620> up<00:02:24.740> giggling<00:02:25.010> and

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
is you you end up giggling and

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.490 
is you you end up giggling and
snickering<00:02:26.240> more<00:02:26.540> times<00:02:26.750> than<00:02:26.960> all<00:02:27.170> this<00:02:27.350> is

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
snickering more times than all this is

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.970 
snickering more times than all this is
exciting

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
exciting

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.100 
exciting
yeah<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:28.640> it's<00:02:28.849> probably<00:02:29.120> pretty<00:02:29.690> short<00:02:30.019> as

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
yeah and it's probably pretty short as

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.570 
yeah and it's probably pretty short as
well<00:02:30.260> I<00:02:30.290> imagine<00:02:30.500> that's<00:02:31.040> about<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.430> same

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
well I imagine that's about the same

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.050 
well I imagine that's about the same
like<00:02:31.790> that<00:02:31.970> as<00:02:32.209> the<00:02:32.450> previous<00:02:33.290> ones<00:02:33.650> um<00:02:34.060> but

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
like that as the previous ones um but

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.330 
like that as the previous ones um but
you<00:02:35.209> know<00:02:35.239> as<00:02:35.480> dumb<00:02:36.019> as<00:02:36.049> it<00:02:36.230> is<00:02:36.620> it's<00:02:37.250> still

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
you know as dumb as it is it's still

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.000 
you know as dumb as it is it's still
pretty<00:02:37.519> fun<00:02:37.730> yep<00:02:38.299> simply<00:02:39.110> said<00:02:39.319> yeah<00:02:39.620> I<00:02:39.650> mean

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
okay so so let's go into the multiplier

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.110 
okay so so let's go into the multiplier
because<00:03:03.290> I<00:03:03.560> mean<00:03:04.010> we<00:03:04.640> can<00:03:04.790> say<00:03:04.940> a<00:03:04.970> lot<00:03:05.000> about

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
because I mean we can say a lot about

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.520 
because I mean we can say a lot about
the<00:03:05.390> single<00:03:05.569> player<00:03:05.750> but<00:03:06.019> the<00:03:06.109> multiplayer

the single player but the multiplayer
really<00:03:06.920> is<00:03:07.099> where<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.879> call<00:03:08.030> of<00:03:08.150> duty<00:03:08.180> series

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
really is where the call of duty series

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.000 
really is where the call of duty series
in<00:03:08.840> general<00:03:08.989> excels<00:03:09.590> and<00:03:10.420> you<00:03:11.420> know<00:03:11.510> it's

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
in general excels and you know it's

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.960 
in general excels and you know it's
they've<00:03:13.010> never<00:03:13.160> really<00:03:13.250> changed<00:03:13.609> multiplayer

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
they've never really changed multiplayer

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
they chopped off a couple of the weak

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.140 
they chopped off a couple of the weak
spots<00:03:27.250> so<00:03:28.250> in<00:03:28.370> general<00:03:28.489> is<00:03:28.790> pretty<00:03:28.910> much<00:03:29.090> the

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
spots so in general is pretty much the

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.819 
spots so in general is pretty much the
same<00:03:29.390> experience<00:03:29.900> was<00:03:29.989> previously<00:03:30.260> which<00:03:30.680> is

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
same experience was previously which is

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
problem because you can still make a

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.289 
problem because you can still make a
difference<00:04:03.079> with<00:04:03.440> with<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:03.769> system<00:04:04.069> um<00:04:04.310> and

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
difference with with the system um and

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.210

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 
pretty much sounds like when it comes to

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.070 
pretty much sounds like when it comes to
the<00:06:18.250> mall<00:06:18.400> that<00:06:18.640> they'd<00:06:19.090> have<00:06:19.300> more<00:06:19.810> let's

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
the mall that they'd have more let's

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.070 
the mall that they'd have more let's
just<00:06:20.490> put<00:06:21.490> everything<00:06:21.670> they<00:06:22.390> did<00:06:22.630> a<00:06:22.870> good

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080

just put everything they did a good
thing<00:06:23.140> up<00:06:23.530> in<00:06:23.680> the<00:06:23.740> pattern<00:06:24.480> yeah<00:06:25.480> it's<00:06:25.630> the

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
thing up in the pattern yeah it's the

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.540 
thing up in the pattern yeah it's the
sort<00:06:25.900> of<00:06:25.930> thing<00:06:25.990> where<00:06:26.260> you<00:06:26.530> know<00:06:26.620> take<00:06:27.370> what

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
sort of thing where you know take what

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.030 
sort of thing where you know take what
works<00:06:27.790> and<00:06:28.090> if<00:06:28.690> it's<00:06:29.080> not<00:06:29.200> broke<00:06:29.530> don't<00:06:29.560> fix<00:06:29.800> it

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:30.040 
works and if it's not broke don't fix it

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.820 
works and if it's not broke don't fix it
and<00:06:30.220> then<00:06:30.310> you<00:06:30.610> just<00:06:30.940> add<00:06:31.090> a<00:06:31.210> X<00:06:31.960> layer<00:06:32.290> polish

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
and then you just add a X layer polish

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.020 
and then you just add a X layer polish
to<00:06:33.010> it<00:06:33.070> and<00:06:33.160> your<00:06:33.370> skills<00:06:33.580> and<00:06:33.790> some<00:06:33.880> of<00:06:33.940> the

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:36.940 
experiences they made so it's not

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.730 
experiences they made so it's not
revolution<00:06:37.450> at<00:06:37.510> all<00:06:37.630> but<00:06:38.140> it's<00:06:38.320> really<00:06:38.560> really
