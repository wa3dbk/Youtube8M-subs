00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.330
 Its 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:15.559
 Yes . Did you get the ball right now ? 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:21.590
 Jesus 2 0 Now, this is one society, and so on. 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:26.630
 So also the tongue is a little geotinde ended the ball to Tokyo without thinking saliva 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:30.920
 Jung is going to kiss you on the rock. 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.809
 Before you finish first, give me the first vote, 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:37.399
 Well, then, did you judge first? 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:41.420
 So this is the first one trillion kkeokgi for catching crabs purposes 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:45.199
 Then I will come here and see this like this 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:50.539
 Mike just off the report right here FRONTAL 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:51.800
 Yijeongdo the right one will fall so that the thickness ah this is two minutes when one of the 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:58.039
 I do not think so. 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:58.879
 Then almost a few roots need to take away more than two-thirds a lot of technical dad 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.949
 please give it to me 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:06.950
 If I had thickened the thickness after seeing the introduction first, 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:10.340
 The area human beings think first well. 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:14.570
 I'll get you to do that, and then give me maxima. 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.450
 It's going to be a bit like thinking and pulling it to see the votes and seeing the votes 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.140
 The party will include construction 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.140
 4 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:30.390
 So, first of all, 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:35.470
 The same thing happens in super-high speeds. 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.420
 Here's one of the hardest ways to get a kiss out . 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:42.189
 That's it 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:45.460
 Then chop the normal number was a fair share 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:48.909
 So chop some body enters a smile to match each other 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:55.810
 This will be 100% unconditionally because 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:58.149
 Let him be scared. He can do this by seeing him. Then kiss this. 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.230
 There's a way out. 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:06.710
 You 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:11.440
 So what was I supposed to turn so according to this ball, go here 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:17.300
 I'm out of here. It's Lam Deborah . So there are two techniques. 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:20.720
 The first is that I thinly fit this aerodynamics into the price argument first c5 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:26.200
 So how to turn the evil so thinly submerged 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.200
 It's a three-time, time-lapse attack with a pseudonym. 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.950
 This way, you can go back to work faster and faster 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.829
 No. 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.939
 This can be done by the naked eye . 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:46.459
 Then I am hard to send in the forest after being thinned. 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:49.720
 Then how do you get a way to push the tribute? 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.720
 Let's push it to the west. 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:03.090
 Oh, I'm pushing it like this. 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:05.670
 I'm pushing it out , I'm going to be able to keep this angle on the floor . 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:10.920
 The best and the angle of incidence 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:14.010
 I do not make angles like this, but rather read it here, 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:18.060
 It's going out so we do not do two things. 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:21.860
 If you have a child with a thin slice of cis 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.860
 I showed you another one . 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:38.410
 Give me 02 in this state . 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.090
 In this state of 0, the arm to remove the kiss is sent out thicker 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:45.160
 I have to go back. 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:46.540
 It is extremely difficult, however neunghage forced to shorten the rotation is strong illumination 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.459
 I will not. 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:54.150
 I'm going to go to bed with something thick. 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.150
 To push 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:02.750
 Alas, come give me not only contains two lines How then do this drill 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.750
 Will LA 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:14.630
 Let's look at it. 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:18.290
 It is important, first for the ball on the first hit two balls thinly stayed four thousand two hundred twenty-one 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:21.500
 Hers back the hand embroidery, so this also a kind of time hasineunde 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:25.090
 Let's take a slice of the concept. 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:28.470
 And the bear is throwing lightly. 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.470
 4 4 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.560
 So 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:40.240
 My clan and work are saving the money 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.980
 Then hitting the kind of rotation time, so that to avoid the thin chaechyeoseo hers 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.010
 These balls 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:49.150
 0 won by subtracting the jig technology 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:53.950
 When it comes to resistance , I leave it unconditionally. 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:58.330
 But the way to avoid kissing it is to give it the best, 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:59.230
 That the speed will be born not long ago never kiss to adjust the time 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:05.170
 Will 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:10.930
 So in the future you might as well learn from the accident in our thinking moves 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:16.360
 The most important thing that I can do is to write 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:21.610
 The spear that thrives at speed is thrown, and the Chikita law is the most important. 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:23.980
 If it is not, I can not beat Jangdan. 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:29.410
 This is not the only thing. 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:31.060
 The first configuration will be good value pull stroke it yourself is always more where 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:35.650
 Even if you drag on the part 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:40.470
 I can turn it and do it so it's basically the base I dragged 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.470
 Then I 'll tell you how to practice.
