that when you came into summer league

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:31.479 
that when you came into summer league
that<00:00:29.930> you<00:00:30.200> mainly<00:00:30.529> wanted<00:00:30.770> to<00:00:30.919> get<00:00:31.009> a<00:00:31.070> system

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
that you mainly wanted to get a system

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.400 
that you mainly wanted to get a system
in<00:00:31.640> get<00:00:32.090> the<00:00:32.210> guys<00:00:32.360> running<00:00:32.599> an<00:00:32.930> offense<00:00:33.320> that

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
in get the guys running an offense that

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.319 
in get the guys running an offense that
type<00:00:33.710> of<00:00:33.739> thing<00:00:34.010> but<00:00:34.460> at<00:00:34.640> this<00:00:34.850> point<00:00:35.090> two

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
type of thing but at this point two

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.120 
type of thing but at this point two
games<00:00:35.570> into<00:00:35.899> it<00:00:36.020> what<00:00:36.260> is<00:00:36.350> your<00:00:36.500> analysis<00:00:36.980> so

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.130 
games into it what is your analysis so

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.590 
games into it what is your analysis so
far<00:00:37.370> well<00:00:37.700> actually<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:38.090> first<00:00:38.240> thing<00:00:38.450> we've

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
far well actually the first thing we've

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.390 
far well actually the first thing we've
emphasizes<00:00:39.320> the<00:00:39.410> defense<00:00:39.800> and<00:00:39.980> rebounding

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.400 
emphasizes the defense and rebounding

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.380 
emphasizes the defense and rebounding
and<00:00:40.520> I<00:00:40.610> think<00:00:40.820> that<00:00:40.970> they've<00:00:41.120> been<00:00:41.150> working

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
and I think that they've been working

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.490 
and I think that they've been working
hard<00:00:41.840> on<00:00:42.050> that<00:00:42.080> and<00:00:42.530> been<00:00:43.400> doing<00:00:43.670> okay<00:00:44.060> but

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
hard on that and been doing okay but

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.960 
hard on that and been doing okay but
there's<00:00:45.500> a<00:00:45.560> long<00:00:45.740> way<00:00:45.950> to<00:00:46.010> go<00:00:46.250> and<00:00:46.430> we<00:00:46.490> have<00:00:46.730> put

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
there's a long way to go and we have put

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.720 
there's a long way to go and we have put
in<00:00:47.120> a<00:00:47.330> simple<00:00:48.260> system<00:00:48.440> that<00:00:48.860> will<00:00:49.220> will

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
in a simple system that will will

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.160 
in a simple system that will will
translate<00:00:50.329> to<00:00:50.480> what<00:00:50.750> we're<00:00:50.870> going<00:00:50.990> to<00:00:51.079> do

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
translate to what we're going to do

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.260 
translate to what we're going to do
during<00:00:51.380> the<00:00:51.560> season<00:00:51.950> and<00:00:52.160> I<00:00:52.760> think<00:00:52.820> the<00:00:53.090> guys

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
during the season and I think the guys

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.810 
during the season and I think the guys
are<00:00:53.300> picking<00:00:53.570> that<00:00:53.840> up<00:00:53.900> really<00:00:54.170> well<00:00:54.410> and<00:00:54.820> you

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
are picking that up really well and you

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.710 
are picking that up really well and you
know<00:00:55.910> we<00:00:56.030> would<00:00:56.180> have<00:00:56.270> liked<00:00:56.420> to<00:00:56.480> have<00:00:56.540> got

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
know we would have liked to have got

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.420 
know we would have liked to have got
that<00:00:56.870> last<00:00:57.079> win<00:00:57.380> we<00:00:57.590> have<00:00:57.920> that<00:00:58.070> lead<00:00:58.250> and

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
that last win we have that lead and

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.190 
that last win we have that lead and
threw<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:58.970> game<00:00:59.150> away<00:00:59.180> but<00:00:59.600> learning<00:00:59.989> how<00:01:00.140> to

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
threw the game away but learning how to

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.220 
threw the game away but learning how to
win<00:01:00.410> as<00:01:00.560> part<00:01:00.800> of<00:01:00.860> it<00:01:00.980> too<00:01:01.130> so<00:01:01.960> we're<00:01:02.960> just

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
win as part of it too so we're just

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.560 
win as part of it too so we're just
trying<00:01:03.500> to<00:01:03.680> keep<00:01:03.800> making<00:01:04.100> steps<00:01:04.339> we've<00:01:05.329> had<00:01:05.540> a

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
trying to keep making steps we've had a

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.880 
trying to keep making steps we've had a
chance<00:01:05.780> to<00:01:05.990> talk<00:01:06.020> to<00:01:06.290> several<00:01:06.470> of<00:01:06.619> the<00:01:06.770> players

chance to talk to several of the players
and<00:01:07.159> and<00:01:07.579> I<00:01:07.820> know<00:01:07.880> as<00:01:08.270> a<00:01:08.299> player<00:01:08.630> it's<00:01:08.810> a

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
and and I know as a player it's a

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.210 
and and I know as a player it's a
difficult<00:01:09.049> thing<00:01:09.290> to<00:01:09.470> come<00:01:09.740> in<00:01:09.890> and<00:01:09.979> play<00:01:10.100> with

difficult thing to come in and play with
an<00:01:10.370> entirely<00:01:10.670> new<00:01:10.850> group<00:01:11.150> of<00:01:11.479> guys<00:01:11.750> and<00:01:11.810> you

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
an entirely new group of guys and you

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
a lot of practice assignment as much as

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.140 
a lot of practice assignment as much as
you<00:01:15.680> can<00:01:15.830> get<00:01:16.010> in<00:01:16.130> how<00:01:16.640> do<00:01:16.700> you<00:01:16.850> feel<00:01:17.030> that

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
you can get in how do you feel that

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.880 
you can get in how do you feel that
they've<00:01:17.300> adjusted<00:01:17.600> to<00:01:18.320> playing<00:01:18.590> with<00:01:18.680> each

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
they've adjusted to playing with each

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.290 
they've adjusted to playing with each
other<00:01:19.100> in<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:19.280> short<00:01:19.580> amount<00:01:19.760> of<00:01:19.820> time<00:01:19.880> I

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
other in the short amount of time I

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.530 
other in the short amount of time I
think<00:01:20.930> we're<00:01:21.110> Justin<00:01:21.440> real<00:01:21.650> well<00:01:22.210> other<00:01:23.210> than

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
think we're Justin real well other than

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.710 
think we're Justin real well other than
the<00:01:23.600> turnovers<00:01:24.200> I<00:01:24.790> I<00:01:25.790> think<00:01:26.240> a<00:01:26.299> lot<00:01:26.330> of<00:01:26.510> that

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
the turnovers I I think a lot of that

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.170 
the turnovers I I think a lot of that
can<00:01:26.900> be<00:01:26.960> attributed<00:01:27.409> to<00:01:27.979> just<00:01:28.340> summer<00:01:28.820> rust

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
can be attributed to just summer rust

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.370 
can be attributed to just summer rust
they<00:01:29.420> have<00:01:29.570> it<00:01:29.659> even<00:01:29.900> though<00:01:30.020> we've<00:01:30.200> been

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
they have it even though we've been

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.130 
they have it even though we've been
playing<00:01:30.760> guys<00:01:31.760> to<00:01:32.180> get<00:01:32.299> ready<00:01:32.570> for<00:01:32.780> this<00:01:32.870> camp

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
haven't been playing much five on five

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.969 
haven't been playing much five on five
and<00:01:35.030> your<00:01:35.119> timings<00:01:35.540> off<00:01:35.750> a<00:01:35.780> little<00:01:36.080> bit<00:01:36.290> and<00:01:36.650> I

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
and your timings off a little bit and I

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.070 
and your timings off a little bit and I
think<00:01:37.820> that's<00:01:38.000> certainly<00:01:38.510> an<00:01:38.659> area<00:01:38.750> we<00:01:38.990> have

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
think that's certainly an area we have

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.050 
think that's certainly an area we have
to<00:01:39.200> improve<00:01:39.350> Paul<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.460> game<00:01:40.610> against<00:01:41.000> the

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
to improve Paul the game against the

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.969 
to improve Paul the game against the
Warriors<00:01:41.420> was<00:01:41.600> a<00:01:41.630> game<00:01:41.869> work<00:01:42.110> like<00:01:42.619> you<00:01:42.770> said

without<00:02:25.780> creating<00:02:26.780> all<00:02:27.049> the<00:02:27.200> files<00:02:27.470> that<00:02:27.799> we

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
without creating all the files that we

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.580 
without creating all the files that we
see<00:02:28.280> in<00:02:28.310> summer<00:02:28.610> leagues<00:02:29.110> that<00:02:30.110> that's<00:02:30.440> a

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
see in summer leagues that that's a

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.199 
see in summer leagues that that's a
great<00:02:30.860> question<00:02:31.129> because<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.760> files<00:02:32.000> are

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
great question because the files are

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.759 
great question because the files are
inevitable<00:02:32.690> not<00:02:32.870> only<00:02:33.140> because<00:02:33.409> we're<00:02:33.620> fine

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
inevitable not only because we're fine

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.280 
inevitable not only because we're fine
both<00:02:34.370> teams<00:02:34.640> file<00:02:34.940> a<00:02:34.970> lot<00:02:35.269> but<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:35.930> officials

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
both teams file a lot but the officials

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.750 
both teams file a lot but the officials
are<00:02:36.409> trying<00:02:36.560> out<00:02:36.890> too<00:02:37.129> and<00:02:37.159> they're<00:02:37.459> showing

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
are trying out too and they're showing

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.280 
are trying out too and they're showing
it<00:02:37.909> they're<00:02:38.239> not<00:02:38.269> going<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.510> put<00:02:38.659> anything<00:02:38.870> by

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
it they're not going to put anything by

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.809 
it they're not going to put anything by
in<00:02:39.500> my<00:02:39.680> game<00:02:39.920> i'm<00:02:40.129> going<00:02:40.250> to<00:02:40.310> call<00:02:40.370> everything

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
in my game i'm going to call everything

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.180 
in my game i'm going to call everything
and<00:02:41.180> so<00:02:41.390> you<00:02:42.110> get<00:02:42.230> a<00:02:42.290> lot<00:02:42.440> of<00:02:42.470> fouls<00:02:42.739> of<00:02:42.920> several

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
and so you get a lot of fouls of several

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.699 
and so you get a lot of fouls of several
you<00:02:43.280> i<00:02:43.340> think<00:02:43.519> they've<00:02:43.640> done<00:02:43.790> a<00:02:43.849> good<00:02:44.120> job<00:02:44.180> of

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
you i think they've done a good job of

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.140 
you i think they've done a good job of
tweaking<00:02:45.709> the<00:02:45.860> rules<00:02:46.129> so<00:02:46.430> it's<00:02:46.579> just<00:02:46.730> not<00:02:46.879> only

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
tweaking the rules so it's just not only

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.210 
tweaking the rules so it's just not only
free<00:02:47.360> throws<00:02:47.629> you<00:02:47.959> know<00:02:48.049> like<00:02:48.230> you<00:02:48.950> don't<00:02:49.099> get

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
free throws you know like you don't get

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.089 
free throws you know like you don't get
in<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.400> penalty<00:02:49.670> till<00:02:50.000> ten<00:02:50.560> ten<00:02:51.560> fouls<00:02:51.829> in<00:02:52.069> the

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
in the penalty till ten ten fouls in the

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.990 
in the penalty till ten ten fouls in the
quarter<00:02:52.870> you<00:02:53.870> can't<00:02:54.140> file<00:02:54.379> out<00:02:54.620> so<00:02:55.129> they

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
quarter you can't file out so they

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.089 
quarter you can't file out so they
really<00:02:56.209> minimize<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:57.109> impact<00:02:57.530> but<00:02:57.709> it<00:02:57.859> still

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
really minimize the impact but it still

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.130 
really minimize the impact but it still
it<00:02:58.609> hurts<00:02:59.090> the<00:02:59.299> flow<00:02:59.480> of<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.660> game<00:02:59.690> when<00:02:59.989> it

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
it hurts the flow of the game when it

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.449 
it hurts the flow of the game when it
when<00:03:00.230> there's<00:03:00.379> so<00:03:00.470> many<00:03:00.590> fouls<00:03:00.890> how<00:03:01.280> do<00:03:01.340> you

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
when there's so many fouls how do you

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.880 
when there's so many fouls how do you

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
the stands watching does that give you a

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.130 
the stands watching does that give you a
better<00:03:07.040> view<00:03:07.250> of<00:03:07.640> what's<00:03:08.090> going<00:03:08.329> on<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:08.780> how

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
don't think it's a better view it's just

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.559

a<00:03:14.359> different<00:03:14.569> view<00:03:14.959> I<00:03:15.170> like<00:03:15.799> to<00:03:16.420> first<00:03:17.420> of<00:03:17.540> all

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
a different view I like to first of all

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.479 
a different view I like to first of all
I<00:03:17.629> like<00:03:17.840> to<00:03:17.959> have<00:03:18.079> the<00:03:18.170> players<00:03:18.829> exposed<00:03:19.310> to

I like to have the players exposed to
Pete<00:03:19.670> Kirill<00:03:19.970> I<00:03:20.180> think<00:03:20.659> that's<00:03:20.959> a<00:03:21.079> great<00:03:21.109> thing

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
Pete Kirill I think that's a great thing

Pete Kirill I think that's a great thing
and<00:03:21.890> and<00:03:22.159> then<00:03:22.579> you<00:03:22.760> can<00:03:22.940> get<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.239> insights<00:03:23.690> of

and and then you can get the insights of

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.930 
and and then you can get the insights of
what<00:03:24.290> he<00:03:24.470> thinks<00:03:24.829> coaching<00:03:25.220> the<00:03:25.310> guys<00:03:25.519> as<00:03:25.790> well

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
what he thinks coaching the guys as well

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.180 
what he thinks coaching the guys as well
as<00:03:26.090> what<00:03:26.239> you<00:03:26.419> I<00:03:26.660> coached<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.380> practices<00:03:27.950> and

as what you I coached the practices and
also<00:03:28.489> then<00:03:28.669> just<00:03:28.880> watch<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.269> games<00:03:29.480> really

closely<00:03:30.019> and<00:03:30.349> it's<00:03:30.440> just<00:03:30.590> different

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
closely and it's just different

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.400 
closely and it's just different
different<00:03:31.669> point<00:03:31.910> of<00:03:32.030> view<00:03:32.209> and<00:03:32.450> III<00:03:33.079> think

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410
