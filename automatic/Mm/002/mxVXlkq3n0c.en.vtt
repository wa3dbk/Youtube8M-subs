and<00:03:47.850> that<00:03:47.940> gets<00:03:48.120> awful<00:03:48.570> it's<00:03:49.170> that<00:03:49.440> energy<00:03:50.130> the

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
and that gets awful it's that energy the

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.479 
and that gets awful it's that energy the
energy<00:03:50.430> shots<00:03:51.239> always<00:03:51.720> end<00:03:52.200> poorly<00:03:52.530> does<00:03:53.370> all

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
energy shots always end poorly does all

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:54.830 
energy shots always end poorly does all
that<00:03:53.640> flavoring<00:03:54.150> that<00:03:54.269> they<00:03:54.390> put<00:03:54.570> into<00:03:54.690> the

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
that flavoring that they put into the

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.020 
that flavoring that they put into the
drinks<00:03:55.170> isn't<00:03:55.440> there<00:03:55.620> yeah<00:03:56.250> it<00:03:56.430> tastes<00:03:56.970> like

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
drinks isn't there yeah it tastes like

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.560 
drinks isn't there yeah it tastes like
they<00:03:57.420> just<00:03:58.290> put<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.530> bunch<00:03:59.010> of<00:03:59.310> kool-aid<00:03:59.820> powder

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
they just put a bunch of kool-aid powder

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.710 
they just put a bunch of kool-aid powder
just<00:04:01.140> like<00:04:01.290> a<00:04:01.500> lot<00:04:01.920> of<00:04:02.100> powder<00:04:02.340> dunno<00:04:02.880> and<00:04:03.360> not

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
just like a lot of powder dunno and not

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.420 
just like a lot of powder dunno and not
enough<00:04:03.930> liquid<00:04:04.260> in<00:04:04.290> it<00:04:04.380> exactly<00:04:05.010> yeah<00:04:05.220> that's

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
enough liquid in it exactly yeah that's

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.670 
enough liquid in it exactly yeah that's
actually<00:04:05.550> exactly<00:04:05.850> I<00:04:06.450> do<00:04:06.989> kind<00:04:07.350> of<00:04:07.410> like<00:04:07.530> it

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
actually exactly I do kind of like it

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.009 
actually exactly I do kind of like it
though<00:04:07.709> did<00:04:08.519> the<00:04:08.730> taste<00:04:09.000> no<00:04:09.239> data<00:04:09.450> I<00:04:09.630> like<00:04:09.810> the

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
though did the taste no data I like the

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.810 
though did the taste no data I like the
first<00:04:10.380> I<00:04:10.680> played<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.010> first<00:04:11.190> couple<00:04:11.340> seconds

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
first I played the first couple seconds

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.340 
first I played the first couple seconds
but<00:04:11.940> then<00:04:12.120> once<00:04:12.269> it<00:04:12.390> hits<00:04:12.600> that<00:04:12.840> they<00:04:13.110> need<00:04:13.260> to

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
but then once it hits that they need to

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.050 
but then once it hits that they need to
put<00:04:13.500> more<00:04:13.650> liquid<00:04:13.890> in<00:04:14.310> there<00:04:14.489> I<00:04:14.700> wish<00:04:14.850> it<00:04:14.970> was

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
put more liquid in there I wish it was

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.129 
put more liquid in there I wish it was
just<00:04:15.180> a<00:04:15.300> drink<00:04:15.570> so

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
just a drink so

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.809 
just a drink so
it's<00:04:16.409> thick<00:04:16.769> to<00:04:17.069> me<00:04:17.219> I<00:04:17.370> don't<00:04:17.549> know<00:04:17.609> it's<00:04:17.759> kind

00:04:17.809 --> 00:04:17.819 
it's thick to me I don't know it's kind

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:20.330 
it's thick to me I don't know it's kind
of<00:04:17.999> average<00:04:18.629> for<00:04:19.199> your<00:04:19.349> normal<00:04:19.709> energy<00:04:19.949> shots

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
of average for your normal energy shots

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.510 
of average for your normal energy shots
but<00:04:20.669> now<00:04:21.419> we're<00:04:21.659> moving<00:04:21.749> on<00:04:21.989> to<00:04:22.259> chemo<00:04:23.219> range

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
but now we're moving on to chemo range

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
rage black ultra concentrate I would

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.510 
rage black ultra concentrate I would
have<00:04:36.990> been<00:04:37.110> completely<00:04:37.710> happy<00:04:38.039> with<00:04:38.159> it<00:04:38.340> maybe

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
have been completely happy with it maybe

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.159 
have been completely happy with it maybe
just<00:04:38.669> do<00:04:38.849> like<00:04:38.969> it<00:04:39.150> well<00:04:39.300> shot<00:04:39.539> down<00:04:39.749> here<00:04:39.779> in

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
just do like it well shot down here in

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.469 
just do like it well shot down here in
the<00:04:40.259> body<00:04:40.439> well<00:04:41.189> may<00:04:41.400> they<00:04:41.580> have<00:04:41.909> more<00:04:42.300> than

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
the body well may they have more than

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.080 
the body well may they have more than
one<00:04:42.689> so<00:04:43.169> this<00:04:43.469> is<00:04:43.499> like<00:04:43.710> the<00:04:43.919> turbo<00:04:44.669> energy

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
one so this is like the turbo energy

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.820 
one so this is like the turbo energy
shot<00:04:45.509> and<00:04:45.749> then<00:04:45.810> they<00:04:45.900> get<00:04:46.020> it<00:04:46.110> like<00:04:46.259> a<00:04:46.289> it's

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
shot and then they get it like a it's

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.050 
shot and then they get it like a it's
just<00:04:47.039> the<00:04:47.159> energy<00:04:47.279> channel<00:04:47.669> it's<00:04:47.759> just<00:04:47.909> too

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
just the energy channel it's just too

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.670 
just the energy channel it's just too
much<00:04:48.090> with<00:04:48.479> title<00:04:48.779> though<00:04:48.900> but<00:04:49.080> I<00:04:49.199> Johnny<00:04:49.529> I

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
much with title though but I Johnny I

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.529 
much with title though but I Johnny I
agree<00:04:50.219> are<00:04:50.370> usually<00:04:50.639> too<00:04:50.729> much<00:04:50.969> there<00:04:51.210> even

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:51.539 
agree are usually too much there even

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:54.019 
agree are usually too much there even
just<00:04:51.659> hemo<00:04:52.229> rage<00:04:52.259> black<00:04:53.039> turbo<00:04:53.520> energy<00:04:53.669> shot

00:04:54.019 --> 00:04:54.029 
just hemo rage black turbo energy shot

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:56.059 
just hemo rage black turbo energy shot
will<00:04:54.150> be<00:04:54.210> fine<00:04:54.419> yeah<00:04:55.289> and<00:04:55.500> that<00:04:55.590> gets<00:04:55.740> cross

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:56.069 
will be fine yeah and that gets cross

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:57.920 
will be fine yeah and that gets cross
with<00:04:56.250> me<00:04:56.340> one<00:04:56.550> so<00:04:56.939> there's<00:04:57.120> two<00:04:57.270> servings<00:04:57.719> I

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
with me one so there's two servings I

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.740 
with me one so there's two servings I
think<00:04:58.139> this<00:04:58.860> is<00:04:58.919> juicer<00:04:59.310> me<00:04:59.430> closely<00:04:59.610> no<00:05:00.509> this

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
think this is juicer me closely no this

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.360 
think this is juicer me closely no this
one<00:05:00.930> is<00:05:00.960> actually<00:05:01.169> only<00:05:01.439> one<00:05:01.650> serving<00:05:02.039> okay

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
one is actually only one serving okay

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.559 
one is actually only one serving okay
usually<00:05:02.819> the<00:05:02.879> energy<00:05:03.120> shots<00:05:03.330> are<00:05:03.479> two

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:03.569 
usually the energy shots are two

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:04.670 
usually the energy shots are two
surgeons<00:05:03.870> you<00:05:03.930> were<00:05:04.050> willing<00:05:04.199> at<00:05:04.349> this<00:05:04.379> size

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
surgeons you were willing at this size

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.709 
surgeons you were willing at this size
but<00:05:04.919> this<00:05:05.039> one<00:05:05.219> is<00:05:05.310> definitely<00:05:05.460> double<00:05:06.060> so<00:05:06.689> I

00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:06.719 
but this one is definitely double so I

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:09.860 
but this one is definitely double so I
got<00:05:06.870> two<00:05:06.990> shots<00:05:07.199> I'm<00:05:07.889> about<00:05:08.189> to<00:05:08.460> open<00:05:09.300> it<00:05:09.689> up

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
got two shots I'm about to open it up

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:15.980 
got two shots I'm about to open it up
its<00:05:10.800> own<00:05:11.099> tonight<00:05:12.139> kick<00:05:13.139> it<00:05:13.319> open<00:05:14.539> wow<00:05:15.539> that

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
its own tonight kick it open wow that

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.260 
its own tonight kick it open wow that
smells<00:05:16.169> even<00:05:16.589> more<00:05:17.129> like<00:05:17.580> they<00:05:17.759> put<00:05:18.029> a<00:05:18.060> bunch

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
smells even more like they put a bunch

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.820 
smells even more like they put a bunch
of<00:05:18.360> kool-aid<00:05:18.689> in<00:05:18.930> and<00:05:19.110> didn't<00:05:19.439> have<00:05:19.620> enough
