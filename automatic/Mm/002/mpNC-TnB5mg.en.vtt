00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 good this this video is to explain 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.859
 a little the question of the hand 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.840
 left of the classical guitar and by 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.700
 there also applicable to the electric and 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.650
 any style and genre that I make of 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.410
 this question of out there getting that 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.310
 hand is stabilized 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.900
 perpendicularly in a position that 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.460
 generally looking for some that 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.160
 they touch xylem the palms far back 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.539
 then this exercise will favor you the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.539
 question is this 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.870
 an almost perpendicular position that is 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.460
 the one that makes the most with the work of touching 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.800
 the exercise that I propose to you is 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.720
 laburar as if it were the series of two 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.899
 fingers as if it were one or 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.899
 considering from 1 to 2 to 3 and 4 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:56.250
 13 on the same string is to touch what 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.280
 same can play 13 and in sixth and in 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.690
 fifth string 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.530
 it is understood when I the young one you 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.989
 remove 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.850
 in the rooms and then tele 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.850
 first and when I come back I go backwards 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.390
 we leave if it were the series of two of two 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.399
 on two different strings he explained it 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.180
 so that it is clearer to them other 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:23.180
 time 13 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.430
 ah 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.000
 You can combine to 13 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.810
 day 24 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.760
 it can not be 14 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.180
 and I finish followed with a sad 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.240
 I will not do four simultaneous now 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.100
 13 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:11.660
 we said 13 first after we do 14 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:14.290
 after 13 24 14 and 23 and we will try 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.290
 to join us all 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.980
 and now let's try to make them 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.890
 simultaneously in another way by 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.890
 example 13 and 24 as I do 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.180
 it is very similar to that of the giants 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:55.390
 Ideally, let the four fingers do 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:58.650
 this the four fingers and in their 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.650
 corresponding boxes 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.220
 there is a simultaneous moment that the four 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.720
 fingers are going to create maybe that's a 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.940
 important to achieve stability and 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.080
 let's do it let's go to establish 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.080
 my first healer 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.120
 Hello 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.730
 shoot me by the rope 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.069
 I come back 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.390
 or the floor from below 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:54.270
 and as I agree 1 3246 I am 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.910
 I have done this exercise in the 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.640
 guitar pro 66 anyone who wants well 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.010
 can send a crisis or an email or something 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.840
 So here I am going to leave at the foot of the 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.990
 video I will leave more information of 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.310
 this can send me an email or something like that 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.680
 and passed him all the other combinations 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.550
 but it comes out of a mathematical question 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:18.060
 because if I say 13 24 it means that 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:21.470
 I can do 1 2 3 4 and grab that 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.470
 combination for all the strings 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.490
 1 1 2 3 4 1 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:43.030
 1 423 I have to raise the 4 for here 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:46.000
 it sounds to me 3 then all those 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.860
 combinations that are 24 that is they are 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.190
 written in the inter pro exercise 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:54.780
 that I did in tablature and pentagram yes and 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:59.289
 that's gone a little bit what I suggest 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:01.210
 as to be able to soften not so much 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:04.229
 speaking but creating those reflections like 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.229
 we had done roped 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.420
 of playing in block people playing more than 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.060
 a voice without very seriously not a plucking 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.880
 alone but two or three simultaneous voices 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.270
 it creates is those reflexes and many hands 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.270
 Thank you
