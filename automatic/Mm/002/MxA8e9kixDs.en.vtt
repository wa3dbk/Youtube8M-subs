00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
I could and when I felt like with some

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.729 
I could and when I felt like with some
impulse<00:00:36.420> from<00:00:36.719> people<00:00:37.140> who<00:00:37.320> are<00:00:37.410> better<00:00:37.649> at

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
impulse from people who are better at

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
interpreting that stuff I saw was McCoy

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.720 
interpreting that stuff I saw was McCoy
wasn't<00:00:41.100> impressive<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:42.480> 2014<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:43.739> 2013<00:00:44.610> he

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
wasn't impressive in 2014 in 2013 he

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.819 
wasn't impressive in 2014 in 2013 he
might<00:00:44.910> have<00:00:45.030> been<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.180> top<00:00:45.570> one<00:00:45.840> or<00:00:45.960> two<00:00:46.079> in<00:00:46.320> my

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
might have been the top one or two in my

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.260 
might have been the top one or two in my
experience<00:00:47.370> some<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.789> these<00:00:47.879> advanced

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
experience some of these advanced

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.170 
experience some of these advanced
metrics<00:00:48.570> really<00:00:49.020> there<00:00:49.440> was<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.820> drop-off<00:00:50.820> and

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
metrics really there was a drop-off and

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.080 
metrics really there was a drop-off and
you<00:00:51.719> know<00:00:51.840> was<00:00:52.170> whether<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.710> was<00:00:53.090> mileage

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
you know was whether that was mileage

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.270 
you know was whether that was mileage
and<00:00:54.510> something<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.289> be<00:00:55.379> alarmed<00:00:55.710> about<00:00:55.770> or

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
and something to be alarmed about or

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.619 
and something to be alarmed about or
just<00:00:56.809> if<00:00:57.809> an<00:00:58.050> anomaly<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.590> some<00:00:58.770> kind<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.969> know

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629

just if an anomaly of some kind you know
I<00:01:00.719> guess<00:01:00.899> that's<00:01:01.230> TBD

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
I guess that's TBD

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.799 
I guess that's TBD
