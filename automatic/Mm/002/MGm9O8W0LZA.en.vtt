00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 the ww was considering the possibility of 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.470
 include said rollins in the fight between 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.809
 the snr versus john dinner for the title 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.670
 maximum they were hesitating for three 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.190
 weeks about doing it or not at the end 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.109
 the officers decided to carry it out 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.449
 they had several meetings to discuss 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.460
 if a last confrontation between brock 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.289
 lesnar and john dinner in which he would leave a 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.000
 winner in a clean way would be the 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.580
 main attraction to sell the 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.500
 event or if they could add 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.269
 Seth Rollins making the fight 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.579
 this one a triple threat because the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.590
 Real battle of 30 men is really 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.829
 what makes people buy the show 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.960
 also during these meetings he was 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.520
 talking about the possibility of creating a 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.010
 new story line in which brock lesnar 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.530
 will show his anger with authority by 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.870
 this has been added to combat 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.670
 would cause problems between iman lesnar and 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.559
 authority and it would lead to a 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.480
 situation of maximum tension in which 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.030
 brock lesnar would doubt about the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.160
 fidelity of his manager paul heyman me 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.930
 it seems great another betrayal with this 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.789
 I think Brock Lesnar is going to win the 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.050
 fight and then rollins charge your 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.690
 briefcase 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.050

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.160

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.240

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.040

 mekong made his last appearance in tn a 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.680
 in the year 2010 leaving a legacy of two 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.780
 championships and the creation of one of the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.420
 better rivalries between women in the 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.130
