making it go it's really similar to a
car<00:01:18.170> but<00:01:18.860> when<00:01:19.070> you<00:01:19.220> add<00:01:19.490> in<00:01:19.760> all<00:01:20.060> of<00:01:20.120> your

men's<00:02:01.400> hockey<00:02:01.730> game<00:02:02.120> here<00:02:02.720> initially<00:02:03.590> we<00:02:03.980> like

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
men's hockey game here initially we like

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.080 
men's hockey game here initially we like
to<00:02:04.310> have<00:02:04.810> ideally<00:02:05.810> maybe<00:02:06.440> two<00:02:06.770> hours<00:02:07.370> of<00:02:07.670> open

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
to have ideally maybe two hours of open

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.869 
to have ideally maybe two hours of open
ice<00:02:08.420> to<00:02:08.899> get<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.590> ice<00:02:09.739> ready<00:02:10.009> for<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.670> game

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
ice to get the ice ready for the game

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.869 
ice to get the ice ready for the game
we'll<00:02:11.450> start<00:02:11.780> out<00:02:11.930> by<00:02:11.959> taking<00:02:12.739> an<00:02:13.129> edger<00:02:13.310> which

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
we'll start out by taking an edger which

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:15.760 
we'll start out by taking an edger which
is<00:02:14.090> basically<00:02:14.480> like<00:02:14.750> a<00:02:14.780> lawnmower<00:02:15.110> for<00:02:15.650> ice

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
is basically like a lawnmower for ice

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.119 
is basically like a lawnmower for ice
and<00:02:16.220> running<00:02:16.640> around<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:17.150> perimeter<00:02:17.600> of

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
and running around the perimeter of

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.099 
and running around the perimeter of
ice<00:02:18.459> to<00:02:18.819> get<00:02:18.939> our<00:02:19.060> corners<00:02:19.599> and<00:02:19.810> edges

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:20.109 
ice to get our corners and edges

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:22.289 
ice to get our corners and edges
smoothed<00:02:20.680> out<00:02:20.920> so<00:02:21.340> there's<00:02:21.489> no<00:02:21.640> bumps<00:02:22.060> when

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
smoothed out so there's no bumps when

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:23.819 
smoothed out so there's no bumps when
they<00:02:22.450> sling<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.959> puck<00:02:23.170> around<00:02:23.319> the<00:02:23.590> board

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:23.829 
they sling the puck around the board

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:26.580 
they sling the puck around the board
once<00:02:24.280> we<00:02:24.489> get<00:02:24.999> that<00:02:25.180> going<00:02:25.480> we'll<00:02:26.049> scrape<00:02:26.349> off

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
once we get that going we'll scrape off

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.830 
once we get that going we'll scrape off
any<00:02:26.829> excess<00:02:27.280> by<00:02:27.549> hand<00:02:27.849> and<00:02:28.120> then<00:02:28.420> get<00:02:28.659> ready

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
any excess by hand and then get ready

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.470 
any excess by hand and then get ready
for<00:02:29.079> our<00:02:29.139> dry<00:02:29.499> shave<00:02:29.889> which<00:02:30.459> is<00:02:30.700> with<00:02:31.329> the

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
for our dry shave which is with the

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.170 
for our dry shave which is with the
Zamboni<00:02:31.870> we<00:02:32.560> drive<00:02:32.799> around<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.609> entire<00:02:33.939> ice

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
Zamboni we drive around the entire ice

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.089 
Zamboni we drive around the entire ice
with<00:02:34.510> no<00:02:34.540> water<00:02:34.959> and<00:02:35.349> just<00:02:35.620> shave<00:02:35.859> the<00:02:36.069> ice

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
with no water and just shave the ice

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.369 
with no water and just shave the ice
down<00:02:36.549> until<00:02:37.269> we<00:02:37.359> get<00:02:37.450> it<00:02:37.599> as<00:02:37.719> smooth<00:02:37.989> as<00:02:38.139> we

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
down until we get it as smooth as we

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.920 
down until we get it as smooth as we
want<00:02:38.620> it<00:02:38.769> from<00:02:39.010> there<00:02:39.280> we<00:02:39.730> will<00:02:40.030> take<00:02:40.389> out<00:02:40.810> a

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
want it from there we will take out a

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.679 
want it from there we will take out a
second<00:02:41.409> samboni<00:02:41.889> and<00:02:42.250> do<00:02:43.060> our<00:02:43.209> regular<00:02:43.540> ice

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:43.689 
second samboni and do our regular ice

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:46.140 
second samboni and do our regular ice
makes<00:02:44.079> with<00:02:44.620> water<00:02:44.919> full<00:02:45.280> water<00:02:45.519> and<00:02:45.879> just

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
makes with water full water and just

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.750 
makes with water full water and just
make<00:02:46.810> it<00:02:46.840> look<00:02:46.989> like<00:02:47.290> glass<00:02:47.469> out<00:02:47.919> there<00:02:48.189> really

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
make it look like glass out there really

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.449 
make it look like glass out there really
that's<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.329> that's<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.959> goal<00:02:50.560> I<00:02:50.590> guess<00:02:50.799> so

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
that's the that's the goal I guess so

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.759 
that's the that's the goal I guess so
make<00:02:51.639> it<00:02:51.819> look<00:02:52.000> as<00:02:52.180> smooth<00:02:52.930> as<00:02:53.079> possible<00:02:53.109> get

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
make it look as smooth as possible get

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.830 
make it look as smooth as possible get
it<00:02:53.889> hard<00:02:54.129> enough<00:02:54.340> but<00:02:54.669> not<00:02:54.849> too<00:02:54.909> hard<00:02:55.329> so<00:02:55.629> it

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
it hard enough but not too hard so it

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.750 
it hard enough but not too hard so it
ships<00:02:56.199> out<00:02:56.379> when<00:02:56.620> you<00:02:56.680> skate<00:02:56.980> on<00:02:57.010> it<00:02:57.189> but<00:02:57.489> not

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
ships out when you skate on it but not

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.119 
ships out when you skate on it but not
soft<00:02:58.269> where<00:02:58.780> you<00:02:59.049> try<00:02:59.379> to<00:02:59.409> stop<00:02:59.769> and<00:03:00.040> you<00:03:00.099> just

soft where you try to stop and you just

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:03.300 
soft where you try to stop and you just
sink<00:03:00.609> into<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:01.000> ice<00:03:01.180> I<00:03:01.510> always<00:03:02.019> like<00:03:02.319> to<00:03:02.349> you

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
the crowd and partially because I was

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.589 
the crowd and partially because I was
just<00:04:06.109> new<00:04:06.290> at<00:04:06.499> it<00:04:06.530> I<00:04:06.969> set<00:04:07.969> the<00:04:08.090> blade<00:04:08.239> a<00:04:08.269> little

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
too much and didn't know it until the

too much and didn't know it until the
snow<00:04:11.750> tank<00:04:12.079> overflowed<00:04:12.799> back<00:04:13.129> into<00:04:13.430> my<00:04:13.549> face

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
snow tank overflowed back into my face

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.120

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
snow at an incredibly rapid rate which

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.920 
snow at an incredibly rapid rate which
really<00:04:19.820> didn't<00:04:20.209> look<00:04:20.329> good<00:04:20.509> with<00:04:20.720> all<00:04:20.810> the

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
really didn't look good with all the

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.480 
really didn't look good with all the
fans<00:04:21.169> there's<00:04:21.380> doubled<00:04:21.829> their<00:04:21.949> intermission

about<00:04:24.740> a<00:04:24.800> half<00:04:24.979> hour<00:04:25.250> because<00:04:25.789> it<00:04:26.150> took<00:04:26.300> me<00:04:26.449> a

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
about a half hour because it took me a

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:27.879 
about a half hour because it took me a
little<00:04:26.570> while<00:04:26.690> to<00:04:26.780> get<00:04:27.020> my<00:04:27.169> nerves<00:04:27.380> back<00:04:27.680> and

little while to get my nerves back and

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:29.379 
little while to get my nerves back and
go<00:04:27.979> back<00:04:28.190> out<00:04:28.340> and<00:04:28.400> actually<00:04:28.789> finish<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:29.240> ice
