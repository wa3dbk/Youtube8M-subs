00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:07.470
 friends of table football welcome back to the 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.750
 school of amazing seen the success 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.790
 of which I thank you last year 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.490
 this year it will keep you company for everyone 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.850
 and 30 for all 30 bets that 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.550
 they will be divided into a school made 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.189
 both for beginners and for 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.630
 a little bit experienced players then 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.630
 good school and let's get started 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.330
 we begin our journey and it 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.420
 we do by taking a small step 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.850
 back to last year for those who do 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.250
 were the first bets lost because 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.329
 anyway who sent me 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.610
 by email 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.640
 some doubts about the setting then 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.309
 let's start talking about the setting but 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.620
 even before we talk d dominant eye 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.050
 so before talking about the correct 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.329
 body setting 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.280
 we have to understand a small concept but 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.739
 essential for playing billiards 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.600
 we must see each other well we learn a 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.309
 then determine which one is ours 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.149
 the dominant eye we do it with a 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.280
 small gesture 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.260
 let yourself be helped by a friend of ours 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.720
 put it in front of him is in fact a 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.220
 circle in front of the eyes 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.540
 look inside this circle with everyone 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.790
 and two eyes 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.040
 you will see your friend will tell you that d 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.200
 good eye sees only one in this 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.170
 in case you see my left eye 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.020
 in fact I am a dominant left 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.460
 what does this mean that in the process of 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.159
 setting 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.920
 I'll have to approach the billiard so 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.850
 such that the cue low under mine 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.560
 left eye 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.240
 this is the only way to have one 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.240
 correct view of the truck 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.420
 sent him back to the explanation 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.119
 it is always available on the site 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.110
 of amazing that I remind you illustrates 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.200
 billiard point com 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.539
 regarding the error of 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.759
 parallax let's say two words 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.200
 here also from the villas the hero of 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.509
 parallax as you have seen it is 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.789
 simply the fact that an object 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.320
 that you are observing in this case 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:09.340
 both our villa and the ball 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.560
 opponent change perspective a 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.500
 depending on the observation point that 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.620
 what I mean if we move the point 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.319
 observation to the left or right the 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.870
 opposing ball does exactly 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.660
 on the other hand this is what 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.549
 produces produces an error too 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.040
 quite important if the alignment 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.080
 of the face on the splint is not correct e 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.850
 could lead us to make mistakes 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.269
 remarkable aims 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.549
 we will see later how to heal them is the 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:42.599
 body positioning and be with 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.599
 some small ploy 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.640
 and now a good three-dimensional 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.980
 to the next amazing lesson e 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.980
 to the next installment of billions
