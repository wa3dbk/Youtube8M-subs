00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.739
 there are pilots who have changed the rules 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.960
 there are team managers who have 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.960
 revolutionized the rules online maikel 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.710
 even the faithful has done it in the middle of 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.490
 year to counteract the superiority 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.490
 of a team 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.020
 but what no one imagined is that the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.000
 rain could change the rules of the 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.160
 I play last year's race in 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.530
 Canada was endless it became 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.460
 the longest race in history 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.949
 since the lights went out 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.280
 until the checkered flag passed 4 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.830
 hours 4 minutes and 39 seconds ago has 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.250
 left 3 hours and 45 minutes of the great 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:07.830
 German prize of 1954 and 3 hours 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.240
 and 57 minutes of the 500 miles of 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.950
 Indianapolis of the year 1951 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.110
 as of this season it has 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.360
 changed the regulation no race 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.369
 It can last more than four hours 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.200
 Canada 2011 became the eighth 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.630
 proof of all the times that began 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.149
 behind the safety car until 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.799
 five times he had to intervene if he 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.229
 set in the career graph you will see 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:33.289
 all the prominence he had in total 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.600
 32 laps on the track a 46 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.399
 one hundred percent of the entire test up to two hours 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.710
 the race was stopped by the rain 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.509
 it went from the tents of the teams to 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.819
 see how the stewards shrink water 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.340
 as they could or some pilots like to the 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:48.409
 are cowboys even rihanna saw as 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.100
 Some journalist went from braking in 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.100
 Rest 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.500
 the average speed of the race was 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.180
 74 kilometers per hour is the data of 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.660
 lowest speed in all history 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.880
 after the grand prize of Monaco of 1950 and 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.980
 the tip marked it webber came to be put 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:12.590
 at 321 kilometers per hour 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.590
 and all this with only 7 dropouts 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.640
 but if someone has not forgotten it for sure 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.740
 that is bator won making six 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.750
 pitches five changes of 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.200
 wheels and another position sanctioned with a 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.200
 'drive club 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.950
 after trulli or the pilot that more 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.040
 time lost in the pit lane the whopping 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.870
 of 2 minutes and 21 seconds never anyone 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.600
 I had won by doing 6 steps 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.070
 boxes and also got it 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.710
 surviving two accidents one with 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.660
 hamilton 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:51.220
 they have listened well after their 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.220
 teammate out of combat 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.460
 and another with alonso to Asturian also 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.460
 it left him out of play 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.460
 Not from English can traca 30 laps 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.240
 of the end it was 21ยบ but it advanced 14 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.240
 pilots on the track 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.360
 between them to vettel in the last curve 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.700
 became the tenth pilot of the 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.370
 history in winning just leading the 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.920
 Last lap a crazy race that 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.400
 he threw some incredible statistics there were 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.160
 76 pit stops and 83 overtaking 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.650
 the highest number in the whole season 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.780
 last and there was also the rose 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.670
 the Catalan lived with software this 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.240
 incredible race for the fall of sergio 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.550
 Perez lived on site as a channel to 2011 not 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:47.220
 just changed the regulation was also 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.220
 an unforgettable race for the formula1
