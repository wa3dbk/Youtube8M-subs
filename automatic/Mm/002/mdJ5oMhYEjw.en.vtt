that's a performance subject that

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.499 
that's a performance subject that
there's<00:02:04.380> always<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.590> sense<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.159> showing<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.329> an

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
it is a tough script and there are a lot

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.130

of difficult emotions and emotions that

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.680

these kids haven't ever felt hopefully

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.720 
these kids haven't ever felt hopefully
and<00:02:59.410> so<00:02:59.650> they<00:02:59.770> need<00:02:59.950> to<00:02:59.980> find<00:03:00.280> some<00:03:00.610> way<00:03:00.700> of

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
and so they need to find some way of

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:14.430 
and so they need to find some way of
accessing<00:03:01.240> them<00:03:12.780> but<00:03:13.780> I<00:03:13.810> do<00:03:13.900> find<00:03:14.320> the

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
accessing them but I do find the

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.900 
accessing them but I do find the
challenging<00:03:15.450> controversial<00:03:17.760> little<00:03:18.760> bit

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
challenging controversial little bit

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.670 
challenging controversial little bit
risky<00:03:19.300> texts<00:03:19.720> are<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.900> ones<00:03:20.050> that<00:03:20.200> generate

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
risky texts are the ones that generate

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.340 
risky texts are the ones that generate
the<00:03:20.830> best<00:03:21.040> lessons<00:03:21.460> that's<00:03:21.760> when<00:03:22.320> there's<00:03:23.320> a

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
the best lessons that's when there's a

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.530 
the best lessons that's when there's a
slight<00:03:23.620> sense<00:03:24.190> of<00:03:24.430> danger<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:25.030> I<00:03:25.060> think<00:03:25.330> that

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
slight sense of danger and I think that

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.040 
slight sense of danger and I think that
that's<00:03:26.290> what<00:03:26.560> invigorates<00:03:27.400> them<00:03:27.670> it<00:03:27.880> it<00:03:28.239> it

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
that's what invigorates them it it it

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.850 
that's what invigorates them it it it
makes<00:03:29.650> them<00:03:29.890> feel<00:03:30.239> not<00:03:31.239> necessarily<00:03:31.860> adult

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
makes them feel not necessarily adult

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.890 
makes them feel not necessarily adult
but<00:03:33.070> it's<00:03:33.190> almost<00:03:33.520> like<00:03:33.730> they're<00:03:33.940> they're

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
but it's almost like they're they're

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.330 
but it's almost like they're they're
learning<00:03:35.260> through<00:03:35.650> their<00:03:35.770> drama<00:03:36.100> they're

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
learning through their drama they're

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.770 
learning through their drama they're
experiencing<00:03:37.030> things<00:03:37.270> that<00:03:37.450> they<00:03:37.540> couldn't

experience<00:03:38.260> or<00:03:39.070> wouldn't<00:03:39.459> want<00:03:39.610> to

experience or wouldn't want to

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.280 
experience or wouldn't want to
experience<00:03:40.300> but<00:03:40.450> that's<00:03:40.600> a<00:03:40.690> chance<00:03:40.930> for<00:03:41.200> them

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
experience but that's a chance for them

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
this is all very dull then you have

getting quite silly mama confessors are

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.179 
getting quite silly mama confessors are
very<00:04:12.359> difficult<00:04:12.629> over<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.799> years<00:04:13.980> I've

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:14.189 
very difficult over the years I've

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:15.410 
very difficult over the years I've
really<00:04:14.459> got<00:04:14.609> to<00:04:14.640> know<00:04:14.760> these<00:04:15.000> kids<00:04:15.060> and<00:04:15.390> I

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
really got to know these kids and I

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.909 
really got to know these kids and I
think<00:04:15.629> once<00:04:15.810> they've<00:04:15.989> got<00:04:16.289> to<00:04:16.470> know<00:04:16.590> you<00:04:16.650> and

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
think once they've got to know you and

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.409 
think once they've got to know you and
they<00:04:17.039> know<00:04:17.190> how<00:04:17.370> you<00:04:17.400> work<00:04:17.820> and<00:04:18.030> you've<00:04:18.180> got<00:04:18.329> to

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
they know how you work and you've got to

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.180 
they know how you work and you've got to
know<00:04:18.539> them<00:04:18.720> and<00:04:18.840> you<00:04:18.900> know<00:04:19.079> how<00:04:19.530> they<00:04:19.739> work<00:04:20.009> you

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
know them and you know how they work you

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.460 
know them and you know how they work you
really<00:04:20.519> come<00:04:20.759> to<00:04:20.910> an<00:04:21.000> understanding<00:04:21.600> and<00:04:22.350> it's

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
really come to an understanding and it's

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.930 
really come to an understanding and it's
not<00:04:22.590> always<00:04:22.740> a<00:04:22.830> verbal<00:04:23.190> understanding<00:04:23.820> but<00:04:23.880> I

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
not always a verbal understanding but I

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.610 
not always a verbal understanding but I
think<00:04:24.150> it's<00:04:24.270> definitely<00:04:24.539> a<00:04:24.870> very<00:04:25.229> clear

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
think it's definitely a very clear

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.710 
think it's definitely a very clear
understanding<00:04:26.030> the<00:04:27.030> important<00:04:27.510> thing<00:04:27.630> I

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
understanding the important thing I

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.200 
understanding the important thing I
think<00:04:27.930> is<00:04:28.050> to<00:04:28.229> just<00:04:29.160> to<00:04:29.250> treat<00:04:29.490> all<00:04:29.970> those

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
think is to just to treat all those

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.939 
think is to just to treat all those
relationships<00:04:30.539> not<00:04:31.050> as<00:04:31.169> a<00:04:31.199> single<00:04:31.710> but<00:04:31.800> as

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
relationships not as a single but as

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:34.520 
relationships not as a single but as
individuals<00:04:32.789> so<00:04:32.910> some<00:04:33.870> of<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.050> kids<00:04:34.289> they

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
individuals so some of the kids they

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.560 
individuals so some of the kids they
will<00:04:34.680> get<00:04:34.860> away<00:04:35.100> with<00:04:35.280> a<00:04:35.310> lot<00:04:35.639> more<00:04:35.850> I've<00:04:36.510> got

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570

the head boy in the head goal in this
class<00:04:38.100> and<00:04:38.370> they<00:04:38.460> get<00:04:38.610> away<00:04:38.699> with<00:04:38.789> very<00:04:38.910> little

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.760 

others<00:04:44.550> who<00:04:44.910> are<00:04:45.210> known<00:04:46.020> around<00:04:46.320> the<00:04:46.530> school

others who are known around the school

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.740 
others who are known around the school
to<00:04:46.949> be<00:04:46.979> behavior<00:04:47.639> problems<00:04:48.120> I<00:04:48.300> don't<00:04:48.509> have<00:04:48.720> a

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
to be behavior problems I don't have a

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.540 
to be behavior problems I don't have a
major<00:04:49.289> issue<00:04:49.620> with<00:04:49.800> them<00:04:49.949> in<00:04:50.070> drama<00:04:50.310> cuz<00:04:50.520> I

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
major issue with them in drama cuz I

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.490 
major issue with them in drama cuz I
think<00:04:50.729> they<00:04:50.820> enjoy<00:04:51.060> the<00:04:51.210> subject<00:04:51.630> but<00:04:51.690> you<00:04:51.750> you

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
think they enjoy the subject but you you

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.140 
think they enjoy the subject but you you
can't<00:04:52.800> keep<00:04:53.039> them<00:04:53.220> on<00:04:53.370> such<00:04:53.580> a<00:04:53.610> tight<00:04:53.940> leash

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
can't keep them on such a tight leash

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.189 
can't keep them on such a tight leash
because<00:04:54.360> then<00:04:54.479> you're<00:04:54.599> just<00:04:54.630> going<00:04:54.990> to<00:04:55.110> have

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
because then you're just going to have

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.710 
because then you're just going to have
confrontations<00:04:55.919> every<00:04:56.160> lesson<00:04:56.340> so<00:04:57.150> a<00:04:57.449> lot<00:04:57.690> of

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
confrontations every lesson so a lot of

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.779 
confrontations every lesson so a lot of
it<00:04:57.870> is<00:04:57.990> tactically<00:04:58.590> ignored<00:04:58.979> I<00:04:59.130> think<00:04:59.340> if<00:04:59.460> if

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
it is tactically ignored I think if if

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:01.550 
it is tactically ignored I think if if
that's<00:05:00.030> not<00:05:00.360> going<00:05:00.539> to<00:05:00.630> seriously<00:05:01.050> impact<00:05:01.470> the

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
that's not going to seriously impact the

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.670 
that's not going to seriously impact the
rest<00:05:01.710> of<00:05:01.830> the<00:05:01.919> class<00:05:02.099> it's<00:05:02.370> an<00:05:03.380> employment

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
rest of the class it's an employment

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.070 
rest of the class it's an employment
maybe<00:05:05.130> it's<00:05:05.310> annoying<00:05:05.550> you<00:05:06.000> know<00:05:06.030> some<00:05:06.900> people

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
maybe it's annoying you know some people

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.230 
maybe it's annoying you know some people
but<00:05:07.380> it's<00:05:07.500> not<00:05:07.560> having<00:05:07.889> a<00:05:08.010> major<00:05:08.699> effect<00:05:09.150> on

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
but it's not having a major effect on

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.370 
but it's not having a major effect on
the<00:05:09.360> class<00:05:09.539> that's<00:05:09.750> not<00:05:09.990> worth<00:05:10.169> the

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
the class that's not worth the

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.500 
the class that's not worth the
confrontation<00:05:11.099> it's<00:05:11.580> like<00:05:11.789> a<00:05:11.820> very<00:05:12.060> fluid

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
confrontation it's like a very fluid

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.589 
confrontation it's like a very fluid
ongoing<00:05:13.460> relationship<00:05:14.460> you<00:05:14.639> just<00:05:14.669> you<00:05:15.240> that

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:15.599 
ongoing relationship you just you that

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:16.939 
ongoing relationship you just you that
but<00:05:15.780> that<00:05:15.900> the<00:05:15.990> relationship<00:05:16.560> that<00:05:16.680> you<00:05:16.800> have

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:16.949 
but that the relationship that you have

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.230 
but that the relationship that you have
with<00:05:16.979> the<00:05:17.130> people<00:05:17.280> that<00:05:17.460> keeps<00:05:18.000> them<00:05:18.150> in

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
with the people that keeps them in

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.640 
with the people that keeps them in
control<00:05:18.510> it's<00:05:18.690> not<00:05:18.810> the<00:05:18.900> shouting<00:05:19.380> or<00:05:19.500> the

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
control it's not the shouting or the

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.070 
control it's not the shouting or the
school's<00:05:20.580> behavior<00:05:21.090> policy<00:05:21.570> it's<00:05:21.750> not<00:05:21.960> the

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
school's behavior policy it's not the

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.390 
school's behavior policy it's not the
detentions<00:05:22.680> that's<00:05:22.860> not<00:05:22.949> the<00:05:23.070> threatening

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
detentions that's not the threatening

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.040 
detentions that's not the threatening
it's<00:05:23.550> just<00:05:23.699> that<00:05:23.849> kind<00:05:24.090> of<00:05:24.180> relationship

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
it's just that kind of relationship

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.659 
it's just that kind of relationship
people<00:05:25.530> with<00:05:25.800> your<00:05:25.979> students<00:05:26.370> that's<00:05:26.550> what

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
now we're going to tell with this

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.010 
now we're going to tell with this
low-level<00:05:53.580> disruption<00:05:54.090> issues<00:05:54.690> so<00:05:54.810> it's<00:05:54.930> a

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
low-level disruption issues so it's a

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.560 
low-level disruption issues so it's a
judgment<00:05:55.470> call<00:05:55.530> the<00:05:56.340> kids<00:05:56.580> they<00:05:57.180> need<00:05:57.300> to<00:05:57.480> have

judgment call the kids they need to have

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.000 
judgment call the kids they need to have
a<00:05:57.600> very<00:05:57.840> clear<00:05:58.110> boundary<00:05:58.560> and<00:05:58.740> they<00:05:58.860> will

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
a very clear boundary and they will

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.160 
a very clear boundary and they will
always<00:05:59.250> tiptoe<00:05:59.850> right<00:06:00.180> to<00:06:00.480> their<00:06:00.630> very<00:06:00.930> edge

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.170 
always tiptoe right to their very edge

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.170 
always tiptoe right to their very edge
you<00:06:01.440> look<00:06:01.560> at<00:06:01.680> them<00:06:01.800> they<00:06:01.920> know<00:06:02.160> okay<00:06:03.030> I'm

right<00:06:03.420> here<00:06:03.450> at<00:06:03.690> the<00:06:03.840> edge<00:06:03.930> take<00:06:04.140> another<00:06:04.350> step

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
right here at the edge take another step

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:05.810 
right here at the edge take another step
and<00:06:04.650> you<00:06:05.100> know<00:06:05.220> we're<00:06:05.340> gonna<00:06:05.430> have<00:06:05.520> to<00:06:05.700> deal

into the classroom

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:41.499 
into the classroom
unfortunately<00:07:40.279> there's<00:07:40.520> you<00:07:41.180> know<00:07:41.300> there's

00:07:41.499 --> 00:07:41.509 
unfortunately there's you know there's

00:07:41.509 --> 00:07:43.089 
unfortunately there's you know there's
not<00:07:41.930> much<00:07:42.139> you<00:07:42.169> can<00:07:42.409> do<00:07:42.499> about<00:07:42.529> that<00:07:42.710> for<00:07:43.039> the

00:07:43.089 --> 00:07:43.099 
not much you can do about that for the

00:07:43.099 --> 00:07:45.070 
not much you can do about that for the
next<00:07:43.219> teacher<00:07:43.460> you<00:07:43.759> can<00:07:44.029> you<00:07:44.389> can't<00:07:44.599> do<00:07:44.719> a<00:07:44.749> warm

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:45.080 
next teacher you can you can't do a warm

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.679 
next teacher you can you can't do a warm
down<00:07:45.409> session<00:07:46.009> but<00:07:46.699> in<00:07:46.789> a<00:07:46.879> single<00:07:47.270> lesson<00:07:47.419> you

00:07:47.679 --> 00:07:47.689 
down session but in a single lesson you

00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:49.329 
down session but in a single lesson you
really<00:07:48.199> are<00:07:48.319> pressed<00:07:48.649> for<00:07:48.740> time<00:07:48.889> and<00:07:49.249> I<00:07:49.279> think

00:07:49.329 --> 00:07:49.339 
really are pressed for time and I think

00:07:49.339 --> 00:07:51.119 
really are pressed for time and I think
what's<00:07:49.639> more<00:07:49.849> important<00:07:50.330> is<00:07:50.449> the<00:07:50.569> kind<00:07:50.779> of<00:07:50.869> the

00:07:51.119 --> 00:07:51.129 
what's more important is the kind of the

00:07:51.129 --> 00:07:53.320 
what's more important is the kind of the
giving<00:07:52.129> it's<00:07:52.249> a<00:07:52.309> chance<00:07:52.550> to<00:07:52.699> perform<00:07:53.059> the<00:07:53.180> work

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:53.330 
giving it's a chance to perform the work

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:54.730 
giving it's a chance to perform the work
that<00:07:53.479> they've<00:07:53.599> been<00:07:53.689> working<00:07:53.839> on<00:07:54.139> there's<00:07:54.680> a

that they've been working on there's a

00:07:54.740 --> 00:08:10.719 
that they've been working on there's a
real<00:07:54.979> buzz<00:07:55.189> about<00:07:55.369> that
