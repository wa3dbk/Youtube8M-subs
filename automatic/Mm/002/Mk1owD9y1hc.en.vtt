well<00:03:44.970> that<00:03:45.120> doesn't<00:03:45.450> prove<00:03:45.660> his<00:03:45.900> global

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
well that doesn't prove his global

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.559 
well that doesn't prove his global
flooding<00:03:47.040> theory<00:03:47.550> yeah<00:03:48.090> it's<00:03:48.450> just

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
flooding theory yeah it's just

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.460 
flooding theory yeah it's just
coincidental<00:03:50.239> more<00:03:51.239> rain<00:03:51.629> only<00:03:51.870> serves<00:03:52.349> to

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
coincidental more rain only serves to

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.199
