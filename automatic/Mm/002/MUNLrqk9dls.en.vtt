what we're going to do here today I dug

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.860 
what we're going to do here today I dug
this<00:00:35.430> hole<00:00:35.489> quite<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.120> bit<00:00:36.300> bigger<00:00:36.600> than<00:00:36.630> it

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
this hole quite a bit bigger than it

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.490 
this hole quite a bit bigger than it
needs<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.260> be<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:39.690> plants<00:00:40.110> wouldn't<00:00:40.260> need<00:00:40.469> a

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
needs to be the plants wouldn't need a

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.650 
needs to be the plants wouldn't need a
hole<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.950> big<00:00:42.140> because<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:44.660> soil

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
hole that big because of the soil

conditions<00:00:46.289> we<00:00:46.410> want<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.800> amend<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.879> soil

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
conditions we want to amend the soil

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.130 
conditions we want to amend the soil
here<00:00:49.010> or<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.340> might<00:00:50.640> be<00:00:52.820> the<00:00:53.820> soil<00:00:54.090> might<00:00:54.420> be<00:00:55.110> a

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
here or you might be the soil might be a

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.720 
here or you might be the soil might be a
little<00:00:55.350> high<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.739> pH<00:00:57.050> we're<00:00:58.050> okay<00:00:58.469> here<00:00:58.730> we

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
little high in pH we're okay here we

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.819 
little high in pH we're okay here we
don't<00:00:59.910> really<00:01:00.120> need<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.660> amend<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.199> our<00:01:01.469> pH

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
don't really need to amend it and our pH

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.770 
don't really need to amend it and our pH
is<00:01:01.859> about<00:01:02.340> four<00:01:02.760> seven<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:04.140> five<00:01:05.479> but<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.600> gives

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
is about four seven to five but it gives

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.600 
is about four seven to five but it gives
it<00:01:06.900> plant<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.260> little<00:01:07.470> better<00:01:07.680> start<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.490> when

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
it plant a little better start so when

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.399 
it plant a little better start so when
you<00:01:08.670> get<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.939> plant<00:01:09.240> take<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.840> out<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.140> box

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
you get you plant take it out of the box

00:01:10.409 --> 00:02:14.360 
you get you plant take it out of the box
and<00:01:10.770> always<00:01:11.760> remove<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.240> tag<00:01:40.159> along<00:01:41.159> with<00:02:13.370> we

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
and always remove the tag along with we

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.589 
and always remove the tag along with we
want<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.670> do<00:02:14.849> is<00:02:15.000> have<00:02:15.180> an<00:02:15.420> amended<00:02:15.959> soil<00:02:17.599> in

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
want to do is have an amended soil in

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.710 
want to do is have an amended soil in
the<00:02:18.810> lower<00:02:19.050> part<00:02:19.470> of<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.709> hole<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.420> then<00:02:21.420> we

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
the lower part of the hole and then we

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.490 
the lower part of the hole and then we
will<00:02:21.930> complete<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.069> planet<00:02:23.690> with<00:02:24.690> with<00:02:25.349> the

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
will complete the planet with with the

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.760 
will complete the planet with with the
natural<00:02:25.950> soil<00:02:26.840> sandy<00:02:27.840> soil<00:02:28.170> right<00:02:28.379> here<00:02:28.680> at

natural soil sandy soil right here at
the<00:02:28.890> top<00:02:30.680> so<00:02:31.680> look<00:02:31.860> we<00:02:32.040> want<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.400> do<00:02:33.110> pick<00:02:34.110> up

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
the top so look we want to do pick up

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.759 
the top so look we want to do pick up
your<00:02:34.470> plant<00:02:34.739> find<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.489> center<00:02:35.849> of<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.000> hole

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
your plant find the center of the hole

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.470 
your plant find the center of the hole
dig<00:02:37.769> with<00:02:37.980> your<00:02:38.010> hand<00:02:38.370> about<00:02:38.819> where<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.209> think

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
dig with your hand about where you think

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.789 
dig with your hand about where you think
it<00:02:39.629> needs<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:40.050> be

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.209 

and<00:02:43.799> plant<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.400> into<00:02:44.730> that<00:02:44.909> amended<00:02:45.840> soil<00:02:46.219> you

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:47.219 
and plant it into that amended soil you

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:49.940 
and plant it into that amended soil you
can<00:02:47.370> see<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.670> soil<00:02:47.939> line<00:02:48.500> came<00:02:49.500> from<00:02:49.799> the

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
can see the soil line came from the

00:02:49.950 --> 00:03:23.050 
can see the soil line came from the
nursery<00:02:50.159> right<00:02:50.549> about<00:02:50.849> here<00:02:51.060> so<00:02:51.239> weird

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:30.369 

stepped<00:03:24.060> in<00:03:24.269> on<00:03:24.480> it<00:03:25.099> get<00:03:26.099> all<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.340> air<00:03:26.489> pockets

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:34.970 

put<00:03:31.379> some<00:03:31.560> more<00:03:31.739> sand<00:03:32.099> in<00:03:32.340> there<00:03:33.680> level<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:34.799> out

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
put some more sand in there level it out

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:41.629 
put some more sand in there level it out
nice<00:03:39.500> I'll<00:03:40.500> make<00:03:40.680> sure<00:03:40.859> you<00:03:40.950> get<00:03:41.069> most<00:03:41.400> of<00:03:41.549> the

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
nice I'll make sure you get most of the

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.080 
nice I'll make sure you get most of the
air<00:03:41.819> out<00:03:42.060> of<00:03:42.090> there<00:03:42.389> that<00:03:42.599> we<00:03:43.340> plant<00:03:44.340> both<00:03:44.579> will

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
air out of there that we plant both will

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.729 
air out of there that we plant both will
see<00:03:45.359> you<00:03:45.450> till<00:03:45.689> the<00:03:45.810> natural<00:03:46.260> ground<00:03:46.500> and

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
see you till the natural ground and

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.699 
see you till the natural ground and
takeoff<00:03:47.159> better<00:03:49.010> then<00:03:50.010> a<00:03:50.040> heavy<00:03:51.709> five-gallon

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
takeoff better then a heavy five-gallon

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.770 
takeoff better then a heavy five-gallon
bucket<00:03:53.159> of<00:03:54.199> pine<00:03:55.199> bark<00:03:56.239> both<00:03:57.239> half<00:03:57.479> inch

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
bucket of pine bark both half inch

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.770 
bucket of pine bark both half inch
chunks<00:03:58.229> so<00:03:58.590> you<00:03:58.769> can<00:03:58.889> go<00:03:58.979> a<00:03:59.010> bigger<00:03:59.510> just<00:04:00.510> just

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
chunks so you can go a bigger just just

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.200 
chunks so you can go a bigger just just
what<00:04:00.959> I<00:04:00.989> happen<00:04:01.379> to<00:04:01.409> have<00:04:01.620> here

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:11.270 

five<00:04:06.900> gallons<00:04:07.170> is<00:04:07.560> more<00:04:07.770> than<00:04:07.920> enough<00:04:10.130> put<00:04:11.130> it

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
five gallons is more than enough put it

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.530 
five gallons is more than enough put it
around<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.760> Platte<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:12.830> that'll<00:04:13.830> keep<00:04:14.540> weeds

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
around the Platte and that'll keep weeds

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.900 
around the Platte and that'll keep weeds
from<00:04:16.040> getting<00:04:17.040> to<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.310> plant

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
from getting to the plant

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.910 
from getting to the plant
