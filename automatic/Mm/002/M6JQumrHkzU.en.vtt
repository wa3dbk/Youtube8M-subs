00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
believe it they they actually released

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.740 
believe it they they actually released
they<00:03:10.170> released<00:03:10.680> a<00:03:10.830> trailer<00:03:11.069> with<00:03:11.489> John<00:03:12.390> Cena's

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
they released a trailer with John Cena's

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.620 
they released a trailer with John Cena's
old<00:03:13.110> titantron<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:14.040> miniature<00:03:14.510> but<00:03:15.510> they

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
old titantron and miniature but they

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.870 
old titantron and miniature but they
have<00:03:15.780> its<00:03:15.930> new<00:03:16.110> attire<00:03:16.410> so<00:03:16.890> it<00:03:17.640> should<00:03:17.850> be

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
have its new attire so it should be

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.000 
have its new attire so it should be
easier<00:03:18.269> to<00:03:18.299> switch<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.900> videos<00:03:19.230> then<00:03:19.709> to<00:03:19.890> make

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
easier to switch the videos then to make

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.850 
easier to switch the videos then to make
that<00:03:20.250> harder<00:03:20.519> so<00:03:21.360> i<00:03:21.390> don't<00:03:21.660> really<00:03:21.720> get<00:03:22.019> it<00:03:22.079> and

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
that harder so i don't really get it and

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.229 
that harder so i don't really get it and
i<00:03:22.950> think<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.310> switching<00:03:23.730> music<00:03:24.090> was

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
i think the switching music was

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.900 
i think the switching music was
interesting<00:03:24.930> m<00:03:25.110> and<00:03:25.350> this<00:03:26.100> game<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:26.549> almost

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
interesting m and this game it almost

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.050 
interesting m and this game it almost
looked<00:03:27.239> like<00:03:27.500> WWE<00:03:28.500> all<00:03:28.799> stars<00:03:28.880> where<00:03:29.880> you

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
looked like WWE all stars where you

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.729 
looked like WWE all stars where you
could<00:03:30.360> throw<00:03:30.510> them<00:03:30.750> in<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:30.989> air<00:03:31.079> and<00:03:31.290> then<00:03:31.530> do

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
could throw them in the air and then do

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.660 
could throw them in the air and then do
a<00:03:31.769> finisher<00:03:32.540> then<00:03:33.540> we<00:03:33.660> saw<00:03:34.010> it<00:03:35.010> all<00:03:35.160> sigler

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
a finisher then we saw it all sigler

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.690 
a finisher then we saw it all sigler
with<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:35.910> same<00:03:36.209> zigzag<00:03:37.079> rock<00:03:37.950> bottom<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:38.549> AAA

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
with the same zigzag rock bottom and AAA

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.800 
with the same zigzag rock bottom and AAA
and<00:03:40.070> we<00:03:41.070> got<00:03:41.220> no<00:03:41.400> information<00:03:42.120> what<00:03:42.299> consoles

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810

and we got no information what consoles
it's<00:03:43.079> for<00:03:43.459> it's<00:03:44.459> probably<00:03:44.880> only<00:03:45.060> for<00:03:45.359> 360<00:03:45.989> and

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
it's for it's probably only for 360 and

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.440 
it's for it's probably only for 360 and
ps3<00:03:46.350> because<00:03:47.310> then<00:03:47.489> i<00:03:47.519> have<00:03:47.940> to<00:03:47.970> stick<00:03:48.390> with

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
ps3 because then i have to stick with
