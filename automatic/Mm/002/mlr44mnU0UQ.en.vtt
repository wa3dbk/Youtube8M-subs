00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.030
 January is traditionally a quiet month for 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.040
 video games 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.170
 high-profile premieres during this period are usually not 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.780
 it is expected and you can safely play in 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.970
 what I missed last year now 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.949
 There are several important and jdi remakes 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.170
 old games reissued with new graphics 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.900
 to keep the classics for one more 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.570
 generation gaming systems logic of choice 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.460
 it is not always clear for example 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.859
 know why on annual lists 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.320
 remakes there are some games and when they 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.630
 there will appear let's talk about those 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.129
 projects that would not hurt 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.600
 faces or even partial rethinking 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.850
 pro system shock 2 we talked very 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.570
 many good many times and you yourself 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.610
 everyone knows not everyone found this game in 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.890
 1999 when she came out but you can 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.469
 play and now downloading the version from steam 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.360
 or year nonetheless system shock 2 was 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.370
 it would be useful to be on consoles new 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.350
 generations in updated outfit 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.059
 to ken levin's studio shut down and when we 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.700
 get a new bayou shock or something 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.860
 similar generally unclear representative 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.530
 neighboring factions arkane studios designer 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.750
 disonord harvey smith is also incomprehensible than 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.670
 engaged his instagram bursting with 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.680
 pictures of food and alcohol and there are none 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.500
 a single hint of the continuation of one of 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.850
 our favorite and mercy in sims then these 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.759
 us system shock 2 on consoles 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.450
 cursed at the same time youth turn to 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:31.229
 the origins are not the last action race in this 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.360
 interstate 76 was released in 1997 and 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.159
 showed that a good fighter is not 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.290
 must be a shooter pro 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.360
 the game's monsters hero is always driving on 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.640
 the roofs of their cars sparkle polished 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.970
 machine gun from tape recorder rattles colorful 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.500
 the funk of the late 70s everything is natural in a mustache with 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.259
 afro and jeans flared 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.509
 interstate 76 is a great option for those 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.549
 who just a little driving simulation 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.009
 imagine a game like forza 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.960
 motorsport 5 or not for speed rivals with 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.880
 their graphics physics and detail 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.770
 the world around add there 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.509
 ability to shoot and six barrels 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.880
 machine guns and replace sporting 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.970
 cars for muscle cars is not easy 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.940
 can this be done 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.920
 racing thriller defrag came out in 1989 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.480
 year and once was a reissue 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.880
 skyfall 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.800
 entertainment in that remake was important and 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.630
 the omission the game was strictly single 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.250
 now when a new generation console 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.860
 offer more and more 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.980
 mechanisms of communication between players would be 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.790
 appropriate to release will give jack again 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.980
 futuristic racing through beautiful 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.130
 sparkling tracks shooting blasters 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.500
 on a par with interstate 76 girls are capable 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.190
 give something that is clearly not enough modern 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.900
 car simulator after success 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.610
 last year's cartoon will be a new 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.500
 warrant would be appropriate to refer to 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.049
 classics to remember that not all games in the series 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.690
 wolfenstein between 1 last were 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.760
 bad for example 2001 came out 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.410
 gorgeous baby to the word finn standing 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.390
 developers which is completely 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.640
 rethought the originals released 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.470
 great story shooter in which 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.569
 there was a place and fascists we are a robot and 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.060
 mystics who for example was not in her 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.010
 order for rent by the way is found smoothly 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.110
 changes mood throughout 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.660
 campaigns are transforming from action movie to 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.220
 horror of horror stealth action even 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.959
 nothing needs to be redone 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.280
 pull up graphics and optimize 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.049
 control under gamepads 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.030
 eventually through these operations 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:26.230
 Every year there are many less 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.480
 noteworthy game when the company 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.130
 big dog ends up with moving derivatives 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.560
 baldur's gate let her please 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.480
 will take up far out now go 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.220
 rumors that bethesda may soon 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.319
 announce a new part of the legendary 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.910
 the series and the growing interest of the public 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.380
 can warm up a nice perry 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.010
 the release of the original dilogy on 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.200
 tablets 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.980
 and then take up the fallout tactics 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.260
 then for arcanum last year in 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.329
 nominations vatafak tribute year with 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.030
 a small margin from online won 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:57.850
 players full restart brilliant 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.829
 Stealth Action 1998 release 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.170
 the game was not catastrophic 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.030
 bad but extremely unassuming will be 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.859
 insulting if the current generation 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.079
 players will fill the master thief garrett 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:10.060
 just so on the cypher trilogy puss 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.889
 sold in one set in steam 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.989
 but on the consoles of the new generation which 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:15.989
 now dragging new audiences into the industry 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.010
 look at this topic yet nothing 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.840
 transferring a game like cypher to 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.510
 modern system will be followed 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.640
 debt 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.410
 and costly reworking of the interface and 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.920
 it is generally not clear to whom it may be 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.540
 need to 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:31.100
 but we really want and we do not care a 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.110
 now a moment of terrible truth 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.120
 the original dark souls came out four 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.550
 years ago and stayed forever on 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.310
 hard drives gradually leaving in 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.290
 nonexistence of consoles of the previous generation 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.060
 March on playstation 4 and xbox one 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.800
 reissue dark souls 2 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.840
 but about the original game apparently 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.820
 players will remember us now 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.330
 remember the battletoads that stayed 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.370
 status 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.290
 that cult games stand and super 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.120
 nintendo something to do with it 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.860
 because the first part is obvious 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.930
 surpasses the sequel in all that 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.590
 concerns the design of the plot style and 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.990
 mechanics 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.180
 hell is one of the best games of the previous 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.890
 generation devil may edge plans 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.650
 retake oh dark souls no yes you 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.030
 are you kidding me 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.830
 of course we like you to 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.380
 many favorite games were always near 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.180
 for example, we are very worried about what 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.130
 will zdoom which a long time 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.340
 transferred from platform to platform and into 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.080
 which is still fun to play on xbox 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.940
 360 and 3 will be released if playstation 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.130
 immortal shooter on new consoles or 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.350
 he has already lost relevance to this 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.030
 question we have no answer and we cannot 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.400
 say what games will surely get 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.990
 reissue in the future but our wish sheets 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.030
 we announced share your 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.510
 comments and let's get a petition 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.510
 write
