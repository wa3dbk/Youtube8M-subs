00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
in the ninth and I had the tenth even

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.730 
in the ninth and I had the tenth even
and<00:01:47.950> I<00:01:48.580> had<00:01:48.760> a<00:01:48.790> there's<00:01:49.479> such<00:01:49.659> an<00:01:49.810> extent<00:01:50.200> in

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
and I had a there's such an extent in

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.980 
and I had a there's such an extent in
Ben's<00:01:51.040> favor<00:01:51.369> that<00:01:51.670> you<00:01:52.150> Bank<00:01:52.360> had<00:01:52.600> to<00:01:52.750> win<00:01:52.869> the

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
Ben's favor that you Bank had to win the

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.719 
Ben's favor that you Bank had to win the
last<00:01:53.170> two<00:01:53.350> runs<00:01:53.590> you<00:01:54.100> just<00:01:54.250> had<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:54.460> one<00:01:54.549> who

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
last two runs you just had the one who

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.219 
last two runs you just had the one who
loses<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.210> fight<00:01:55.390> but<00:01:56.100> no<00:01:57.100> I<00:01:57.130> thought<00:01:57.640> it<00:01:57.760> was

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
loses the fight but no I thought it was

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.100 
loses the fight but no I thought it was
like<00:01:59.229> that<00:01:59.909> entirely<00:02:00.909> entirely<00:02:01.600> Troy<00:02:01.900> to

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
like that entirely entirely Troy to

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.420 
like that entirely entirely Troy to
fight<00:02:02.320> it<00:02:02.439> was<00:02:02.530> like<00:02:02.710> that<00:02:02.890> was<00:02:03.009> going<00:02:03.220> one<00:02:03.400> way

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
fight it was like that was going one way

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.380 
fight it was like that was going one way
and<00:02:03.549> then<00:02:03.729> going<00:02:03.970> the<00:02:04.060> other

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
and then going the other

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.480 
and then going the other
but<00:02:04.869> that's<00:02:05.049> how<00:02:05.170> close<00:02:05.380> it<00:02:05.409> was<00:02:05.680> later'<00:02:06.070> owns

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
but that's how close it was later' owns

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.609 
but that's how close it was later' owns
in<00:02:06.909> my<00:02:07.180> opinion<00:02:07.540> Ewbank<00:02:07.869> had<00:02:08.049> to<00:02:08.200> win<00:02:08.319> and<00:02:08.470> I

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
in my opinion Ewbank had to win and I

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:09.869 
in my opinion Ewbank had to win and I
thought<00:02:08.860> he<00:02:08.950> wouldn't<00:02:09.220> let's<00:02:09.610> just<00:02:09.759> have<00:02:09.849> a

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
thought he wouldn't let's just have a

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.909 
thought he wouldn't let's just have a
look<00:02:10.030> at<00:02:10.569> a<00:02:10.629> bit<00:02:10.840> of<00:02:10.869> action<00:02:11.560> you<00:02:11.620> know<00:02:11.709> got<00:02:11.889> a

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:11.919 
look at a bit of action you know got a

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:14.310 
look at a bit of action you know got a
little<00:02:12.010> bit<00:02:12.189> untidy<00:02:12.549> didn't<00:02:12.939> it<00:02:13.029> from

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
little bit untidy didn't it from

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.930 
little bit untidy didn't it from
been<00:02:15.320> going<00:02:15.470> on<00:02:15.890> you<00:02:16.040> know<00:02:16.220> remember<00:02:16.430> then

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
been going on you know remember then

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.730 
been going on you know remember then
that<00:02:16.970> actually<00:02:17.450> fallen<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.410> hit<00:02:18.560> his<00:02:18.710> head

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
that actually fallen and hit his head

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.830 
that actually fallen and hit his head
against<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.280> camera<00:02:19.670> 35<00:02:20.120> Kong<00:02:20.360> camera<00:02:20.720> no

to give the fans a clear definitive
winner<00:04:52.140> and<00:04:52.410> I<00:04:52.470> think<00:04:52.740> that<00:04:52.950> posting<00:04:53.700> the

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
winner and I think that posting the

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.390 
winner and I think that posting the
school<00:04:54.870> round<00:04:55.140> by<00:04:55.320> round<00:04:55.590> will<00:04:55.950> help<00:04:56.250> to

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
school round by round will help to

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.190 
school round by round will help to
enhance<00:04:56.520> that<00:04:57.000> because<00:04:57.360> it<00:04:57.510> makes<00:04:57.690> the<00:04:57.840> judges

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
enhance that because it makes the judges

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.140 
enhance that because it makes the judges
