00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
seam seal it here so I figured I would

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.810 
seam seal it here so I figured I would
make<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.700> couple<00:00:09.000> videos<00:00:09.150> on<00:00:10.250> first<00:00:11.250> off<00:00:11.460> how<00:00:11.759> to

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
to actually seal the tarp so this will

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.890 
to actually seal the tarp so this will
be<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.500> first<00:00:16.740> video<00:00:16.920> on<00:00:17.250> how<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.460> make

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
the store it is a known as sill net

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.960 
the store it is a known as sill net
that's<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.740> only<00:00:28.920> product<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.369> know<00:00:29.400> at<00:00:29.730> least

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
that's the only product I know at least

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.680 
that's the only product I know at least
and<00:00:30.769> it<00:00:31.769> works<00:00:32.579> perfectly<00:00:33.090> fine<00:00:33.300> it's<00:00:33.540> what<00:00:33.660> I

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
and it works perfectly fine it's what I

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.709 
and it works perfectly fine it's what I
used<00:00:33.960> on<00:00:34.110> my<00:00:34.230> previous<00:00:34.469> tarp<00:00:35.300> but<00:00:36.300> it's<00:00:36.660> a

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
used on my previous tarp but it's a

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.229 
used on my previous tarp but it's a
little<00:00:36.960> bit<00:00:37.079> expensive<00:00:37.489> not<00:00:38.489> always<00:00:38.850> easy<00:00:39.120> to

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
little bit expensive not always easy to

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.830 
little bit expensive not always easy to
find<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:40.790> going<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:42.000> route<00:00:42.239> will<00:00:42.480> actually

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
find and going this route will actually

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.100 
find and going this route will actually
give<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.079> much<00:00:43.410> more<00:00:43.440> seam<00:00:43.980> sealer<00:00:44.539> for<00:00:45.539> about

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
give you much more seam sealer for about

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.319 
give you much more seam sealer for about
the<00:00:46.289> same<00:00:46.320> price<00:00:46.559> maybe<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.340> tiny<00:00:47.670> bit<00:00:47.879> more<00:00:47.910> but

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
the same price maybe a tiny bit more but

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.150 
the same price maybe a tiny bit more but
it<00:00:48.420> will<00:00:48.510> go<00:00:48.660> much<00:00:48.930> longer<00:00:49.170> way<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.890> ends<00:00:50.100> up

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
it will go much longer way so it ends up

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.310 
it will go much longer way so it ends up
being<00:00:50.399> cheaper<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:53.270> the<00:00:54.270> seal<00:00:54.570> net<00:00:54.780> like<00:00:55.170> I

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
being cheaper and the seal net like I

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.049 
being cheaper and the seal net like I
said<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.860> works<00:00:56.010> fine<00:00:56.340> it's<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.699> little<00:00:56.940> bit

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
said it works fine it's a little bit

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.099 
said it works fine it's a little bit
thick<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:58.260> it's<00:00:58.469> hard<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.460> apply<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.390> really

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
thick so it's hard to apply a really

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.170 
thick so it's hard to apply a really
nice<00:01:01.410> even<00:01:01.770> coat<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.370> kind<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.640> get<00:01:02.820> globby

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
nice even coat you kind of get globby

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.780 
nice even coat you kind of get globby
coats<00:01:03.750> or<00:01:03.989> really<00:01:04.170> thick<00:01:04.439> coats<00:01:04.710> doing<00:01:05.670> it

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
coats or really thick coats doing it

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.429 
coats or really thick coats doing it
this<00:01:05.970> method<00:01:06.450> creates<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.869> little<00:01:07.020> bit<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.260> a

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
this method creates a little bit of a

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.730 
this method creates a little bit of a
thinner<00:01:08.210> thinner<00:01:09.210> liquid<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.960> apply<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.560> it

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
thinner thinner liquid to apply so it

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.160 
thinner thinner liquid to apply so it
makes<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.310> cleaner<00:01:11.610> coat<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.479> looks<00:01:12.720> nicer

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
makes a cleaner coat and it looks nicer

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.480 
makes a cleaner coat and it looks nicer
and<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.590> functions<00:01:14.270> the<00:01:15.270> same<00:01:16.100> so<00:01:17.100> what<00:01:17.340> you're

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
and it functions the same so what you're

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.539 
and it functions the same so what you're
going<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.670> need<00:01:18.619> not<00:01:19.619> too<00:01:19.799> many<00:01:19.950> things<00:01:20.220> first

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
going to need not too many things first

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.410 
going to need not too many things first
off<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:22.320> heart<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.130> operation<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.820> just

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
off the heart of the operation is just

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.760 
off the heart of the operation is just
100%<00:01:25.259> silicone<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.299> GE<00:01:27.770> silicone

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
100% silicone and this is GE silicone

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.530 
100% silicone and this is GE silicone
too<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.610> want<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.880> make<00:01:29.970> sure<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.420> get

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
too you want to make sure that you get

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.649 
too you want to make sure that you get
clear<00:01:31.110> because<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.640> if<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.479> get<00:01:33.630> a

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
clear because that is a if you get a

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.200 
clear because that is a if you get a
dyed<00:01:34.070> silicone<00:01:35.070> it's<00:01:35.340> going<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.549> make<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
dyed silicone it's going to make the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.480 
dyed silicone it's going to make the
tarp<00:01:36.420> look<00:01:36.659> ugly<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.259> it'll<00:01:37.890> look<00:01:38.009> pretty<00:01:38.280> bad

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
tarp look ugly and it'll look pretty bad

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.480 
tarp look ugly and it'll look pretty bad
the<00:01:39.150> clear<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.689> as<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.560> says<00:01:40.740> just<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.159> clear

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
the clear is as it says just a clear

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.580 
the clear is as it says just a clear
silicone<00:01:41.820> that's<00:01:42.299> not<00:01:42.479> going<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.750> change<00:01:43.409> the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
silicone that's not going to change the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.630 
silicone that's not going to change the
color<00:01:43.799> or<00:01:43.890> look<00:01:44.460> bad<00:01:44.670> on<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.970> tarp<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:46.640> you

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
color or look bad on the tarp and you

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.899 
color or look bad on the tarp and you
want<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.880> make<00:01:47.970> sure<00:01:48.000> it's<00:01:48.240> 100%<00:01:48.750> silicone

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.639 
silicone you will also need some type of
thinner<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:06.479> thin<00:02:06.719> out<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.990> silicone<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:07.560> you

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
thinner to thin out the silicone so you

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.869 
thinner to thin out the silicone so you
can<00:02:07.770> actually<00:02:07.890> apply<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.340> without<00:02:08.550> getting

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
can actually apply it without getting

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.600 
can actually apply it without getting
the<00:02:09.119> mess<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.690> globs<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.349> that<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.370> where

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
the mess and the globs and that is where

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.760 
the mess and the globs and that is where
older<00:02:12.000> less<00:02:12.150> mineral<00:02:12.420> spirits<00:02:12.989> come<00:02:13.230> in

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
older less mineral spirits come in

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.130 
older less mineral spirits come in
and<00:02:14.130> if<00:02:15.030> you've<00:02:15.210> ever<00:02:15.330> looked<00:02:15.660> this<00:02:15.720> up<00:02:15.840> online

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
and if you've ever looked this up online

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.080 
and if you've ever looked this up online
there<00:02:16.560> are<00:02:16.710> you<00:02:17.070> can<00:02:17.190> use<00:02:17.400> pretty<00:02:17.640> much<00:02:17.790> any

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
there are you can use pretty much any

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.150 
there are you can use pretty much any
type<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.330> thinner<00:02:18.780> like<00:02:19.500> turpentine<00:02:19.800> or

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
type of thinner like turpentine or

type of thinner like turpentine or
something<00:02:20.580> else<00:02:20.730> but<00:02:20.970> ultimately<00:02:21.630> it's

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
something else but ultimately it's

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.110 
something else but ultimately it's
really<00:02:22.320> nice<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.010> have<00:02:23.280> an<00:02:23.430> odorless<00:02:23.880> one

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
really nice to have an odorless one

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.580 
really nice to have an odorless one
because<00:02:24.450> that's<00:02:24.630> not<00:02:24.780> going<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.020> stink<00:02:25.470> up

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
because that's not going to stink up

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.430 
because that's not going to stink up
your<00:02:25.740> tarp<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.480> if<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.630> use<00:02:27.840> turpentine<00:02:28.290> or

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
your tarp and if you use turpentine or

your tarp and if you use turpentine or
something<00:02:28.800> like<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:28.950> that's<00:02:29.280> gonna<00:02:29.490> that

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
something like that that's gonna that

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.340 
something like that that's gonna that
smell<00:02:30.300> is<00:02:30.450> going<00:02:30.600> to<00:02:30.660> stay<00:02:30.870> with<00:02:31.020> you<00:02:31.170> for

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
smell is going to stay with you for

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.280 
smell is going to stay with you for
quite<00:02:31.380> some<00:02:31.800> time<00:02:31.830> so<00:02:32.840> odorless<00:02:33.840> is<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.110> best

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
quite some time so odorless is the best

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.130 
quite some time so odorless is the best
way<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.470> go<00:02:34.710> and<00:02:35.060> mineral<00:02:36.060> spirits<00:02:36.150> are<00:02:36.660> one<00:02:37.050> of

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
way to go and mineral spirits are one of

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.670 
way to go and mineral spirits are one of
the<00:02:37.230> ways<00:02:37.350> to<00:02:37.380> do<00:02:37.620> that<00:02:38.570> so<00:02:39.570> that's<00:02:39.780> really<00:02:40.230> all

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
the ways to do that so that's really all

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.540 
the ways to do that so that's really all
this<00:02:40.920> takes<00:02:41.310> I'm<00:02:42.210> using<00:02:42.990> a<00:02:43.410> little<00:02:43.770> 50-cent

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
this takes I'm using a little 50-cent

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.570 
this takes I'm using a little 50-cent
foam<00:02:45.360> paint<00:02:46.290> brush<00:02:46.560> that<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:47.010> can<00:02:47.130> pick<00:02:47.310> up<00:02:47.460> at

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
smoother application it might look a

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.230 
smoother application it might look a
little<00:02:51.750> better<00:02:52.140> than<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:53.280> typical<00:02:53.610> brush<00:02:54.090> you

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
little better than the typical brush you

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.930 
little better than the typical brush you
might<00:02:54.390> use<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:55.460> then<00:02:56.460> you're<00:02:56.580> going<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:56.730> need

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
might use and then you're going to need

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.010 
might use and then you're going to need
a<00:02:57.210> jar<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:58.500> mix<00:02:58.740> the<00:02:58.920> two<00:02:58.950> products<00:02:59.910> in<00:03:00.150> the

a jar to mix the two products in the

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
a jar to mix the two products in the
glass<00:03:01.290> is<00:03:01.530> best<00:03:01.890> cleans<00:03:02.670> up<00:03:02.850> much<00:03:03.030> better<00:03:03.270> and

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
glass is best cleans up much better and

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.680 
glass is best cleans up much better and
some<00:03:05.040> way<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.220> stir<00:03:05.700> it<00:03:05.940> now<00:03:06.210> it's<00:03:06.390> going<00:03:06.510> to<00:03:06.570> be

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
some way to stir it now it's going to be

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.930 
some way to stir it now it's going to be
pretty<00:03:06.990> thick<00:03:07.440> so<00:03:07.620> it's<00:03:07.740> going<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:07.950> be<00:03:08.190> not

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
pretty thick so it's going to be not

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.780 
pretty thick so it's going to be not
quite<00:03:08.970> so<00:03:09.300> easy<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:10.080> stir<00:03:10.320> by<00:03:10.500> hand<00:03:10.860> so<00:03:11.610> what

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
quite so easy to stir by hand so what

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.620 
quite so easy to stir by hand so what
I've<00:03:12.000> done<00:03:12.300> is<00:03:12.600> attached<00:03:13.590> a<00:03:14.210> bunch<00:03:15.210> of<00:03:15.330> little

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
I've done is attached a bunch of little

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.870 
I've done is attached a bunch of little
zip<00:03:15.930> ties<00:03:16.520> to<00:03:17.520> the<00:03:17.850> end<00:03:18.060> of<00:03:18.420> this<00:03:18.570> little<00:03:18.840> pole

zip ties to the end of this little pole

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.790 
zip ties to the end of this little pole
here<00:03:20.900> just<00:03:21.900> like<00:03:21.990> that<00:03:22.050> you<00:03:22.410> just<00:03:22.500> kind<00:03:22.680> of

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
here just like that you just kind of

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.440 
here just like that you just kind of
ratchet<00:03:23.220> them<00:03:23.340> around<00:03:23.580> the<00:03:23.760> pole<00:03:23.970> as<00:03:24.120> tight<00:03:24.360> as

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
ratchet them around the pole as tight as

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.280 
ratchet them around the pole as tight as
you<00:03:24.540> can<00:03:24.570> and<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:28.650> other<00:03:28.830> end<00:03:29.160> of<00:03:29.250> this<00:03:29.430> pole

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
you can and the other end of this pole

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.830 
you can and the other end of this pole
is<00:03:31.290> going<00:03:32.160> to<00:03:32.280> go<00:03:32.460> into<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.090> chalk<00:03:33.360> on<00:03:33.630> this

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
is going to go into the chalk on this

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.980 
is going to go into the chalk on this
drill<00:03:34.170> here<00:03:34.530> electric<00:03:35.430> drill<00:03:38.450> but<00:03:39.450> wrong<00:03:39.810> way

drill here electric drill but wrong way

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.940 
drill here electric drill but wrong way
and<00:03:40.460> this<00:03:41.460> will<00:03:41.670> make<00:03:41.790> a<00:03:42.060> fast<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.260> much<00:03:43.770> more

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
and this will make a fast and much more

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:50.750 
and this will make a fast and much more
efficient<00:03:44.490> stirrer<00:03:45.980> for<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.280> silicone<00:03:49.760> so

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
efficient stirrer for the silicone so

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.130 
efficient stirrer for the silicone so
that's<00:03:51.060> just<00:03:51.180> going<00:03:51.330> to<00:03:51.390> go<00:03:51.540> down<00:03:51.750> into<00:03:51.990> the

that's just going to go down into the

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.980 
that's just going to go down into the
jar<00:03:52.350> to<00:03:52.530> stir<00:03:52.770> it<00:03:52.890> up<00:03:53.300> now<00:03:54.300> as<00:03:55.290> far<00:03:55.530> as<00:03:56.990> ratios

to<00:04:13.650> be<00:04:13.770> plenty<00:04:14.250> so<00:04:14.490> what<00:04:14.850> I'm<00:04:14.910> going<00:04:15.030> to<00:04:15.090> do<00:04:15.350> put

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
to be plenty so what I'm going to do put

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.289 
to be plenty so what I'm going to do put
this<00:04:16.440> jar<00:04:16.739> on<00:04:16.890> the<00:04:16.920> scale<00:04:17.280> tear<00:04:17.790> it<00:04:17.910> out<00:04:18.030> to

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
this jar on the scale tear it out to

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.710 
this jar on the scale tear it out to
zero<00:04:18.950> squeeze<00:04:19.950> in<00:04:20.190> one<00:04:20.760> ounce<00:04:20.940> of<00:04:21.180> silicone

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
zero squeeze in one ounce of silicone

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.060 
zero squeeze in one ounce of silicone
and<00:04:22.370> then<00:04:23.419> pour<00:04:24.419> in<00:04:24.630> one<00:04:25.169> ounce<00:04:25.350> of<00:04:25.710> mineral

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
and then pour in one ounce of mineral

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.650 
and then pour in one ounce of mineral
spirits<00:04:26.460> mix<00:04:26.880> them<00:04:27.090> up

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
spirits mix them up

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:34.390 
spirits mix them up
that'll<00:04:27.870> be<00:04:27.960> ready<00:04:28.140> to<00:04:28.380> apply<00:04:28.650> to<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:28.890> tarp

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.980 

okay<00:04:35.400> so<00:04:35.460> I've<00:04:35.730> measured<00:04:36.000> out<00:04:36.240> one<00:04:36.600> ounce<00:04:36.750> of

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
okay so I've measured out one ounce of

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.710 
okay so I've measured out one ounce of
the<00:04:37.140> silicone<00:04:37.680> gel<00:04:37.710> into<00:04:38.400> this<00:04:38.730> jar<00:04:39.150> here<00:04:39.180> and

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
the silicone gel into this jar here and

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.740 
the silicone gel into this jar here and
I<00:04:40.320> did<00:04:40.500> that<00:04:40.680> by<00:04:40.860> zeroing<00:04:41.400> out<00:04:41.670> the<00:04:41.730> scale<00:04:42.150> with

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
I did that by zeroing out the scale with

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.200 
I did that by zeroing out the scale with
the<00:04:42.870> jar<00:04:43.140> on<00:04:43.350> it<00:04:43.530> and<00:04:43.710> then<00:04:44.280> adding<00:04:44.700> 1<00:04:44.940> ounce

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
the jar on it and then adding 1 ounce

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.410 
the jar on it and then adding 1 ounce
worth<00:04:45.480> of<00:04:45.690> silicone<00:04:46.410> pretty<00:04:46.650> obvious<00:04:47.010> and<00:04:47.420> you

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
worth of silicone pretty obvious and you

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.150 
worth of silicone pretty obvious and you
can<00:04:48.570> actually<00:04:48.690> buy<00:04:48.930> bigger<00:04:49.290> tubes<00:04:49.650> of<00:04:50.010> this

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
can actually buy bigger tubes of this

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.940 
can actually buy bigger tubes of this
silicone<00:04:50.810> like<00:04:51.810> a<00:04:51.840> traditional<00:04:52.440> caulking

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
silicone like a traditional caulking

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.070 
silicone like a traditional caulking
tube<00:04:53.220> like<00:04:53.490> you<00:04:53.520> might<00:04:53.760> see<00:04:53.790> and<00:04:54.240> you<00:04:54.840> can<00:04:54.960> make

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
tube like you might see and you can make

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.520 
tube like you might see and you can make
large<00:04:55.350> batches<00:04:55.740> of<00:04:56.100> this<00:04:56.310> and<00:04:56.550> the<00:04:57.530> reasoning

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
large batches of this and the reasoning

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.080 
large batches of this and the reasoning
behind<00:04:58.680> that<00:04:58.950> would<00:04:59.310> be<00:04:59.490> you<00:04:59.790> can<00:04:59.940> actually

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
behind that would be you can actually

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.290 
behind that would be you can actually
design<00:05:01.050> and<00:05:01.560> build<00:05:01.770> a<00:05:01.980> ripstop<00:05:02.430> nylon<00:05:02.490> tarp

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
design and build a ripstop nylon tarp

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.980 
design and build a ripstop nylon tarp
and<00:05:03.540> then<00:05:04.520> you<00:05:05.520> can<00:05:05.670> coat<00:05:05.910> that<00:05:06.150> entire<00:05:06.570> tarp

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
and then you can coat that entire tarp

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.380 
and then you can coat that entire tarp
in<00:05:07.260> this<00:05:07.470> mixture<00:05:07.860> and<00:05:08.070> make<00:05:08.220> it<00:05:08.430> like<00:05:09.060> a<00:05:09.090> SIL

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
in this mixture and make it like a SIL

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.060 
in this mixture and make it like a SIL
nylon<00:05:09.690> tarp<00:05:09.960> so<00:05:10.140> essentially<00:05:10.860> make<00:05:11.040> it

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
nylon tarp so essentially make it

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.550 
nylon tarp so essentially make it
waterproof<00:05:11.520> and<00:05:11.970> then<00:05:12.720> that<00:05:12.870> also<00:05:13.140> keeps<00:05:13.440> you

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
waterproof and then that also keeps you

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.000 
waterproof and then that also keeps you
from<00:05:13.740> having<00:05:13.950> to<00:05:14.130> seam<00:05:14.520> seal<00:05:14.880> the<00:05:15.630> seams<00:05:16.010> now

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
from having to seam seal the seams now

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.250 
from having to seam seal the seams now
it's<00:05:17.190> not<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:17.520> neatest<00:05:17.760> way<00:05:18.600> to<00:05:18.660> do<00:05:18.900> it<00:05:19.080> and

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
it's not the neatest way to do it and

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.220 
it's not the neatest way to do it and
it's<00:05:19.380> not<00:05:20.120> entirely<00:05:21.120> easy<00:05:21.600> you<00:05:21.840> kind<00:05:22.050> of<00:05:22.110> have

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
it's not entirely easy you kind of have

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.110 
it's not entirely easy you kind of have
to<00:05:22.320> really<00:05:22.680> squeeze<00:05:23.220> it<00:05:23.460> in<00:05:23.580> there<00:05:23.700> make<00:05:23.910> sure

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
to really squeeze it in there make sure

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.660 
to really squeeze it in there make sure
it<00:05:24.240> gets<00:05:24.330> coated<00:05:24.630> well<00:05:24.960> but<00:05:25.710> it's<00:05:26.070> cheaper

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
it gets coated well but it's cheaper

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.490 
it gets coated well but it's cheaper
than<00:05:26.850> buying<00:05:27.000> seal<00:05:27.390> nylon<00:05:27.750> so<00:05:27.960> that's<00:05:28.140> one<00:05:28.350> way

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
than buying seal nylon so that's one way

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.440 
than buying seal nylon so that's one way
to<00:05:28.580> do<00:05:29.580> it<00:05:29.730> you<00:05:29.820> might<00:05:29.940> want<00:05:30.120> to<00:05:30.150> think<00:05:30.300> about

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
to do it you might want to think about

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.250 
to do it you might want to think about
that<00:05:30.720> if<00:05:30.840> you<00:05:30.960> want<00:05:31.200> to<00:05:31.230> make<00:05:31.380> a<00:05:31.410> cheap<00:05:31.770> tarp<00:05:33.260> so

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
that if you want to make a cheap tarp so

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.020 
that if you want to make a cheap tarp so
anyways<00:05:34.650> I've<00:05:34.920> got<00:05:35.760> the<00:05:37.580> silicone<00:05:38.580> one<00:05:38.850> ounce

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
anyways I've got the silicone one ounce

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.970 
anyways I've got the silicone one ounce
of<00:05:39.180> silicone<00:05:39.630> so<00:05:39.960> because<00:05:40.350> it's<00:05:40.560> a<00:05:40.650> 1<00:05:40.830> to<00:05:40.860> 1

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:40.980 
of silicone so because it's a 1 to 1

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.640 
of silicone so because it's a 1 to 1
ratio<00:05:41.720> I'm<00:05:42.720> going<00:05:42.870> to<00:05:42.930> put<00:05:43.080> that<00:05:43.200> on<00:05:43.320> the<00:05:43.440> scale

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
ratio I'm going to put that on the scale

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.040 
ratio I'm going to put that on the scale
zero<00:05:44.130> it<00:05:44.280> out<00:05:44.430> and<00:05:44.700> then<00:05:44.850> pour<00:05:45.120> in<00:05:45.300> one<00:05:45.900> ounce

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
zero it out and then pour in one ounce

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:53.449 
zero it out and then pour in one ounce
of<00:05:46.320> mineral<00:05:46.680> spirits

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:53.459 

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:57.809 

there<00:05:54.459> we<00:05:54.699> go<00:05:55.679> close<00:05:56.679> enough<00:05:56.949> not<00:05:57.399> quite<00:05:57.639> one

00:05:57.809 --> 00:05:57.819 
there we go close enough not quite one

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:03.209 
there we go close enough not quite one
ounce<00:05:57.969> but<00:05:59.639> that's<00:06:00.639> all<00:06:00.999> it<00:06:01.119> takes<00:06:01.299> and<00:06:02.219> now

00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:03.219 
ounce but that's all it takes and now

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:05.789 
ounce but that's all it takes and now
I'm<00:06:03.399> going<00:06:03.519> to<00:06:03.610> mix<00:06:03.849> it<00:06:04.059> so<00:06:04.599> I'll<00:06:04.899> do<00:06:05.499> a<00:06:05.529> quick

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:05.799 
I'm going to mix it so I'll do a quick

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:08.069 
I'm going to mix it so I'll do a quick
cut<00:06:06.069> of<00:06:06.219> me<00:06:06.369> mixing<00:06:06.759> it<00:06:06.879> here<00:06:07.089> and<00:06:07.239> that'll<00:06:07.959> be

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:08.079 
cut of me mixing it here and that'll be

00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:16.780 
cut of me mixing it here and that'll be
in

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:16.790 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:28.400 

you

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.800 

okay<00:06:29.410> so<00:06:29.470> I<00:06:29.710> have<00:06:30.040> mixed<00:06:30.490> up<00:06:30.610> the<00:06:31.030> mineral

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
okay so I have mixed up the mineral

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.440 
okay so I have mixed up the mineral
spirits<00:06:32.170> and<00:06:32.350> the<00:06:32.410> silicon<00:06:32.890> and<00:06:33.700> they<00:06:33.850> are<00:06:34.090> a

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:34.450 
spirits and the silicon and they are a

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.570 
spirits and the silicon and they are a
nice<00:06:34.690> consistency<00:06:35.440> now<00:06:35.710> this<00:06:35.950> is<00:06:36.160> the<00:06:36.340> type<00:06:36.550> of

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
nice consistency now this is the type of

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.520 
nice consistency now this is the type of
liquid<00:06:37.360> you<00:06:37.600> want<00:06:37.780> to<00:06:37.870> look<00:06:38.020> for<00:06:38.260> when<00:06:38.440> you

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.530 
liquid you want to look for when you

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.650 
liquid you want to look for when you
make<00:06:38.710> this<00:06:38.890> stuff<00:06:39.160> you<00:06:39.820> want<00:06:40.000> it<00:06:40.090> runny<00:06:40.390> but

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:40.660 
make this stuff you want it runny but

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.180 
make this stuff you want it runny but
not<00:06:40.840> too<00:06:41.110> runny<00:06:41.350> and<00:06:41.710> you<00:06:41.800> want<00:06:42.010> a<00:06:42.040> nice

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:42.190 
not too runny and you want a nice

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.160 
not too runny and you want a nice
consistent<00:06:43.000> mixture<00:06:43.420> make<00:06:43.690> sure<00:06:43.840> there's<00:06:44.050> no

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:44.170 
consistent mixture make sure there's no

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.190 
consistent mixture make sure there's no
pockets<00:06:44.680> of<00:06:44.800> silicon<00:06:45.280> in<00:06:45.430> there<00:06:45.640> or<00:06:46.200> unstirred

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:47.200 
pockets of silicon in there or unstirred

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.550 
pockets of silicon in there or unstirred
mineral<00:06:47.710> spirits<00:06:48.130> and<00:06:48.810> you<00:06:49.810> can<00:06:49.960> see<00:06:50.200> it's

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 
mineral spirits and you can see it's

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.650 
mineral spirits and you can see it's
viscous<00:06:51.130> but<00:06:51.370> it's<00:06:51.490> not<00:06:51.700> too<00:06:52.000> viscous<00:06:52.300> it's

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:52.660 
viscous but it's not too viscous it's

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.690 
viscous but it's not too viscous it's
not<00:06:52.840> going<00:06:53.020> to<00:06:53.080> be<00:06:53.350> really<00:06:54.130> hard<00:06:54.340> to<00:06:54.490> apply

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:54.700 
not going to be really hard to apply

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.790 
not going to be really hard to apply
it's<00:06:55.060> smooth<00:06:55.810> enough<00:06:56.080> that<00:06:56.260> you<00:06:56.380> can<00:06:56.530> take<00:06:56.770> a

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 
it's smooth enough that you can take a

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.350 
it's smooth enough that you can take a
brush<00:06:57.100> and<00:06:57.340> kind<00:06:57.460> of<00:06:57.610> paint<00:06:57.880> it<00:06:58.000> over<00:06:58.120> the

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.360 
brush and kind of paint it over the

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.590 
brush and kind of paint it over the
seams<00:06:58.630> like<00:06:58.930> you'll<00:06:59.080> need<00:06:59.230> to<00:06:59.730> so<00:07:00.730> that<00:07:01.060> is<00:07:01.300> how

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:01.600 
seams like you'll need to so that is how

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.050 
seams like you'll need to so that is how
you<00:07:01.630> make<00:07:02.070> mineral<00:07:03.070> spirit<00:07:03.430> or<00:07:03.550> that<00:07:03.820> is<00:07:03.970> how

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:04.060 
you make mineral spirit or that is how

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.990 
you make mineral spirit or that is how
you<00:07:04.120> make<00:07:04.330> silicon<00:07:04.810> seam<00:07:05.470> sealer<00:07:05.920> at<00:07:06.730> your

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.000 
you make silicon seam sealer at your

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.990 
you make silicon seam sealer at your
house<00:07:07.180> and<00:07:07.920> you<00:07:08.920> want<00:07:09.130> to<00:07:09.220> use<00:07:09.370> this<00:07:09.550> fairly

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 
house and you want to use this fairly

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.320 
house and you want to use this fairly
quick<00:07:10.300> it<00:07:10.510> will<00:07:10.750> start<00:07:11.140> to<00:07:11.260> set<00:07:11.530> eventually

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.330 
quick it will start to set eventually

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.540 
quick it will start to set eventually
but<00:07:13.330> uh<00:07:13.390> I'd<00:07:14.140> say<00:07:14.410> you<00:07:14.470> have<00:07:14.710> a<00:07:14.740> good<00:07:15.010> maybe

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:15.550 
but uh I'd say you have a good maybe

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.510 
but uh I'd say you have a good maybe
hour<00:07:15.820> of<00:07:16.150> use<00:07:16.360> out<00:07:16.570> of<00:07:16.600> it<00:07:16.870> you<00:07:17.680> don't<00:07:17.710> want<00:07:18.310> to

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:18.520 
hour of use out of it you don't want to

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.070 
hour of use out of it you don't want to
keep<00:07:18.670> it<00:07:18.820> out<00:07:18.940> in<00:07:19.000> the<00:07:19.210> Sun<00:07:19.480> and<00:07:19.750> you<00:07:19.840> kind<00:07:20.050> of

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:20.080 
keep it out in the Sun and you kind of

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.570 
keep it out in the Sun and you kind of
want<00:07:20.260> to<00:07:20.320> seal<00:07:20.530> off<00:07:20.710> the<00:07:20.860> jar<00:07:21.100> if<00:07:21.280> you're<00:07:21.460> not

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:21.580 
want to seal off the jar if you're not

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.060 
want to seal off the jar if you're not
using<00:07:21.820> it<00:07:22.000> immediately<00:07:22.410> but<00:07:23.410> definitely<00:07:23.890> try

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:24.070 
using it immediately but definitely try

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.730 
using it immediately but definitely try
to<00:07:24.130> use<00:07:24.340> it<00:07:24.490> pretty<00:07:24.640> fast<00:07:25.350> so<00:07:26.350> that's<00:07:26.470> how<00:07:26.680> you

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:26.740 
to use it pretty fast so that's how you

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.250 
to use it pretty fast so that's how you
make<00:07:26.800> seam<00:07:27.130> sealer<00:07:27.520> stay<00:07:28.030> tuned<00:07:28.330> and<00:07:28.720> my<00:07:28.990> next

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:29.260 
make seam sealer stay tuned and my next

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.290 
make seam sealer stay tuned and my next
video<00:07:29.500> will<00:07:29.770> be<00:07:29.800> actually<00:07:30.430> seam<00:07:30.850> sealing<00:07:31.120> the

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:31.300 
video will be actually seam sealing the

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.540 
video will be actually seam sealing the
tarp
