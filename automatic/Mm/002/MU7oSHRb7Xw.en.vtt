00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 this video shows you what i mean 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.820
 eat for a week in the final phase 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.800
 prepared so step number one is 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.240
 the preparation, the chicken meat to 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.950
 you need the following ingredients 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.230
 we need first I 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.029
 maybe it's clear I have two now 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.050
 kilo 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:23.880
 we need virgin olive oil and some 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.050
 will be spiced me after your choice 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.500
 I have many flavors 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.050
 Chinese and I still do 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.030
 bit of food starch in, I know 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.559
 not scientifically why I do that 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.780
 But I have the feeling that 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.879
 meat is when I do not 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.730
 quite as first on the screen first 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.379
 you need a big bowl best 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.680
 so actually have a glass of dig 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.379
 euro meets a small difference 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.620
 maybe in small pieces about 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.620
 big thumbs 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.090
 so maybe I finished now 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.520
 cut in small pieces and have 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.310
 Just put it in this one 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.970
 given damage 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:28.010
 next we take the olive oil and 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:39.770
 we make a simply beautiful on 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:42.410
 bit over what to take next 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.119
 we should also pay attention to the spice 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.399
 if your birthday is not with sugar app 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.649
 more sugar and salt should you 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.090
 be a bit more economical 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.710
 if you use a zock but 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:59.869
 can you make truffles pure like 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:02:02.000
 you like it and for you 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.649
 I know it will be 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.960
 bad if indeed not so dry 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:09.039
 volt I make another spoon of the 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.039
 food starch pure 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.670
 maybe because I'm one of those 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.290
 why watch the food? 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.269
 may not be that dry 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.200
 if it describes it 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.230
 maybe just down in the 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.230
 comments to 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.340
 so I'm a bit too 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.980
 what can learn 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.680
 so we all over to others now 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.570
 the whole thing just strong around that 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.890
 olive oil that the spice and the 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.900
 food starch as everywhere on her 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.810
 Come on a piece of cake is best for this 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.400
 if wooden spoon I first as 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.330
 The first time I did plastic 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.640
 it was taken right away 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.299
 By the way , my girlfriend fans spend 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.299
 not so funny 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:09.819
 so the whole looks like this now 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.599
 and that comes now at 180 degrees 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.939
 unheated so I'll do it in the 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.409
 unheated oven for one hour and one 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:18.049
 then I look for the meat 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:19.159
 completely through or not yet firm 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.629
 not yet through that I am again 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.170
 ten minutes in there if it by the 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:23.170
 take out 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:44.510
 so complicated 2 while the feature in 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.800
 oven gave more time for one hour and 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.330
 Now we'll take care of it a bit 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.580
 around the cabin 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.140
 I got the Italian art 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.590
 when vegetables are in it 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:57.760
 roccoli you inside beans onions 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:02.330
 olives and a bit small stuff 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:05.770
 In addition, I have extra help 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.770
 and that also comes in more gloomy than 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:13.010
 I use super here which the 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.890
 are the size 1 liter approximately 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.660
 there is the blue blanket in the can 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.760
 you have to fight with them in the squad 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.720
 like me because of the deformed and 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.880
 after that did not fit anymore 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.890
 They are available in three sets and the cost 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:37.880
 under five euros are relatively cheap and 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:39.320
 her neat slam so the vegetables 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:44.330
 I have now cleaned in the heads 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:46.570
 and the whole looks at the end like so 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.650
 made that vegetable youtube alone 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.090
 but the whole thing just another 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.930
 to make it tastier 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:57.100
 he is still a bit like that 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.100
 I do not really know an answer 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.910
 the girl maybe was one now 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.940
 a little shorter in just 50 minutes 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.770
 now I'm in the middle also took 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.830
 the pieces one middle are already 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:25.080
 through and it looks good so 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:27.760
 you can now also our tip 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.360
 I also have to fill the gates 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:34.750
 ikea 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:37.540
 Here I got myself 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.900
 her I just do completely full and 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:53.470
 that's about 100 grams 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:55.479
 the city I have every top the hook 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.820
 now bottled unfortunately it does not quite 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:06:00.370
 but it is not so bad 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.960
 how they pull into the troop they are 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.639
 not yet filled with chicken 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.120
 but not enough , that's it 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:05.590
 not bad 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.539
 I'll just do that tomorrow 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.680
 The day after tomorrow I'll do it again 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:12.280
 a little chicken and fill the 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:14.710
 remaining top even from the day esse 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.680
 I might already have counted 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.150
 it is three of his tuba though 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.760
 Of course not everything because that would want 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.620
 a little bit so what he is 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.910
 nor about the day I have spread my 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.169
 Just put something on the table 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.080
 I eat so in my day 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:29.590
 Definitions phase where I catch you tomorrow 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.320
 on 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:36.490
 there are two eggs together with 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:38.340
 about 125 grams of lean quark was after 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:44.139
 I go straight to the sport in the morning 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:48.430
 after the sport I drink 100 250 grams 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:50.860
 lean quark mixed with 30 grams of that 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:54.220
 whey protein and of course it gives way 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.630
 the training also a banana so 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.490
 when I arrived home after the 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.560
 sport in the shake, I'm kicking right 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:03.970
 As a dressing I eat my first 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:05.710
 tupper about two and a half to three 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:07.180
 hours later than me then short at home 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:10.650
 before I go to work the second 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:14.050
 top but I want to work first 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:16.360
 when i'm at work i'm around 18 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.550
 clock break then there is the next one 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:22.090
 next toba I do but synonymous 

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:24.340

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:26.169
 it's frozen and not yet 

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.060
 I'll just pack it on top 

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:30.039
 pack in a microwave with and 

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.900

 I have the kind pink lady the 

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.930
