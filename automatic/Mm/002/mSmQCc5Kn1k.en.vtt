comes to estimating body fat percentage

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.899 
comes to estimating body fat percentage
the<00:00:14.320> gold<00:00:14.530> standard<00:00:14.799> is<00:00:15.099> hydrostatic<00:00:15.400> Wayne

university it's not that cheap and it's
hard<00:00:22.210> to<00:00:22.240> find<00:00:22.570> so<00:00:23.140> what<00:00:23.650> are<00:00:23.679> better<00:00:23.980> options

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
hard to find so what are better options

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.970 
hard to find so what are better options
well<00:00:24.820> the<00:00:25.060> best<00:00:25.539> home<00:00:25.960> option<00:00:26.230> would<00:00:26.919> be

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
well the best home option would be

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.290 
well the best home option would be
something<00:00:27.279> called<00:00:27.550> an<00:00:27.669> ACK<00:00:27.880> you<00:00:28.089> measure

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
something called an ACK you measure

now<00:00:30.400> and<00:00:30.759> you<00:00:31.419> can<00:00:31.539> do<00:00:31.660> this<00:00:31.779> yourself<00:00:32.140> in<00:00:32.230> the

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:32.289 
now and you can do this yourself in the

privates your own home and I found it to
be<00:00:33.969> fairly<00:00:34.329> fairly<00:00:35.050> accurate<00:00:35.649> and<00:00:35.829> I<00:00:36.219> use<00:00:36.340> it

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
be fairly fairly accurate and I use it

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.279 
be fairly fairly accurate and I use it
with<00:00:36.610> a<00:00:36.640> lot<00:00:36.850> of<00:00:36.879> people<00:00:37.239> online<00:00:37.480> when<00:00:38.170> they're

at<00:00:38.410> home<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:39.640> first<00:00:39.850> thing<00:00:39.940> you<00:00:40.090> do<00:00:40.239> is<00:00:40.270> you

00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:40.539 
at home the first thing you do is you

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:43.290 
at home the first thing you do is you
locate<00:00:40.989> one<00:00:41.620> point<00:00:41.949> on<00:00:42.070> the<00:00:42.160> body<00:00:42.340> not<00:00:43.030> seven

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
right above what we call the super iliac

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.979 
right above what we call the super iliac

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
a pinch you're going to take the CalPERS

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.849 
a pinch you're going to take the CalPERS
and<00:00:52.660> push<00:00:53.289> the<00:00:54.010> meter<00:00:54.969> out<00:00:55.449> and<00:00:55.899> then<00:00:56.649> just

00:00:56.849 --> 00:00:56.859 
and push the meter out and then just

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:59.310

you<00:01:04.449> look<00:01:04.600> at<00:01:04.689> the<00:01:04.750> chart<00:01:04.989> you'll<00:01:05.259> give<00:01:05.590> you<00:01:05.680> an

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
you look at the chart you'll give you an

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.649 
you look at the chart you'll give you an
estimate<00:01:06.130> of<00:01:06.250> your<00:01:06.340> percent<00:01:06.820> body<00:01:06.939> fat<00:01:07.090> it's

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
estimate of your percent body fat it's

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.520 
estimate of your percent body fat it's
that<00:01:07.900> simple<00:01:08.229> now<00:01:09.189> something<00:01:09.580> more<00:01:10.570> effective

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
that simple now something more effective

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.789 
that simple now something more effective
and<00:01:11.680> much<00:01:12.040> more<00:01:12.250> accurate<00:01:12.759> would<00:01:13.150> be<00:01:13.390> an

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
and much more accurate would be an

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.560 
and much more accurate would be an
ultrasound<00:01:14.799> an<00:01:15.040> ultrasound<00:01:15.939> is<00:01:16.119> the<00:01:16.240> latest

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
ultrasound an ultrasound is the latest

bodymetrix<00:01:18.820> now<00:01:19.720> the<00:01:19.780> problem<00:01:20.140> with<00:01:20.290> CalPERS

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
bodymetrix now the problem with CalPERS

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.560 
bodymetrix now the problem with CalPERS
is<00:01:21.070> you<00:01:21.369> can<00:01:21.520> tend<00:01:21.729> not<00:01:21.820> to<00:01:22.030> pinch<00:01:22.240> it<00:01:22.390> up

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
is you can tend not to pinch it up

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.359 
is you can tend not to pinch it up
pinched<00:01:23.020> too<00:01:23.079> little<00:01:23.470> or<00:01:23.500> pinch<00:01:24.159> a<00:01:24.250> little

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
pinched too little or pinch a little

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.850 
pinched too little or pinch a little
more<00:01:24.700> depending<00:01:25.420> on<00:01:25.509> what's<00:01:26.350> going<00:01:26.680> on<00:01:26.799> I

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
more depending on what's going on I

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.789 
more depending on what's going on I
guess<00:01:27.159> but<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:28.119> ultrasound<00:01:28.750> is<00:01:28.960> very<00:01:29.500> simple

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
guess but the ultrasound is very simple

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.920 
guess but the ultrasound is very simple
to<00:01:29.950> use<00:01:30.070> all<00:01:30.430> you<00:01:30.700> do<00:01:30.880> still<00:01:31.420> just<00:01:31.600> stand<00:01:31.840> right

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
to use all you do still just stand right

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.539 
to use all you do still just stand right
there<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:34.750> have<00:01:34.899> an<00:01:35.110> ultrasound<00:01:35.350> device<00:01:35.829> you

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
there you have an ultrasound device you

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.760 
there you have an ultrasound device you
apply<00:01:36.820> the<00:01:36.880> gel<00:01:37.030> just<00:01:37.659> like<00:01:37.840> as<00:01:38.049> if<00:01:38.200> you<00:01:38.649> were

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
apply the gel just like as if you were

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.760 
apply the gel just like as if you were
checking<00:01:39.369> a<00:01:39.579> baby<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:41.020> applied<00:01:41.200> on<00:01:41.320> the<00:01:41.560> site

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
checking a baby you applied on the site

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.429 
checking a baby you applied on the site
and<00:01:42.490> you<00:01:42.610> do<00:01:42.820> you<00:01:43.119> anywhere<00:01:43.479> from<00:01:43.570> one<00:01:44.200> to

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
and you do you anywhere from one to

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.730 
and you do you anywhere from one to
