00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:08.269
 hello everyone and now we will 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:10.769
 disassemble such a speaker 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.900
 loudspeaker and so what is it from 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.880
 composed 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:20.369
 such is the speaker from the old radio he 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.800
 consists of a magnet and a coil here 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.619
 There are contacts to connect the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.070
 coil coil respectively attached 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.070
 on the paper membrane that sways 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.930
 on this dynamic let's remove for 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.930
 start paper membrane 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:55.969
 cut it around the perimeter of so here 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.969
 we actually see our coil 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.710
 the coil she keeps here such here 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:16.659
 gauze tissues and so here she is coil 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:20.460
 which moves inside magnetically 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:23.200
 such a magnet 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:31.960
 that is, here we have what we have here 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:37.270
 we have a selenite solenoid which when 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:39.250
 changing the current strength of this coil then 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:48.160
 pushes out of the magnetic field then 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:52.450
 retracts back and so here we are next 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:59.520
 watch the magnet to release our 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:04.750
 magnet from captivity other parts i 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:07.020
 I put here such a pusher and you can 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.020
 knock 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.140
 to knock out 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:26.489
 So 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:26.489
 flew here this thing from the center 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:36.700
 here again you remain with us a magnet 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:42.459
 here it is all made on glue therefore 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:46.239
 disassemble this device is enough 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.239
 not listening 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:03.910
 so we actually separated the ring 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:07.570
 such a magnet magnet it can 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.630
 to glue other metal 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:13.980
 objects or he glues himself to 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.980
 metal surface 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:27.760
 this is how we disassembled our speaker 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:32.830
 removed from his magnet note that here 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:38.160
 these are the details of which our 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:42.250
 solenoid they characterize the walls that 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.890
 iron which is used for their 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:49.210
 workmanship is clean enough and she 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:51.940
 absolutely not tempered and that is tempered 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.700
 iron but retains enough magnetism 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.900
 whereas illicit and pure iron is not 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.610
 containing impurities 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:03.180
 it does not save residual magnetism 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:07.210
 exactly such iron 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.210
 soft used to make 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.700
 different 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:16.410
 cores so that they do not save on 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.410
 enough magnetism 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.739
 subscribe to like start channel 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.670
 A lot of new interesting things are waiting for you 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:27.780
 and useful videos in science and technology 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.780
 thank you all for your attention
