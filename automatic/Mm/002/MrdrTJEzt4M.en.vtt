00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.090
 only the kickoff collection that is one 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.440
 leaves a little more time with the tigers 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.570
 I think in any case 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.360
 come now to the opening namely 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:34.970
 You can still bag the second chamber 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:37.700
 Let me be the first to tell you 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.260
 Unfortunately not all names are mentioned here 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.050
 the players are not lame under 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.250

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:54.530
 We have no idea then 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:58.040
 sebastian rudy the idea i believe about 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.750
 the idea then chandler and marcel 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.150
 Schmelzer distinctive I think so 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.460
 actually if I do some wrong ones 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.380

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.150
 a little harder jonathan 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.670

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:14.000
 I know Elijah and the others 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:15.650

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:24.190
 rare sticker zambia mehmedi halil 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:27.080
 altintop dortmund logo and huntelaar as 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:30.500
 as the smallest's classics I'd say 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:33.520
 to continue with the second title 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.520

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:43.669
 there we have the trees of wolfsburg 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:45.770

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:01.160

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:06.160
 next sticker we have the alliance 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:08.900
 arena then that's the keeper of 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.630
 Augsburg I believe hits means heated 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:15.050

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:20.500

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:32.650
 Cologne pushes the leverkusen and paderborn 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.490
 Those were the two bags 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.090
 actually not that bad 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.920
