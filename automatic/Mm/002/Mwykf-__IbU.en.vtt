00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 hello and today i will tell you how 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.849
 change the control of fifa 15 to 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.790
 the keyboard is standard there 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.030
 select only controls on the joystick 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.910
 either the board on the keyboard on the mouse so 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.830
 both on whether the gamepad joystick someone 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.510
 wants to play 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.150
 someone for other reasons refuses 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.099
 from this way of controlling the rest 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.550
 only want to play the keyboard and 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:33.860
 Now I will show how to change management 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:40.910
 fifa 15 on the keyboard initially go 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:44.969
 match let's say and press the arrow down 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:47.940
 on the keyboard to become an icon 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:53.690
 classic they are alternate so 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:57.360
 now press escape go to 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:01.020
 customization customization customization 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:06.920
 gamepad and now as you can see you 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.130
 so much keyboard further choose 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.820
 alternative 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.659
 Here's to those arrows into classes 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.009
 classic for example 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:21.360
 move up move down left 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.640
 and right on the buttons that we control 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.450
 there pass and strike and their like 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.810
 can't change 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.610
 on alternative up arrow 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.140
 move up that is all 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.180
 corresponds as in previous versions 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.710
 Well, then set up a pass for themselves 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.970
 I will personally have this cut 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.970
 w 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.970
 upstairs 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:52.320
 hit yes short groove with 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.440
 switch step running I had 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.960
 c key that is it 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.740
 switch to player adjustment 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.180
 precision q button 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:09.450
 the pace of running, in principle, I did not change 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:13.260
 jerk left shift I was basically well 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.710
 All here are the settings that I changed under 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.850
 myself 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.010
 actually on it all further click 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.940
 escape 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:27.240
 on an empty slot save your yours 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.840
 new management and then you can 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.630
 quietly play the keyboard to everyone 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.120
