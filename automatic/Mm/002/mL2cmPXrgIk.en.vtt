managed to deal with this minion in the
end<00:04:28.689> now<00:04:29.650> certainly<00:04:29.949> for<00:04:30.159> me<00:04:30.280> I<00:04:30.310> don't<00:04:30.699> have<00:04:30.789> a

00:04:30.929 --> 00:04:30.939 
end now certainly for me I don't have a

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:32.909 
end now certainly for me I don't have a
shadow<00:04:31.300> where<00:04:31.509> death<00:04:31.780> at<00:04:32.020> which<00:04:32.800> would

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
shadow where death at which would

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:34.439 
shadow where death at which would
actually<00:04:33.250> get<00:04:33.400> rid<00:04:33.639> of<00:04:33.699> that<00:04:33.939> card<00:04:34.210> right<00:04:34.419> away

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
actually get rid of that card right away

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.659 
actually get rid of that card right away
because<00:04:34.930> it's<00:04:35.080> out<00:04:35.199> of<00:04:35.409> basically<00:04:36.129> also<00:04:36.280> kills

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
because it's out of basically also kills

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.820 
because it's out of basically also kills
any<00:04:37.419> minion<00:04:37.870> that<00:04:37.900> has<00:04:38.139> more<00:04:38.409> than<00:04:38.560> five

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
any minion that has more than five

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.070 
any minion that has more than five
attack<00:04:39.189> but<00:04:39.430> I<00:04:39.550> can<00:04:39.879> still<00:04:40.569> go<00:04:40.750> for<00:04:40.960> my

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
attack but I can still go for my

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.779 
attack but I can still go for my
Stormwind<00:04:41.530> champion<00:04:41.560> and<00:04:42.099> now<00:04:42.460> I<00:04:42.490> need<00:04:42.699> to

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
Stormwind champion and now I need to

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:44.159 
Stormwind champion and now I need to
make<00:04:42.879> the<00:04:43.030> decision<00:04:43.449> what<00:04:43.539> do<00:04:43.689> I<00:04:43.780> did<00:04:43.960> well

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
make the decision what do I did well

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.080 
make the decision what do I did well
where<00:04:44.889> you<00:04:44.979> think<00:04:45.189> about<00:04:45.460> it<00:04:45.639> I<00:04:45.699> can<00:04:45.879> either

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
where you think about it I can either

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.240 
where you think about it I can either
deal<00:04:46.449> damage<00:04:46.479> to<00:04:47.050> his<00:04:47.229> minion<00:04:47.590> or<00:04:47.710> I<00:04:47.770> can<00:04:48.069> go

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
deal damage to his minion or I can go

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.939 
deal damage to his minion or I can go
for<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:48.580> hero<00:04:49.330> health<00:04:49.629> what<00:04:50.229> I<00:04:50.259> decide<00:04:50.650> to<00:04:50.680> do

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949 
for the hero health what I decide to do

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:52.589 
for the hero health what I decide to do
in<00:04:51.069> the<00:04:51.159> end<00:04:51.250> is<00:04:51.400> actually<00:04:51.550> go<00:04:51.939> for<00:04:52.180> his<00:04:52.270> hero's

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:52.599 
in the end is actually go for his hero's

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:54.119 
in the end is actually go for his hero's
health<00:04:52.840> the<00:04:53.289> reason<00:04:53.710> for<00:04:53.830> that<00:04:53.889> is<00:04:54.099> because

00:04:54.119 --> 00:04:54.129 
health the reason for that is because

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:56.040 
health the reason for that is because
what<00:04:54.580> would<00:04:54.729> he<00:04:54.909> likely<00:04:55.210> attack<00:04:55.569> in<00:04:55.719> the<00:04:55.780> next

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
what would he likely attack in the next

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.260 
what would he likely attack in the next
turn<00:04:56.199> well<00:04:56.469> he<00:04:56.919> would<00:04:57.069> always<00:04:57.310> go<00:04:57.669> free<00:04:57.909> storm

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
turn well he would always go free storm

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.360 
turn well he would always go free storm
in<00:04:58.419> champion<00:04:58.960> that<00:04:59.469> is<00:04:59.590> the<00:04:59.710> mean<00:04:59.889> that<00:05:00.039> he<00:05:00.190> can

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
in champion that is the mean that he can

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.980 
in champion that is the mean that he can
one-shot<00:05:00.580> that<00:05:01.150> is<00:05:01.270> Dominion<00:05:01.750> that<00:05:01.840> who

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
one-shot that is Dominion that who

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.040 
one-shot that is Dominion that who
actually<00:05:02.169> you<00:05:02.860> know<00:05:03.210> give<00:05:04.210> him<00:05:04.360> most<00:05:04.599> value

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
actually you know give him most value

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.230 
actually you know give him most value
for<00:05:05.349> his<00:05:05.530> son<00:05:05.860> for<00:05:06.190> his<00:05:06.310> fire<00:05:06.520> elemental<00:05:07.090> so

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
for his son for his fire elemental so

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.860 
for his son for his fire elemental so
there<00:05:07.509> we<00:05:07.569> go

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
there we go

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.080 
there we go
I<00:05:07.900> decide<00:05:08.440> to<00:05:08.560> hit<00:05:08.740> T<00:05:08.919> shaman<00:05:09.310> and<00:05:09.430> that<00:05:09.909> means

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
I decide to hit T shaman and that means

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.559 
I decide to hit T shaman and that means
he<00:05:10.240> got<00:05:10.360> only<00:05:10.719> nine<00:05:10.960> health<00:05:11.289> left<00:05:12.210> now<00:05:13.210> as<00:05:13.479> you

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:13.569 
he got only nine health left now as you

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:15.270 
he got only nine health left now as you
can<00:05:13.719> see<00:05:13.780> I<00:05:13.930> do<00:05:14.080> way<00:05:14.469> more<00:05:14.710> than<00:05:14.860> nine<00:05:15.039> health

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
can see I do way more than nine health

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.700 
can see I do way more than nine health
right<00:05:15.520> now<00:05:15.669> so<00:05:15.940> I<00:05:15.969> can<00:05:16.270> actually<00:05:16.710> probably

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
right now so I can actually probably

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.529 
right now so I can actually probably
kill<00:05:18.069> him<00:05:18.099> next<00:05:18.490> turn<00:05:18.610> or<00:05:18.819> maybe<00:05:19.029> return<00:05:19.330> often

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
kill him next turn or maybe return often

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:21.749 
kill him next turn or maybe return often
I<00:05:19.750> decided<00:05:20.110> to<00:05:20.229> use<00:05:20.349> the<00:05:20.500> hex<00:05:20.680> which<00:05:21.430> is<00:05:21.550> very

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 
I decided to use the hex which is very

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.850 
I decided to use the hex which is very
smart<00:05:22.090> of<00:05:22.180> him<00:05:22.210> but<00:05:22.750> it<00:05:22.960> does<00:05:23.199> make<00:05:23.409> it<00:05:23.439> a<00:05:23.590> tall

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
smart of him but it does make it a tall

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.999 
smart of him but it does make it a tall
so<00:05:24.069> he<00:05:24.189> will<00:05:24.370> be<00:05:24.490> forced<00:05:24.879> to<00:05:24.990> use<00:05:25.990> the<00:05:26.169> fire

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:27.009 
so he will be forced to use the fire

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:28.769 
so he will be forced to use the fire
elemental<00:05:27.310> right<00:05:27.610> there<00:05:27.789> only<00:05:28.090> told<00:05:28.449> me<00:05:28.629> and

00:05:28.769 --> 00:05:28.779 
elemental right there only told me and

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:29.760 
elemental right there only told me and
that<00:05:28.810> I<00:05:28.900> get<00:05:29.110> out<00:05:29.139> right<00:05:29.379> there<00:05:29.529> they<00:05:29.620> only

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
that I get out right there they only

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:30.450 
that I get out right there they only

I could do a holy Nova right now but I

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:52.369 
I could do a holy Nova right now but I
actually<00:05:51.279> make<00:05:51.580> a<00:05:51.610> little<00:05:51.789> bit<00:05:51.879> of<00:05:52.000> a<00:05:52.060> mistake
