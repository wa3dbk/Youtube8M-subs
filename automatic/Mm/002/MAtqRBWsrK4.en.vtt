block or the pod to create something i
don't<00:00:33.239> know<00:00:33.300> if<00:00:33.360> i<00:00:33.420> can<00:00:33.480> get<00:00:33.719> this<00:00:33.780> visible

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
don't know if i can get this visible

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.450 
don't know if i can get this visible
I've<00:00:34.649> drawn<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.570> really<00:00:36.570> like<00:00:37.219> to<00:00:38.219> do<00:00:38.370> this

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
I've drawn it really like to do this

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.770 
I've drawn it really like to do this
little<00:00:38.760> skit<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.239> can<00:00:39.360> see<00:00:39.540> what<00:00:39.660> I'm

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
little skit so you can see what I'm

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.590 
little skit so you can see what I'm
getting<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.350> basically<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.879> want<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.390> tail

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
getting it and basically I want the tail

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.190 
getting it and basically I want the tail
area<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:43.110> be<00:00:43.550> sufficient<00:00:44.600> large<00:00:45.600> enough<00:00:45.899> big

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
area to be sufficient large enough big

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.190 
area to be sufficient large enough big
enough<00:00:46.469> wide<00:00:46.860> enough<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.480> make<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.510> tail<00:00:48.870> fin

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
enough wide enough to make that tail fin

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.569 
enough wide enough to make that tail fin
not<00:00:49.800> overly<00:00:50.539> control<00:00:51.539> your<00:00:52.469> turns<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:53.340> other

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
not overly control your turns in other

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.220 
not overly control your turns in other
words<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.940> narrow<00:00:54.149> tail<00:00:54.390> board<00:00:54.719> with<00:00:55.199> a

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
words the narrow tail board with a

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:06.940 
words the narrow tail board with a
little<00:00:55.469> thin<00:00:55.860> I'll<00:00:56.039> do<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.280> quicks<00:00:56.520> again

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.610 

basically<00:01:08.600> that's<00:01:09.600> what<00:01:09.750> I'm<00:01:09.960> aiming<00:01:10.140> at<00:01:10.440> now

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
basically that's what I'm aiming at now

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.890 
basically that's what I'm aiming at now
is<00:01:10.890> something<00:01:11.160> which<00:01:11.460> has<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.360> much<00:01:12.660> greater

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
is something which has a much greater

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.220 
is something which has a much greater
surface<00:01:13.260> area<00:01:13.530> all<00:01:14.370> around<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.940> pin<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:16.020> top

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 
surface area all around the pin the top

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.410 
surface area all around the pin the top
in<00:01:16.500> there<00:01:16.710> with<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.670> increase<00:01:18.120> in<00:01:18.240> surface

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
in there with that increase in surface

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.800 
in there with that increase in surface
area<00:01:18.810> what<00:01:19.230> you're<00:01:19.380> getting<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.810> proportion

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
area what you're getting is a proportion

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.020 
area what you're getting is a proportion
of<00:01:21.900> surface<00:01:22.200> area<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.500> pin<00:01:22.920> area<00:01:23.250> which<00:01:23.850> is

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
of surface area to pin area which is

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.510 
of surface area to pin area which is
high<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:25.170> means<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.620> tail<00:01:25.800> fins<00:01:26.040> not<00:01:26.340> going

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
high that means the tail fins not going

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.710 
high that means the tail fins not going
to<00:01:26.580> have<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.820> grip<00:01:27.030> potential<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.600> it

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
to have the grip potential that it

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.880 
to have the grip potential that it
normally<00:01:27.840> would<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.200> with<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.530> standard

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
normally would have with the standard

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.010 
normally would have with the standard
tribe<00:01:29.070> cream<00:01:29.310> I'll<00:01:29.940> do<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> outline<00:01:30.540> for<00:01:30.930> the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
tribe cream I'll do the outline for the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:43.139 
tribe cream I'll do the outline for the
standard<00:01:31.290> try<00:01:31.860> between<00:01:32.040> proportions

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.789 

what<00:01:44.149> you'll<00:01:44.359> see<00:01:44.630> if<00:01:45.020> i<00:01:45.140> can<00:01:45.320> get<00:01:45.619> this

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
what you'll see if i can get this

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.660 
what you'll see if i can get this
sketched<00:01:46.130> in<00:01:46.369> a<00:01:46.399> little<00:01:46.640> bit<00:01:48.429> not<00:01:49.429> that<00:01:49.549> the

pin not that depends going to work
upside<00:01:51.439> down<00:01:52.390> with<00:01:53.390> that<00:01:53.539> decrease<00:01:54.020> you<00:01:54.200> can

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:54.319 
upside down with that decrease you can

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:56.260 
upside down with that decrease you can
see<00:01:54.469> that<00:01:54.500> if<00:01:54.740> in<00:01:54.950> area<00:01:55.100> now<00:01:55.460> only<00:01:55.819> has<00:01:56.119> to

see that if in area now only has to

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.020 
see that if in area now only has to
fulfill<00:01:56.689> or<00:01:56.990> take<00:01:57.289> control<00:01:57.649> of<00:01:57.799> a<00:01:58.069> narrowest

fulfill or take control of a narrowest
surface<00:01:59.899> area<00:02:00.189> isn't<00:02:01.189> that<00:02:01.429> terrible<00:02:01.759> I'm

surface area isn't that terrible I'm

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.699 
surface area isn't that terrible I'm
quite<00:02:02.179> a<00:02:02.209> good<00:02:02.299> sketcher<00:02:03.110> and<00:02:03.289> that<00:02:03.409> is<00:02:03.560> the

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:03.709 
quite a good sketcher and that is the

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:06.399 
quite a good sketcher and that is the
worst<00:02:04.039> wrongs<00:02:04.670> I've<00:02:04.880> done<00:02:04.909> enables<00:02:05.450> many

the<00:02:09.019> point<00:02:09.229> being<00:02:09.530> you<00:02:10.480> can<00:02:11.480> have<00:02:11.660> a<00:02:11.690> tribe<00:02:11.930> in

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
the point being you can have a tribe in

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.600 
the point being you can have a tribe in
its<00:02:12.379> short<00:02:12.590> and<00:02:12.860> wide<00:02:13.160> but<00:02:15.250> actually<00:02:16.250> they're

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
its short and wide but actually they're

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.910 
its short and wide but actually they're
not<00:02:16.640> that<00:02:16.849> widen<00:02:17.329> in<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:17.660> center<00:02:17.989> it's<00:02:18.620> more

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
not that widen in the center it's more

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.800 
not that widen in the center it's more
the<00:02:19.250> tail<00:02:19.489> in<00:02:19.849> relation<00:02:20.269> to<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.510> rest<00:02:20.599> of<00:02:20.720> the

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.360 
the tail in relation to the rest of the
planchette<00:02:21.200> so<00:02:21.590> you<00:02:21.680> get<00:02:21.769> this<00:02:21.860> nice<00:02:22.099> big

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
planchette so you get this nice big

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.490 
planchette so you get this nice big

whitetail it's not that square so it's

whitetail it's not that square so it's

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
young guys I guess it's probably not for

young guys I guess it's probably not for
the<00:02:38.959> older<00:02:39.260> dudes<00:02:39.440> as<00:02:39.560> much<00:02:39.769> you'll<00:02:40.310> get<00:02:40.579> that

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
the older dudes as much you'll get that

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.640 
the older dudes as much you'll get that
release<00:02:41.120> you'll<00:02:41.299> get<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.599> freedom<00:02:41.959> that<00:02:42.140> you

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
release you'll get the freedom that you

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.430 
release you'll get the freedom that you
normally<00:02:43.400> have<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:44.230> over<00:02:45.230> power<00:02:47.019> aboard<00:02:48.019> again

more about group so this way you got the

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.590 
more about group so this way you got the

you<00:02:59.090> don't<00:02:59.269> need<00:02:59.420> to<00:02:59.630> move<00:02:59.750> around<00:02:59.959> on

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
you don't need to move around on

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:01.780 
you don't need to move around on
something<00:03:00.380> that's<00:03:00.530> nice<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:00.709> short<00:03:01.069> so<00:03:01.639> for

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
something that's nice and short so for

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.680 
something that's nice and short so for
something<00:03:01.970> that's<00:03:02.090> like<00:03:02.920> let's<00:03:03.920> see<00:03:04.069> what's<00:03:04.310> a

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
something that's like let's see what's a

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.160 
something that's like let's see what's a
165<00:03:05.690> pounds<00:03:06.200> about<00:03:06.319> 17<00:03:06.799> kilos<00:03:07.840> that<00:03:08.840> guy<00:03:09.049> would

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
165 pounds about 17 kilos that guy would

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:17.110 
165 pounds about 17 kilos that guy would
be<00:03:09.200> riding<00:03:09.709> say<00:03:11.620> 58<00:03:14.799> look<00:03:15.799> just<00:03:16.190> under<00:03:16.430> 19<00:03:16.880> and

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
be riding say 58 look just under 19 and

be riding say 58 look just under 19 and
two<00:03:18.019> and<00:03:18.200> three<00:03:18.260> eighths<00:03:18.530> so<00:03:19.250> I<00:03:19.280> mean<00:03:19.430> it's

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
two and three eighths so I mean it's

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.370 
two and three eighths so I mean it's
going<00:03:19.849> to<00:03:20.000> paddle<00:03:20.329> quite<00:03:20.720> well<00:03:20.900> but<00:03:21.049> it's<00:03:21.169> not

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
going to paddle quite well but it's not

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.960 
going to paddle quite well but it's not
a<00:03:21.410> bulky<00:03:21.709> you<00:03:21.950> thick<00:03:22.130> chunky<00:03:22.519> board<00:03:22.700> it's<00:03:22.819> not

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
a bulky you thick chunky board it's not

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.539 
a bulky you thick chunky board it's not
a<00:03:23.000> 20<00:03:23.359> it's<00:03:23.750> still<00:03:23.959> a<00:03:23.989> normal<00:03:24.380> board<00:03:24.560> but<00:03:25.280> with

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
a 20 it's still a normal board but with

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:26.530 
a 20 it's still a normal board but with
the<00:03:25.639> surface<00:03:25.819> area<00:03:26.120> that's<00:03:26.269> going<00:03:26.299> to<00:03:26.450> allow

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
the surface area that's going to allow

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.860 
the surface area that's going to allow
you<00:03:26.720> to<00:03:26.900> do<00:03:27.079> radical<00:03:27.500> type<00:03:27.709> maneuvers<00:03:28.549> and<00:03:28.870> as

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
you to do radical type maneuvers and as

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.930 
you to do radical type maneuvers and as
I<00:03:30.049> said<00:03:30.109> before<00:03:30.400> plant<00:03:31.400> your<00:03:31.519> feet<00:03:31.700> in<00:03:31.849> one

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
I said before plant your feet in one

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.170 
I said before plant your feet in one
spot<00:03:32.620> it<00:03:33.620> means<00:03:33.889> you<00:03:33.980> really<00:03:34.130> do<00:03:34.400> aerials<00:03:34.970> to

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
spot it means you really do aerials to

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.539 
spot it means you really do aerials to
if<00:03:35.329> you're<00:03:35.480> one<00:03:35.599> of<00:03:35.630> those<00:03:35.780> kind<00:03:36.079> of<00:03:36.109> people

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
if you're one of those kind of people

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.640 
if you're one of those kind of people
and<00:03:37.549> if<00:03:37.669> a<00:03:37.760> bigger<00:03:37.940> guy<00:03:38.150> gets<00:03:38.389> one<00:03:38.599> it's<00:03:39.319> going

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
and if a bigger guy gets one it's going

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.740 
and if a bigger guy gets one it's going
to<00:03:39.709> have<00:03:39.829> that<00:03:39.980> glide<00:03:40.250> and<00:03:40.400> flow<00:03:40.609> of<00:03:40.750> something

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
to have that glide and flow of something

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.710 
to have that glide and flow of something
from<00:03:42.370> probably<00:03:43.370> from<00:03:43.519> the<00:03:43.639> 80s<00:03:44.000> and<00:03:44.060> 90s<00:03:44.150> when

from probably from the 80s and 90s when

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.599 
from probably from the 80s and 90s when

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
boards were wider and thicker anyway it

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.490 
boards were wider and thicker anyway it

some<00:03:56.630> stupid<00:03:56.900> little<00:03:57.170> quirky<00:03:57.560> little<00:03:57.680> phrase

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
some stupid little quirky little phrase

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.980 
some stupid little quirky little phrase
but<00:03:58.970> I<00:03:59.030> think<00:03:59.210> it's<00:03:59.300> going<00:03:59.390> to<00:03:59.450> be<00:03:59.570> really<00:03:59.720> good

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
but I think it's going to be really good

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.080 
but I think it's going to be really good
and<00:04:00.170> the<00:04:00.530> last<00:04:00.740> one<00:04:00.950> my<00:04:01.430> neck<00:04:01.640> was<00:04:01.790> looking

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
and the last one my neck was looking

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.370 
and the last one my neck was looking
terrible<00:04:02.510> so<00:04:03.070> adjusted<00:04:04.070> that<00:04:04.220> okay<00:04:05.170> sign<00:04:06.170> that

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
terrible so adjusted that okay sign that

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.650 
terrible so adjusted that okay sign that
one<00:04:06.500> off
