give me a 3 pin UK plug you then have

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.910 
give me a 3 pin UK plug you then have
here<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.049> larger<00:02:07.799> type<00:02:08.720> charger<00:02:09.920> transformer

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
here the larger type charger transformer

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.369 
here the larger type charger transformer
itself<00:02:11.300> so<00:02:12.300> these<00:02:12.420> are<00:02:12.660> slight<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.170> click

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
itself so these are slight and click

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.930 
itself so these are slight and click
together

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
together

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.670 
together
this<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.120> your<00:02:15.330> 10<00:02:15.570> watt<00:02:15.780> device<00:02:16.110> giving<00:02:16.560> out

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
this that your 10 watt device giving out

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.390 
this that your 10 watt device giving out
2.1<00:02:17.400> amps<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:17.910> 5<00:02:18.330> volts<00:02:18.810> it's<00:02:19.230> more<00:02:19.860> powerful

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
2.1 amps and 5 volts it's more powerful

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.870 
2.1 amps and 5 volts it's more powerful
than<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:21.150> normal<00:02:21.450> iPhone<00:02:22.410> charger<00:02:22.710> etc<00:02:23.460> and

now are we going to move on to the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.650 
now are we going to move on to the
actual<00:02:26.510> iPad<00:02:27.510> itself<00:02:29.240> okay<00:02:30.240> let's<00:02:30.420> get<00:02:30.510> the

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
not to get too many reflections let's

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.450 
not to get too many reflections let's
just<00:03:15.090> pair<00:03:15.330> it<00:03:15.360> on<00:03:15.590> pretty<00:03:16.590> much<00:03:16.800> always<00:03:17.040> these

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
just pair it on pretty much always these

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.820 
just pair it on pretty much always these
devices<00:03:18.030> come<00:03:18.270> with<00:03:18.300> enough<00:03:18.660> charge<00:03:18.990> to<00:03:19.080> to

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
devices come with enough charge to to

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:20.750 
devices come with enough charge to to
get<00:03:19.980> you<00:03:20.100> started

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
get you started

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.280 
get you started
so<00:03:21.240> what's<00:03:21.450> it<00:03:21.540> pairing<00:03:21.840> up<00:03:21.930> although<00:03:22.110> this

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
so what's it pairing up although this

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.870 
so what's it pairing up although this
isn't<00:03:22.470> going<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.740> be<00:03:22.800> a<00:03:22.830> start-up<00:03:23.370> setup<00:03:23.760> video

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
isn't going to be a start-up setup video

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.210 
isn't going to be a start-up setup video
I<00:03:24.270> just<00:03:24.570> want<00:03:24.840> to<00:03:24.930> show<00:03:25.110> up<00:03:25.230> show<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.770> the

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
I just want to show up show the the

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.420 
I just want to show up show the the
screen<00:03:26.580> at<00:03:26.790> least<00:03:26.970> coming<00:03:27.330> on<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:28.430> obviously

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
screen at least coming on and obviously

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.450 
screen at least coming on and obviously
a<00:03:29.460> 7.9<00:03:30.240> inch<00:03:30.390> diagonal<00:03:30.900> screen<00:03:31.290> which<00:03:31.470> is<00:03:31.620> 2048

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
a 7.9 inch diagonal screen which is 2048

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.940 
a 7.9 inch diagonal screen which is 2048

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
bucket loads on there that I'm not going

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.610 
bucket loads on there that I'm not going
to<00:04:02.970> whisk<00:04:03.150> through<00:04:03.240> in<00:04:03.360> particular<00:04:03.630> also<00:04:04.380> I've

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
to whisk through in particular also I've

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.310 
to whisk through in particular also I've
got<00:04:04.680> a<00:04:04.800> few<00:04:05.040> that<00:04:05.130> I<00:04:05.190> need<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:05.490> update<00:04:05.610> for<00:04:06.120> the

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
got a few that I need to update for the

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.740 
got a few that I need to update for the
iPad<00:04:07.320> versions<00:04:07.970> all<00:04:08.970> in<00:04:09.180> all<00:04:09.300> I<00:04:09.540> would<00:04:09.600> say

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
iPad versions all in all I would say

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.570 
iPad versions all in all I would say
it's<00:04:10.230> very<00:04:10.530> very<00:04:10.770> comfortable<00:04:10.950> and<00:04:11.250> easy<00:04:11.460> to

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
it's very very comfortable and easy to

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.950 
it's very very comfortable and easy to
hold<00:04:11.790> and<00:04:11.970> use<00:04:12.210> and<00:04:12.360> I<00:04:12.390> think<00:04:12.420> that's<00:04:12.720> one<00:04:12.870> the

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:12.960 
hold and use and I think that's one the

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.170 
hold and use and I think that's one the
biggest<00:04:13.230> advantage<00:04:13.800> of<00:04:14.100> this<00:04:14.370> new<00:04:14.700> shape<00:04:14.940> and

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
biggest advantage of this new shape and

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.479 
biggest advantage of this new shape and
style<00:04:15.390> and<00:04:15.630> design<00:04:15.980> nothing<00:04:16.980> gets<00:04:17.130> in<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.310> way

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
style and design nothing gets in the way

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.970 
style and design nothing gets in the way
it<00:04:17.730> feels<00:04:17.910> really<00:04:18.330> good<00:04:18.630> in<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:18.870> hand<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.320> it

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
it feels really good in the hand and it

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.950 
it feels really good in the hand and it
doesn't<00:04:20.250> have<00:04:20.370> any<00:04:20.489> kind<00:04:20.700> of<00:04:20.790> tiring<00:04:21.299> points

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
doesn't have any kind of tiring points

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.860 
doesn't have any kind of tiring points
so<00:04:22.080> there's<00:04:22.260> no<00:04:22.730> angle<00:04:23.730> or<00:04:23.880> any<00:04:24.030> way<00:04:24.330> I've<00:04:24.510> held

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
so there's no angle or any way I've held

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.200 
so there's no angle or any way I've held
it<00:04:25.080> both<00:04:25.350> landscape<00:04:25.919> and<00:04:26.190> portrait

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
it both landscape and portrait

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.909 
it both landscape and portrait
where<00:04:27.419> I<00:04:27.449> found<00:04:27.690> its<00:04:27.840> @g<00:04:28.139> self-cutting<00:04:28.590> into

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
where I found its @g self-cutting into

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.980 
where I found its @g self-cutting into
my<00:04:29.009> hand<00:04:29.250> at<00:04:29.550> all<00:04:29.819> my<00:04:30.150> fingers<00:04:30.360> at<00:04:30.630> all<00:04:30.780> nothing

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
my hand at all my fingers at all nothing

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.150 
my hand at all my fingers at all nothing
that's<00:04:31.259> a<00:04:31.319> really<00:04:31.500> important<00:04:31.919> point<00:04:32.039> because

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
that's a really important point because

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.879 
that's a really important point because
in<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.550> older<00:04:32.789> design<00:04:33.090> original<00:04:33.960> iPads<00:04:34.380> both

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
in the older design original iPads both

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.200 
in the older design original iPads both
because<00:04:35.190> of<00:04:35.220> the<00:04:35.310> weight<00:04:35.520> and<00:04:35.759> their<00:04:35.970> shape

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
because of the weight and their shape

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.879 
because of the weight and their shape
actually<00:04:37.020> used<00:04:37.169> to<00:04:37.229> be<00:04:37.319> a<00:04:37.349> little<00:04:37.560> bit<00:04:37.650> painful

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
actually used to be a little bit painful

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.770 
actually used to be a little bit painful
