hello<00:00:01.290> whip<00:00:01.560> runs<00:00:01.800> shrug<00:00:02.159> here<00:00:02.429> welcome<00:00:02.939> to

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
hello whip runs shrug here welcome to

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.630 
hello whip runs shrug here welcome to
what<00:00:03.389> is<00:00:03.600> and<00:00:04.020> this<00:00:04.650> episode<00:00:05.100> today<00:00:05.310> we're

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
what is and this episode today we're

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.710 
what is and this episode today we're
going<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:05.819> be<00:00:05.910> looking<00:00:06.000> at<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.240> monostable

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
going to be looking at a monostable

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.200 
going to be looking at a monostable
circuit<00:00:07.379> so<00:00:08.309> what<00:00:08.700> does<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:08.880> monostable

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
circuit so what does a monostable

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.410 
circuit so what does a monostable
circuit<00:00:09.809> it's<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.889> circuit<00:00:11.429> which<00:00:11.730> limits<00:00:12.179> the

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
circuit it's a circuit which limits the

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.839 
circuit it's a circuit which limits the
output<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.440> redstone<00:00:13.799> signal<00:00:14.250> when

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
output of a redstone signal when

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.689 
output of a redstone signal when
inputted<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.900> no<00:00:16.170> matter<00:00:16.320> what<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:17.250> input<00:00:17.279> is

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
inputted and no matter what the input is

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.189 
inputted and no matter what the input is
the<00:00:17.940> output<00:00:18.119> will<00:00:18.510> always<00:00:18.869> be<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.170> same

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
the output will always be the same

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.010 
the output will always be the same
length<00:00:19.710> unless<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.789> input<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.539> shorter<00:00:21.990> than

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
length unless the input is shorter than

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.560 
length unless the input is shorter than
the<00:00:22.289> output<00:00:22.710> then<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.789> need<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.180> signal

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
the output then you need a signal

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.210 
the output then you need a signal
extender<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:25.519> a<00:00:26.519> quick<00:00:26.910> example<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.890> us<00:00:28.890> here

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
extender so a quick example is us here

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.420 
extender so a quick example is us here
so<00:00:29.250> we've<00:00:29.699> got<00:00:29.939> our<00:00:30.230> input<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.949> when<00:00:32.070> we<00:00:32.189> flick

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
so we've got our input and when we flick

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.510 
so we've got our input and when we flick
the<00:00:32.550> slaver<00:00:33.649> short<00:00:34.649> pulse<00:00:34.890> will<00:00:35.070> be<00:00:35.160> sent<00:00:35.399> down

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
the slaver short pulse will be sent down

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.810 
the slaver short pulse will be sent down
the<00:00:35.700> output<00:00:36.230> we<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.440> flick<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:37.800> again<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.309> the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
the output we can flick it again and the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.850 
the output we can flick it again and the
same<00:00:39.000> thing<00:00:39.059> will<00:00:39.360> happen<00:00:39.390> when<00:00:40.350> we<00:00:40.500> turn<00:00:40.739> it

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
same thing will happen when we turn it

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.000 
same thing will happen when we turn it
off<00:00:41.010> nothing<00:00:41.700> will<00:00:41.820> happen<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.360> output<00:00:43.010> so

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
off nothing will happen to the output so

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.950 
off nothing will happen to the output so
how<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.250> works<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:45.030> can<00:00:45.480> see<00:00:45.539> here<00:00:45.809> we've

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
how it works is you can see here we've

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.069 
how it works is you can see here we've
got<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.170> torch<00:00:46.620> powering<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:48.180> store<00:00:48.450> chair<00:00:48.809> and

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
got a torch powering the store chair and

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.110 
got a torch powering the store chair and
we'll<00:00:49.200> put<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.410> repeater<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:49.980> middle<00:00:50.190> when

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
we'll put a repeater in the middle when

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.290 
we'll put a repeater in the middle when
when<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:52.020> gets<00:00:52.230> an<00:00:52.440> input<00:00:52.910> this<00:00:53.910> repeater<00:00:54.210> is

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
when this gets an input this repeater is

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.810 
when this gets an input this repeater is
set<00:00:54.510> for<00:00:54.870> Tex<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.530> take<00:00:55.860> four<00:00:56.190> texts<00:00:56.579> for<00:00:56.730> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
set for Tex so take four texts for the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.689 
set for Tex so take four texts for the
signal<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.210> get<00:00:57.449> from<00:00:57.660> here<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:57.989> here<00:00:58.530> but<00:00:59.520> this

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
signal to get from here to here but this

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.049 
signal to get from here to here but this
torch<00:01:00.000> only<00:01:00.359> takes<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.780> think<00:01:00.809> it's<00:01:01.109> one<00:01:02.059> to

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
torch only takes I think it's one to

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.830 
torch only takes I think it's one to
text<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.809> turn<00:01:04.140> off<00:01:04.729> so<00:01:05.729> there'll<00:01:06.390> be<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.570> to

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
text to turn off so there'll be a to

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.649 
text to turn off so there'll be a to
tech<00:01:07.080> gap<00:01:07.439> where<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.790> torch<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.390> allowed<00:01:09.630> to

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
tech gap where this torch is allowed to

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.620 
tech gap where this torch is allowed to
turn<00:01:09.990> on<00:01:10.939> so<00:01:12.229> that<00:01:13.229> effectively<00:01:14.330> though<00:01:15.330> that

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
turn on so that effectively though that

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.310 
turn on so that effectively though that
there<00:01:15.869> allows<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.740> short<00:01:17.700> post<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.360> be<00:01:18.930> output

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
there allows a short post to be output

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.649 
there allows a short post to be output
now<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.070> can<00:01:20.430> add<00:01:20.700> more<00:01:21.060> repeaters<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
now you can add more repeaters in the

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.249 
now you can add more repeaters in the
middle<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.350> extend<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.770> signal<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:24.259> this

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
middle to extend the signal and this

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.020 
middle to extend the signal and this
particular<00:01:26.570> device<00:01:27.570> works<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.610> or<00:01:29.610> can<00:01:29.850> have<00:01:29.970> a

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
particular device works on or can have a

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.010 
particular device works on or can have a
three<00:01:30.329> tek<00:01:31.130> repeater<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.430> middle<00:01:33.020> thus

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
three tek repeater in the middle thus

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.690 
three tek repeater in the middle thus
giving<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.799> one<00:01:35.490> tech<00:01:35.790> output<00:01:37.100> so<00:01:38.100> that's<00:01:38.460> what

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
giving a one tech output so that's what

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.999 
giving a one tech output so that's what
is<00:01:38.880> now<00:01:39.600> there's<00:01:40.170> many<00:01:40.350> different<00:01:40.439> designs

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
is now there's many different designs

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.840 
is now there's many different designs
one<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.610> preferred<00:01:42.180> designs<00:01:42.659> at<00:01:42.869> least<00:01:43.049> is

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
one of the preferred designs at least is

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.460 
one of the preferred designs at least is
this<00:01:44.850> here<00:01:46.850> let's<00:01:47.850> kind<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.329> think<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.320> as<00:01:49.439> a

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
this here let's kind of think of it as a

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.190 
this here let's kind of think of it as a
vertical<00:01:50.100> version<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.540> we've<00:01:51.930> got

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
vertical version of this so we've got

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.550 
vertical version of this so we've got
the<00:01:52.860> two<00:01:53.070> torches<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.990> repeater<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.470> the

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
the two torches the repeater in the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.109 
the two torches the repeater in the
middle<00:01:55.770> we're<00:01:56.250> going<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.460> say<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.729> vortex

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
middle we're going to say that vortex

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.459 
middle we're going to say that vortex
and<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:59.460> wire<00:01:59.700> leading<00:02:00.149> from<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.600> torch<00:02:00.899> to

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
and the wire leading from this torch to

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.130 
and the wire leading from this torch to
this<00:02:01.590> torch<00:02:02.030> now<00:02:03.030> we've<00:02:03.270> got<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.600> input<00:02:03.960> down

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
this torch now we've got the input down

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.550 
this torch now we've got the input down
here<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.670> output<00:02:06.180> over<00:02:06.570> here

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
here and the output over here

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.979 
here and the output over here
so<00:02:09.369> we<00:02:09.910> can<00:02:10.060> actually<00:02:10.239> just<00:02:10.569> throw<00:02:10.780> lever

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
so we can actually just throw lever

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.589 
so we can actually just throw lever
directly<00:02:11.590> on<00:02:11.739> their<00:02:11.920> block<00:02:12.160> and<00:02:12.640> power<00:02:13.239> it<00:02:13.420> and

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
directly on their block and power it and

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:19.740 
directly on their block and power it and
you<00:02:13.870> can<00:02:14.020> see<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.290> flash<00:02:14.680> there<00:02:18.330> so<00:02:19.330> what

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
you can see the flash there so what

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.650 
you can see the flash there so what
going<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:19.959> be<00:02:20.080> used<00:02:20.319> for<00:02:20.590> there's<00:02:21.099> not<00:02:21.280> many

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
going to be used for there's not many

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.199 
going to be used for there's not many
conventional<00:02:22.660> uses<00:02:23.110> in<00:02:23.349> general<00:02:24.280> redstone<00:02:25.000> I

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
conventional uses in general redstone I

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:32.339 
conventional uses in general redstone I
guess<00:02:26.610> but<00:02:28.140> it's<00:02:29.140> used<00:02:29.500> in<00:02:29.970> circuits<00:02:31.349> for

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
guess but it's used in circuits for

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.309 
guess but it's used in circuits for
things<00:02:32.560> like<00:02:32.650> piston<00:02:33.580> t<00:02:33.730> flip-flops<00:02:34.209> so<00:02:35.019> here

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
things like piston t flip-flops so here

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.740 
things like piston t flip-flops so here
we<00:02:35.380> go<00:02:35.410> I've<00:02:35.650> got<00:02:35.739> a<00:02:35.860> very<00:02:36.519> basic<00:02:36.750> personality

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
we go I've got a very basic personality

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.759 
we go I've got a very basic personality
flip-flop<00:02:38.410> we<00:02:39.130> inflict<00:02:39.550> the<00:02:39.640> sleep<00:02:39.849> once<00:02:40.769> this

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
flip-flop we inflict the sleep once this

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.340 
flip-flop we inflict the sleep once this
block<00:02:42.160> we<00:02:42.430> dropped<00:02:42.790> by<00:02:43.209> because<00:02:43.690> as<00:02:44.170> you<00:02:44.319> can

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
block we dropped by because as you can

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.800 
block we dropped by because as you can
see<00:02:44.500> here<00:02:47.730> this<00:02:48.730> mono<00:02:49.060> step<00:02:49.269> is<00:02:49.360> a<00:02:49.420> little<00:02:49.720> bit

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
see here this mono step is a little bit

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.949 
see here this mono step is a little bit
different<00:02:50.080> uses<00:02:50.260> a<00:02:50.380> piston<00:02:50.860> retracting<00:02:51.670> off

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
different uses a piston retracting off

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.509 
different uses a piston retracting off
of<00:02:52.959> this<00:02:53.349> repeater<00:02:53.739> here<00:02:53.799> so<00:02:54.010> this<00:02:54.099> repeated

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
of this repeater here so this repeated

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.170 
of this repeater here so this repeated
powers<00:02:55.120> this<00:02:55.299> block<00:02:55.599> and<00:02:56.760> but<00:02:57.760> this<00:02:57.910> block<00:02:58.150> is

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
powers this block and but this block is

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.309 
powers this block and but this block is
only<00:02:58.540> down<00:02:58.840> there<00:02:59.110> for<00:02:59.440> one<00:02:59.590> tech<00:02:59.890> so<00:03:00.730> or<00:03:01.319> it

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
only down there for one tech so or it

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.009 
only down there for one tech so or it
could<00:03:02.560> be<00:03:02.790> shorter<00:03:03.790> than<00:03:03.819> that<00:03:03.970> so<00:03:04.840> this

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
could be shorter than that so this

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.500 
could be shorter than that so this
person's<00:03:05.530> like<00:03:05.769> well<00:03:06.130> I've<00:03:06.430> got<00:03:06.459> to<00:03:06.819> push<00:03:07.269> out

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
person's like well I've got to push out

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.330 
person's like well I've got to push out
but<00:03:07.780> then<00:03:07.989> it<00:03:08.170> realizes<00:03:08.739> that<00:03:08.769> it<00:03:09.069> doesn't

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
but then it realizes that it doesn't

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.449 
but then it realizes that it doesn't
have<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:09.580> full<00:03:09.760> 1.5<00:03:10.239> tech<00:03:10.660> it's<00:03:11.530> required<00:03:12.130> to

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
have the full 1.5 tech it's required to

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.400 
have the full 1.5 tech it's required to
push<00:03:12.700> out<00:03:12.910> so<00:03:13.150> it<00:03:13.269> drops<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.750> block<00:03:13.959> because

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
push out so it drops the block because

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:20.539 
push out so it drops the block because
it<00:03:14.739> sucks<00:03:15.070> back<00:03:15.310> in<00:03:15.519> so<00:03:16.480> quickly<00:03:18.180> so<00:03:19.180> anything

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
it sucks back in so quickly so anything

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.539 
it sucks back in so quickly so anything
this<00:03:21.549> is<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.790> d<00:03:21.970> flip-flop<00:03:22.000> and<00:03:23.370> now<00:03:24.370> there's

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
this is the d flip-flop and now there's

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.250 
this is the d flip-flop and now there's
not<00:03:24.700> nothing<00:03:25.000> much<00:03:25.420> more<00:03:25.720> to<00:03:25.840> say<00:03:26.049> on<00:03:26.079> the

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
not nothing much more to say on the

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.220 
not nothing much more to say on the
subject<00:03:26.290> I'm<00:03:27.250> afraid<00:03:28.060> but<00:03:30.359> yeah<00:03:31.359> it's<00:03:32.079> the

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
subject I'm afraid but yeah it's the

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.130 
subject I'm afraid but yeah it's the
kind<00:03:32.440> of<00:03:32.470> thing<00:03:32.620> you<00:03:33.180> you<00:03:34.180> need<00:03:34.510> to<00:03:34.540> know<00:03:34.840> if

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
kind of thing you you need to know if

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.190 
kind of thing you you need to know if
you<00:03:35.290> want<00:03:35.440> to<00:03:35.620> know<00:03:35.829> more<00:03:36.069> advanced<00:03:36.370> circuits

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
you want to know more advanced circuits

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.580 
you want to know more advanced circuits
so<00:03:38.200> anyway<00:03:39.040> thanks<00:03:39.370> for<00:03:39.400> watching<00:03:39.730> and<00:03:40.590> this

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
so anyway thanks for watching and this

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.199 
so anyway thanks for watching and this
is<00:03:41.769> shrug<00:03:42.160> from<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.489> red<00:03:42.670> cent<00:03:42.910> velton

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
is shrug from the red cent velton

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.720 
is shrug from the red cent velton
