 semester for the student masnoticias 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:20.620
 in the news upv the department of 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.449
 new technologies work 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.490
 constantly to improve 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:27.370
 learning experiences in the 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.470
 ibi learning learning modalities for 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.599
 thus increase the offer of courses and the 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.220
 number of students spending the days 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:35.470
 currently costs three servers 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.599
 where the platforms of 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.000
 new technologies the first server is 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:42.340
 the server where you are currently 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.830
 mantis is the current platform that by 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.349
 transition in 2014 will happen the new 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.410
 platform the second platform in a 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:53.080
 testing platform in which we do 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:56.139
 evidence through new 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:59.680
 requirements and would go through a 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:01.840
 optimization test cycle and up 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.080
 that complete cycle would not happen and it 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.120
 would deploy to the new platform the 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.880
 new software will be used from 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.400
 first half of 2014 and will continue 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.680
 running in parallel with the 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.680
 mantis platform until finishing the 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.620
 transition stage engineering software 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:24.160
 new technologies we have implemented the 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:26.500
 new 2.5 plus platform with excellent 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.330
 features that topicals handle this 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.460
 of these characteristics manages 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.110
 security and usability that wants to be 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.930
 that ability that we can access this 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:38.350
 new platform from mobile media and 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:41.800
 tablets we are currently doing 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:44.020
 load tests and regulated tests of 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.419
 hacking this platform we want to measure 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.729
 the level of usability and load and 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:50.590
 concurrency of the users and the level 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:54.130
 of security that this new 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:57.160
 platform and level it and find 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:59.590
 patterns that help us regulate and 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.349
 avoid to the maximum that we here in the 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:06.389
 new platform these are the facts 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:06.389
 that were news in the upv
