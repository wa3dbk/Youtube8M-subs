like<00:03:04.910> I<00:03:05.000> said<00:03:05.150> I've<00:03:05.269> missed<00:03:05.450> out<00:03:05.569> on<00:03:05.630> the

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
like I said I've missed out on the

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.170 
like I said I've missed out on the
spizike<00:03:06.290> so<00:03:06.530> this<00:03:06.829> was<00:03:07.040> one<00:03:07.610> of<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.790> closest

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
spizike so this was one of the closest

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.789 
spizike so this was one of the closest
thing<00:03:08.329> is<00:03:08.540> I<00:03:08.630> got<00:03:08.780> both<00:03:08.989> colorways<00:03:09.470> and<00:03:09.650> once

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
thing is I got both colorways and once

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.599 
thing is I got both colorways and once
you<00:03:09.980> know<00:03:10.459> big<00:03:11.799> lot<00:03:12.799> of<00:03:12.889> people's<00:03:13.160> not<00:03:13.310> into

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
you know big lot of people's not into

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:15.729 
you know big lot of people's not into
this<00:03:13.730> physics<00:03:14.150> I<00:03:14.389> actually<00:03:14.690> think<00:03:15.560> they're

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
this physics I actually think they're

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.590 
this physics I actually think they're
hot<00:03:15.889> not<00:03:16.250> every<00:03:16.579> color<00:03:16.790> either<00:03:16.970> drop<00:03:17.299> his<00:03:17.450> hot

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
hot not every color either drop his hot

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.280 
hot not every color either drop his hot
way<00:03:17.810> oh<00:03:18.109> I<00:03:19.100> think<00:03:19.370> it's<00:03:19.639> a<00:03:19.700> hot<00:03:19.880> shoe<00:03:20.090> so<00:03:20.989> we'll

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
way oh I think it's a hot shoe so we'll

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.990 
way oh I think it's a hot shoe so we'll
just<00:03:21.319> do<00:03:21.500> a<00:03:21.530> quick<00:03:21.739> rundown<00:03:22.010> I<00:03:22.459> think<00:03:22.880> we're
