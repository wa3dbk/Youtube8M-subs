00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.170 
to really go through that anymore so I
think<00:05:14.310> that's<00:05:14.550> one<00:05:14.760> of<00:05:14.790> the<00:05:14.850> things<00:05:14.910> that's

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
think that's one of the things that's

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.480 
think that's one of the things that's
making<00:05:15.540> me<00:05:15.690> not<00:05:16.080> enjoy<00:05:16.320> model<00:05:16.650> 1<00:05:16.740> for<00:05:16.920> 3<00:05:17.130> and

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
making me not enjoy model 1 for 3 and

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.520 
making me not enjoy model 1 for 3 and
that's<00:05:17.520> going<00:05:18.000> for<00:05:18.180> moobs<00:05:18.360> so<00:05:18.660> hopefully<00:05:19.440> you
