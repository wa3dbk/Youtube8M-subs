and<00:05:40.850> the<00:05:40.940> important<00:05:41.390> aspect<00:05:42.020> is<00:05:42.169> to<00:05:42.200> not<00:05:42.560> just

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
and the important aspect is to not just

flying past Mach 1 is a definitely an

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.330 
flying past Mach 1 is a definitely an
excitement<00:06:33.650> but<00:06:33.800> you<00:06:34.010> don't<00:06:34.190> necessarily

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:34.340 
excitement but you don't necessarily

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.240 
excitement but you don't necessarily
feel<00:06:35.090> that<00:06:35.330> you're<00:06:35.450> going<00:06:35.720> past<00:06:35.930> Mach<00:06:36.260> 1<00:06:36.500> until

feel that you're going past Mach 1 until

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.610

you start to slow back down let me slow
back<00:06:39.800> down<00:06:39.830> you<00:06:40.310> can<00:06:40.460> definitely<00:06:40.610> feel<00:06:41.000> the

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
back down you can definitely feel the

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:51.980 
back down you can definitely feel the
deceleration<00:06:42.730> it's<00:06:43.730> very<00:06:43.940> pronounced

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.160 
getting used to the motion sickness is
definitely<00:06:54.790> always<00:06:54.940> a<00:06:55.060> challenge<00:06:55.570> but<00:06:55.960> I

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:56.170 
definitely always a challenge but I

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.440 
definitely always a challenge but I
think<00:06:56.200> the<00:06:56.470> benefits<00:06:56.890> of<00:06:57.100> being<00:06:57.850> able<00:06:58.000> to<00:06:58.240> fly

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:58.450 
think the benefits of being able to fly

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:07.329 
think the benefits of being able to fly
outweigh<00:06:59.020> those<00:06:59.320> uh<00:06:59.440> those<00:07:00.430> challenges
