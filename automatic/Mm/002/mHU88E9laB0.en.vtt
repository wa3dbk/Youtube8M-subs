book for Bloomsbury called luck what it

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:14.820 
book for Bloomsbury called luck what it
means<00:00:12.459> and<00:00:12.670> why<00:00:12.849> it<00:00:12.910> matters<00:00:13.090> I<00:00:13.740> think<00:00:14.740> the

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:14.830 
means and why it matters I think the

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.409 
means and why it matters I think the
first<00:00:15.129> thing<00:00:15.280> to<00:00:15.429> say<00:00:15.639> is<00:00:15.669> I<00:00:15.820> never<00:00:15.879> used<00:00:16.360> to

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:16.419 
first thing to say is I never used to

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:19.470 
first thing to say is I never used to
believe<00:00:16.630> in<00:00:16.960> luck<00:00:17.650> at<00:00:17.830> all<00:00:17.980> when<00:00:18.820> I<00:00:18.849> started

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 
believe in luck at all when I started

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.120 
believe in luck at all when I started
out<00:00:19.630> as<00:00:19.990> a<00:00:20.050> professional<00:00:20.289> cricketer<00:00:20.950> when<00:00:21.099> I

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
out as a professional cricketer when I

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.500 
out as a professional cricketer when I
was<00:00:21.340> 18<00:00:21.669> 19

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.510 
was 18 19

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.839 
was 18 19
I<00:00:22.539> thought<00:00:23.410> luck<00:00:23.830> was<00:00:24.130> a<00:00:24.400> sign<00:00:24.670> of<00:00:24.699> weakness

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:24.849 
I thought luck was a sign of weakness

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:26.550 
I thought luck was a sign of weakness
believing<00:00:25.599> in<00:00:25.689> luck<00:00:25.869> was<00:00:26.050> a<00:00:26.080> sign<00:00:26.289> of<00:00:26.410> weakness

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
believing in luck was a sign of weakness

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.200 
believing in luck was a sign of weakness
I<00:00:26.800> thought<00:00:27.039> that<00:00:27.220> if<00:00:27.310> you<00:00:27.400> had<00:00:27.550> talent<00:00:28.029> and<00:00:28.090> you

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
I thought that if you had talent and you

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.630 
I thought that if you had talent and you
had<00:00:28.390> resilience<00:00:29.019> and<00:00:29.769> he<00:00:29.830> had<00:00:29.949> determination

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
had resilience and he had determination

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.310 
had resilience and he had determination
that<00:00:30.789> was<00:00:30.880> all<00:00:31.029> you<00:00:31.119> needed<00:00:31.269> in<00:00:31.509> life<00:00:31.689> it's

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
that was all you needed in life it's

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.890 
that was all you needed in life it's
quite<00:00:32.559> a<00:00:32.589> harsh<00:00:33.059> philosophy<00:00:34.059> if<00:00:34.150> you<00:00:34.269> like<00:00:34.449> not

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
quite a harsh philosophy if you like not

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.180 
quite a harsh philosophy if you like not
believing<00:00:35.350> in<00:00:35.410> luck<00:00:35.589> at<00:00:35.739> all

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
believing in luck at all

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.000 
believing in luck at all
but<00:00:37.000> I've<00:00:37.120> realized<00:00:37.540> now<00:00:37.660> that<00:00:38.110> all<00:00:38.350> the<00:00:38.799> big

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
but I've realized now that all the big

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.560 
but I've realized now that all the big
things<00:00:39.040> that<00:00:39.610> happen<00:00:39.909> to<00:00:40.059> me<00:00:40.089> not<00:00:40.330> just<00:00:40.449> as<00:00:40.540> a

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
things that happen to me not just as a

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.840 
things that happen to me not just as a
sportsman<00:00:41.140> but<00:00:41.440> as<00:00:41.530> a<00:00:41.559> human<00:00:41.920> being<00:00:42.129> were

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
sportsman but as a human being were

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.759 
sportsman but as a human being were
actually<00:00:43.390> like<00:00:43.839> we<00:00:44.019> look<00:00:44.140> at<00:00:44.260> the<00:00:44.320> turning

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
actually like we look at the turning

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:47.310 
actually like we look at the turning
points<00:00:45.190> where<00:00:45.430> I<00:00:46.000> broke<00:00:46.600> my<00:00:46.780> ankle<00:00:46.900> which

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
points where I broke my ankle which

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.700 
points where I broke my ankle which
ended<00:00:47.619> my<00:00:47.769> career<00:00:48.430> when<00:00:48.699> I<00:00:48.790> was<00:00:48.879> 31<00:00:49.210> a<00:00:49.930> decision

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
ended my career when I was 31 a decision

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.289 
ended my career when I was 31 a decision
went<00:00:50.890> against<00:00:51.250> me<00:00:51.400> in<00:00:51.489> a<00:00:51.549> crucial<00:00:51.729> moment<00:00:51.940> in

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:52.299 
went against me in a crucial moment in

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:54.240 
went against me in a crucial moment in
my<00:00:52.449> international<00:00:52.809> career<00:00:53.229> for<00:00:53.530> England<00:00:53.860> that

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
my international career for England that

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.100 
my international career for England that
sounds<00:00:54.519> like<00:00:54.610> bad<00:00:54.820> luck<00:00:55.089> but<00:00:55.360> much<00:00:55.930> more

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
sounds like bad luck but much more

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.109 
sounds like bad luck but much more
importantly<00:00:56.559> I<00:00:56.619> met<00:00:56.890> my<00:00:57.010> wife<00:00:57.040> on<00:00:57.460> a<00:00:57.489> train<00:00:57.790> and

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
I ended up obviously after we got

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
completely by chance those incidents

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.710 
completely by chance those incidents
became<00:01:05.530> the<00:01:05.710> prompts<00:01:06.280> for<00:01:06.490> me<00:01:07.060> asking<00:01:07.479> a<00:01:07.540> much

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
like Connie said if you meet someone who

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.050 
like Connie said if you meet someone who
doesn't<00:02:44.349> believe<00:02:44.769> in<00:02:44.829> luck<00:02:45.129> just<00:02:45.489> a<00:02:45.519> complete

and<00:02:46.720> I<00:02:47.620> think<00:02:47.980> that<00:02:48.099> I<00:02:48.340> mean<00:02:49.060> Napoleon<00:02:49.750> said<00:02:49.989> it

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
and I think that I mean Napoleon said it

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:51.720 
and I think that I mean Napoleon said it
brilliantly<00:02:50.439> give<00:02:50.650> me<00:02:50.769> lucky<00:02:51.099> generals<00:02:51.519> I

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
brilliantly give me lucky generals I

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.190 
brilliantly give me lucky generals I
think<00:02:52.030> people<00:02:52.299> who've<00:02:52.420> been<00:02:52.629> really

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
think people who've been really

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.349 
think people who've been really
successful<00:02:53.620> if<00:02:54.370> you<00:02:54.430> actually<00:02:54.579> get<00:02:55.090> them<00:02:55.239> to

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:55.359 
successful if you actually get them to

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:57.960 
successful if you actually get them to

you<00:02:58.030> know<00:02:58.180> I<00:02:58.569> had<00:02:59.049> a<00:02:59.079> massive<00:02:59.440> amount<00:02:59.950> of<00:03:00.069> luck

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
you know I had a massive amount of luck

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.660 
you know I had a massive amount of luck
as<00:03:00.519> well<00:03:01.120> as<00:03:01.450> everything<00:03:02.230> else<00:03:02.349> so<00:03:03.310> I<00:03:03.340> think<00:03:03.430> my

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
as well as everything else so I think my

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.460 
as well as everything else so I think my
attitude<00:03:03.730> to<00:03:04.090> Luck's<00:03:04.329> always<00:03:04.959> changing<00:03:05.379> I

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.920 
attitude to Luck's always changing I
don't<00:03:05.680> think<00:03:05.889> it's<00:03:06.010> all<00:03:06.280> luck<00:03:06.670> but<00:03:07.389> I<00:03:07.420> do<00:03:07.510> think

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
don't think it's all luck but I do think

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.559 
don't think it's all luck but I do think
we<00:03:08.129> underestimate<00:03:09.129> the<00:03:09.790> amount<00:03:10.000> of<00:03:10.180> luck<00:03:10.420> in

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569

not really I think I'd miss terribly the

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.149 
not really I think I'd miss terribly the
ability<00:03:21.639> to<00:03:22.290> demonstrate<00:03:23.290> self<00:03:23.829> expression

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:26.199 
to do something I love but I was very

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:29.819 
to do something I love but I was very
lucky<00:03:26.410> in<00:03:26.739> that<00:03:27.989> playing<00:03:28.989> sport<00:03:29.379> was<00:03:29.620> one

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
lucky in that playing sport was one

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.439 
lucky in that playing sport was one
thing<00:03:30.099> for<00:03:30.310> me<00:03:30.459> and<00:03:30.519> it<00:03:30.609> was<00:03:30.699> a<00:03:30.760> way<00:03:30.910> for<00:03:30.940> me<00:03:31.209> to

be me if you like but I think writing if

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:35.400 
be me if you like but I think writing if
anything<00:03:34.239> is<00:03:34.359> an<00:03:34.510> even<00:03:34.750> fuller<00:03:35.019> expression
