World Series if you want a WPT event I

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.789 
World Series if you want a WPT event I
mean<00:03:21.600> they're<00:03:21.750> completely<00:03:22.260> different<00:03:22.350> this

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
mean they're completely different this

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.280 
mean they're completely different this

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
the World Poker Tour I didn't like their

the World Poker Tour I didn't like their
structure<00:03:41.910> in<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.060> past<00:03:42.360> but<00:03:42.600> it<00:03:42.720> seems<00:03:42.930> like

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
structure in the past but it seems like

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.270 
structure in the past but it seems like
they're<00:03:43.260> changing<00:03:43.620> it<00:03:43.709> a<00:03:43.799> little<00:03:43.920> bit<00:03:44.130> so

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
they're changing it a little bit so

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.560 
they're changing it a little bit so
they're<00:03:44.430> allowing<00:03:44.640> us<00:03:44.850> to<00:03:44.880> really<00:03:45.120> play<00:03:45.329> poker

they're allowing us to really play poker

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.270 
they're allowing us to really play poker
and<00:03:45.780> it's<00:03:45.900> not<00:03:46.019> just<00:03:46.140> an<00:03:46.290> all-in<00:03:46.650> festival<00:03:47.130> I
