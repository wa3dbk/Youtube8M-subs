00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.090
 porore 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:30.340
 Hello Dawn 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:35.950
 I would like to play today because it is a picture matching game 123 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:39.700
 This is the coin because Anpanman slides here and points come out. 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:44.350
 We're playing Dei-kun with a lot of pattern match 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:48.060
 Such I feel like coin is I'm playing in the put from the top this 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.470
 Then I would like to go soon 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.000
 Well then 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:55.010
 Right ? 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.110
 First Shazam like this' s body of Anpanman 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.220
 Anpanman will come out with coins coming out here 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.660
 do it 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.380
 I can see a little 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:08.810
 Slide it 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:14.299
 A coin comes out of a piece and the coin comes out 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.950
 Since there are these sheets you're going to put one on top of the sheet 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:21.789
 Hey 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:24.850
 Put this chip and say that this chip is vertical or horizontal 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:31.070
 Or Naname or whatever 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:37.430
 If the three are in a straight line, the line ahead will win 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:38.670
 I would like to try it right now, but first I want to put all the coins into this 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.670
 I will 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:46.869
 There is a lot of coins with that kind of feeling . 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:50.790
 Akachan Man Baikinman Muron Panda 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:55.090
 Anpanman put this in this 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.869
 Additional I've got a lot of kind Horahoraï½° Well 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.869
 Curry bread 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.750
 Cream pants 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.320
 Share another child's 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.369
 There are so many 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:15.410
 All out in 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:23.930
 And a Pachitto Kyu was capped at Ann bread man 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:26.260
 It If you are using any effect because I'm going back So also those of the card actually there is nothing kind 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.519
 Then I wonder if I'm using this red guy 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:33.329
 All by the kind, there is a place where everyone has a mark 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.329
 It is different 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:40.320
 This is this 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.550
 Little wonder if you look from the top I would like to immediately doing this 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.570
 Yes 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.380
 You can see from a bit above and then Anpanman 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.250
 Let it slide 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:56.650
 It might be interesting if you do it all in one go 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:03:00.290
 First to the chip in place of cream panda-chan in the Gleam panda-chan came out 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:07.400
 One will Dake It's a good place in this 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:08.330
 Next step is to put this tip in the place of food Panman Shokupanman 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:15.530
 I will 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:21.560
 Now it is still also the next person since there is no place to line up in a straight line because here the individual there is in the house 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:22.550
 A lot of chips now come to Baikinman at Baikinman 's chip. 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.510
 There is 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.830
 That is a man 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:32.520
 It is straight in line 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:36.120
 A straight line here, if you come after Anpanman is here 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:44.319
 And here the star Akachan manga came first 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:45.880
 Here you can Tteyuu straight line's Ann bread man or Akachanmanga person has a following 8 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.630
 Then I will try 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:55.410
 What will come out next 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:56.100
 If you put a chip here that Baijajankan-chan Man came out Baikin 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.140
 man 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:02.319
 Kachanman 6 Panna-chan, etc. in 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:07.170
 This is because it became a straight line 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:09.819
 It might be interesting if the person who put out Akachanman tried a game like this 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.500
 Yes I wonder if was fun 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:15.780
 Anpanman's 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:18.620
 Match the game 123 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.670
 I enjoy a lot of other videos 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.360
 Well then 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:28.789
 Everybody's video is a sword 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.950
 Then you have to subscribe to watch new videos 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:35.700
 pattern 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:38.960
 Recommended videos should be videos of nuts above 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.740
 Which slave said because it is a temple 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.740
 Look for it
