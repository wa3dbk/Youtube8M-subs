00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
really like this how balanced the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.789 
really like this how balanced the
characters<00:01:27.600> were<00:01:27.720> people<00:01:28.259> think<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.619> other

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
characters were people think that other

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.100 
characters were people think that other
characters<00:01:29.220> stand<00:01:29.460> out<00:01:29.640> like<00:01:29.820> Superman

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
characters stand out like Superman

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.600 
characters stand out like Superman
Deathstroke<00:01:31.110> flash<00:01:31.409> but<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.070> personally<00:01:32.430> think

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
Deathstroke flash but I personally think

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.830 
Deathstroke flash but I personally think
it's<00:01:32.820> all<00:01:32.909> about<00:01:33.060> finding<00:01:33.210> each<00:01:33.479> character

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
it's all about finding each character

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.450 
it's all about finding each character
strong<00:01:34.049> suits<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.470> weak<00:01:34.590> points<00:01:34.770> like

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
strong suits and weak points like

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.460 
strong suits and weak points like
Harlequin<00:01:35.909> for<00:01:36.030> example<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.570> can't<00:01:37.140> use<00:01:37.320> her

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
Harlequin for example I can't use her

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.950 
Harlequin for example I can't use her
for<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.280> thought<00:01:38.640> she<00:01:39.210> was<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.420> god-awful

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
for it I thought she was a god-awful

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.600 
for it I thought she was a god-awful
character<00:01:40.530> then<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.130> played<00:01:41.369> her<00:01:41.460> I'm<00:01:41.579> very

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
character then I played her I'm very

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.520 
character then I played her I'm very
hard<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.180> got<00:01:42.210> shat<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:43.079> it's<00:01:43.320> really

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
hard and I got shat on so it's really

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.749 
hard and I got shat on so it's really
how<00:01:43.710> well<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.070> know<00:01:44.189> how<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.430> fight<00:01:44.610> each

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
how well you know how to fight each

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.520 
how well you know how to fight each
character<00:01:45.180> because<00:01:45.810> each<00:01:45.960> character<00:01:46.320> fights

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
character because each character fights

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.380 
character because each character fights
long<00:01:46.829> range<00:01:47.130> short<00:01:47.520> medium<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.180> really

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
long range short medium so you really

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.179 
long range short medium so you really
have<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.570> find<00:01:48.840> your<00:01:48.990> character<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.560> get<00:01:50.070> to

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
have to find your character and get to

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.740 
have to find your character and get to
know<00:01:50.310> him<00:01:50.490> or<00:01:50.579> her<00:01:50.700> if<00:01:51.210> you're<00:01:51.420> sick<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.630> the

whatsoever<00:03:03.590> which<00:03:03.800> makes<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:04.250> game<00:03:04.280> a<00:03:04.520> little

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
whatsoever which makes the game a little

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.280 
whatsoever which makes the game a little
harder<00:03:05.270> because<00:03:05.630> it's<00:03:05.900> all<00:03:06.020> about<00:03:06.140> getting

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
harder because it's all about getting

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.560 
harder because it's all about getting
the<00:03:06.410> upper<00:03:06.590> hand<00:03:07.120> however<00:03:08.120> this<00:03:08.240> leads<00:03:08.360> me<00:03:08.480> to

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
the upper hand however this leads me to

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.110 
the upper hand however this leads me to
my<00:03:08.690> next<00:03:08.780> con<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.890> wager<00:03:10.100> system<00:03:10.520> and<00:03:10.820> just

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
my next con the wager system and just

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.280 
my next con the wager system and just
this<00:03:11.180> is<00:03:11.240> one<00:03:11.450> of<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:11.600> first<00:03:11.720> fighting<00:03:12.080> games

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
this is one of the first fighting games

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.720 
this is one of the first fighting games
which<00:03:12.470> introduced<00:03:12.860> a<00:03:12.920> quick<00:03:13.100> time<00:03:13.310> system

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
which introduced a quick time system

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.640 
which introduced a quick time system
where<00:03:14.240> you<00:03:14.360> wager<00:03:14.570> up<00:03:14.780> to<00:03:14.900> four<00:03:15.110> bars<00:03:15.290> of<00:03:15.500> power

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
where you wager up to four bars of power

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.710 
where you wager up to four bars of power
to<00:03:15.860> either<00:03:16.040> gain<00:03:16.310> health<00:03:16.610> or<00:03:16.820> lose<00:03:17.030> it<00:03:17.209> it's

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
to either gain health or lose it it's

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.930 
to either gain health or lose it it's
nice<00:03:18.110> but<00:03:18.470> it'd<00:03:18.590> be<00:03:18.620> nicer<00:03:19.340> if<00:03:19.370> it<00:03:19.610> was<00:03:19.700> easier

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
nice but it'd be nicer if it was easier

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.030 
nice but it'd be nicer if it was easier
to<00:03:19.970> unleash<00:03:20.350> this<00:03:21.350> is<00:03:21.530> really<00:03:21.770> convenient

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
to unleash this is really convenient

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.400 
to unleash this is really convenient
because<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:22.370> computer<00:03:22.700> at<00:03:22.790> least<00:03:23.300> wagers<00:03:23.959> 96

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
because the computer at least wagers 96

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.470 
because the computer at least wagers 96
times<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:24.950> then<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:25.580> opponent<00:03:26.000> just<00:03:26.300> ends<00:03:26.420> up

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
times and then the opponent just ends up

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.630 
times and then the opponent just ends up
getting<00:03:26.720> all<00:03:26.870> their<00:03:26.990> health<00:03:27.200> back<00:03:27.490> with<00:03:28.490> all

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
getting all their health back with all

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.220 
getting all their health back with all
this<00:03:28.850> it's<00:03:29.060> a<00:03:29.120> really<00:03:29.360> fun<00:03:29.540> fighting<00:03:29.780> game<00:03:30.020> I

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
this it's a really fun fighting game I

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.660 
this it's a really fun fighting game I
love<00:03:30.470> the<00:03:30.590> characters<00:03:30.950> in<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.100> game<00:03:31.250> play<00:03:31.459> by

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
love the characters in the game play by

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.610 
love the characters in the game play by
just<00:03:32.000> didn't<00:03:32.480> like<00:03:32.840> how<00:03:33.020> they<00:03:33.170> want<00:03:33.380> to<00:03:33.440> be<00:03:33.530> a

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
just didn't like how they want to be a

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.860 
just didn't like how they want to be a
more<00:03:33.890> original<00:03:34.070> because<00:03:34.850> it<00:03:35.060> kind<00:03:35.660> of<00:03:35.750> took

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
more original because it kind of took

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.930 
more original because it kind of took
away<00:03:36.080> from<00:03:36.110> the<00:03:36.290> experience<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:37.340> DLCs<00:03:37.760> are

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
away from the experience the DLCs are

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.100 
away from the experience the DLCs are
also<00:03:38.209> a<00:03:38.240> plus<00:03:38.450> but<00:03:38.630> doesn't<00:03:38.870> change<00:03:38.990> the

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
also a plus but doesn't change the

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.810 
also a plus but doesn't change the

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
gameplay that's why we're giving this

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.930
