 our first report talks about goats 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.440
 the abrapa caprinos de sobral in ceará 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.019
 is collecting animals without 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.849
 called native breeds to improve the 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.750
 genetic potential of the herd 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.120
 northeast 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.020
 the reporter ivaci matias accompanied this 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.660
 job 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.430
 the goats arrived in the northeast 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.010
 hands of the Portuguese 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.170
 today the Northeastern herd revolves around 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.930
 of 9 million head 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.660
 they are descendants of African races 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.560
 European countries that have been 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.370
 of time 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.870
 are animals of various colors and sizes 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.230
 generally classified as standing 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.149
 hard or non-defined 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.700
 the Northeastern goats are very 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.920
 resistant to drought but low 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.379
 productivity 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.930
 although this genetic mix is ​​still 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.570
 there are in the northeast small herds 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.260
 which retain the same characteristics 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.570
 the races of the animals introduced here 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.899
 more than 400 years 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:08.340
 are the so-called native weeds of the 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:11.340
 Brazil and these herds is in the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.970
 good trip county central region 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.640
 of the ceará on the farm lages at the top of 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.820
 trench saw 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.860
 the owner to his wise mount did know 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.740
 how long have you been preserving 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.070
 these goats here well this narrative already 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.049
 comes from family comes my bizarre and 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.990
 Dad 13hoo and I'm counting 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.450
 continuity of work in it has here 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.210
 several animals separated in batches 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.070
 according to the race of each 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.369
 Let's start to see here then 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.759
 goats' corral are these here to our 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.759
 door 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.610
 this is considered the same race 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.300
 the first native race 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.870
 I think the main her mother 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.970
 rusticity dropping precocity say 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:10.190
 a northeaster who motown a kid 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:12.140
 outside or inside it, the 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.870
 take creates so she is without game 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.210
 It is being seen from the hill beyond 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.760
 motorola to another recognized breed 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.800
 Savio has here is canindé as the 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.950
 animals you have of that breed is one of the 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:28.160
 registered animals are 30 animals of this 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.620
 race her characteristic is the one with 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.530
 which predominates black with the belly 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.640
 white and that name that came to me 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:41.180
 precisely of the given time of the slaves né 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.570
 they wore those in their white trunks, right? 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.830
 then the name of those Hungarian katalin 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:52.220
 And god, that name too, but it stayed 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.000
 to record her way and what animal 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.300
 and health 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.340
 This is the one we call Nambi. 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.280
 characteristic of him is an animal that has 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.520
 the very small rudimentary ear 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.100
 this animal is not considered a breed but is 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.709
 an animal that deserves to be studied very 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:13.310
 rustic and that they have not got until today 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:16.250
 I 've been you see in the middle of the 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.610
 Central Nubian django in the middle it 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.530
 to print this rudimentary ear 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.500
 that we have in this picket here we 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.690
 Let's see the cases they are blue from 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.320
 truth is to seek a review of the 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.400
 According to she says the cultural bias says 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.150
 clear 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.230
 this is one of the most beautiful each native in the 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.680
 my understanding 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.769
 besides being an animal that has a 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.160
 the most advanced dairy product of the 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:49.820
 than others on the banks or ground 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:53.120
 apportioned share of steel called ham 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.400
 by the former mouse country 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.380
 is saying that the two-color distribution is 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.170
 one of the races that is already studying 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.440
 well studied but is one of those that almost 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.440
 extinction 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.510
 to improve the herd of breeds 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.180
 and prevent them from disappearing in 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.310
 the embrapa researchers are 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.769
 collecting semen from males 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:19.100
 the work is done by the doctor 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:22.220
 veterinary jones oliveira santos and pelo 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.039
 john the river zootechnician 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:34.699
 This time I'll provide the ones on me. 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:37.580
 a goat of the breed distributed only this one 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:40.789
 the droplet is sufficient enough cm is 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.990
 highly concentrated around 3 million 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:43.690
 of spermatozoa 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.580
 so from here we dilute 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.490
 increases the amount of doses and reduces 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.979
 that dose to 150 million microsoft 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.380
 is a similar dose for capri that 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:57.680
 This little droplet is important to you. 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.380
 good is very valuable in the face of 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.710
 of extinction of this new is and so 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.169
 given the rusticity of production of these 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.970
 animals even in conditions we have 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.949
 here in the northeast this little girl who 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:13.070
 represents a lot because it will be more 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:16.699
 goats and more logically than 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:19.639
 will be part of the Senate after 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:24.080
 to dilute the packed ceme in tubes and 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:26.780
 transportation to the headquarters of the 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:31.130
 embrapa in the city of sobral is made in 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:32.919
 Nitrogen bottleneck less than 173 degrees 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.570
 temperature 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.440
 here the material goes to the bank of 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.289
 semen 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.030
 under these conditions can be preserved by 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:44.330
 at least 20 years 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:47.180
 a part of the semen is already being used 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.460
 in the work of improving and selecting the 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.310
 herd of native goats from embrapa 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.020
 to get males and females who 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.849
 maintain the original characteristics 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.509
 of the breed a good production of meat and milk 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:01.729
 brook 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:04.099
 how long will the producers go 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:07.039
 to benefit from this work here 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:09.440
 four years ago because the project has 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:13.010
 finished and told you to do the 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:16.160
 evolution of the herd and we can have 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:18.560
 animals available for sale 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.460
 producers, especially those 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.630
 small farmers 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.840

 only wear lipstick in the future the material of the 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:32.080
 semen bank will also be used for 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:35.540
 crosses with other exotic breeds 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:38.180
 with the purpose of printing on them the 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:42.230
 main characteristics of goats 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:44.500
 native rusticity and climate adaptation
