were<00:03:25.040> some<00:03:25.250> things<00:03:25.370> where<00:03:25.549> I<00:03:25.579> could<00:03:25.730> still<00:03:25.940> see

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
were some things where I could still see

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.850 
were some things where I could still see
a<00:03:26.209> little<00:03:26.420> bit<00:03:26.599> of<00:03:26.780> difficulty<00:03:27.200> on<00:03:27.470> it<00:03:27.590> but

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
a little bit of difficulty on it but

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.680 
a little bit of difficulty on it but
good<00:03:28.430> job<00:03:28.670> you<00:03:28.849> did<00:03:29.030> put<00:03:29.209> forth<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:29.599> effort

good job you did put forth the effort
and<00:03:30.110> I<00:03:30.170> know<00:03:30.230> next<00:03:30.560> time<00:03:30.769> I<00:03:30.829> think<00:03:30.980> it<00:03:31.220> would<00:03:31.370> be

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
and I know next time I think it would be

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:37.720 
and I know next time I think it would be
better<00:03:31.700> so
