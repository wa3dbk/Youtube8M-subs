00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 hey people you like pizza or and 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.649
 you also do not like fruits 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.450
 and since it is quite warm in summer 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.880
 pizza not always so cool I thought 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.070
 I 'll do something new and connect 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.020
 Just fruits with pizza and after his 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.520
 fruits pizza and somehow I have 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.750
 his first recipe of myself 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.949
 invented and I would say let's say 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.439
 Just try it and look like that 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.539
 So we need fruit first 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.939
 and I thought so pizza dough 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.160
 could you take a melon and 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.849
 simply speak because as a basis 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.009
 use 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.440
 And we also need for the foundation 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.170
 your tomato sauce we just out 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.510
 strawberries will be made on one 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.579
 good pizza is also part of course reading 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.579
 I thought a mango was there 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.320
 actually quite practical and may cover 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.090
 Of course not missing there you can 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.629
 Now I really choose freely 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.789
 opted for cherries and raspberries 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.059
 and I'm very excited to resist 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.219
 becomes 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.289
 So we first cut the 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.329
 just melon like a slice 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.430
 From this mine is about one 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.260
 thumb wide that just then one 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.420
 a million slice which we then lie down 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.280
 and then she is done and we take her 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.510
 Strawberries and make the first green 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.790
 off and mix them and then have 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.369
 we already have such a tomato colored sauce 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.080
 I think somehow cheese is always 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.670
 rubbed and because of that rub too 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.259
 just the mango so we cut them 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.850
 in handy pieces and then we catch 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.189
 they simply travel to rub a 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.080
 simply in the Kreisliga which largest 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.970
 in return for the cheese in simply over 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.119
 can when we are done with it 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.350
 So how about olives with olive 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.270
 they just take the cherries and 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.310
 Cut once the center thereof and 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.710
 turn it out so get the core out and 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.970
 then we'll hear cool olives and 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.710
 as a second cover I have just 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.570
 be thought as it would allow the 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.720
 could yes then I do not know pirate 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.399
 be or somehow go out of business 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.070
 we just take ours 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.100
 Melon slice make the tomato sauce 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.710
 Sprinkle the cheese over it and 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.619
 then finally prove the pizza with 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.969
 our olives and our bodies and 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.189
 that's the result now we can 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.830
 Just cut them into pieces 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.380
 pizza pieces and clock 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.960
 that does not even look cool 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:16.010
 and I want that on the verses 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:20.270
 is now just this kind determines the 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.920
 is now the pizza i am trying now 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.720
 initiate test it will be provided me 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.800
 terrible would have stopped 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.110
 eating pizza probably everyone 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:33.530
 So it should taste like laundry 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.510
 a really cool fruit salad the 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.740
 Strawberry so fluid and I think 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.780
 totally with the brand and the taste 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:45.650
 just like a fruit salad like that 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:46.600
 do not let shake and even vegetables that 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.880
 imitate 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:53.750
 So I am convinced is mega 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.600
 really cool parties or when I feel like it 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.770
 like to be on about facebook 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.350
 and then you can also tell me 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.810
 what their drauflegt for vegetables for 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.550
 variations and then I say adiÃ³s 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.550
 and set again
