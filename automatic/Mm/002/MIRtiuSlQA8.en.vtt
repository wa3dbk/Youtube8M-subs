00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.509
 let's calculate the operation between fractions 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.919
 algebraic that appears on the screen 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.669
 we know we have fractions but that 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.500
 appears the X's are called fractions 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:17.760
 algebraic 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.790
 in our case it works the same in 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.550
 principle that with fractions of numbers 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.769
 over with rational numbers 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.630
 we calculate the least common multiple of 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.939
 the denominators we write here 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.860
 common to both new fractions 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.170
 fractions the first will be equivalent to 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.629
 the first and the second will be equivalent 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.519
 to the second and from there to have 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.420
 the same denominator simply 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.550
 we subtract the two operators 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.769
 for this we are going to decompose in 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.879
 prime factors x squared minus 9 x 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:52.260
 4 - 6 x 9 for prime factors when 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.739
 we work with x linux are called 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.649
 irreducible factors x square minus 9 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.089
 for the decomposition observe that x 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.190
 to the minus 9 box although it can be done 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:04.489
 for a purpose and is the same as x to 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.060
 square minus 9 that stresses square 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.670
 difference of squares is sum 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.659
 by difference 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.759
 as for x square 69 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.600
 I have prepared this for you to have 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:25.630
 common factors x 4 minus 6 x 9 lo 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.630
 same as x 4 6 x 9 stress squared 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:35.570
 let's note that if we consider x as 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:38.630
 the sign of the coefficient of the X is 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.300
 negative we put here minus x we have 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.520
 caught from this x and now the 3 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.910
 in less we have taken it by the sign of 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.330
 of the part in x of this if we do this 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:54.420
 box you get x square plus 9 and 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.590
 now minus twice the first are less 2 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.900
 for x for 36 x or is it that you have that there 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.730
 we tried to see if that gave us what 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.550
 from above and if it goes crazy this is x 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.650
 minus 3 squared then for 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.990
 calculate the lowest common multiple of the 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.780
 denominators are 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:18.430
 irreducible factors the polygons of 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:21.450
 Grade 1 are irreducible factors x 3 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.520
 for x 3 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.590
 and now x 3 to the box that we have already 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.370
 since that three elevated to greater 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.890
 exponent x 3 is raised to 1 as 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.800
 we see only it seems and x minus 3 up to 1 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.900
 down the picture to the picture as we put 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.610
 here x + 3 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.610
 for x minus 3 squared 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.620
 now we divide well let's remember 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.709
 so that this was let's put it 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.569
 here x + 3 times x minus 3 because to the 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.069
 time to divide is going to come well 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:01.660
 and this from here 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:05.050
 sx 3 to the box 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.740
 let's go there this 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.170
 divided between this 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.140
 if we divide x + 3 by x minus 3 to 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.360
 square between more than xx 3 the x3 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.310
 with the x + 3 would be and that minus 3 to 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:22.620
 squared divided by x minus 3 at 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:25.650
 square remain x minus 3 x 3 xx 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.110
 and now this one here divided between this 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.200
 here would be x minus 3 to the table we 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.910
 there would be an x3 that would multiply the 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.980
 X is here 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.980
 and this would fit us then 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.750
 if I want I'm going to leave the 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.520
 denominator so if anyone is interested 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.260
 for making product and that's it 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.120
 I will leave all the data and also 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.890
 It's convenient until you get the result 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.350
 go that will be simplified to the naked eye 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.890
 something I do not know if it will happen in this case 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:01.360
 now x xx minus three properties 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:05.070
 distributive xxxx squared yxx 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.070
 minus 3 - 3 x 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:12.530
 and now 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:16.040
 x x x 3 that is x x x x squared yxx 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.040
 33 here 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:22.789
 then what we have left is going to see 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.620
 it would remain as a denominator attention 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:28.160
 with this I'm going to put it like that so 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.590
 we do not read x square minus 3 x 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.940
 - and now I put this in parentheses 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.230
 because this least affects all the 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.230
 fraction affects all the numerator 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.680
 then this is not that it would not be like a 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.680
 denominator 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.340
 up - in front a parenthesis changes from 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.240
 sign 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.240
 with that less 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:57.080
 they were minus 3 xx minus 3 and now here already 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:59.419
 it is denominator 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.400
 is broken down into products factors 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:04.900
 irreducible and that is when with x 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.979
 square goes less 3 x 3 x 6 x 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.259
 let's observe that it can not be simplified 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.849
 because x is the only factor 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:12.259
 irreducible that appears in the numerator 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:14.629
 that does not appear in the denominator 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:17.180
 if we want to develop the denominator 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:19.009
 I leave it like that and this would be the result 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:23.530
 then of the operation between 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:23.530
 algebraic fractions raised
