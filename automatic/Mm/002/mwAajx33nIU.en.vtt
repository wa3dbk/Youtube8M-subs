00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
do not permit boosting I would rather be

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.469 
do not permit boosting I would rather be
one<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.130> booster<00:01:59.310> hunters<00:01:59.939> rather<00:02:00.240> than

one of the booster hunters rather than

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
boosting myself so I discovered another

part<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.659> this<00:02:03.869> glitch<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.380> will<00:02:04.500> allow<00:02:04.740> you

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
part to this glitch that will allow you

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.530 
part to this glitch that will allow you
to<00:02:04.950> do<00:02:05.190> just<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.670> now<00:02:06.030> if<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.240> were<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.420> do

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
to do just that now if you were to do

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.029 
to do just that now if you were to do
the<00:02:06.659> glitch<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:07.020> just<00:02:07.260> showed<00:02:07.470> you<00:02:07.710> when<00:02:07.950> you

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
the glitch I just showed you when you

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.590 
the glitch I just showed you when you
are<00:02:08.069> searching<00:02:08.399> for<00:02:08.670> players<00:02:08.940> instead<00:02:09.390> of

and wait you may have to wait for a
little<00:02:13.230> bit<00:02:13.380> but<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.709> is<00:02:13.830> only<00:02:14.040> searching<00:02:14.520> for

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
little bit but it is only searching for

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
bit I was randomly placed in a game and

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.059

once<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.510> began<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:25.020> kind<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.380> just<00:02:25.530> watched<00:02:25.800> my

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
once it began I kind of just watched my

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.949 
once it began I kind of just watched my
other<00:02:26.190> players<00:02:26.550> I<00:02:26.850> first<00:02:27.239> noticed<00:02:27.660> that<00:02:27.810> one

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
other players I first noticed that one

other players I first noticed that one
of<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.170> other<00:02:28.319> players<00:02:28.680> second<00:02:29.160> controllers

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
of the other players second controllers

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.280 
of the other players second controllers
was<00:02:29.790> on<00:02:29.940> being<00:02:30.239> their<00:02:30.450> guest<00:02:30.720> but<00:02:30.959> he<00:02:31.080> wasn't

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
was on being their guest but he wasn't

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.990 
was on being their guest but he wasn't
moving<00:02:31.709> meaning<00:02:32.160> he<00:02:32.280> was<00:02:32.400> just<00:02:32.610> someone<00:02:32.819> to

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
moving meaning he was just someone to

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.120 
moving meaning he was just someone to
boost<00:02:33.180> off<00:02:33.420> of<00:02:33.630> I<00:02:33.810> then<00:02:34.200> ran<00:02:34.440> over<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.830> see<00:02:34.980> what

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
boost off of I then ran over to see what

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.440 
boost off of I then ran over to see what
the<00:02:35.220> other<00:02:35.370> players<00:02:35.700> were<00:02:35.880> doing<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.360> the

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
the other players were doing and the

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.000 
the other players were doing and the
first<00:02:36.690> thing<00:02:36.900> I<00:02:36.989> saw<00:02:37.230> was<00:02:37.560> two<00:02:37.800> people

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
first thing I saw was two people

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:45.590 
first thing I saw was two people
boosting<00:02:43.489> so<00:02:44.489> once<00:02:44.670> I<00:02:44.790> realized<00:02:45.000> all<00:02:45.300> of<00:02:45.360> these

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
boosting so once I realized all of these

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.120 
boosting so once I realized all of these
players<00:02:45.870> were<00:02:46.050> on<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.170> party<00:02:46.530> together<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:46.920> had

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
players were on a party together I had

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.830 
players were on a party together I had
nothing<00:02:47.459> else<00:02:47.550> to<00:02:47.730> do<00:02:47.880> but<00:02:48.090> put<00:02:48.239> an<00:02:48.390> end<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.630> it

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
nothing else to do but put an end to it

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.750 
nothing else to do but put an end to it
so<00:02:49.320> whether<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.650> are<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.890> booster<00:02:50.310> or<00:02:50.550> the

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
so whether you are the booster or the

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.400 
so whether you are the booster or the
hunter<00:02:51.090> in<00:02:51.209> this<00:02:51.390> case<00:02:51.630> definitely<00:02:52.140> try<00:02:52.350> out

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
hunter in this case definitely try out

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.020 
hunter in this case definitely try out
this<00:02:52.590> glitch<00:02:52.890> like<00:02:53.160> I<00:02:53.340> said<00:02:53.580> it's<00:02:53.730> kind<00:02:53.970> of

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
this glitch like I said it's kind of

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.640 
this glitch like I said it's kind of
unpredictable<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:54.870> never<00:02:55.019> really<00:02:55.470> know

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
unpredictable you never really know

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.320 
unpredictable you never really know
what's<00:02:55.920> going<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.250> happen<00:02:56.640> but<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:57.090> only<00:02:57.209> way

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
what's going to happen but the only way

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.670 
what's going to happen but the only way
to<00:02:57.390> figure<00:02:57.600> that<00:02:57.840> out<00:02:57.900> is<00:02:58.170> if<00:02:58.320> you<00:02:58.410> try<00:02:58.560> it

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
to figure that out is if you try it

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.350 
to figure that out is if you try it
yourself<00:02:59.040> this<00:02:59.340> glitch<00:02:59.640> is<00:02:59.819> difficult<00:03:00.269> to

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
yourself this glitch is difficult to

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.090 
yourself this glitch is difficult to
understand<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.080> I<00:03:01.260> honestly<00:03:01.620> don't<00:03:01.860> know<00:03:01.980> if

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
understand and I honestly don't know if

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.250 
understand and I honestly don't know if
I<00:03:02.340> understand<00:03:02.819> it<00:03:02.970> fully<00:03:03.090> myself<00:03:03.390> I<00:03:03.840> tried<00:03:04.110> to

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
I understand it fully myself I tried to

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.960 
I understand it fully myself I tried to
explain<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.830> best<00:03:05.070> way<00:03:05.250> possible<00:03:05.280> I'm

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
explain it the best way possible I'm

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.640 
explain it the best way possible I'm
