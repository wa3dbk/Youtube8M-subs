 Why 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.470
 and it's a little gem that we book here that shiva with this model 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.730
 the ultraportable the satellite t130 for what it was 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.410
 intended for use rather not bad with its weight of only 26 flights 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.880
 military it is easily transportable 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.760
 as for its autonomy around 6 7 and 8 hours in use thanks to 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.260
 its 6-cell battery 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.240
 very fine and very design with the sound white pearly 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.730
 its screen of 13 inches 3 will still allow you to work from 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.700
 way more than correct 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.810
 an extremely small footprint yet we are very far from the 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.300
 fashion small netbooks 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.400

 Connectivity is as complete as on computers 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.770
 portable larger templates since we find the port vga but 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.000
 also a hdmi output and 3 USB ports 2 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.480
 a memory card reader comes to cap it all while the 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.930
 communication is provided by wifi n a webcam on the top of the screen but 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.350
 also a bluetooth connection or only two points 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.680
