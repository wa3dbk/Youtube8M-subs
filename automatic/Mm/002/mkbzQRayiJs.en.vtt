00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.020
 Y 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.490
 very good and costa voice again in 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.320
 minecraft and first of all I want to clarify 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.029
 a little thing this bad that just brought 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.180
 is a mode very similar to another one that 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.590
 suit a few months ago and good the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.509
 difference between this and the other is that 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.310
 the other stayed at 1.6 point 4 and 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.570
 never got to be updated follow me 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.149
 arriving comments every day 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.989
 practically from people who are looking 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.120
 that way 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.440
 specifically updated and there is not 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.610
 so bring me this one that I just 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.680
 find that I thought it was great 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.899
 even better than the other one since in 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.550
 principle is in 1.7 point 10 and the 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.650
 another is never going to be used or 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.300
 except that's what it seems not then 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.829
 good introduced the mode is called just 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.170
 invent and works with forges and key 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.390
 download it and install it and let's go to 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.860
 mod in principle what he does is teach 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.320
 any object that we have in 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.510
 any chest without having to open it in 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.600
 This case, as you can see, I will point out the 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.030
 en casket and notice how pretty this gives 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.759
 it's magic this will save us a lot of 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.649
 time when looking for things because 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.600
 example in a normal chest then look 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.399
 we have this in the other one because we have 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.049
 this in other chests because we have a 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:18.329
 lots of things and as you can see 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.980
 see all things in 3-d while 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:22.830
 we are turning 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.720
 in the chest the truth that is great and 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.190
 apart from all this well 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.750
 the chests of the in work up to 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.100
 now I have not seen any way that 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.320
 this guy who can get to do it 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.540
 then it's pretty cool it's very 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.430
 handsome and as you can see we have a 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.530
 emerald a magma cream and an eye 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.000
 ya who have to be this eye 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.590
 in this chest of the end it will come out 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.240
 same and I for example removed this from 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.950
 here, here comes a spiral of 64 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.740
 magma cream and here it will be the same 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.190
 then he was pretty handsome is very 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.110
 pimp 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.310
 good the way he teaches the 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.500
 things the truth that is pretty cool 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.480
 and as you see according to also the objects 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.800
 that we have then they will come out bigger or 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.500
 smaller as you see and only 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.810
 we have an object will come out super big and 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.940
 if we go putting other quanta 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.200
 as you will see, the thing will change 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.060
 coming out increasingly smaller until 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.640
 that you see something more or less like 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.350
 well then good as you see according to 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.420
 we also have the objects as they go 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.980
 to come out in that order for example the ore 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.360
 diamond will come out before the 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.790
 book and if I put the book for example 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.530
 here it will come before and others and good 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.900
 will be the order this way okay I think 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.060
 I was like that if it was that way it's worth 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.680
 here until here after down to 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.910
 here and then the third line here 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.800
 up to this point 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.870
 it's pretty cool the truth is that 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.030
 very cool too although for example 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.100
 let's have this is ordered this is not going 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.830
 order with the blocks that we have in 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.170
 total expose for example if I put 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.690
 this for example like this will not come out 128 and 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.700
 If I fill all this with sponge then you go 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.320
 to see that it's not going to come out exactly 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.330
 number of sponges we have equal 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.910
 the stacks they are stuck in is worth 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.800
 then he 's pretty handsome he's very 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.600
 cool and we can do a lot of things 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.190
 with this in principle save time 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.080
 ok because this is going to save us a 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.700
 a lot of time the bad thing is that by 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.290
 example on the theme of double chests 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.180
 as you are seeing then we have to see 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.030
 one half of a chest and then the other 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.920
 half of the chest then and that's where 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.260
 I do not like what we offer 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.880
 in this case I have not tried them yet or 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.790
 I know I let you probeis 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.170
 but surely not worth it because 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.030
 Clearly it made with tenderloin for 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.590
 minecraft chests then if it works 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.850
 perfect if it does not work because it has already 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.200
 warned that he will not get to 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.440
 to work, it works if it works 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.400
 forms let me know I put here a small 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.370
 information up here a bar of 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.810
 information and I comment it and then nothing 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.840
 this is the only thing that brings the mode 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.670
 it's really cool 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.050
 all the mods of this type of that 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.790
 teach the things in the chests before 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.590
 get to open them because the only thing 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.170
 they do is save time but also this 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.640
 looks in 3d is gorgeous and nothing has been 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.290
 liked you can press the team experts 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.489
 new in the next video and I hope you 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.299
 liked the decoration that I am 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:53.660
 making a friend this to me I do not know how 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:54.769
 it's called this vale but cccc that I've 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.480
 post has been sent to the sale of 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.940
 decorate and started changing this before 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.250
 of the sand and then change it for 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.379
 by wood of these now after all 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.170
 this seems like a chess so weird and 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:07.340
 now I have put a makeshift portal 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.569
 here in this part that also works 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.069
 in what for what works from a 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.799
 special way when you go up 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:17.479
 instead of taking us to the neder takes us 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:19.100
 to allen then etc is cool epic os 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.410
 the reasons that I have for here good I go 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.930
 to give you bar here we can again to them 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.639
 I put here where he taught the mods and 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.650
 nothing like I say, I hope you liked it 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:32.080
 a lot you press likes mauritana we see 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.080
 and the next video and until then
