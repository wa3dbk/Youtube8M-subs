up of the journey so once I get to the
hospital<00:01:10.460> I<00:01:11.180> don't<00:01:11.990> think<00:01:12.290> I'll<00:01:12.409> be<00:01:12.560> recording

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
hospital I don't think I'll be recording

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.340 
hospital I don't think I'll be recording
the<00:01:13.190> actual<00:01:13.640> operation<00:01:14.510> but<00:01:14.810> after<00:01:15.260> the

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
the actual operation but after the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.820 
the actual operation but after the
operation<00:01:15.860> and<00:01:16.159> the<00:01:16.610> recovery<00:01:17.680> in<00:01:18.680> the

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
operation and the recovery in the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.260 
operation and the recovery in the
hospital<00:01:19.220> and<00:01:19.430> I'll<00:01:19.520> probably<00:01:19.760> make<00:01:20.090> some

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
hospital and I'll probably make some

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.240 
hospital and I'll probably make some
updates<00:01:20.479> while<00:01:20.930> I'm<00:01:21.049> at<00:01:21.170> home<00:01:21.320> recovering<00:01:21.710> as

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
updates while I'm at home recovering as

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.950 
updates while I'm at home recovering as
well<00:01:22.460> and<00:01:22.760> what<00:01:22.910> they're<00:01:23.090> going<00:01:23.270> to<00:01:23.420> do<00:01:23.660> is

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
well and what they're going to do is

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.800 
well and what they're going to do is
it's<00:01:24.290> called<00:01:24.610> cerebral<00:01:25.610> shot<00:01:25.910> so<00:01:26.630> they're

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
it's called cerebral shot so they're

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.860 
it's called cerebral shot so they're
gonna<00:01:26.930> put<00:01:27.140> a<00:01:27.170> shoat<00:01:28.180> insert<00:01:29.180> it<00:01:29.330> into<00:01:29.570> the

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
gonna put a shoat insert it into the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.800 
gonna put a shoat insert it into the
syrinx<00:01:30.260> so<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.620> cyst<00:01:30.890> filled<00:01:31.280> with<00:01:31.810> cerebral

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
syrinx so the cyst filled with cerebral

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.510 
syrinx so the cyst filled with cerebral
spinal<00:01:32.930> fluid<00:01:33.260> where<00:01:33.740> it's<00:01:33.890> not<00:01:34.160> meant<00:01:34.400> to<00:01:34.460> be

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
spinal fluid where it's not meant to be

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.130 
spinal fluid where it's not meant to be
because<00:01:34.850> right<00:01:34.880> now<00:01:35.240> it's<00:01:35.510> in<00:01:35.690> the<00:01:35.840> spinal

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
because right now it's in the spinal

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.380 
because right now it's in the spinal
cord<00:01:36.290> and<00:01:36.770> it's<00:01:37.490> not<00:01:37.700> meant<00:01:37.910> to<00:01:37.940> be<00:01:38.030> there<00:01:38.240> it's

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
cord and it's not meant to be there it's

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.000 
cord and it's not meant to be there it's
meant<00:01:38.540> to<00:01:38.600> be<00:01:38.720> on<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:38.900> outside<00:01:39.440> of<00:01:39.650> the<00:01:39.770> spinal

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
meant to be on the outside of the spinal

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.580 
meant to be on the outside of the spinal
cord<00:01:40.250> but<00:01:40.790> somehow<00:01:41.060> it<00:01:41.570> is<00:01:41.690> got<00:01:41.870> all<00:01:42.020> inside

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
cord but somehow it is got all inside

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.680 
cord but somehow it is got all inside
which<00:01:43.130> isn't<00:01:43.370> good<00:01:43.730> because<00:01:43.940> that<00:01:43.970> means<00:01:44.270> I'm

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
which isn't good because that means I'm

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.270 
which isn't good because that means I'm
losing<00:01:45.340> feeling<00:01:46.340> it<00:01:46.730> was<00:01:46.880> in<00:01:47.090> my<00:01:47.980> and<00:01:48.980> it<00:01:49.160> is

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
losing feeling it was in my and it is

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.790 
losing feeling it was in my and it is
now<00:01:49.460> spreading<00:01:49.880> down<00:01:50.180> my<00:01:50.390> body<00:01:50.540> hasn't<00:01:51.320> got<00:01:51.650> to

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
now spreading down my body hasn't got to

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.940 
now spreading down my body hasn't got to
my<00:01:51.920> legs<00:01:52.160> yet<00:01:52.400> which<00:01:52.550> is<00:01:52.700> really<00:01:53.030> good<00:01:53.240> but<00:01:53.950> it

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
my legs yet which is really good but it

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.640 
my legs yet which is really good but it
is<00:01:55.280> down<00:01:56.030> at<00:01:56.330> the<00:01:56.480> right<00:01:56.690> side<00:01:56.930> of<00:01:57.050> my<00:01:57.230> body<00:01:57.380> now

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
is down at the right side of my body now

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.160 
is down at the right side of my body now
so<00:01:58.010> that<00:01:58.850> definitely<00:01:59.240> means<00:01:59.420> that<00:01:59.630> I<00:01:59.810> don't

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
so that definitely means that I don't

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.660 
so that definitely means that I don't
mean<00:02:00.290> that<00:02:00.560> we<00:02:00.680> need<00:02:00.830> to<00:02:00.950> act<00:02:01.130> quickly<00:02:01.310> and

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
mean that we need to act quickly and

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.700 
mean that we need to act quickly and
have<00:02:02.030> this<00:02:02.150> surgery<00:02:02.600> very<00:02:02.840> soon<00:02:03.170> which<00:02:03.380> we<00:02:03.560> are

best<00:04:07.449> because<00:04:07.629> I<00:04:07.810> do<00:04:07.870> have<00:04:08.049> a<00:04:08.290> lot<00:04:08.470> of<00:04:08.590> work

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
best because I do have a lot of work

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.119 
best because I do have a lot of work
going<00:04:09.190> on<00:04:09.280> at<00:04:09.400> school<00:04:09.669> right<00:04:09.879> now<00:04:10.090> but<00:04:11.129> these

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
going on at school right now but these

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:13.770 
going on at school right now but these
past<00:04:12.430> few<00:04:12.579> weeks<00:04:12.669> I<00:04:13.000> have<00:04:13.090> been<00:04:13.120> catching<00:04:13.660> up

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
past few weeks I have been catching up

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.960 
past few weeks I have been catching up
and<00:04:13.989> making<00:04:14.319> sure<00:04:14.349> that<00:04:15.190> I<00:04:15.220> won't<00:04:15.519> be<00:04:15.699> behind

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
and making sure that I won't be behind

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.330 
and making sure that I won't be behind
when<00:04:16.239> I<00:04:16.269> do<00:04:16.389> get<00:04:16.750> back<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:16.959> school<00:04:17.349> so<00:04:18.070> that's

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
when I do get back to school so that's

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.400 
when I do get back to school so that's
why<00:04:18.519> this<00:04:18.579> video<00:04:18.970> is<00:04:19.120> also<00:04:19.599> a<00:04:19.810> little<00:04:20.139> late

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
why this video is also a little late

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.219 
why this video is also a little late
because<00:04:20.680> I<00:04:21.280> have<00:04:21.729> been<00:04:21.940> trying<00:04:22.630> to<00:04:22.780> work<00:04:22.960> my

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
because I have been trying to work my

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.760 
because I have been trying to work my
bum<00:04:23.949> off<00:04:24.160> trying<00:04:24.760> to<00:04:24.960> get<00:04:25.960> a<00:04:26.020> lot<00:04:26.199> of<00:04:26.289> work<00:04:26.500> done

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
bum off trying to get a lot of work done

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.070 
bum off trying to get a lot of work done
before<00:04:27.340> the<00:04:27.669> surgery<00:04:28.030> so<00:04:28.210> I'm<00:04:28.330> not<00:04:28.510> completely

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
before the surgery so I'm not completely

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.870 
before the surgery so I'm not completely
bombarded<00:04:29.500> with<00:04:29.949> all<00:04:30.220> the<00:04:30.340> work<00:04:30.520> after

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
bombarded with all the work after

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.900 
bombarded with all the work after
surgery<00:04:31.570> but<00:04:32.349> I<00:04:32.440> will<00:04:32.740> be<00:04:32.979> doing<00:04:33.220> work<00:04:33.520> in<00:04:33.760> the

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
surgery but I will be doing work in the

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.910 
surgery but I will be doing work in the
hospital<00:04:34.360> and<00:04:34.620> horns

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
hospital and horns

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.970 
hospital and horns
I<00:04:36.480> that's<00:04:37.480> another<00:04:37.810> reason<00:04:38.080> there's<00:04:38.800> three

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
I that's another reason there's three

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.630 
I that's another reason there's three
reasons<00:04:39.400> why<00:04:39.940> the<00:04:40.620> video<00:04:41.620> from<00:04:42.100> the<00:04:42.190> hospital

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
reasons why the video from the hospital

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.880 
reasons why the video from the hospital
might<00:04:43.090> be<00:04:43.240> a<00:04:43.270> little<00:04:43.480> late<00:04:43.720> like<00:04:44.410> I<00:04:44.530> said<00:04:44.740> I

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
might be a little late like I said I

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.590 
might be a little late like I said I
plan<00:04:45.130> to<00:04:45.160> take<00:04:45.490> you<00:04:45.610> guys<00:04:45.760> with<00:04:45.820> me<00:04:46.060> in<00:04:46.480> the

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
plan to take you guys with me in the

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.570 
plan to take you guys with me in the
hospital<00:04:46.750> and<00:04:47.140> I<00:04:47.230> plan<00:04:47.470> to<00:04:47.500> make<00:04:47.650> update

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580

hospital and I plan to make update

like<00:04:51.100> two<00:04:51.340> week<00:04:51.520> updates<00:04:51.880> I'm<00:04:52.060> not<00:04:52.210> quite<00:04:52.390> sure

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 
like two week updates I'm not quite sure

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.720 
like two week updates I'm not quite sure
right<00:04:52.870> now<00:04:53.020> cuz<00:04:53.590> I'm<00:04:53.710> not<00:04:53.890> sure<00:04:54.220> the<00:04:54.430> full

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
right now cuz I'm not sure the full

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.810 
right now cuz I'm not sure the full
recovery<00:04:55.330> time<00:04:55.630> just<00:04:55.960> yet<00:04:56.280> the<00:04:57.280> doctors<00:04:57.610> said

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
recovery time just yet the doctors said

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.820 
recovery time just yet the doctors said
that<00:04:57.940> it<00:04:58.090> kind<00:04:58.300> of<00:04:58.360> depends<00:04:58.780> on<00:04:58.990> every<00:04:59.380> person

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
that it kind of depends on every person

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.900 
that it kind of depends on every person
but<00:05:00.460> they<00:05:00.640> did<00:05:00.880> say<00:05:01.150> that<00:05:01.180> if<00:05:01.480> you<00:05:01.630> do<00:05:01.810> not<00:05:01.990> have

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
but they did say that if you do not have

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.970 
but they did say that if you do not have
senses<00:05:03.910> back<00:05:04.060> after<00:05:04.480> 18<00:05:04.840> months<00:05:05.290> then<00:05:05.770> you

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
senses back after 18 months then you

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.220 
senses back after 18 months then you
won't<00:05:06.220> gain<00:05:06.400> them<00:05:06.640> back<00:05:06.850> which<00:05:07.180> is<00:05:07.810> a<00:05:07.870> bit

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
won't gain them back which is a bit

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.760 
won't gain them back which is a bit
annoying

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
annoying

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.910 
annoying
but<00:05:09.190> it's<00:05:10.060> not<00:05:10.360> like<00:05:10.570> I'm<00:05:10.750> completely<00:05:11.290> losing

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:11.920 
but it's not like I'm completely losing

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.040 
but it's not like I'm completely losing
a<00:05:11.950> function<00:05:12.490> of<00:05:12.610> my<00:05:12.790> arm<00:05:13.060> and<00:05:13.330> my<00:05:13.450> body<00:05:13.690> I'm

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
a function of my arm and my body I'm

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.090 
a function of my arm and my body I'm
just<00:05:14.590> losing<00:05:14.800> the<00:05:15.010> feeling<00:05:15.430> and<00:05:16.500> also<00:05:17.500> if<00:05:17.890> I

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
just losing the feeling and also if I

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.070 
just losing the feeling and also if I
touch<00:05:18.370> something<00:05:18.640> that's<00:05:18.940> cold<00:05:19.270> if<00:05:19.540> feels<00:05:19.780> hot

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
touch something that's cold if feels hot

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.750 
touch something that's cold if feels hot
because<00:05:20.350> I<00:05:20.440> touch<00:05:20.680> something<00:05:20.950> hot<00:05:21.160> it<00:05:21.700> feels

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
because I touch something hot it feels

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.500 
because I touch something hot it feels
cold

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
cold

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.180 
cold
so<00:05:22.960> that's<00:05:23.110> another<00:05:23.410> kind<00:05:23.650> of<00:05:23.770> weird<00:05:23.980> and

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
so that's another kind of weird and

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.490 
so that's another kind of weird and
wacky<00:05:24.490> thing<00:05:24.760> but<00:05:25.120> other<00:05:25.810> than<00:05:26.110> that<00:05:26.170> it

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
wacky thing but other than that it

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.940 
wacky thing but other than that it
doesn't<00:05:26.530> really<00:05:26.920> bother<00:05:27.160> me<00:05:27.310> so<00:05:27.820> but<00:05:28.720> if<00:05:29.350> I<00:05:29.650> was

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
doesn't really bother me so but if I was

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.250 
doesn't really bother me so but if I was
not<00:05:30.130> to<00:05:30.310> get<00:05:30.460> this<00:05:30.580> done<00:05:30.880> then<00:05:31.450> other<00:05:31.900> more

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
not to get this done then other more

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.720 
not to get this done then other more
serious<00:05:32.740> things<00:05:33.010> would<00:05:33.220> happen<00:05:33.520> so<00:05:33.670> I

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:33.730 
serious things would happen so I

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.520 
serious things would happen so I
definitely<00:05:33.970> need<00:05:34.390> to<00:05:34.420> get<00:05:34.660> the<00:05:34.750> shunt<00:05:35.020> very

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
definitely need to get the shunt very

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
definitely need to get the shunt very
soon<00:05:36.480> and<00:05:37.480> I<00:05:38.380> think<00:05:38.800> that's<00:05:38.980> about<00:05:39.100> it<00:05:39.340> right

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
soon and I think that's about it right

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.550 
soon and I think that's about it right
now<00:05:39.730> and<00:05:40.030> I'll<00:05:40.210> update<00:05:40.390> you<00:05:40.720> guys<00:05:40.750> as<00:05:41.230> soon<00:05:41.290> as

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
now and I'll update you guys as soon as

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.940 
now and I'll update you guys as soon as
possible<00:05:42.010> that<00:05:42.820> might<00:05:43.090> have<00:05:43.300> to<00:05:43.450> be<00:05:43.630> after<00:05:44.620> the

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
possible that might have to be after the

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.220 
possible that might have to be after the
surgery<00:05:45.340> I'm<00:05:45.910> not<00:05:46.120> quite<00:05:46.360> sure<00:05:46.390> it<00:05:46.660> depends<00:05:46.990> on

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.230 
surgery I'm not quite sure it depends on

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:48.570 
surgery I'm not quite sure it depends on
whether<00:05:47.380> I<00:05:47.470> have<00:05:47.680> enough<00:05:47.890> information<00:05:48.100> to

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
whether I have enough information to

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.460 
whether I have enough information to
make<00:05:48.730> a<00:05:48.880> completely<00:05:49.480> separate<00:05:49.960> video

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
make a completely separate video

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.800 
make a completely separate video
I<00:05:50.500> might<00:05:51.160> just<00:05:51.190> comment<00:05:51.730> on<00:05:51.850> this<00:05:52.030> video<00:05:52.240> or<00:05:52.720> I

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
I might just comment on this video or I
