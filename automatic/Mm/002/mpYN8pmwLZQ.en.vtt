00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.400
 and let's prepare yuki roll a sushi 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.250
 with palm crab and salmon 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.980
 I make it a kind of caviar let's see 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.130
 the ingredients 80 grams of rice 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.980
 sushi an avocado 30 grams more I do 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.920
 80 grams of fresh salmon two sticks 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.650
 of crab 30 grams of anguilla an alga 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.300
 dynamite and sesame sauce nori ya 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.410
 we made the rice 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.260
 they are going to buy something not today 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.140
 we grab an algae when they buy the algae 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.250
 already going to have a striped part that in the 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.680
 part ralla is where the rice will go 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:53.010
 has a part that is smoother and has 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.620
 a striped part has some lines if 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.580
 you can see them then they will place the 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:03.360
 seaweed in this way with the stripes 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:10.450
 horizontals looking at you and what 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:14.409
 long do not use the complete seaweed 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.619
 because there would be many laps and not 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.930
 it's the right thing we're going to grab 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:24.120
 approximately 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.490
 between 70 80 and 90 grams of rice I'm going 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.500
 to take step by step as they should 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.840
 do each one has its form every 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.000
 who has his technique I 'm going to 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.360
 teach the one that for me is the easiest 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.470
 that they placed with a rice ball in 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.590
 the means to spread it in this way towards 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.979
 long and then they are expanding from this 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.979
 way 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.710
 and it expands all over the rice already 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.200
 let's polish be 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.240
 putting rice that all the nori is left 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.400
 covered if there is any 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:07.380
 little hole is not in bad life is not 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:07.380
 mortify it covers or leads to the other 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:14.870
 we expanded the rice as we could have 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.110
 realized is all the rice on the 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.950
 alga 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.740
 we turn the nori looking at us 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.150
 we do not worry about rice anymore 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:31.329
 it's not going to come out 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:34.810
 is stuffed with cream cheese cream cheese 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:37.659
 q what is stuck and you look over that 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.599
 outward because we're going to wrap up 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:51.609
 here for outside we are going to prepare a 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:55.480

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:18.640
 Take heart of crab tighten here 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.409
 we climb the first tight always 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.000
 it has to be strong but not so strong 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:24.790
 because we are always going to tend 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.040
 it also depends on carroll carroll has 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.620
 a filling the avocado and for being more 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.150
 weak always tends to slip in the 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:36.040
 role then we firmly tighten 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.260
 we make 2 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.450
 we firmly do 3 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.540
 we express firmly and there we already give 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:49.120
 the last to the role then the decoration 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:51.340
 of this role goes with past 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:55.980
 they can bite it 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.980
 and then place it go placing more I do 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.560
