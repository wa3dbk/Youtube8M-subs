00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:05.180
 coffee harvester harvested in 2010 suffered from drill infestation and 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.420
 producers had to make strict chemical control to avoid 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.820
 both for quality and quantity of coffee 

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:17.869
 but for 2011 a news encouraging coffee growers 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:23.579
 the prediction is that the drill is low infestation in crops, the reason is that 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:27.809
 southern region of Minas Gerais underwent a more rigid drought and with 

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:32.119
 conditions were not favorable for survival and multiplication 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.689
 of the drill we by others initially the drill that it survives juno puc 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.320
 circuses that have not been punished 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.320
 coffee trees and also on the ground 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.510
 if the company is dry 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.410
 there will be little surviving vote on it 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.410
 to attack the fruits give only that the thirst of the new crop 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.730
 last year 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.520
 and maybe it facilitates 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.550
 little about vesta drill few people are assaulted 2011 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.350
 so this is it is very important because 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.350
 This is good news for our coffee growers. 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.350
 tusk to party very well in the market so climbing 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.200
 little mouth endosulfan buy of the type of highly toxic credit 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.900
 who will be replaced than two years 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.840
 the new product 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.060
 I say efficiency or bar to air 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.630
 I hate psychological 3 little crooked 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.970
 to prevent the spread of the disease 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.300
 producers should monitor the coffee 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.970
 taylor made the following logo the new initially dalton 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.880
 and made his goal then 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.270
 arrived in the field of the other and did what made a survey 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.970
 monitoring is done 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.350
 in the three heights where you will fill a spreadsheet 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.590
 and 30 plants were left in the end it does in short all the wanted 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.670
 and calculates the percentage of funds on the roof 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.550
 yielded 3% even more than he will make a single condemnation when drowned 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.150
 two liters per team 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.760
 and this monitoring of the result 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.800
 here on the farm eparema one of the largest coffee exporters in the country. 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.430
 control that is victorious for some years is done regularly during a 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.590
 month five people split in the 3400 equitares you get a battalion 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.579
 battalion 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.670
 it is unheard of at the moment there is a second application 

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:30.549
 do not even know 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.430
 some hotels have already been marked and it is possible to see beetle even though it is 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.489
 other grains 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.720
 As recently as last year only 30% of the area needed insecticides this year. 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:47.669
 number dropped even more only 10% of the coffee will need the application 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:53.879
 performing 10% according to them at 90% and 90% representing around 90 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.969
 thousand reais there 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:57.749
 It's for the less and to save. 

00:02:57.749 --> 00:03:01.109
 you can soon offer other technologies to 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:02.999
 the measure is to reduce costs 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:07.239
 and still benefits the environment as well as the employee 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.109
 of the farm that is less exposed to the product even before taking off and 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.579
 sustainability certification she has already done 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.580
 or adopted integrated pest management techniques 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.220
 and this is good because you have an economy is not a product economy right? 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:26.959
 and to the advantage of protecting the environment and myself and the 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:27.319
 also
