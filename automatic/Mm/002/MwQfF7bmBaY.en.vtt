00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.300
 in this episode we will see 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:28.570
 how to make steaming successful 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:31.150
 full couscous I start with that 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.120
 lots and I water the couscous with 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.120
 water I work well with them 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.400
 fingers and I let it absorb 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.460
 fully salt water once the water 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.830
 absorbed I rework the couscous with 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.170
 the fingers to separate the grains 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.899
 I then deposit the couscous in a 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.450
 couscous and I place it on a 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.940
 pot containing boiling water and 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.160
 we have 15 to 20 minutes 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.980
 from the moment the steam starts 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.110
 to escape through the couscous after 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.629
 the first steaming I 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.460
 put the couscous back in the big dish and 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.740
 I coat it with a tablespoon 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.600
 sunflower oil 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.970
 I work well couscous for 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.220
 the fat coated and I the 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.890
 pink for the second time with water 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.420
 salty and I let it sit until 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.270
 that it does not absorb completely 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.550
 once the water is absorbed I rework the 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.399
 couscous to air and separate well 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.800
 the grains I then place the couscous 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:33.490
 in couscous for the second 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.149
 steaming and counting 15 to 20 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.399
 minutes 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.429
 from the moment the steam starts 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.200
 to escape through the couscous after 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:44.080
 the second steaming 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.300
 I put the couscous back in the dish and I 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.009
 the ai had yesterday with a spoon until 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.380
 what I know by well the grains of 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.929
 couscous game the rose for the last 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.819
 time with the remaining salt water and I 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:57.490
 let him absorb once the water 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:59.590
 absorbed I rework the couscous for 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.899

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.060

 from the moment the steam starts to 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.670
 escape through the couscous 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.920
 after the 3rd steam cooking 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.500
 the couscous in the dish and it is coated 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.270
 of fat depending on the choice either 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.830
