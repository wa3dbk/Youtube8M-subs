project in a few days when one bulb
comes<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.850> will<00:01:59.969> be<00:02:00.890> it<00:02:01.890> will<00:02:02.040> be<00:02:02.070> LED<00:02:02.610> reverse

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
comes in will be it will be LED reverse

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.170 
comes in will be it will be LED reverse
lights<00:02:03.299> green<00:02:03.840> green<00:02:04.619> reverse<00:02:04.890> lights

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
so that's it 2.5 curl LEDs and green

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.240 
so that's it 2.5 curl LEDs and green
parking<00:02:23.670> lights<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.870> uh<00:02:25.700> that's<00:02:26.700> about<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:27.060> I
