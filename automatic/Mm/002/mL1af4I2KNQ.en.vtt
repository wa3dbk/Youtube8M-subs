now<00:02:00.090> we'll<00:02:00.210> take

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
now we'll take

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:01.880 
now we'll take
we're<00:02:00.780> going<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.020> glue<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.320> on<00:02:01.499> usually<00:02:01.829> a

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
we're going to glue this on usually a

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.910 
we're going to glue this on usually a
typical<00:02:02.479> keg<00:02:03.479> shoe<00:02:03.749> or<00:02:04.020> directly<00:02:04.469> gluing<00:02:04.829> it

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
typical keg shoe or directly gluing it

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.349 
typical keg shoe or directly gluing it
usually<00:02:05.159> just<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.369> two<00:02:05.549> ounce<00:02:05.700> jar<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.149> equi

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:06.359 
usually just a two ounce jar of equi

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:09.559 
usually just a two ounce jar of equi
lots<00:02:06.569> the<00:02:06.899> usual<00:02:07.229> will<00:02:07.409> will<00:02:08.280> need<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:09.360> then

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
lots the usual will will need and then

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.150 
lots the usual will will need and then
we<00:02:09.899> mix<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.140> little<00:02:10.289> bit<00:02:10.379> of<00:02:10.440> fiberglass<00:02:10.920> in

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
we mix a little bit of fiberglass in

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.770 
we mix a little bit of fiberglass in
there<00:02:11.310> just<00:02:11.640> shred<00:02:11.879> some<00:02:11.970> fiberglass<00:02:12.330> up<00:02:12.629> in

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
there just shred some fiberglass up in

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.479 
there just shred some fiberglass up in
there<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:13.019> it<00:02:13.110> helps<00:02:13.769> increase<00:02:14.010> some<00:02:14.370> of<00:02:14.400> the

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
there and it helps increase some of the

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.009 
there and it helps increase some of the
tensile<00:02:14.849> strength<00:02:15.269> it<00:02:15.450> stops<00:02:15.690> some<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:15.959> the

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
tensile strength it stops some of the

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.440 
tensile strength it stops some of the
cracking<00:02:16.500> my<00:02:17.370> opinion<00:02:17.730> also<00:02:17.970> makes<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.299> glue

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
cracking my opinion also makes the glue

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.640 
cracking my opinion also makes the glue
a<00:02:18.480> little<00:02:18.690> easier<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:18.989> work<00:02:19.049> with<00:02:19.200> gives<00:02:19.620> a

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
a little easier to work with gives a

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.550 
a little easier to work with gives a
little<00:02:19.769> more<00:02:19.860> bulk<00:02:20.220> so<00:02:20.700> it's<00:02:20.819> not<00:02:20.910> so<00:02:21.200> so<00:02:22.200> so

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
little more bulk so it's not so so so

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.470 
little more bulk so it's not so so so
liquidy<00:02:22.980> just<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:23.790> makes<00:02:23.910> it<00:02:24.030> easier<00:02:24.209> to<00:02:24.239> mold

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
liquidy just it makes it easier to mold

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.570 
liquidy just it makes it easier to mold
it<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:24.750> sculpt<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:25.230> around<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.799> angle<00:02:26.489> to

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
it and sculpt it around the angle to

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:36.110 
it and sculpt it around the angle to
heal<00:02:34.549> one<00:02:35.549> thing<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.730> want<00:02:35.849> to<00:02:35.879> make<00:02:35.940> sure

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
heal one thing you want to make sure

while you're letting the glue set up
what's<00:06:20.069> the<00:06:20.189> clue<00:06:20.340> cure<00:06:20.639> better<00:06:20.879> -<00:06:21.090> you<00:06:21.449> keep

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:21.569 
what's the clue cure better - you keep

what's the clue cure better - you keep
wrap<00:06:22.199> it<00:06:22.349> up<00:06:22.439> with<00:06:22.530> plastic<00:06:23.009> or<00:06:23.099> a<00:06:23.159> glove<00:06:23.430> the

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:23.699 
wrap it up with plastic or a glove the

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:26.450 
wrap it up with plastic or a glove the
glove<00:06:23.729> is<00:06:24.030> really<00:06:24.240> easy<00:06:24.360> to<00:06:24.419> use<00:06:25.340> you're<00:06:26.340> going

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
glove is really easy to use you're going

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.279 
glove is really easy to use you're going
to<00:06:26.520> charge<00:06:26.699> using<00:06:26.879> plastic<00:06:27.479> wrap<00:06:27.690> to<00:06:27.900> wrap<00:06:28.080> it

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:28.289 
to charge using plastic wrap to wrap it

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:29.570 
to charge using plastic wrap to wrap it
that's<00:06:28.680> a<00:06:28.770> little<00:06:28.919> more<00:06:29.069> difficult<00:06:29.520> because

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
that's a little more difficult because

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.010 
that's a little more difficult because
the<00:06:29.759> shoe<00:06:29.940> may<00:06:30.090> shift<00:06:30.360> on<00:06:30.599> you<00:06:30.780> when<00:06:30.900> you're

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
the shoe may shift on you when you're

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.439 
the shoe may shift on you when you're
wrapping<00:06:31.259> it<00:06:31.319> with<00:06:31.409> a<00:06:31.440> plastic<00:06:32.060> so<00:06:33.060> just<00:06:33.300> put<00:06:33.419> a

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:33.449 
wrapping it with a plastic so just put a

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:35.270 
wrapping it with a plastic so just put a
glove<00:06:33.690> on<00:06:33.870> there<00:06:34.050> is<00:06:34.169> probably<00:06:34.830> the<00:06:34.919> way<00:06:35.039> to<00:06:35.099> go

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 
glove on there is probably the way to go

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.659 
glove on there is probably the way to go
in<00:06:35.430> my<00:06:35.460> opinion<00:06:37.129> usually<00:06:38.129> you<00:06:38.219> got<00:06:38.340> to<00:06:38.430> hold<00:06:38.550> it

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:38.669 
in my opinion usually you got to hold it

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:42.499 
in my opinion usually you got to hold it
up<00:06:38.789> for<00:06:38.819> maybe<00:06:39.690> two<00:06:39.900> or<00:06:40.050> three<00:06:40.199> minutes<00:06:41.509> we

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:42.509 
up for maybe two or three minutes we

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:43.730 
up for maybe two or three minutes we
heated<00:06:42.780> the<00:06:42.870> shoe<00:06:43.080> up<00:06:43.229> so<00:06:43.409> it<00:06:43.469> should<00:06:43.620> go<00:06:43.710> a

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
heated the shoe up so it should go a

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.440 
heated the shoe up so it should go a
little<00:06:43.800> quicker

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:48.450 

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.850 

and<00:06:49.450> we<00:06:49.600> removed<00:06:49.930> most<00:06:50.050> of<00:06:50.200> the<00:06:50.290> excess<00:06:50.560> glue

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:50.860 
and we removed most of the excess glue

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.260 
and we removed most of the excess glue
when<00:06:51.160> it<00:06:51.250> was<00:06:51.340> still<00:06:51.550> setting<00:06:51.910> up<00:06:52.000> with<00:06:52.180> the

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.270 
when it was still setting up with the

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.710 
when it was still setting up with the
gauze<00:06:52.480> so<00:06:54.150> it's<00:06:55.150> not<00:06:55.210> a<00:06:55.270> whole<00:06:55.420> lot<00:06:55.510> to<00:06:55.600> do

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 
gauze so it's not a whole lot to do

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.450 
gauze so it's not a whole lot to do
we'll<00:06:55.900> just<00:06:56.020> hit<00:06:56.080> with<00:06:56.260> a<00:06:56.290> with<00:06:56.650> a<00:06:56.680> sander<00:06:57.130> just

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:57.460
