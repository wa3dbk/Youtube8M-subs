00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
trills let's say in the key of C the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.210 
trills let's say in the key of C the
truth<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.960> tools<00:00:28.200> tend<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.590> go<00:00:28.710> between<00:00:28.860> the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
truth of tools tend to go between the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:41.450 
truth of tools tend to go between the
fifth<00:00:29.520> and<00:00:29.700> the<00:00:30.529> seventh<00:00:38.840> in<00:00:39.840> Orleans<00:00:40.460> they

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
fifth and the seventh in Orleans they

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.009 
fifth and the seventh in Orleans they

tend to go between the third and the

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:48.020 
tend to go between the third and the
fifth<00:00:45.830> and<00:00:46.830> they<00:00:47.070> go<00:00:47.339> slice<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.820> slightly

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
fifth and they go slice it slightly

experiment with those different trills

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.230 
experiment with those different trills
in<00:02:00.979> those<00:02:01.160> two<00:02:01.399> different<00:02:01.670> intervals

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
in those two different intervals
