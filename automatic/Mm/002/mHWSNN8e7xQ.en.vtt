00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.300 

so<00:00:00.719> now<00:00:00.840> that<00:00:00.900> we've<00:00:01.199> talked<00:00:01.469> about<00:00:01.589> glycogen

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
so now that we've talked about glycogen

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.269 
so now that we've talked about glycogen
metabolism<00:00:02.460> in<00:00:03.330> terms<00:00:03.570> of<00:00:04.279> glycogenolysis

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
metabolism in terms of glycogenolysis

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.089 
metabolism in terms of glycogenolysis
and<00:00:05.569> glycol<00:00:06.569> Genesis<00:00:07.109> I<00:00:07.379> just<00:00:07.830> want<00:00:08.010> to

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
and glycol Genesis I just want to

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.480 
and glycol Genesis I just want to
quickly<00:00:08.519> go<00:00:08.730> over<00:00:08.990> the<00:00:10.010> glycogen<00:00:11.010> storage

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
quickly go over the glycogen storage

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.820 
quickly go over the glycogen storage
diseases<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.480> I'm<00:00:12.690> just<00:00:12.870> gonna<00:00:12.960> go<00:00:13.200> over<00:00:13.440> the

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
diseases and I'm just gonna go over the

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.150 
diseases and I'm just gonna go over the
enzymes<00:00:14.580> that<00:00:14.820> are<00:00:14.969> affected<00:00:15.750> when<00:00:16.410> the

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
enzymes that are affected when the

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.970 
enzymes that are affected when the
symptoms<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.789> these<00:00:17.940> diseases<00:00:18.350> manifest<00:00:19.350> so

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
symptoms of these diseases manifest so

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.960 
symptoms of these diseases manifest so
the<00:00:20.130> first<00:00:20.369> one<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.550> want<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.850> look<00:00:21.060> at<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.769> the

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
the first one I want to look at is the

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:30.550 
the first one I want to look at is the
glycogen<00:00:24.320> synthase<00:00:25.320> enzyme<00:00:25.640> and<00:00:28.640> here<00:00:29.640> this

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
glycogen synthase enzyme and here this

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.280 
glycogen synthase enzyme and here this
effects<00:00:31.560> are<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.489> organ<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.540> affected

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
effects are the organ that is affected

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.729 
effects are the organ that is affected
in<00:00:34.410> this<00:00:34.559> case<00:00:34.890> would<00:00:35.460> be<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:36.329> liver<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.960> some

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
in this case would be the liver and some

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.900 
in this case would be the liver and some
of<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.980> symptoms<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.840> this<00:00:40.040> disease<00:00:41.040> or<00:00:41.700> this

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
of the symptoms of this disease or this

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.209 
of the symptoms of this disease or this
glycogen<00:00:42.300> storage<00:00:42.690> disease<00:00:43.170> when<00:00:43.500> glycogen

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
glycogen storage disease when glycogen

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.639 
glycogen storage disease when glycogen
synthase<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.090> enzyme<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.840> affected

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
synthase is the enzyme that is affected

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.619 
synthase is the enzyme that is affected
or<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.980> isn't<00:00:47.129> working<00:00:47.730> properly<00:00:47.760> or<00:00:48.270> just

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
or that isn't working properly or just

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.830 
or that isn't working properly or just
not<00:00:48.870> present<00:00:49.410> we<00:00:49.980> see<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.460> there<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.510> low

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
not present we see that there is a low

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.069 
not present we see that there is a low

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
be affected in glycogen storage diseases

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.679 
be affected in glycogen storage diseases
is<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.870> enzyme<00:01:05.210> glucose-6-phosphatase<00:01:06.210> and

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
is the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase and

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.830 
is the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase and
this<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.560> often<00:01:08.340> referred<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.939> as<00:01:09.330> von

this is often referred to as von

this is often referred to as von
gierek's<00:01:10.320> disease<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:12.119> organ<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.780> is

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
gierek's disease and the organ that is

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.320 
gierek's disease and the organ that is
affected<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.770> disease<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:15.000> liver

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
affected in this disease is the liver

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.260 
affected in this disease is the liver
and<00:01:15.630> some<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.439> symptoms<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.310> can<00:01:17.850> that

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
and some of the symptoms that can that

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.830 
and some of the symptoms that can that
are<00:01:18.390> noticeable<00:01:18.930> are<00:01:19.110> an<00:01:19.320> enlarged<00:01:20.100> liver<00:01:20.430> and

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
are noticeable are an enlarged liver and

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.340 
are noticeable are an enlarged liver and
kidney<00:01:21.840> failure

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
kidney failure

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.090 
kidney failure
so<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.430> deep<00:01:23.640> branching<00:01:24.240> enzyme<00:01:24.360> can<00:01:24.930> also<00:01:25.170> be

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
so the deep branching enzyme can also be

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.760 
so the deep branching enzyme can also be
affected<00:01:26.759> or<00:01:27.030> inactive<00:01:28.020> not<00:01:28.380> working

would see cramps in patients or them had

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.800 
would see cramps in patients or them had
the<00:02:25.460> patients<00:02:25.880> would<00:02:25.940> have<00:02:26.120> pain<00:02:26.420> during

the patients would have pain during

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.350 
the patients would have pain during
exercise<00:02:27.440> and<00:02:27.470> also<00:02:28.280> there'll<00:02:28.490> be<00:02:28.550> a<00:02:28.670> presence

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
exercise and also there'll be a presence

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.550 
exercise and also there'll be a presence
of<00:02:29.650> myoglobin<00:02:30.650> in<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:32.000> urine<00:02:32.390> so<00:02:33.140> this<00:02:33.350> just
