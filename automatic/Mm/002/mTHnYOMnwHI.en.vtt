at that second I'm saying that you need
to<00:01:07.170> essentially<00:01:07.590> build<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.700> routine<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.450> has

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
to essentially build a routine that has

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.710 
to essentially build a routine that has
more<00:01:10.110> water<00:01:10.439> getting<00:01:10.830> into<00:01:11.070> your<00:01:11.280> hair<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:11.820> you

more water getting into your hair so you

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.200

can co wash or no poo one time two times
I<00:01:15.600> mean<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:15.990> do<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:16.290> often<00:01:16.470> as

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
I mean you can do it as often as

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.249 
I mean you can do it as often as
necessary<00:01:16.890> let<00:01:17.460> your<00:01:17.640> hair<00:01:17.850> tell<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.570> think

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
two weeks or more than that is just bad

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
even before I went natural one of the

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.649 
even before I went natural one of the
best<00:01:32.040> things<00:01:32.280> i<00:01:32.430> did<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> dermatologist<00:01:33.450> told

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
best things i did a dermatologist told

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.789 
best things i did a dermatologist told
me<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:33.990> was<00:01:34.079> having<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.409> problem<00:01:34.619> with

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
me that I was having a problem with

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.880 
me that I was having a problem with
dandruff<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.549> thought<00:01:35.759> my<00:01:35.939> hair<00:01:36.150> was<00:01:36.180> dry<00:01:36.890> so

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
dandruff so I thought my hair was dry so

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:38.870 
dandruff so I thought my hair was dry so
I<00:01:37.920> certainly<00:01:38.159> would<00:01:38.460> have<00:01:38.490> think<00:01:38.729> that

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
I certainly would have think that

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.399 
I certainly would have think that
watching<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.479> more<00:01:39.659> often<00:01:39.840> would<00:01:40.110> be<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
watching it more often would be the

body<00:03:11.549> is<00:03:11.700> using<00:03:12.150> more<00:03:12.359> of<00:03:12.389> its<00:03:12.600> energy<00:03:13.170> to

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
body is using more of its energy to

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.020 
body is using more of its energy to
ensure<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:13.709> your<00:03:14.069> head<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.489> your<00:03:14.609> body's

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
ensure that your head and your body's

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.360 
ensure that your head and your body's
warm<00:03:15.359> and<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.989> more<00:03:16.230> energies<00:03:16.530> uses<00:03:17.100> in<00:03:17.220> one

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
warm and the more energies uses in one

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.860 
warm and the more energies uses in one
place<00:03:17.639> means<00:03:17.910> there's<00:03:18.090> less<00:03:18.150> energy<00:03:18.690> being

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
place means there's less energy being

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.569 
place means there's less energy being
used<00:03:19.109> in<00:03:19.230> another<00:03:19.530> so<00:03:20.099> it<00:03:20.160> doesn't<00:03:20.400> mean<00:03:20.489> you

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
used in another so it doesn't mean you

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.220 
used in another so it doesn't mean you
probably<00:03:20.730> have<00:03:20.940> less<00:03:21.150> energy<00:03:21.389> being<00:03:21.840> used<00:03:22.079> in

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
probably have less energy being used in

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.780 
probably have less energy being used in
your<00:03:22.380> immune<00:03:22.650> system<00:03:22.920> that<00:03:23.400> sort<00:03:23.670> of<00:03:23.730> thing

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
your immune system that sort of thing

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.940 
your immune system that sort of thing
but<00:03:24.510> no<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:25.319> only<00:03:25.410> way<00:03:25.590> you're<00:03:25.709> going<00:03:25.799> to<00:03:25.859> get

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
but no the only way you're going to get

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.800 
but no the only way you're going to get
a<00:03:26.010> cold<00:03:26.340> or<00:03:26.700> something<00:03:26.730> like<00:03:27.120> that<00:03:27.180> is<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.690> get

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
a cold or something like that is to get

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.900 
a cold or something like that is to get
in<00:03:28.049> contact<00:03:28.319> with<00:03:28.680> a<00:03:28.709> virus<00:03:29.069> and<00:03:29.519> just<00:03:29.730> going

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
in contact with a virus and just going

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.339 
in contact with a virus and just going
outside<00:03:30.150> in<00:03:30.359> the<00:03:30.540> cold<00:03:30.720> does<00:03:30.959> not<00:03:30.989> necessarily

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
outside in the cold does not necessarily

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.849 
outside in the cold does not necessarily
make<00:03:31.829> that<00:03:32.010> happen<00:03:32.160> I<00:03:32.430> walk<00:03:32.700> outside<00:03:32.910> with

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
make that happen I walk outside with

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.110 
make that happen I walk outside with
flip-flops<00:03:34.859> on<00:03:35.069> in<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.310> winter<00:03:35.579> all<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.849> time

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
flip-flops on in the winter all the time

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.690 
flip-flops on in the winter all the time
again<00:03:37.079> with<00:03:37.560> wet<00:03:37.769> hair<00:03:38.010> all<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.160> time<00:03:38.280> and

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
again with wet hair all the time and

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.520 
again with wet hair all the time and
never<00:03:39.000> really<00:03:39.239> have<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.510> problem<00:03:39.720> of<00:03:39.989> cold<00:03:40.230> so

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
never really have a problem of cold so

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.289 
never really have a problem of cold so
so<00:03:41.280> there's<00:03:41.459> definitely<00:03:41.549> not<00:03:41.910> some<00:03:42.090> thoughts

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
so there's definitely not some thoughts

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.909 
so there's definitely not some thoughts
on<00:03:42.450> moisture<00:03:42.900> when<00:03:43.049> people<00:03:43.349> say<00:03:43.530> you<00:03:43.590> need<00:03:43.769> to

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
on moisture when people say you need to

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:46.009 
on moisture when people say you need to
moisturize<00:03:44.250> more<00:03:44.910> it's<00:03:45.060> not<00:03:45.239> saying<00:03:45.540> oh<00:03:45.750> well

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
moisturize more it's not saying oh well

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.449 
moisturize more it's not saying oh well
you<00:03:46.169> need<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:46.410> go<00:03:46.530> right<00:03:46.769> now<00:03:46.829> run<00:03:47.190> into<00:03:47.370> the

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
you need to go right now run into the

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.190 
you need to go right now run into the
bathroom<00:03:47.609> and<00:03:47.940> put<00:03:48.150> some<00:03:48.329> water<00:03:48.599> on<00:03:48.720> your<00:03:48.870> hair

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
bathroom and put some water on your hair

bathroom and put some water on your hair
essentially<00:03:50.010> it<00:03:50.099> means<00:03:50.130> you<00:03:50.459> need<00:03:50.639> to<00:03:50.700> build

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
essentially it means you need to build

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:54.199 
essentially it means you need to build
up<00:03:51.630> your<00:03:51.660> routine<00:03:52.109> your<00:03:52.799> regimen<00:03:53.400> of<00:03:53.609> washing
