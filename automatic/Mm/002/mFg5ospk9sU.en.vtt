00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:04.510 

here's<00:00:01.729> a<00:00:01.819> situation<00:00:02.150> where<00:00:03.139> we<00:00:03.530> actually<00:00:03.709> got

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:04.520 
here's a situation where we actually got

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.090 
here's a situation where we actually got
to<00:00:04.850> fill<00:00:05.390> the<00:00:05.690> spot<00:00:05.960> tub<00:00:06.290> up<00:00:06.589> with<00:00:06.799> water

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.100 
to fill the spot tub up with water

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.970 
to fill the spot tub up with water
before<00:00:07.700> installing<00:00:08.240> it<00:00:08.660> now<00:00:09.469> the<00:00:09.530> reason<00:00:09.860> why

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:09.980 
before installing it now the reason why

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.709 
before installing it now the reason why
we<00:00:10.009> did<00:00:10.400> this<00:00:10.580> was<00:00:10.910> because<00:00:11.150> there<00:00:11.599> were<00:00:11.690> just

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:11.719 
we did this was because there were just

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.850 
we did this was because there were just
too<00:00:12.320> many<00:00:13.690> possible<00:00:14.690> problems<00:00:15.410> that<00:00:15.620> could

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:15.860 
too many possible problems that could

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.440 
too many possible problems that could
have<00:00:15.980> went<00:00:16.219> wrong<00:00:16.430> with<00:00:16.640> his<00:00:16.760> tub<00:00:17.030> we<00:00:17.210> wanted

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:17.450 
have went wrong with his tub we wanted

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.780 
have went wrong with his tub we wanted
to<00:00:17.540> make<00:00:17.690> sure<00:00:17.840> that<00:00:18.020> it<00:00:18.200> didn't<00:00:18.500> leak<00:00:18.800> it<00:00:19.130> had

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:19.790 
to make sure that it didn't leak it had

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.260 
to make sure that it didn't leak it had
a<00:00:20.590> Plexiglas<00:00:21.590> window<00:00:22.070> on<00:00:22.280> the<00:00:22.430> side<00:00:22.700> of<00:00:22.880> it

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
a Plexiglas window on the side of it

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.070 
a Plexiglas window on the side of it
I<00:00:23.300> think<00:00:23.990> this<00:00:24.200> tub<00:00:24.560> had<00:00:24.880> 30<00:00:25.880> holes<00:00:26.330> in<00:00:26.690> it<00:00:26.840> for

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
I think this tub had 30 holes in it for

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.320 
I think this tub had 30 holes in it for
special<00:00:27.290> parts<00:00:27.860> that<00:00:28.100> did<00:00:28.280> this<00:00:28.490> and<00:00:28.550> that<00:00:28.820> and

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
special parts that did this and that and

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.600 
special parts that did this and that and
I<00:00:29.450> was<00:00:29.630> just<00:00:29.660> worried<00:00:30.110> about<00:00:30.170> it<00:00:30.440> leaking<00:00:30.680> now

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
I was just worried about it leaking now

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.130 
I was just worried about it leaking now

on every tub you run into situations
where<00:00:38.090> you<00:00:38.360> might<00:00:38.570> have<00:00:38.600> a<00:00:39.290> tub<00:00:40.160> that<00:00:40.190> sits<00:00:40.940> in

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
where you might have a tub that sits in

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.040 
where you might have a tub that sits in
an<00:00:41.980> opening<00:00:42.980> and<00:00:43.550> if<00:00:44.000> this<00:00:44.120> is<00:00:44.330> the<00:00:44.360> case<00:00:44.630> yeah

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.520 
you're not going to be able to fill it
up<00:00:46.460> if<00:00:47.090> you<00:00:47.329> can<00:00:47.480> figure<00:00:47.690> out<00:00:47.810> a<00:00:47.960> way<00:00:48.050> to<00:00:48.170> do<00:00:48.410> it

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
up if you can figure out a way to do it

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.180 
up if you can figure out a way to do it
safely<00:00:48.770> great<00:00:49.400> but<00:00:50.390> other<00:00:51.079> than<00:00:51.320> that<00:00:51.380> you

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
safely great but other than that you

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.260 
safely great but other than that you

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
worked out to our benefit to test the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.920 
worked out to our benefit to test the
tub<00:01:35.810> out<00:01:35.990> and<00:01:36.790> we<00:01:37.790> didn't<00:01:38.119> end<00:01:38.299> up<00:01:38.420> installing

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
tub out and we didn't end up installing

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.680 
tub out and we didn't end up installing
it<00:01:39.290> anyway<00:01:39.770> because<00:01:40.100> we<00:01:40.850> had<00:01:41.060> a<00:01:41.090> couple<00:01:41.360> other

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
it anyway because we had a couple other

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.870 
it anyway because we had a couple other
problems<00:01:42.200> with<00:01:42.530> it<00:01:42.740> besides<00:01:42.950> the<00:01:43.280> waste<00:01:43.580> valve

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
problems with it besides the waste valve

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.480 
problems with it besides the waste valve
so<00:01:44.619> make<00:01:45.619> a<00:01:45.650> long<00:01:45.920> story<00:01:46.220> short<00:01:46.369> it<00:01:47.330> does

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
so make a long story short it does

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.219 
so make a long story short it does
benefit<00:01:49.490> you<00:01:49.729> every<00:01:49.909> once<00:01:50.360> in<00:01:50.510> a<00:01:50.600> while<00:01:50.659> to

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
benefit you every once in a while to

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.270 
benefit you every once in a while to
test<00:01:51.710> some<00:01:52.369> of<00:01:52.400> these<00:01:52.900> tubs<00:01:53.900> to<00:01:54.590> make<00:01:55.070> sure

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
test some of these tubs to make sure

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.660 
test some of these tubs to make sure
that<00:01:55.520> they<00:01:55.700> don't<00:01:55.939> leak<00:01:56.330> before<00:01:56.960> you<00:01:57.200> actually

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
that they don't leak before you actually

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.670 
that they don't leak before you actually
install<00:01:58.670> them<00:01:59.119> and<00:01:59.509> check<00:02:00.140> to<00:02:00.290> make<00:02:00.409> sure<00:02:00.470> that

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
install them and check to make sure that

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.670 
install them and check to make sure that
they're<00:02:01.189> that<00:02:01.790> they<00:02:02.030> work<00:02:02.450> so<00:02:03.020> that<00:02:03.380> would<00:02:03.530> be

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
they're that they work so that would be

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.729 
they're that they work so that would be
the<00:02:03.799> priority<00:02:04.400> number<00:02:04.700> one
