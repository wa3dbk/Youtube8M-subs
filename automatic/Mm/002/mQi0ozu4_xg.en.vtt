00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
carbon plates to make carbon plate you

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.680 
carbon plates to make carbon plate you
need<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.710> first<00:01:02.250> make<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:02.699> raw<00:01:02.940> carbon<00:01:03.359> mesh

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
need to first make this raw carbon mesh

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.050 
need to first make this raw carbon mesh
which<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.680> will<00:01:04.920> show<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.189> how<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.369> do<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.790> as

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
which I will show you how to do that as

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.789 
which I will show you how to do that as
you<00:01:06.360> can<00:01:06.479> see<00:01:06.600> we<00:01:06.659> got<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.869> ice<00:01:06.990> block<00:01:07.560> from

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
you can see we got the ice block from

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.700 
you can see we got the ice block from
the<00:01:08.000> snowball<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.840> can<00:01:09.960> press<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.530> raw

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
the snowball and you can press the raw

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.440 
the snowball and you can press the raw
carbon<00:01:11.159> mesh<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.850> will<00:01:12.030> make<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.330> an

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
carbon mesh and that will make you an

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.590 
carbon mesh and that will make you an
iron<00:01:12.600> plate<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.080> make<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.409> bra<00:01:13.650> carbon<00:01:14.130> mesh

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
iron plate to make the bra carbon mesh

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.020 
iron plate to make the bra carbon mesh
you<00:01:15.600> first<00:01:16.049> need<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.380> make<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.189> bit<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.670> coal

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
you first need to make a bit of coal

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.510 
you first need to make a bit of coal
dust<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:19.170> do<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.590> by<00:01:19.830> running<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.340> piece<00:01:20.490> of

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
dust you do that by running a piece of

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.880 
dust you do that by running a piece of
coal<00:01:21.000> through<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.810> macerator<00:01:22.380> right<00:01:22.650> there

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
coal through the macerator right there

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.170 
coal through the macerator right there
which<00:01:23.070> we<00:01:23.189> already<00:01:23.310> went<00:01:23.460> over<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.790> last<00:01:23.970> one

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
which we already went over the last one

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.060 
which we already went over the last one
that'll<00:01:24.450> turn<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.689> into<00:01:24.780> coal<00:01:25.020> dust<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:28.070> to

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
that'll turn it into coal dust and to

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.950 
that'll turn it into coal dust and to
make<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.340> mesh<00:01:29.579> take<00:01:30.299> your<00:01:30.479> coal<00:01:30.689> dust

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
make the mesh take your coal dust

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.749 
make the mesh take your coal dust
actually<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.530> can<00:01:31.680> do<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.920> in<00:01:32.100> your<00:01:32.400> regular

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
actually you can do it in your regular

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.870 
actually you can do it in your regular
crafting<00:01:33.600> window<00:01:33.930> too<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.579> just<00:01:35.579> make<00:01:35.850> a

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.539 
mainly all what you're going to use a
compressor<00:02:00.540> for<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:01.619> we<00:02:01.890> will<00:02:02.100> then<00:02:02.280> head<00:02:02.520> on

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
compressor for so we will then head on

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.789 
compressor for so we will then head on
to<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.479> next<00:02:03.750> item<00:02:03.960> we<00:02:04.170> need<00:02:04.350> we'll<00:02:04.680> be

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
to the next item we need we'll be

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.200 
to the next item we need we'll be
needing<00:02:05.040> for<00:02:05.159> our<00:02:05.219> solar<00:02:05.490> panel<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.119> is

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
needing for our solar panel and that is

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.570 
needing for our solar panel and that is
going<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.420> be<00:02:06.570> this<00:02:07.200> funny-looking<00:02:07.860> one<00:02:08.099> it's

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
going to be this funny-looking one it's

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.279 
going to be this funny-looking one it's
actually<00:02:09.000> from<00:02:09.119> railcraft<00:02:09.629> it's<00:02:09.959> called<00:02:10.170> the

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
actually from railcraft it's called the

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.020 
actually from railcraft it's called the
rolling

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
rolling

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.360 
rolling
it<00:02:11.780> does<00:02:12.170> run<00:02:12.380> off<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.680> build<00:02:12.860> craft<00:02:13.130> power

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
it does run off the build craft power

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.480 
it does run off the build craft power
which<00:02:13.640> is<00:02:13.790> why<00:02:13.910> I<00:02:13.940> have<00:02:14.090> it<00:02:14.240> over<00:02:14.420> on<00:02:14.540> this<00:02:14.750> half

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
which is why I have it over on this half

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.460 
which is why I have it over on this half
and<00:02:16.490> I'm<00:02:16.760> able<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.150> connect<00:02:17.540> it<00:02:17.690> I've<00:02:18.080> added<00:02:18.290> a

crafting<00:03:25.400> table<00:03:25.700> but<00:03:25.820> that's<00:03:26.000> not<00:03:26.239> going<00:03:26.390> to

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
crafting table but that's not going to

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.910 
crafting table but that's not going to
work<00:03:26.540> anymore<00:03:26.810> you<00:03:27.140> actually<00:03:27.530> have<00:03:27.650> to<00:03:27.739> run<00:03:27.860> it

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
work anymore you actually have to run it

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.220 
work anymore you actually have to run it
through<00:03:28.280> this<00:03:28.459> rolling<00:03:28.910> machine<00:03:29.239> so<00:03:29.870> you<00:03:29.959> put

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
through this rolling machine so you put

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.530 
through this rolling machine so you put
the<00:03:30.320> recipe<00:03:30.739> in<00:03:30.829> there<00:03:31.040> and<00:03:31.280> then<00:03:31.790> you<00:03:32.269> click

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
the recipe in there and then you click

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.300 
the recipe in there and then you click
on<00:03:32.690> this<00:03:32.900> once<00:03:33.200> and<00:03:33.440> that'll<00:03:33.680> start<00:03:33.980> it's

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
on this once and that'll start it's

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.520 
on this once and that'll start it's
gonna<00:03:34.459> suck<00:03:34.880> down<00:03:35.180> your<00:03:35.450> power<00:03:35.690> and<00:03:36.110> it<00:03:36.260> should

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
gonna suck down your power and it should

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.060 
gonna suck down your power and it should
be<00:03:36.700> enough<00:03:37.700> to<00:03:37.970> yes<00:03:38.570> just<00:03:39.049> barely<00:03:39.680> enough<00:03:39.829> to

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
be enough to yes just barely enough to

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.180 
be enough to yes just barely enough to
make<00:03:40.220> two<00:03:40.640> mixed<00:03:40.970> metal<00:03:41.209> and<00:03:41.390> gets<00:03:42.040> run<00:03:43.040> these

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
make two mixed metal and gets run these

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.490 
make two mixed metal and gets run these
into<00:03:43.430> your<00:03:43.549> compressor<00:03:44.030> and<00:03:44.690> it's<00:03:45.350> going<00:03:45.440> to

get<00:03:53.030> these<00:03:53.209> set<00:03:53.540> up<00:03:53.720> if<00:03:53.840> you<00:03:53.959> haven't<00:03:54.320> yet<00:03:54.590> and

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
get these set up if you haven't yet and

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.970 
get these set up if you haven't yet and
in<00:03:56.329> the<00:03:56.780> next<00:03:56.900> very<00:03:57.200> next<00:03:57.350> video<00:03:57.530> we're<00:03:57.829> going

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
in the next very next video we're going

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.340 
in the next very next video we're going
to<00:03:58.100> be<00:03:58.190> making<00:03:58.310> an<00:03:58.750> industrial<00:03:59.750> centrifuge

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
to be making an industrial centrifuge

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.710 
to be making an industrial centrifuge
which<00:04:01.130> is<00:04:01.370> also<00:04:01.609> needed<00:04:02.150> for<00:04:02.390> the<00:04:02.510> solar

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
which is also needed for the solar

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.280 
which is also needed for the solar
panels<00:04:03.140> that<00:04:04.010> Greg<00:04:04.280> texture<00:04:04.790> has<00:04:05.150> made<00:04:06.079> them<00:04:06.260> a

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
panels that Greg texture has made them a

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.720 
panels that Greg texture has made them a
lot<00:04:06.440> more<00:04:06.590> complicated<00:04:07.010> so<00:04:07.400> you<00:04:07.459> see<00:04:07.640> his

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
lot more complicated so you see his

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:08.979 
lot more complicated so you see his
mixed<00:04:08.000> metal<00:04:08.239> ingots<00:04:08.510> will<00:04:08.630> make<00:04:08.780> your

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
mixed metal ingots will make your

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.170 
mixed metal ingots will make your
advanced<00:04:09.440> alloy<00:04:09.890> and<00:04:10.220> you're<00:04:10.910> going<00:04:11.030> to<00:04:11.090> be

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
advanced alloy and you're going to be

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.449 
advanced alloy and you're going to be
using<00:04:11.329> a<00:04:11.630> lot<00:04:11.660> of<00:04:11.989> advanced<00:04:12.530> alloy<00:04:12.859> just<00:04:13.310> like

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
using a lot of advanced alloy just like

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.300 
using a lot of advanced alloy just like
you're<00:04:13.609> gonna<00:04:13.730> be<00:04:13.820> using<00:04:14.090> a<00:04:14.209> lot<00:04:14.239> of<00:04:14.540> carbon

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
you're gonna be using a lot of carbon

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.659 
you're gonna be using a lot of carbon
carbon<00:04:16.310> plates<00:04:16.989> so<00:04:17.989> do<00:04:18.500> set<00:04:19.130> up<00:04:19.220> some<00:04:19.519> way<00:04:19.640> you

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
carbon plates so do set up some way you

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.560 
carbon plates so do set up some way you
can<00:04:19.849> make<00:04:20.030> these<00:04:20.209> rather<00:04:20.690> easily

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
can make these rather easily

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.600 
can make these rather easily
to<00:04:22.260> make<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:23.450> the<00:04:24.450> rolling<00:04:24.840> machine<00:04:25.430> run<00:04:26.430> that

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
to make the the rolling machine run that

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:33.020 
to make the the rolling machine run that
through<00:04:27.650> any<00:04:28.650> IRA<00:04:29.220> here<00:04:31.400> it's<00:04:32.400> actually<00:04:32.610> four

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
through any IRA here it's actually four

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.380 
through any IRA here it's actually four
pistons<00:04:33.860> for<00:04:34.860> iron<00:04:35.220> ingots<00:04:35.550> and<00:04:35.730> a<00:04:36.000> crafting

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
pistons for iron ingots and a crafting

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.820 
pistons for iron ingots and a crafting
table<00:04:36.420> so<00:04:36.810> not<00:04:36.960> a<00:04:36.990> lot<00:04:37.050> of<00:04:37.170> advanced<00:04:37.530> stuff

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
table so not a lot of advanced stuff

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.130 
table so not a lot of advanced stuff
just<00:04:38.010> a<00:04:38.130> lot<00:04:38.310> of<00:04:38.490> a<00:04:39.000> lot<00:04:39.450> of<00:04:39.540> materials

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
just a lot of a lot of materials

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.530 
just a lot of a lot of materials
depending<00:04:40.920> on<00:04:41.040> your<00:04:41.250> whether<00:04:42.240> you're<00:04:42.420> just

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
depending on your whether you're just

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.360 
depending on your whether you're just
starting<00:04:42.630> the<00:04:42.990> game<00:04:43.080> or<00:04:43.260> not<00:04:43.440> this<00:04:43.590> is<00:04:43.650> this<00:04:44.280> is

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
starting the game or not this is this is

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.610 
starting the game or not this is this is
eight<00:04:44.580> pieces<00:04:44.820> of<00:04:44.940> iron<00:04:45.210> to<00:04:45.690> make<00:04:45.930> it<00:04:46.290> each

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
eight pieces of iron to make it each

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.100 
eight pieces of iron to make it each
piston<00:04:47.040> has<00:04:47.490> one<00:04:47.790> piece<00:04:48.090> of<00:04:48.270> iron<00:04:48.450> that's<00:04:48.930> why

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
piston has one piece of iron that's why

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.530 
piston has one piece of iron that's why
I<00:04:49.140> say<00:04:49.350> eight<00:04:49.560> and<00:04:49.860> a<00:04:50.670> crafting<00:04:51.030> table<00:04:51.060> so<00:04:51.510> you

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
I say eight and a crafting table so you

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.660 
I say eight and a crafting table so you
can<00:04:51.870> whip<00:04:52.140> one<00:04:52.380> of<00:04:52.470> those<00:04:52.590> up<00:04:52.800> not<00:04:53.220> too

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
can whip one of those up not too

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.610 
can whip one of those up not too
difficult<00:04:53.910> if<00:04:54.510> you<00:04:54.750> have<00:04:54.930> a<00:04:54.960> decent<00:04:55.200> start

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
difficult if you have a decent start

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.520 
difficult if you have a decent start
into<00:04:56.010> Minecraft<00:04:56.490> so<00:04:57.270> do<00:04:57.420> get<00:04:57.600> those<00:04:57.810> and<00:04:58.200> next

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
into Minecraft so do get those and next

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.650 
into Minecraft so do get those and next
video<00:04:58.800> we<00:04:59.160> will<00:04:59.370> go<00:04:59.430> into<00:04:59.580> this<00:05:00.090> little<00:05:00.540> guy

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 
to make it how to use it and one other

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.820 
to make it how to use it and one other
thing<00:05:06.600> is<00:05:06.900> compressor<00:05:07.520> excuse<00:05:08.520> me<00:05:09.830> macerator

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
thing is compressor excuse me macerator

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.380 
thing is compressor excuse me macerator
I<00:05:11.070> think<00:05:11.340> I<00:05:11.400> showed<00:05:11.640> you<00:05:11.820> that<00:05:11.940> right<00:05:12.150> yeah<00:05:12.360> I

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
I think I showed you that right yeah I

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:17.990 
I think I showed you that right yeah I
did<00:05:15.170> you<00:05:16.170> can<00:05:16.500> macerate<00:05:17.100> the<00:05:17.130> gravel<00:05:17.610> and<00:05:17.790> turn

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
did you can macerate the gravel and turn

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.090 
did you can macerate the gravel and turn
it<00:05:18.180> into<00:05:18.360> flint<00:05:19.050> and<00:05:19.290> I<00:05:19.410> mentioned<00:05:19.620> that<00:05:19.800> again

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
it into flint and I mentioned that again

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.050 
it into flint and I mentioned that again
because<00:05:20.400> i'm<00:05:20.490> gonna<00:05:20.610> be<00:05:20.670> using<00:05:20.700> a<00:05:20.910> lot<00:05:20.940> of

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
because i'm gonna be using a lot of

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:27.410 
because i'm gonna be using a lot of
flint<00:05:22.550> to<00:05:24.620> to<00:05:25.620> make<00:05:25.830> these<00:05:26.040> solar<00:05:26.580> panels<00:05:26.640> so
