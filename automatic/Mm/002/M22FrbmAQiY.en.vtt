exactly why these dinosaurs blow bubbles
the<00:01:34.240> simple<00:01:34.600> reason<00:01:34.780> is<00:01:35.110> plot<00:01:35.590> wouldn't<00:01:35.979> fit

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
the simple reason is plot wouldn't fit

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.830 
the simple reason is plot wouldn't fit
because<00:01:36.460> the<00:01:36.640> puzzle<00:01:36.940> gameplay<00:01:37.330> itself<00:01:37.630> is

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
because the puzzle gameplay itself is
