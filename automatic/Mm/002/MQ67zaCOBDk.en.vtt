lecithin is a soy-based product that's
actually<00:00:21.510> used<00:00:22.230> as<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.500> dietary<00:00:22.890> supplement

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.040 
actually used as a dietary supplement

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.400 
actually used as a dietary supplement
most<00:00:23.670> common<00:00:24.000> actually<00:00:24.180> use<00:00:24.480> soy<00:00:24.720> lecithin<00:00:24.930> to

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
most common actually use soy lecithin to

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.109 
most common actually use soy lecithin to
make<00:00:25.560> foams<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.279> make<00:00:26.430> airs<00:00:26.700> and

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
make foams and to make airs and

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.080 
make foams and to make airs and
basically<00:00:27.989> as<00:00:28.200> an<00:00:28.590> emulsifier<00:00:28.770> it<00:00:29.610> allows<00:00:29.849> me

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
basically as an emulsifier it allows me

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.540 
basically as an emulsifier it allows me
to<00:00:30.119> create<00:00:30.630> things<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.140> never<00:00:31.860> before<00:00:32.279> were

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
to create things that never before were

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.639 
to create things that never before were
actually<00:00:32.579> possible<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:34.050> what<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.230> like<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.500> do

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
actually possible so what I like to do

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.760 
actually possible so what I like to do
is<00:00:35.160> take<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.640> soy<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.329> actually<00:00:37.020> add<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.530> to

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
is take this soy and actually add it to

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.040 
is take this soy and actually add it to
I<00:00:38.160> know<00:00:38.550> any<00:00:38.820> sort<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.120> water-based<00:00:39.600> liquid

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
I know any sort of water-based liquid

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.020 
I know any sort of water-based liquid
and<00:00:40.290> then<00:00:40.470> just<00:00:40.680> watch<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.190> foam<00:00:41.399> grow<00:00:41.730> and

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
and then just watch the foam grow and

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.280 
and then just watch the foam grow and
I'm<00:00:42.360> going<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.570> show<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.750> how<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:42.960> do<00:00:43.140> that

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
this glass bowl that we have right now

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.640 
this glass bowl that we have right now
and<00:01:06.090> as<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.390> can<00:01:06.479> see<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:07.170> bubbles<00:01:07.530> are

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
and as you can see the bubbles are

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.590 
and as you can see the bubbles are
already<00:01:07.950> forming<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.579> that's<00:01:08.820> from<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
already forming and that's from the the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.210 
already forming and that's from the the
method<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:09.990> champagne<00:01:10.380> well<00:01:10.530> that's<00:01:11.040> the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
method the champagne well that's the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.710 
method the champagne well that's the
natural<00:01:11.400> carbonation<00:01:12.180> that's<00:01:12.360> already

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
natural carbonation that's already

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.749 
natural carbonation that's already
inside<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.530> there<00:01:13.649> and<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.280> problem<00:01:14.640> with

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
inside of there and the problem with

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:16.760 
inside of there and the problem with
that<00:01:14.789> because<00:01:15.329> as<00:01:15.539> you<00:01:15.630> can<00:01:15.749> see<00:01:15.810> they're<00:01:16.590> not

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
that because as you can see they're not

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.709 
that because as you can see they're not
really<00:01:17.039> sustaining<00:01:17.819> these<00:01:18.210> bubbles<00:01:18.630> are

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:18.719 
really sustaining these bubbles are

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:21.050 
really sustaining these bubbles are
deflating<00:01:19.289> very<00:01:19.590> very<00:01:19.859> quickly<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.670> we<00:01:20.850> want

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
deflating very very quickly and we want

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.789 
deflating very very quickly and we want
to<00:01:21.149> actually<00:01:21.420> figure<00:01:21.630> out<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> way<00:01:22.049> for<00:01:22.350> those

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
to actually figure out a way for those

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.450 
to actually figure out a way for those
for<00:01:23.310> those<00:01:23.399> bubbles<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.329> become<00:01:24.630> stable<00:01:24.990> and

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
for those bubbles to become stable and

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.160 
for those bubbles to become stable and
here's<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.639> other<00:01:26.670> problem<00:01:26.999> if<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.869> go<00:01:28.049> ahead

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
here's the other problem if I go ahead

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.440 
here's the other problem if I go ahead
and<00:01:28.289> try<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.619> aerate<00:01:28.859> this<00:01:29.249> now<00:01:29.520> it's<00:01:30.240> just

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
and try to aerate this now it's just

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.270 
and try to aerate this now it's just
going<00:01:30.569> to<00:01:30.659> deflate<00:01:31.109> the<00:01:31.259> bubbles<00:01:31.590> even<00:01:32.039> more

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
going to deflate the bubbles even more

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.730 
going to deflate the bubbles even more
so<00:01:32.819> we<00:01:32.909> want<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.179> add<00:01:33.359> more<00:01:33.869> bubbles<00:01:34.319> to<00:01:34.649> our

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
so we want to add more bubbles to our

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.679 
so we want to add more bubbles to our
bubbles<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.280> actually<00:01:35.789> get<00:01:36.060> them<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.240> become

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
bubbles and actually get them to become

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.840 
bubbles and actually get them to become
stable<00:01:37.079> see<00:01:37.649> that<00:01:37.799> just<00:01:37.950> evaporate<00:01:38.399> just<00:01:38.700> like

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
stable see that just evaporate just like

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.199 
stable see that just evaporate just like
that

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:39.209 
that

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:41.569 
that
so<00:01:39.479> let's<00:01:39.689> see<00:01:39.929> what<00:01:40.109> happens<00:01:40.499> we<00:01:41.100> add<00:01:41.280> a

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
so let's see what happens we add a

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.620 
so let's see what happens we add a
little<00:01:41.880> bit<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.060> our<00:01:42.240> friend<00:01:42.539> over<00:01:42.929> here<00:01:44.630> our

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
little bit of our friend over here our

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.639 
little bit of our friend over here our
soy<00:01:46.350> based<00:01:46.789> derivative<00:01:47.789> aka<00:01:48.479> lecithin

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
soy based derivative aka lecithin

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.169 
soy based derivative aka lecithin
so<00:01:49.979> I'm<00:01:50.039> just<00:01:50.130> gonna<00:01:50.219> go<00:01:50.369> ahead<00:01:50.429> and<00:01:50.639> close

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
so I'm just gonna go ahead and close

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:54.379 
so I'm just gonna go ahead and close
that<00:01:51.209> and<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.409> can<00:01:52.560> already<00:01:52.920> see<00:01:53.279> the<00:01:53.700> bubbles

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:54.389 
that and you can already see the bubbles
