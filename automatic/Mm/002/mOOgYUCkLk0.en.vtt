00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.309
 dynamo tv is presented by 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.309
 FeldschlÃ¶sschen 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:23.470
 I am looking forward to the point now 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.460
 No offense if I'm completely honest 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.869
 and I think I have to do that today 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.189
 Let's have the game if I am 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.169
 today given away in my eyes 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.820
 for me it is given away because we 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.080
 have played against a team the 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.730
 just shoot away the ball and 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.170
 hopes that something will happen and that 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.540
 Coach made us aware 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.239
 that we should use that, that they are deep 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.769
 stand and we play the ball 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.150
 and I believe that we 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:47.900
 that today simply did not do enough 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.570
 have and therefore I have you 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.589
 disappoint and again better a point 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.610
 like no but today I believe who a lot 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:58.729
 much more in it 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.530
 1 1 why are they discussing 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:03.339
 last quarter of an hour results again 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.119
 already mega pressure made but we know 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:06.799
 Nevertheless, of course it is so if he is then 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.420
 in the end such a thing that is fine 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.740
 Six men really believed in front then 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.510
 flew the balls only in there and 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.990
 that is then please that then a thing 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.060
 christen 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.159
 I believe that will be the point in the month 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.580
 for once on my page is more than 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.980
 earns these points 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.180
 I do not know what to think 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:27.140
 I am happy with this point but also 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.140
 not I am not 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.710
 I am not satisfied with ours 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.570
 power 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.740
 the 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.620
 not well done I do not know 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.140
 exactly why but know kind with me 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.630
 not so happy for the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.450
 we have community and team spirit 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:55.050
 really shown and that's a good one 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:58.410
 points but that was mean because we did that 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.280
 would have been very very difficult too 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.320
 the colleagues 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.910
 I think we were totally of that 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.860
 play of those infected somehow 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.480
 because really as a newcomer 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.830
 to have 

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:14.910
 what do you have now 17 points i believe 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.290
 good but that is not our game ours 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.180
 Game is not to be beat forward 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.560
 and to hope that what happens for that 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.900
 we have too many good footballers and that 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.400
 we did not get a seat today 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.600
 Of course, such a brutal one 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.110
 quality has in it waiting for you 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.330
 get 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.310
 the opponent in the over goes out as it 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.400
 really that unpredictable and it was 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.870
 real problem came after 2 19 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.040
 who were no longer in dresden 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.060
 a bit withdrawn, I think 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.790
 they wanted more over the counter 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.650
 So it was for us then 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.090
 somehow easier there a little bit after 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.590
 to come forward and us too 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.959
 finally managed how long balls you 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.550
 to fix in front where dresden then 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.690
 in the back also had this problem 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.120
 of course you also say the place was 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.520
 it was very common as a defender 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.520
 normal today are not that easy 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:04.130
 with record of articles 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:11.430
 He always believed he always did that 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.470
 so if the carriage let ten minutes 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.130
 I want to see a movie I 'm coming 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.170
 pure and I always do my expensive 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.220
 always believed that clear is such a type 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.220
 and thereby had 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.240
 very happy with the work of his 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.010
 teammates we worked well 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:38.450
 for in and at the end 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:39.829
 he is that but the team was yes 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.540
 that he always believed 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.019
 of course I have my super 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.519
 seen used in a header game 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.780
 the hand has my back course 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.540
 extended world class and he has to 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.129
 now clean it come a flank and 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.480
 I do not get to die, think 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:55.069
 I just extend it without that 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.579
 we actually stood there that was for 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.739
 not us anymore 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:01.129
 I was the only thing 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.269
 outside los benefits when I am the 17 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.739
 years who back here if I 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.730
 you would have sacrificed then the ball 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:09.530
 come 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:12.489
 So that we got a point 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.489
 and that's what counts 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:37.650
 the coach said that he has his 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:41.430
 cap and bring forward in the 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.940
 stay centered and very dangerous 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.970
 the gate with his 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.640
 complete strong and also with he is 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.820
 getting in motion is very good for us 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:54.460
 rather short as everyone is playing the same 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.950
 Come on, come on mum man in the maximum 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:00.900
 and you have to believe that just one 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.900
 Tor shoots and he has done well
