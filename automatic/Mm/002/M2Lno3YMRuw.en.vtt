 and now talks to Adriana Ferrareto who has international training in 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.540
 cut an area for human development today she speaks 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.600
 on the wheel of life covering all aspects of an individual both

 personal as much as in the professional life hit already having acted well 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.330
 If I understand and I was curious the other week that you were here to 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.950
 to know how it works the wheel of life if they extend it will stay 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.210
 complementary to illustrate 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.989
 because well being khora but we are dealing with people the issues 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.020
 behavior makes a lot of sense with ages from all spheres of the 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.780
 life 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.290
 but we contemplate spirituality aspects of health 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.250
 professional financial aspect to 0 because that is 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.830
 important because it is often said that from the door into the company 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.810
 are those of the professional but this is not just the fact the fact is that the same 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.289
 we have several pertinent situations that need to be worked out 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.379
 so if we want to have high performance 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.070
 if we really want 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.930
 eduardo sa our career our personal life we ​​need to take care of each one 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.770
 of these spheres we see is that the merit of the times matters they have here 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.860
 at the time of fun pertaining to our day-to-day but we do not stop 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.700
 to think of each one of them is good 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.190
 what point are they in this wheel of life how do you do this mapping 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.320
 is predicted to be scary to the person first because of the difficulty 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.820
 deal with all situations simultaneously that are many and serene 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.820
 without care 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.080
 the question is that he wonders what note you city 1 to 10 for each 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.420
 area served, but we only achieved one point per 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.770
 example of 3 to 4 in the area of ​​health for example is already a great evolution 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.780
 so the proposal is that in each of these situations it should promote improvements 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.530
 of life because it is because the graph that is made according to the situation in 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.930
 that the person is 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.250
 have to give support to the sustainability of the person can run her life and 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.350
 statist this perfectly the idea is precisely the smallest Chinese 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.370
 that push a large object 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.490
 it has been improving but the circumference facilitates the process 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.209
 now more than nine months and tips that difficulties wear but it is' adriana 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.329
