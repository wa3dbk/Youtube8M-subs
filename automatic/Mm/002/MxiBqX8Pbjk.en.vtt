00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:22.050
 I bought it is an advertisement that 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.529
 had she another kit of glasses then 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.680
 totaling four glasses is that the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.660
 glasses on the side I'll take 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:57.989
 first to them to show here 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:01:01.219
 You 're showing here I stayed. 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.219
 alone of 3d glasses 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:56.860
 is cutting the bible tv you here 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.759
 plus one more two 3d glasses these are the 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.759
 that accompanies the tv 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:20.340
 this is the stage where you fit 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:20.340
 on tv to be able to fix table base 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.670
 now here the guys one thing I heard 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:40.329
 comments on how forums are born is 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.970
 that its basis would not be of the 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:45.640
 It is not that good base 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.680
 actually the base material is not the 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.780
 It's also not a 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.630
 go for example will put too goes 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.640
 break but it was not until 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.709
 because my other tv I have one 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.390
 glass base then actually compared 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.420
 this one compared to what I have 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.579
 really not least for me not 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.510
 It will make a difference because I go 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:09.069
 learn on the wall then but also not 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.680
 It's something that will put the tv going. 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:16.170
 munch will have to break it here 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.170
 plastic is not the best 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:47.130
 The good thing is that he comes here and there if the 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:04:03.580
 manual remote control knew of strength 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:26.370
 with two daughters and Chinese, very crap 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:26.370
 even and now want to see a little heavy 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:57.880
 now another comment also that what 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.820
 I saw the galley 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.790
 another comment that I saw that 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:06.250
 that the frame of the TV that this 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:09.190
 very poor press finishing 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.360
 with comments 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.540
 I disagree 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:16.120
 even I found that the good material does not have 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:20.020
 nothing much and I found it very good 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:24.550
 really very good here the back 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:27.400
 the tv as all plasma tv is metal 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:30.070
 I'm not sure what to say 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.320
 metal because that is to help dissipate 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.660
 the entire stage heat in the back of the 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:44.250
 vehicle is to increase 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:49.919
 now we do have entries Here 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:57.810
 2h averages one usb 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:06:09.150
 here the antenna cable entries 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:16.270
 composite video optical audio output and 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:21.460
 to the power very well the loudspeaker but the 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:24.370
 tv itself is very very pretty even 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.180
 I do not have to be married here. 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.509
 frame 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:31.770
 mind is very well done I do not know if 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:31.770
 can observe well 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:56.330
 so folks this is excuse me part 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.849
 video was not of the best quality 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.559
 if I did not work a little to do the 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:02.929
 What am I doing here because this 

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:05.059
 There is little girl material on the internet. 

00:07:02.929 --> 00:07:07.249
 then it's just a way for those who want 

00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:09.439
 buy something to see 

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:11.869
 Before you buy, see what TV is like. 

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:12.800
 that sometimes in the photo of the site can not 

00:07:11.869 --> 00:07:17.479
 to see 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:20.869
 So I did more than the sun and for power. 

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:24.559
 see one thing is not the best a boxing 

00:07:20.869 --> 00:07:27.379
 sneakers that's it recommends buying me 

00:07:24.559 --> 00:07:30.889
 I did not call yet but there are people in the 

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:37.339
 My family that has this line 

00:07:30.889 --> 00:07:40.399
 what of tv to ef 4 951 inches and the image 

00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:42.709
 sensational give much better than the tvs of 

00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:45.110
 led tv led does not buy the image of the 

00:07:42.709 --> 00:07:47.959
 if it does not compare with led is fine 

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:52.669
 superior to the image of the plaza beauty of it 

00:07:47.959 --> 00:07:54.949
 Any questions, just put it there. 

00:07:52.669 --> 00:07:59.169
 asking and looking at possible 

00:07:54.949 --> 00:07:59.169
 answering a beauty hugs
