00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.980 
personally have an issue with Heights so
I<00:01:32.490> wasn't<00:01:32.820> sure<00:01:33.000> how<00:01:33.090> Ricky<00:01:33.540> would<00:01:33.660> handle

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
this and also the fact that I was a

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.940 
this and also the fact that I was a
little<00:01:36.420> nervous<00:01:36.570> probably<00:01:37.290> transferred<00:01:37.800> down

little nervous probably transferred down

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.410

the<00:01:38.130> leash<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.550> her<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.000> she<00:01:39.090> might<00:01:39.360> have

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
the leash to her so she might have

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.300 
the leash to her so she might have
picked<00:01:39.540> up<00:01:39.690> on<00:01:39.840> my<00:01:39.900> nerves<00:01:40.230> a<00:01:40.380> little<00:01:40.560> bit<00:01:40.800> so<00:01:41.070> I

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310
