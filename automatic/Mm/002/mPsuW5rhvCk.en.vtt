the whole nine yards so one of the
things<00:00:33.519> I<00:00:33.699> really<00:00:33.730> enjoyed<00:00:34.149> about<00:00:34.180> this

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
things I really enjoyed about this

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.900 
things I really enjoyed about this
course<00:00:34.750> was<00:00:35.019> that<00:00:35.340> everything<00:00:36.340> was<00:00:36.550> hands-on

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
course was that everything was hands-on

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.209 
course was that everything was hands-on
you<00:00:37.239> know<00:00:37.359> you<00:00:37.420> learned<00:00:37.989> the<00:00:38.109> theory<00:00:38.469> you<00:00:39.100> know

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:39.219 
you know you learned the theory you know

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:41.819 
you know you learned the theory you know
literally<00:00:39.550> on<00:00:39.789> Tuesday<00:00:40.239> and<00:00:40.480> by<00:00:40.989> Thursday<00:00:41.469> you

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
literally on Tuesday and by Thursday you

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.130 
literally on Tuesday and by Thursday you
had<00:00:41.980> fully<00:00:42.489> implemented<00:00:43.030> a<00:00:43.090> system<00:00:43.239> utilizing

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
had fully implemented a system utilizing

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.479 
had fully implemented a system utilizing
that<00:00:44.230> theory<00:00:44.559> and<00:00:44.590> putting<00:00:45.070> it<00:00:45.190> into<00:00:45.309> practice

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
that theory and putting it into practice

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.689 
that theory and putting it into practice
I'm<00:00:46.239> the<00:00:46.480> kind<00:00:46.690> of<00:00:46.719> guy<00:00:46.870> who<00:00:46.899> learns<00:00:47.890> by<00:00:48.190> doing

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
I'm the kind of guy who learns by doing

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.259 
I'm the kind of guy who learns by doing
not<00:00:49.149> by<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:50.559> know<00:00:50.679> studying<00:00:51.429> formulas<00:00:52.030> and

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269 
not by you know studying formulas and

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:54.810 
not by you know studying formulas and
seeing<00:00:52.719> what<00:00:53.140> math<00:00:53.410> comes<00:00:53.769> out<00:00:53.920> of<00:00:54.070> it<00:00:54.190> in<00:00:54.670> the

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
seeing what math comes out of it in the

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.400 
seeing what math comes out of it in the
end<00:00:54.969> it<00:00:55.120> seemed<00:00:55.539> to<00:00:55.600> all<00:00:55.629> build<00:00:55.960> on<00:00:56.079> each<00:00:56.109> other

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
end it seemed to all build on each other

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.959 
end it seemed to all build on each other
and<00:00:56.499> you<00:00:56.679> could<00:00:56.829> use<00:00:57.010> each<00:00:57.640> piece

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
and you could use each piece

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.299 
and you could use each piece
individually<00:00:58.210> put<00:00:59.170> them<00:00:59.260> together<00:00:59.379> to<00:00:59.649> make

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
individually put them together to make

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.899 
individually put them together to make
something<00:01:00.489> happen<00:01:01.030> and<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.890> sumo<00:01:03.219> is<00:01:03.489> is

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909 
something happen and the sumo is is

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:06.150 
something happen and the sumo is is
definitely<00:01:04.660> one<00:01:04.840> example<00:01:05.110> of<00:01:05.290> that<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:06.010> mini

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
definitely one example of that the mini

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.550 
definitely one example of that the mini
sumo<00:01:06.460> robot<00:01:07.210> that<00:01:07.630> tournament<00:01:07.990> is<00:01:08.230> nothing

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
sumo robot that tournament is nothing

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.080 
sumo robot that tournament is nothing
more<00:01:08.680> than<00:01:08.740> a<00:01:08.860> essentially<00:01:09.760> a<00:01:09.790> robotic

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
more than a essentially a robotic

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.240 
more than a essentially a robotic
version<00:01:10.420> of<00:01:10.540> a<00:01:10.600> similar<00:01:10.900> tournament<00:01:11.320> it<00:01:11.890> is<00:01:12.070> to

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
version of a similar tournament it is to

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.470 
version of a similar tournament it is to
push<00:01:12.400> your<00:01:12.490> opponent<00:01:12.610> outside<00:01:13.120> of<00:01:13.240> the<00:01:13.300> ring

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.480 
push your opponent outside of the ring

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:23.720 
push your opponent outside of the ring
before<00:01:13.810> they<00:01:14.080> push<00:01:14.260> you<00:01:14.410> outside<00:01:14.590> of<00:01:14.770> the<00:01:14.860> ring

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.970 

our<00:01:24.420> strategy<00:01:24.630> was<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.050> try<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.380> avoid<00:01:25.710> being

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:25.980 
our strategy was to try and avoid being

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.410 
our strategy was to try and avoid being
vulnerable<00:01:26.280> as<00:01:26.580> much<00:01:26.730> as<00:01:26.880> possible<00:01:27.030> so

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
vulnerable as much as possible so

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.540 
vulnerable as much as possible so
anytime<00:01:27.750> we<00:01:27.780> had<00:01:28.020> our<00:01:28.140> back<00:01:28.320> or<00:01:28.560> our<00:01:28.650> side<00:01:28.890> to

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
anytime we had our back or our side to

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.280 
anytime we had our back or our side to
our<00:01:29.670> opponent<00:01:30.150> we<00:01:30.630> knew<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:30.780> was<00:01:31.080> pretty

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
our opponent we knew that was pretty

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.840 
our opponent we knew that was pretty
easy<00:01:31.380> for<00:01:31.860> us<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.070> get<00:01:32.190> pushed<00:01:32.370> off<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:32.730> we

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
easy for us to get pushed off so we

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.240 
easy for us to get pushed off so we
tried<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.320> steer<00:01:34.320> away<00:01:34.440> from<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.800> as<00:01:34.950> much<00:01:35.100> as

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
tried to steer away from that as much as

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.370 
tried to steer away from that as much as
possible<00:01:35.510> for<00:01:36.510> our<00:01:36.660> sumo<00:01:36.840> project<00:01:37.290> we

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
possible for our sumo project we

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.130 
possible for our sumo project we
basically<00:01:37.970> had<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.120> in<00:01:39.300> this<00:01:39.450> main<00:01:39.660> function

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
basically had this in this main function

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.900 
basically had this in this main function
and<00:01:40.260> it<00:01:40.350> called<00:01:40.590> out<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:41.010> couple<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.670> the

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
and it called out a couple of the

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.580 
and it called out a couple of the
functions<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.540> we<00:01:42.720> we<00:01:42.990> went<00:01:43.170> into<00:01:43.320> each

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
functions and we we went into each

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.010 
functions and we we went into each
function<00:01:44.040> test<00:01:44.700> by<00:01:44.880> test<00:01:44.910> and<00:01:45.450> made<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.750> and

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
function test by test and made it and

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.230 
function test by test and made it and
actually<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:47.310> know<00:01:47.430> designed<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.180> then

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
actually you know designed it and then

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.010 
actually you know designed it and then
tested<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:50.030> in<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.150> real<00:01:51.330> world<00:01:51.570> as<00:01:51.810> well<00:01:51.960> as

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
tested it in the real world as well as

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.320 
tested it in the real world as well as
what<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.620> code<00:01:52.800> is<00:01:52.830> doing<00:01:53.280> deal<00:01:53.700> broke<00:01:53.940> all

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
what the code is doing deal broke all

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.080 
what the code is doing deal broke all
the<00:01:54.510> classes<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.080> give<00:01:55.500> these<00:01:56.460> students<00:01:56.880> some
