00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.220
 it has to be the part of the shit of 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.230
 the animals of the cows goats and they 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.070
 has charge times also from the 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.170
 horse here four animals are handled 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.580
 two adult animals and 2 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.700
 in calves 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.490
 and this is the harvest of this material 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.439
 it's only the harvest of the night then 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.160
 they remain locked in the night 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:33.190
 he says clean it and in the day I can 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.440
 pass in the paddock 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.809
 So here what we have is the 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.710
 cancer worms 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.710
 then why 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.200
 and we have lots of earthworms 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.780
 she works us in all that material 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:54.320
 plant that we put it the work 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:58.780
 they are 24-hour workers 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.780
 it becomes the fertilizer 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:06.340
 according to studies is the payment of 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.430
 produced by earthworms is very rich 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.420
 is the best one of the best for the 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.420
 amount of microbiology 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.880
 well rich microbiologically then 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.610
 a good fertilizer 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.280
 and that we study and we give a good 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.829
 handling let's say what here has here is 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.130
 the roof so that he will not fall 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.130
 Water 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:40.380
 protect little of the sun from earthworms 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.380
 it does not affect that they throw him 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.960
 there 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.299
 not because they sevilla are moving 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.640
 for example here that is a material here 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.010
 situated 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.210
 here is flame come here I am 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.280
 are coming to this material 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.640
 and there are a number of more are more 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.640
 calls 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.320
 composed and are moving towards the 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:08.010
 material to fresh material 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.010
 and look what is already in harvest 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:16.580
 look, it's already 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.250
 in the harvest like this with everything and earthworms and 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.920
 it applies it always leaves a part where 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.290
 is it so 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.230
 leave the seeds and all these trees 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.599
 from here he handles them with compost 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.500
 vermicompost all these days can 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.110
 watch 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.020
 and as he is doing so more 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.470
 drive with him with man and with post and 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.840
 also the vegetables use a lot 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:43.030
 then let's say the idea of ​​the tours is 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.220
 that we see all the resource that we have 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.080
 within the farm that many 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.030
 solutions we have them within the 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.220
 farm let's say the solution to our 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.440
 problems we do not have to look for 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.090
 outside or does not have to come to someone 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.720
 sell us the product but we 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.510
 we can make it at low cost 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.550
 let's say on our farm here we produce 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.340
 milk then cheese is already produced 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.160
 the butter curd that takes advantage of 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:13.180
 animal shit that is used to 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:18.329
 fertilizers to fertilize the farm 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.329
 take it to the avocados to the vegetable 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.190
 besides that it already harvests more then 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.490
 we are creating all the interrelation is 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.030
 that all the product that comes out of a 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:33.560
 component is used in another 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.560
 not here 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.680
 the idea is that they take advantage of the 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.340
 amount of resources equal and inclusive 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.590
 a diet is that feeding 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.210
 of the animal does not depend exclusively on 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.560
 concentrated and you are 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.700
 ordering then in age the 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.130
 carceleta 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.280
 chopped orchard 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.530
 a concentrate is made that we 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.360
 we must graze treated also then 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.420
 to increase it 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.820
 production in the cow an aspect 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:12.460
 important is that we do not need so many 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:14.310
 resources look how the island has 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:18.340
 in the warehouse where he is storing 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:23.310
 truth is easy to do is cheap and 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.310
 we are therefore producing a good fertilizer
