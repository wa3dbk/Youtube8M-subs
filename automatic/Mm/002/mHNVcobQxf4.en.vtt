00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.430
 hello am michael núñez coach 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.930
 club handbol sant quirze in barcelona and 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.280
 coordinator of the base chairs 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.130
 now in this chapter we are going to talk to you 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.619
 of the goalkeeper and his technique the goalkeeper is 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.720
 the only one of the field player capable of 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.040
 play the one that is allowed to touch the 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.320
 Ball with any part of your body 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.420
 it is a very important element in defense 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.369
 and the first initiator of the counterattack 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.980
 in the attack phase of the equipment put 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.000
 that a positive action of yours can 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.150
 promote good action 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.290
 counterattack shows the goalie has 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.050
 a basic defensive position 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.270
 slightly flexed the legs and 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.680
 arms in stop position always 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.510
 have to move according to the 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.399
 displacement of the ball is worth 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.170
 small jumps or movements of 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.149
 tiptoes with feet to be active 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.170
 in case I make you stop 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.730
 of quick reaction is worth the stops as 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.739
 we have said before you can do with 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.390
 any part of the body either from 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.090
 head to the feet as with the 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.829
 back the different types of stop 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.050
 depending on the launching up 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.390
 OK with impulse can be with two hands 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.510
 or it can be a 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.130
 he's always controlling 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.750
 throwing the ball out can not 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.670
 try for the ball forward 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.930
 to avoid rebounds towards the attack 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.720
 always have to try to control the 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.430
 ball to go as close as you can 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.619
 to be able to control it or always 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.509
 by the bottom line stops at half 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.070
 height always lowering the arm and 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.750
 raising the leg to attack the ball 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.540
 we can do it like the goalkeepers of 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.920
 football that are always looking for 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.509
 stretched to get the ball but 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.190
 in handball always pushes towards 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.500
 forward, covering the diagonal of the ball 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.600
 to attack the position of the ball to 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.119
 try to make the attacker have less 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.680
 vision of the goal stops at half 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.680
 height the leg is raised and the 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.230
 arm for 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.070
 and put the body and arm and leg 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.930
 in the plane where it is to where 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.640
 direct the ball if it were a stop 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.290
 down can be done with foot and hand or 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.300
 you can fall directly the goalkeeper 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.400
 covering with the whole body if it is standing 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.900
 and hand is a very fast stop and has 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.880
 that crouch the whole body and that the hand 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.560
 is for the ball to escape 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.270
 behind the leg one stop below 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.580
 always has to be accompanied by the 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.320
 foot and hand if the goalie is very 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.420
 fast and is worked can always 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.070
 come with my whole body down always 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.770
 stretching the leg and dropping his 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.709
 weight on itself to be able to fall 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.690
 down and accompany with the whole body with 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.600
 this type of stop we get to cover 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.490
 much more space 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.510
 the most experienced goalies on 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.370
 all in senior and youth category 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.620
 they also work with deception or 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.850
 offers to pitchers when 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.030
 we know that a pitcher has a lot 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.610
 ability we can work instead of 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.400
 wait to see in the armed position 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.440
 and where can they place the ball we can 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.050
 make you try to cheat and try 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.820
 let the doorman be the one to say where 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.440
 He wants me to shoot a goalkeeper who is 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.820
 offering for example now this 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.340
 goalkeeper is telling us that what 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.450
 he wants us to throw him up because 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.190
 has all the top part 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.360
 discovered of the goal and what is going to 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.320
 look for the attacker surely be 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.110
 up at the moment there is a 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.090
 launch the goalkeeper will quickly go to 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.190
 cover the area that has left discovered 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.560
 if we work with another type of 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.690
 this offer for example what 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.950
 is looking for is that we look for the action 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.930
 of throwing to the leg because 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.610
 has raised we will always look for a 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.560
 throwing action off the leg 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.320
 that you have prepared to stop in this 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.660
 case the goalie would try to make a 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.970
 change of leg to look for throwing to 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.440
 opposite side is another stop method 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.840
 a little more advanced but that many 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.270
 goal is being introduced and 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.070
 working so that they are to be 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.990
 they who take the initiative is what 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.450
 called stop in advance or 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.560
 for against stop by reaction 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.690
 which is what we have explained 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.880
 previously the goalkeeper follows the ball 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.530
 according to the stimulus that has and will stop 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.510
 the ball if the goalie is not worked 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.910
 an offer always the attacker 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.890
 has fewer options to launch 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.190
 goalkeeper because the goalkeeper is not for the 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:58.450
 side that is offering 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:00.550
 So far this little class of 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.230
 handball that is my sport I hope that 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.880
 I liked you and I encourage you all to 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.660
 participate because it's a fun sport 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:10.320
 fun fast and very participatory as well 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.320
 What is your bus waiting for you?
