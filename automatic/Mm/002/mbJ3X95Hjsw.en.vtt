00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.680
 1 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:17.770
 leave you with a passion is the 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.210
 mine is sewing I put some 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.520
 time to understand that I could 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.920
 to make for others I first 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:28.900
 made for my family 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:32.650
 noah and then it came all 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.970
 just one day you say is well 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.730
 what am I going to do with my life 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.050
 this is finally the contest of 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.210
 circumstances have made that I 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.700
 met people who have me a lot 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.120
 helped and who made me 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.300
 trust 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.660
 and then the adventure lasts for 19 years 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.660
 now 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.649
 the cuts are always a little near 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.350
 such rob lowe introduced a long dress 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.239
 with a cleavage with the work on the 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.180
 matter and I think it's really 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.239
 the safe sale of being able to create for 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.950
 someone the challenge every time 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.140
 it's always a challenge even if we 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.300
 think it's still the same dress the 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.770
 same cut so it's always going beyond 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.190
 its limits and that's what I like 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.190
 final 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:24.910
 every time I work I 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.450
 escapes me the concentration is such that 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.310
 I work 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.700
 you might think I'm here in 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.860
 pulling the dart here cut 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.710
 the fabric but ultimately my imagination 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.540
 went beyond that stage when I cut I 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.310
 am thinking about assembling 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.980
 when I am assembling I am in the process of 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.060
 think about the fitting and how the 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.220
 matter will react 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:51.140
 so finally game it's a way of 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:53.350
 to escape I'm traveling I was 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.290
 really an adventure to be able to create 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.570
 already offered to the client who has more 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.550
 or less an idea of ​​her dress 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.460
 and then as you go along 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.060
 well there is really a relationship of 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.600
 trust 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:12.070
 who will be established 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.810
 even if the marriage is over 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.820
 she is still very far dress since 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.450
 it is stored in a closet and there is 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.890
 all this story that is that will remain 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.200
 present finally in the hearts of 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.660
 people today I realize 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.350
 many young people who they want 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.120
 that they want to become a stylist 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.950
 because just creating 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.610
 princess dresses it's true that it has 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.900
 always been a myth of power 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.720
 realize and I can say that today 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:46.420
 I'm very lucky to be able to live 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.420
 and be able to work from my passion
