00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
doesn't that is also minus a gazillion

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.449 
doesn't that is also minus a gazillion
bazillion<00:03:48.989> all-in-ones<00:03:49.989> yeah<00:03:50.680> more<00:03:51.099> so<00:03:51.430> than

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
bazillion all-in-ones yeah more so than

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.070 
bazillion all-in-ones yeah more so than
anything<00:03:51.760> else<00:03:52.000> I<00:03:52.150> see<00:03:52.300> that<00:03:52.510> is<00:03:52.660> probably<00:03:52.989> the

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
anything else I see that is probably the

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.750 
anything else I see that is probably the
closest<00:03:53.500> thing<00:03:53.620> I've<00:03:53.769> ever<00:03:53.800> seen<00:03:54.130> two<00:03:54.250> minus<00:03:54.640> a

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
closest thing I've ever seen two minus a

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.220 
closest thing I've ever seen two minus a

so with that overhead low the end hunger

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.860 
so with that overhead low the end hunger
head<00:04:21.220> low<00:04:21.400> right<00:04:21.579> there<00:04:21.729> what<00:04:21.880> he<00:04:22.450> can<00:04:22.630> use<00:04:22.750> the

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
head low right there what he can use the

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
to make a hard to block mixing situation

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.950 
to make a hard to block mixing situation
we<00:04:27.070> can<00:04:27.100> use<00:04:27.430> the<00:04:27.550> bad<00:04:27.700> to<00:04:27.910> do<00:04:28.150> is<00:04:28.270> 50<00:04:28.419> 50<00:04:28.780> and

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
we can use the bad to do is 50 50 and

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.659 
we can use the bad to do is 50 50 and
then<00:04:29.020> make<00:04:29.229> it<00:04:29.350> safe<00:04:29.560> that's<00:04:30.010> it<00:04:30.220> that's<00:04:30.490> it

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
then make it safe that's it that's it
