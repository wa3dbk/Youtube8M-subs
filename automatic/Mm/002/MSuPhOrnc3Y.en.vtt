figure<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.250> I<00:00:35.250> plucked<00:00:35.700> his<00:00:35.850> head<00:00:36.030> off<00:00:36.210> and

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
figure and I plucked his head off and

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.740 
figure and I plucked his head off and
repainted<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.170> it's<00:00:37.860> purple<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.460> white<00:00:38.750> the

double<00:00:40.050> race<00:00:40.230> stripe<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.739> actually<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.219> bit<00:00:41.370> of

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
double race stripe is actually a bit of

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.160 
double race stripe is actually a bit of
a<00:00:41.520> challenge<00:00:41.790> because<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.390> need<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> really

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
a challenge because you need a really

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.080 
a challenge because you need a really
steady<00:00:43.500> hand<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.219> order<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.789> make<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.059> look

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
steady hand in order to make it look

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.200 
steady hand in order to make it look
straight<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.809> even<00:00:46.789> because<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.820> goes<00:00:48.180> from

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
straight and even because it goes from

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.319 
straight and even because it goes from
the<00:00:49.020> brow<00:00:49.500> line<00:00:49.530> all<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.579> way<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.969> back<00:00:51.149> of

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
the brow line all the way to the back of

the brow line all the way to the back of
his<00:00:51.449> spines<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.340> that<00:00:53.340> can<00:00:53.520> be<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> deceptively

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
his spines and that can be a deceptively

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.520 
his spines and that can be a deceptively
hard<00:00:54.629> line<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.170> keep<00:00:55.320> straight<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:57.199> always<00:00:58.199> joke

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
hard line to keep straight I always joke

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.619 
hard line to keep straight I always joke
that<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:59.100> version<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.579> Sonic<00:01:00.000> looks<00:01:00.449> like<00:01:00.600> a

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
that this version of Sonic looks like a

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.200 
that this version of Sonic looks like a
Power<00:01:00.930> Ranger<00:01:01.609> because<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.699> looks<00:01:02.879> like<00:01:02.940> he's

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
Power Ranger because it looks like he's

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.590 
Power Ranger because it looks like he's
wearing<00:01:03.390> purple<00:01:03.809> spandex<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.880> the<00:01:05.880> fact<00:01:06.510> that

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
wearing purple spandex and the fact that

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.020 
wearing purple spandex and the fact that
his<00:01:06.810> head<00:01:07.080> has<00:01:07.380> no<00:01:07.770> visible<00:01:08.010> pupils<00:01:08.700> or<00:01:08.880> mouths

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
his head has no visible pupils or mouths

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.990 
his head has no visible pupils or mouths
makes<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.510> look<00:01:09.630> like<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.810> helmet<00:01:10.369> but<00:01:11.369> it's

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
makes it look like a helmet but it's

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.210 
makes it look like a helmet but it's
pretty<00:01:12.299> much<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.570> repaint<00:01:13.170> except<00:01:13.770> for<00:01:13.979> right

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
pretty much a repaint except for right

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.719 
pretty much a repaint except for right
here

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
here

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.170 
here
the<00:01:15.390> only<00:01:15.600> clay<00:01:16.080> fabrication<00:01:16.890> was<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.759> rings

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
the only clay fabrication was the rings

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.550 
the only clay fabrication was the rings
around<00:01:18.570> his<00:01:19.259> ankles<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.159> his<00:01:20.640> wrists<00:01:21.560> which

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
around his ankles and his wrists which

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.050 
around his ankles and his wrists which
meant<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.250> actually<00:01:23.520> didn't<00:01:23.850> have<00:01:23.970> to

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
meant that I actually didn't have to

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.580 
meant that I actually didn't have to
dismantle<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.570> body<00:01:24.780> except<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.200> pluck<00:01:25.380> the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
dismantle the body except to pluck the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.370 
dismantle the body except to pluck the
feet<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.920> hands<00:01:26.189> off<00:01:26.630> and<00:01:27.630> again<00:01:28.020> that's<00:01:28.290> a

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
feet and hands off and again that's a

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.469 
feet and hands off and again that's a
simple<00:01:28.650> repaint<00:01:29.040> job<00:01:29.280> purple<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.000> gold<00:01:30.150> and

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
simple repaint job purple and gold and

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.929 
simple repaint job purple and gold and
then<00:01:31.170> we<00:01:31.290> see<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.530> completed<00:01:32.100> dark<00:01:32.640> spines

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939
