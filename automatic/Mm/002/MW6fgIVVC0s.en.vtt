00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.700
 el salvador dali I'm here with a 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.740
 ms gt 70 notebook is one of the 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.380
 gay notebooks but who needs flipping 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.080
 in the country this week and the moment 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.239
 received for analysis is the topic that 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.460
 will be here in the country and the 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:33.120
 of quite impressive remission is the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.950
 his graphic chip is a gt x 180 m from the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.790
 nvidia the best graphics when 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.950
 practiced suicide 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.050
 but today I know pressing 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.719
 enough and garbage storage is made 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.420
 in 2007 13 that the staff usually 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.980
 call super naid then on 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.079
 file transference 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.239
 to open the system these activities that 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.250
 They want to pay on this treadmill. 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.140
 he has the answers that are faster than 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.239
 We already tested here completely. 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.789
 16 gb of ram and one 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.530
 intel core i7 generation and 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.470
 vibrant third generation of our 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.260
 benchmark testing also expects the 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.500
 his powerful hardware brought us several 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.440
 new apps or anyone in the company 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.740
 rendering of videos and programs 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.430
 he hit all the models tested until 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.530
 today 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.049
 the design must be made the finish of 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.780
 the filmmaker brushes in black and has a 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.719
 relatively discreet design it is not 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.549
 so heavy it weighs almost four kilos and 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:31.770
 Of course I'm considering a notebook, right? 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.860
 not usually too light even more 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.079
 a 17-inch game that draws a lot 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.750
 attention in design is a keyboard type is 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.850
 illuminated that it is the uncle bells that 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.820
 enough color you can set the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.329
 colors of the back light by the character is 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.210
 a very complex personalization that in it 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.450
 connections it has on the right side 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.750
 two usb 2.0 connections drive input 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:01.380
 optic on the left side three factions 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.390
 USB 3.0 Card Slot and Four 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.130
 microphone inputs with 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.369
 a hunger and two others 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.709
 but there and lay out nÃ©mesis entrance and 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.830
 exit and on the back some more 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:17.760
 conditions like the hdmi connection and more knows 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.739
 gi the connection is the energy ticket 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.330
 his performance with games accompanying 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.730
 several of its partners from March one 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:28.340
 of the best teams to 15 squares and 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.340
 equal results 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.160
 to 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.700
 the case 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.530
 the rainy 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.110
 the only thing that bothers you is 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.190
 that when he works here in 100% of 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:53.290
 load of 40 years heavier to eyepiece 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.700
 his speech is quite loud 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.010
 so if you do not want to play with 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.110
 phone can annoy you a lot 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.890
 The big problem with this model is its 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.560
 price 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.350
 it will be marketed for 11 thousand reais 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.480
 as suggested price and is a value that 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.620
 It can scare you a lot and 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.790
 consumers 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.010
 for those who are thinking of a notebook 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.930
 to play have cheaper options 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.299
 including that of Messi herself 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.790
 for example their entry model 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.780
 today in 70 that will stay in the house of 56 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.600
 one thousand reais 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.280
 the hardware with lighter hardware it 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.960
 already has sufficient potential to run 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.800
 and you are thinking of playing a 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.990
 notebook 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.580
 this option which is justified only 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.919
 those who really want it to be 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.090
 best in notebook hardware and not 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.160
 do not bother being a bit clumsy 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.290
 this very high value 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.600
 this was the video analysis simply 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.460
 more complete details of the 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.330
 notebook you can check the analysis
