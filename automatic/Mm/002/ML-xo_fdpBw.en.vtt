requirements

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.980 

hi<00:01:54.160> Nikki<00:01:54.850> just<00:01:55.090> give<00:01:55.240> me<00:01:55.270> a<00:01:55.390> bit<00:01:55.510> of<00:01:55.540> a<00:01:55.660> look<00:01:55.840> at

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
hi Nikki just give me a bit of a look at

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.690 
hi Nikki just give me a bit of a look at
a<00:01:56.020> delicious<00:01:56.500> stream<00:01:56.740> we've<00:01:56.920> created<00:01:57.130> where's

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
a delicious stream we've created where's

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.310 
a delicious stream we've created where's
Jessie<00:01:57.940> efficiency<00:01:58.600> is<00:01:58.660> an<00:01:58.750> output<00:01:59.050> over

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
Jessie efficiency is an output over

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:14.170 
Jessie efficiency is an output over
Hyderabad<00:01:59.560> yeah

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.050 

so<00:02:14.810> let's<00:02:14.959> see<00:02:15.079> a<00:02:15.110> halogen<00:02:15.319> one<00:02:15.530> unit<00:02:16.060> from

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
so let's see a halogen one unit from

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.360 
so let's see a halogen one unit from
zero<00:02:17.420> to<00:02:17.510> 100<00:02:17.629> meters<00:02:18.019> of<00:02:18.079> heat<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:18.799> it'll<00:02:19.250> do

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
zero to 100 meters of heat and it'll do

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.880 
zero to 100 meters of heat and it'll do
anywhere<00:02:19.790> from<00:02:19.849> 200<00:02:20.780> liters<00:02:21.019> prayer<00:02:21.260> after<00:02:21.500> 50

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
anywhere from 200 liters prayer after 50

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:22.929 
anywhere from 200 liters prayer after 50
meters

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:22.939 
meters

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.059 
meters
one<00:02:23.540> advantage<00:02:23.870> of<00:02:24.110> this<00:02:24.230> unit<00:02:24.620> is<00:02:24.769> that<00:02:24.860> it

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
one advantage of this unit is that it

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.830 
one advantage of this unit is that it
will<00:02:25.220> work<00:02:25.310> from<00:02:25.459> falls<00:02:25.760> through<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.540> Hydra

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
will work from falls through the Hydra

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.589 
will work from falls through the Hydra
violet<00:02:27.170> as<00:02:27.230> low<00:02:27.349> as<00:02:27.409> 250<00:02:27.920> mil<00:02:28.280> with<00:02:29.090> Flyers<00:02:29.329> of
