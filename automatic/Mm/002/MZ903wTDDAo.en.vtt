00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:16.440
 it was very very shocking today we are in 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.130
 a staircase of 100 containers each 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.439
 who 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.670
 obviously I do not know if they are 100 with having 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.410
 exactly we are not going to put here to 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.779
 tell you know but the fact is that in 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.430
 the career title says that they are 100 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.230
 contains so I do not know at least there will be 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.529
 to trust the equator of the race 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.090
 go guys we go first and it's worth 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.910
 moment it seems that they are not with sea â€‹â€‹and 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.469
 half crazy to the first one okay let's go 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.379
 little by little it seems that we have it 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:47.390
 I look to see that is to fall to fall 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.390
 when he passes it for god 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.420
 abajito nine podios men much more 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.379
 easy with cars uncles is to agree the 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.940
 video that I will be a point of 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.280
 time has with car had more lad 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.520
 what it cost to pass me that race is worth 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.080
 Little did not die a Madryn kid and issue 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.400
 and damage is cut please guys luck 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.750
 that it takes me all week 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.420
 training my genres 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.520
 to be able to stand that jump kid 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.530
 thanks to the great feeling that 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.860
 could bear that piece of impact 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.830
 when I'm active here we have the goal to you 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:32.939
 It is very easy or they are difficult but very 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:35.909
 good because the truth is that I was a 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:41.030
 Boy, what better than finishing a 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:43.440
 career is saying a lot of good 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:50.000
 when there are many people the same is because 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:53.970
 is that I find out about that 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.200
 it's a 35.4 are almost four kilometers and 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.020
 a video career guys the truth 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.020
 few times racing game 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.679
 nothing is happening let's go recovering 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:14.220
 we recover is more as well as third 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:17.670
 we have obviously if you are listening 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.010
 but I hear the typical one of having 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.900
 interpreted a bit more but I already 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.090
 you understand the typical sound that 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.340
 listen is god is worth you mind mountain you 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.890
 We put cane we put cane or game 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.560
 here you have to paste a piece of voucher of 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:36.870
 curve we follow butt 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.870
 we look here we left but not 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:46.440
 a lot of guys well fine well fine 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.210
 17.35 we go first 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.120
 we have them very close that a visit 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.230
 some you can draw many distances 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.200
 come on let's try to catch the curves 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.200
 as closed as possible that is we continue 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.040
 power 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.660
 eye this curve closed and leaf this curve 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.730
 closed here 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:10.500
 around here and it's fine I like it I like it 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.970
 for the first time I do not see any 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.320
 kind of danger the work is quite 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.420
 far from what it takes to be a 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.010
 load of bikes because yes that is far 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.240
 now let's go let's not stop pressing 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.410
 he gathers none of the moments I'm going 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.410
 almost like the lad stick 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.440
 neither why nor when, but it is with them 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:32.680
 the power of mixed go boys 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:35.950
 before some supersonic sandals who 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.230
 you know you never know guys you never know 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.630
 maybe this sandal has been created 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.640
 with a material from another planet also 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.870
 it can happen maybe something else comes along 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.100
 planet that there is on earth and 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.480
 just that exactly in armchairs 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.280
 being families andale leaves 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.900
 then with the sandals and I put 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.030
 a sandal with material another language not 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.460
 of gloves that is on the gravel uncle 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.170
 study of nonsense things to guys to 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.430
 see the case is that this climate just that 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.650
 the one and I get delirious 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.180
 please I love the reality this 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.500
 juicy lake in life nor like the ground 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.600
 kid 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.370
 we are missing two control points in two 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.000
 control points and the one that laugh is 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.580
 our the next eye we are going to have 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:22.500
 a little bit to stop pedaling to see what 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:22.500
 it happens because we continue 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.810
 and without pedaling hesitating 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.620
 actually 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
 favorites 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.690
 yes
