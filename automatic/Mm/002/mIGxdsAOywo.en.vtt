00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.970
 hi i am island 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.820
 and this time we are going to teach you 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:16.600
 in the mold of the rabbit 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.370
 The first thing to do is grease 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.110
 grease it with a bit of butter 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:24.750
 vegetable and a little brush 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.590
 then we will have our pasta 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.230
 gum or flower paste 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.720
 that since sugar is totally 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.670
 edible we will pass it on to the 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.160
 that they detest from the side where we are going to 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.750
 record let's make a little one and I'll 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.150
 quito 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:45.080
 so that it enters what has been the 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.850
 nose and shape better we 're going to 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.310
 accommodate 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.470
 and we are going to press hard 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.490
 so that it is well marked what is the 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.820
 face 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.430
 we continue with the little ears 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.300
 and the surplus of pasta we will go 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:05.500
 traveling crushing to go removing 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.850
 the cracks and marks that remain 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.680
 about pasta 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.680
 let's continue with the body 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.740
 and pressing in 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.650
 to form a bulge in what 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.760
 they are being their rabbit's booties the 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.730
 back and a little on the head 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.330
 we will cut the surplus with 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.330
 scissors 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.540
 folds 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.700
 We perform 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.590
 and we are going to break it 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.590
 we do not have left 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.290
 the next thing we have to do is 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:04.430
 separate the ears and remove 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.430
 the city and you're 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.500
 ear 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.130
 in this way the little ears come out more 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.130
 height 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.900
 to 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.569
 the other 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.629
 to give different positions to 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.569
 rabbit in the base we are going to cut a 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:40.069
 little bit to make it more flat 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.069
 and that you play to stand 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:49.450
 we are going to paint in his eyes his mouth 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.609
 like in this one that is here and with a 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:57.129
 little bit of pastel yisr let's shadow 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:03:01.060
 some parts such as the little ears 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:04.049
 cachetitos the tail a little the 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.049
 little arms 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.290
 this is one of the suggestions for 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.840
 decorate you can do different 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.170
 decorations can be put 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.430
 of different color the eyes of different 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.810
 color the different nose shading 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.290
 it depends on what you are going to 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.290
 use 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.730
 this is all for today 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.350
 in your attention and we hope you do not
