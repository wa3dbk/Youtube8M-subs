00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
blow-dries all about kind of like lifted

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.650 
blow-dries all about kind of like lifted
roots<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.420> kind<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.080> light<00:00:14.120> voluminous<00:00:15.120> hair

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660

that<00:00:16.320> has<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.220> bounce<00:00:17.490> which<00:00:18.180> makes<00:00:18.480> sense<00:00:18.710> so<00:00:19.710> I

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
that has a bounce which makes sense so I

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.630 
that has a bounce which makes sense so I
thought<00:00:20.609> what<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.029> do<00:00:21.300> is<00:00:21.630> kind<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.350> food<00:00:23.279> steps

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
thought what I do is kind of food steps

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.160

of<00:00:23.789> how<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:23.970> kind<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.480> fake<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.810> rotor<00:00:24.960> because

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
of how I kind of fake the rotor because

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.540 
of how I kind of fake the rotor because
I<00:00:25.230> can't<00:00:25.470> actually<00:00:25.619> blow<00:00:25.859> dry<00:00:26.039> my<00:00:26.070> hair<00:00:26.220> I'm

this<00:00:48.239> new<00:00:48.300> theorem<00:00:49.289> from<00:00:49.530> Julian<00:00:49.950> Ferrell

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
this new theorem from Julian Ferrell

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.170 
this new theorem from Julian Ferrell
which<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.210> called<00:00:51.890> magnifique<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.219> it

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
which is called magnifique and it

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.020 
which is called magnifique and it
basically<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.289> scalp<00:00:55.590> theorem<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.850> you

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
basically is a scalp theorem that you

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.490 
basically is a scalp theorem that you
just<00:00:57.270> drop<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:57.719> every<00:00:57.989> time<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.230> wash<00:00:58.350> your

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
hair I've used up and use it for a

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.560 
hair I've used up and use it for a
couple<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.120> weeks<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:02.570> it<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.780> really<00:01:04.489> good

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
couple of weeks and it is really good

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.940 
couple of weeks and it is really good
it's<00:01:06.570> all<00:01:06.720> NT<00:01:07.020> edges<00:01:07.229> like<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.680> loads<00:01:07.830> of

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
it's all NT edges like the loads of

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.469 
it's all NT edges like the loads of
hyaluronic<00:01:08.159> acid<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:08.850> there<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.270> other

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
hyaluronic acid in there and other

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.570 
hyaluronic acid in there and other
things<00:01:09.750> apparently<00:01:09.960> even<00:01:10.320> can<00:01:11.070> maybe<00:01:11.250> stop

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
things apparently even can maybe stop

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.850

which is Ruth creeley's and colab and
dry<00:01:48.210> shampoo<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.899> new<00:01:49.079> version

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
dry shampoo this is the new version

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.980 
dry shampoo this is the new version
called<00:01:49.950> extreme<00:01:50.520> volume<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:51.299> haven't<00:01:51.780> tried<00:01:51.869> it

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
called extreme volume I haven't tried it

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.710 
called extreme volume I haven't tried it
before<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.770> it's<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.070> bit<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.720> first-time

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
before so it's a bit of a first-time

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.990 
before so it's a bit of a first-time
experiment<00:01:55.409> basically<00:01:56.310> i<00:01:56.340> think<00:01:56.670> if<00:01:56.729> i<00:01:56.820> get

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
experiment basically i think if i get

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.370 
experiment basically i think if i get
the<00:01:57.030> root<00:01:57.329> if<00:01:57.540> i<00:01:57.630> get<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.810> root<00:01:57.990> volume<00:01:58.290> in

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
the root if i get the root volume in

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.990 
the root if i get the root volume in
first<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.710> can<00:01:58.860> sort<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.159> ends<00:01:59.369> up<00:01:59.460> afterwards

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
first I can sort the ends up afterwards

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.450 
first I can sort the ends up afterwards
and<00:02:00.119> get<00:02:00.329> other<00:02:00.509> bounce<00:02:01.820> so<00:02:02.820> I'm<00:02:02.969> going<00:02:03.180> to

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
and get other bounce so I'm going to

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.779 
and get other bounce so I'm going to
just<00:02:03.690> kind<00:02:04.690> of<00:02:05.010> spray<00:02:06.010> this<00:02:06.220> through<00:02:08.789> lightly

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
just kind of spray this through lightly

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.280 
just kind of spray this through lightly
give<00:02:10.060> it<00:02:10.149> a<00:02:10.209> really<00:02:10.450> really<00:02:10.660> good<00:02:10.810> shake<00:02:11.110> its

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
give it a really really good shake its

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.610 
give it a really really good shake its
prey<00:02:11.440> through<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:13.150> roots<00:02:13.450> in<00:02:13.690> sections<00:02:14.380> like

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
prey through the roots in sections like

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:23.970 
prey through the roots in sections like
this<00:02:21.540> yeah<00:02:22.540> this<00:02:22.870> one<00:02:23.110> reads<00:02:23.350> tells<00:02:23.620> me<00:02:23.830> it's

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
this yeah this one reads tells me it's

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.850 
this yeah this one reads tells me it's
not<00:02:24.100> it's<00:02:24.489> not<00:02:24.550> sheer<00:02:24.970> like<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.800> vision<00:02:26.800> of

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
not it's not sheer like the vision of

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.100 
not it's not sheer like the vision of
one<00:02:26.980> because<00:02:27.220> it's<00:02:27.370> got<00:02:27.610> so<00:02:27.819> much<00:02:28.000> plumping<00:02:28.959> in

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
one because it's got so much plumping in

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.260 
one because it's got so much plumping in
it<00:02:29.230> so<00:02:29.440> you<00:02:29.500> have<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.770> be<00:02:29.800> really<00:02:30.160> careful<00:02:30.940> how

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
it so you have to be really careful how

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.360 
it so you have to be really careful how
you<00:02:31.300> spray<00:02:31.720> it<00:02:31.750> because<00:02:32.050> it<00:02:32.140> does<00:02:32.319> have<00:02:32.739> a

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
you spray it because it does have a

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.100 
you spray it because it does have a
white<00:02:33.640> cast<00:02:34.680> but<00:02:35.680> as<00:02:36.010> soon<00:02:36.190> as<00:02:36.340> you<00:02:36.930> work<00:02:37.930> it
