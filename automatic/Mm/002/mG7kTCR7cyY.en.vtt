again<00:02:41.300> it<00:02:41.660> can<00:02:41.840> be<00:02:41.960> moved<00:02:42.110> around<00:02:42.440> but<00:02:42.680> I<00:02:42.770> don't

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
again it can be moved around but I don't

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.700 
again it can be moved around but I don't
think<00:02:43.250> it<00:02:43.310> would<00:02:43.400> look<00:02:43.580> too<00:02:44.570> it's<00:02:45.380> not<00:02:45.530> really

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
think it would look too it's not really

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.170 
think it would look too it's not really
designed<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.130> be<00:02:46.250> moved<00:02:46.430> anywhere<00:02:46.820> other<00:02:47.030> than

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
designed to be moved anywhere other than

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:59.510 
designed to be moved anywhere other than
the<00:02:47.930> bottom<00:02:48.230> of<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.860> page

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.700 

this<00:03:00.520> is<00:03:00.640> the<00:03:00.700> bottom<00:03:00.940> bar<00:03:01.120> as<00:03:01.990> you<00:03:02.290> can<00:03:02.530> see

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
this is the bottom bar as you can see

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.440 
this is the bottom bar as you can see
it's<00:03:02.920> it's<00:03:03.520> pretty<00:03:03.700> so<00:03:04.030> I<00:03:04.590> guess<00:03:05.590> dark<00:03:06.450> there

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
it's it's pretty so I guess dark there

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.970 
it's it's pretty so I guess dark there
wasn't<00:03:07.780> a<00:03:07.870> group<00:03:08.080> theater<00:03:08.410> Spears<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:08.800> work

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
wasn't a group theater Spears to work

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.410 
wasn't a group theater Spears to work
with<00:03:09.220> where<00:03:09.490> that<00:03:09.640> where<00:03:10.090> you<00:03:10.270> were<00:03:10.390> just

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
with where that where you were just

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.780 
with where that where you were just
simply<00:03:10.870> not<00:03:11.110> impeding<00:03:11.980> on<00:03:12.100> the<00:03:12.190> experience<00:03:12.700> of

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
simply not impeding on the experience of

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.520 
simply not impeding on the experience of
the<00:03:12.910> game<00:03:13.150> so<00:03:13.390> I<00:03:13.420> could<00:03:13.870> quite<00:03:14.080> easily<00:03:14.110> add

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
the game so I could quite easily add

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.010 
the game so I could quite easily add
massive<00:03:15.430> banners<00:03:15.790> with<00:03:15.970> your<00:03:16.120> name<00:03:16.360> on<00:03:16.630> and

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
massive banners with your name on and

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.100 
massive banners with your name on and
starbursts<00:03:17.770> and<00:03:17.890> all<00:03:17.980> that<00:03:18.160> crazy<00:03:18.460> stuff<00:03:18.700> but

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
starbursts and all that crazy stuff but

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.210 
starbursts and all that crazy stuff but
effectively<00:03:20.110> just<00:03:20.440> taking<00:03:20.740> away<00:03:20.830> from<00:03:21.100> the

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
effectively just taking away from the

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.740 
effectively just taking away from the
viewers<00:03:21.520> being<00:03:21.730> able<00:03:21.850> to<00:03:22.000> see<00:03:22.120> what's<00:03:22.360> on<00:03:22.570> the

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
viewers being able to see what's on the

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.600 
viewers being able to see what's on the
game<00:03:22.960> and<00:03:23.200> so<00:03:23.920> I<00:03:23.980> try<00:03:24.160> to<00:03:24.220> keep<00:03:24.370> it<00:03:24.520> as

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
game and so I try to keep it as

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.310 
game and so I try to keep it as
minimalistic<00:03:25.150> as<00:03:25.270> possible<00:03:25.750> again<00:03:26.050> you<00:03:26.200> can

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
minimalistic as possible again you can

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.680 
minimalistic as possible again you can
