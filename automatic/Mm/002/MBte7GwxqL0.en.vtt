like a sniper rifle with the single shot

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
fire on a lot of Awesome ideas but

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.420 
fire on a lot of Awesome ideas but
today's<00:00:20.430> challenge<00:00:21.210> may<00:00:21.720> take<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.439> cake<00:00:22.740> for

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
today's challenge may take the cake for

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.370 
today's challenge may take the cake for
the<00:00:23.670> most<00:00:23.880> ridiculous<00:00:24.570> if<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:25.050> can't<00:00:25.230> tell

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
the most ridiculous if you can't tell

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.220 
the most ridiculous if you can't tell
already<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.859> am<00:00:25.920> using<00:00:26.400> or<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.760> am<00:00:27.080> standing<00:00:28.080> in

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
already I am using or I am standing in

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.400 
already I am using or I am standing in
the<00:00:28.680> stationary<00:00:29.519> tow<00:00:30.000> missile<00:00:30.689> turrets<00:00:31.170> and

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
the stationary tow missile turrets and

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.560 
the stationary tow missile turrets and
the<00:00:32.130> reason<00:00:32.520> why<00:00:32.669> this<00:00:32.730> was<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.360> challenging

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
the reason why this was so challenging

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.630 
the reason why this was so challenging
was<00:00:34.469> for<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.680> couple<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:35.070> reasons<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.610> first

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
was for a couple of reasons the first

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.479 
was for a couple of reasons the first
reason<00:00:36.000> being<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:37.320> doesn't<00:00:37.680> hit<00:00:38.190> very

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
reason being is that it doesn't hit very

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.830 
reason being is that it doesn't hit very
hard<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:39.000> would<00:00:39.090> kind<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.360> think<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.750> it

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
hard you would kind of think that it

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.410 
hard you would kind of think that it
would<00:00:40.020> because<00:00:40.440> it's<00:00:40.770> stationary<00:00:41.460> it's<00:00:42.090> a

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
would because it's stationary it's a

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.690 
would because it's stationary it's a
guided<00:00:42.809> missile<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.350> requires<00:00:43.710> skill<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.550> line

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
guided missile it requires skill to line

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.639 
guided missile it requires skill to line
up<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.879> shot<00:00:44.910> but<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.719> only<00:00:45.899> way<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.410> found

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
up a shot but the only way that I found

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.440 
up a shot but the only way that I found
to<00:00:46.920> be<00:00:46.950> able<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.250> take<00:00:47.340> out<00:00:47.489> infantry<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.180> one

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
to be able to take out infantry in one

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.470 
to be able to take out infantry in one
hit<00:00:48.719> was<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.620> get<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:50.100> body<00:00:50.610> shot<00:00:50.940> or<00:00:51.120> like<00:00:51.360> to

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
hit was to get a body shot or like to

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.900 
hit was to get a body shot or like to
literally<00:00:51.870> hit<00:00:52.170> them<00:00:52.379> at<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.770> base<00:00:53.039> right<00:00:53.699> off

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
literally hit them at the base right off

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
literally hit them at the base right off
the<00:00:54.030> ground<00:00:54.300> where<00:00:54.510> they're<00:00:54.660> standing

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
the ground where they're standing

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.260 
the ground where they're standing
anything<00:00:55.920> else<00:00:56.129> would<00:00:56.430> get<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.640> hitmarker

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
anything else would get a hitmarker

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.389 
anything else would get a hitmarker
and<00:00:57.420> while<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.440> could<00:00:58.649> try<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:58.980> bombard

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
and while you could try to bombard

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.830 
and while you could try to bombard
people<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.910> there<00:01:00.000> were<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.180> couple<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.600> times

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
people and there were a couple of times

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.930 
people and there were a couple of times
where<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.199> would<00:01:01.410> bombard<00:01:01.829> an<00:01:02.250> area<00:01:02.579> around

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
where I would bombard an area around

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.880 
where I would bombard an area around
where<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.480> thought<00:01:03.750> an<00:01:03.870> infantry<00:01:04.199> unit<00:01:04.229> was<00:01:04.650> and

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
where I thought an infantry unit was and

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.800 
where I thought an infantry unit was and
I<00:01:04.949> was<00:01:05.159> able<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.549> tag<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.909> couple<00:01:06.030> kills<00:01:06.540> here

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
I was able to tag a couple kills here

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.990 
I was able to tag a couple kills here
and<00:01:06.960> there<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.799> only<00:01:08.040> way<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.250> was<00:01:08.460> able<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.760> get

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
and there the only way I was able to get

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.810 
and there the only way I was able to get
consistent<00:01:09.689> kills<00:01:09.930> with<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.290> was<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.799> line<00:01:11.549> up

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
consistent kills with it was to line up

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.760 
consistent kills with it was to line up
shots<00:01:12.119> with<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:13.260> other<00:01:13.290> thing<00:01:13.470> that

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
shots with it and the other thing that

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.249 
shots with it and the other thing that
kind<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.010> held<00:01:14.159> me<00:01:14.250> back<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.930> missile

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
kind of held me back is that the missile

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.760 
kind of held me back is that the missile
itself<00:01:16.380> doesn't<00:01:17.369> travel<00:01:17.670> very<00:01:18.119> fast<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:19.170> kind

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
itself doesn't travel very fast it kind

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.620 
itself doesn't travel very fast it kind
of<00:01:19.950> helped<00:01:20.220> me<00:01:20.369> when<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> target<00:01:21.090> was<00:01:21.330> really

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
of helped me when a target was really

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.210 
of helped me when a target was really
close<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.869> me<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.140> could<00:01:22.409> make<00:01:22.560> last-minute

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
close to me I could make last-minute

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.890 
close to me I could make last-minute
adjustments<00:01:23.909> very<00:01:24.060> quickly<00:01:24.360> because<00:01:24.780> it

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
adjustments very quickly because it

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.480 
adjustments very quickly because it
didn't<00:01:25.110> get<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.380> destination<00:01:25.619> very<00:01:26.189> fast

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
didn't get to the destination very fast

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.969 
didn't get to the destination very fast
but<00:01:27.119> for<00:01:27.299> anything<00:01:27.540> at<00:01:27.930> medium<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.470> long<00:01:28.680> range

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
but for anything at medium to long range

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.060 
but for anything at medium to long range
it<00:01:29.520> was<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:30.060> was<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> lesson<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.960> patience<00:01:31.590> there

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
it was it was a lesson in patience there

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.950 
it was it was a lesson in patience there
were<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> lot<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.700> times<00:01:33.060> where<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.390> was<00:01:33.720> trying

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
were a lot of times where I was trying

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.560 
were a lot of times where I was trying
to<00:01:34.110> snipe<00:01:34.400> recons<00:01:35.400> off<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.000> distance<00:01:36.420> and

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
to snipe recons off in the distance and

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.230 
to snipe recons off in the distance and
I<00:01:37.140> would<00:01:37.320> wait<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.710> good<00:01:37.920> what<00:01:38.310> felt<00:01:38.579> like<00:01:38.670> 4<00:01:39.119> to

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
I would wait a good what felt like 4 to

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.120 
I would wait a good what felt like 4 to
5<00:01:39.450> seconds<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.140> then<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.320> would<00:01:40.500> try<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.710> make

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
5 seconds and then I would try to make

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.789 
5 seconds and then I would try to make
my<00:01:41.369> my<00:01:41.909> final<00:01:42.390> Corrections<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.259> line<00:01:43.439> up<00:01:43.619> the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
my my final Corrections to line up the

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.160 
my my final Corrections to line up the
until<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.189> have<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.399> kill<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.810> missile

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
until I have the kill and the missile

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.139 
until I have the kill and the missile
would<00:01:46.500> fly<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.100> ground<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.970> would<00:01:48.060> be

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
would fly to the ground and it would be

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.590 
would fly to the ground and it would be
nowhere<00:01:48.479> near<00:01:48.979> close<00:01:49.979> enough<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:51.299> garner

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
nowhere near close enough to to garner

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.719 
nowhere near close enough to to garner
the<00:01:51.780> kill<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.649> was<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.860> combination<00:01:53.220> of

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
the kill so it was a combination of

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.270 
the kill so it was a combination of
those<00:01:53.939> two<00:01:54.240> factors<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.409> kind<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:55.920> had<00:01:56.130> to

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
those two factors that I kind of had to

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.819 
those two factors that I kind of had to
work<00:01:56.520> around<00:01:56.729> but<00:01:57.420> when<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.570> was<00:01:57.869> able<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.590> line

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
work around but when I was able to line

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.429 
work around but when I was able to line
up<00:01:59.070> shots<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.850> was<00:02:00.149> extremely<00:02:00.930> satisfying

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
up shots it was extremely satisfying

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.469 
up shots it was extremely satisfying
you're<00:02:01.920> gonna<00:02:02.009> see<00:02:02.189> him<00:02:02.250> here<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.490> get<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:03.090> couple

you're gonna see him here I get a couple

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.469 
you're gonna see him here I get a couple
of<00:02:03.869> helicopter<00:02:04.560> Snipes<00:02:05.369> off<00:02:05.579> one<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.180> them

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
of helicopter Snipes off one of them

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.410 
of helicopter Snipes off one of them
admittedly<00:02:07.170> was<00:02:07.619> almost<00:02:08.459> all<00:02:08.789> luck<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.090> mean<00:02:09.300> I

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
admittedly was almost all luck I mean I

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.869 
admittedly was almost all luck I mean I
was<00:02:09.569> lining<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.140> up<00:02:10.259> but<00:02:10.920> halfway<00:02:11.160> through<00:02:11.400> the

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
was lining it up but halfway through the

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.610 
was lining it up but halfway through the
projectile<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.540> was<00:02:12.660> like<00:02:12.780> there's<00:02:12.959> no<00:02:13.230> way<00:02:13.470> I'm

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
projectile I was like there's no way I'm

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.940 
projectile I was like there's no way I'm
gonna

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
gonna

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.920 
gonna
this<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:14.430> didn't<00:02:14.849> move<00:02:15.000> my<00:02:15.360> mouse<00:02:15.540> or<00:02:15.780> anything

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
this I didn't move my mouse or anything

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.600 
this I didn't move my mouse or anything
like<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.230> so<00:02:16.709> it<00:02:16.830> kept<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.160> same<00:02:17.370> trajectory

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
like that so it kept the same trajectory

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.110 
like that so it kept the same trajectory
and<00:02:18.120> this<00:02:18.209> reason<00:02:18.420> why<00:02:18.660> I<00:02:18.690> hit<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.080> but<00:02:19.769> I<00:02:20.610> was<00:02:20.970> I

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
and this reason why I hit it but I was I

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.670 
and this reason why I hit it but I was I
was<00:02:21.239> looking<00:02:21.360> for<00:02:21.660> my<00:02:21.750> next<00:02:22.019> victim<00:02:22.170> because<00:02:22.560> I

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
was looking for my next victim because I

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.350 
was looking for my next victim because I
honestly<00:02:23.280> thought<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:23.819> was<00:02:24.000> gonna<00:02:24.120> miss

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
honestly thought that I was gonna miss

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.509 
honestly thought that I was gonna miss

I can't I can't take credit for it but
in<00:02:31.650> general<00:02:31.730> it<00:02:32.730> kind<00:02:33.030> of<00:02:33.120> felt<00:02:33.330> like<00:02:33.420> this

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
in general it kind of felt like this

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
have it and on those maps they're really

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.430 
have it and on those maps they're really
in<00:02:40.410> kind<00:02:40.950> of<00:02:41.160> random<00:02:41.910> locations<00:02:42.569> operation

capture it I had no line of sight and I

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.309 
capture it I had no line of sight and I
wasn't<00:03:32.850> able<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.150> shoot<00:03:33.480> them<00:03:33.660> I<00:03:33.690> had<00:03:33.959> to<00:03:33.989> wait

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
until they were a good 5 meters away to

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.930 
until they were a good 5 meters away to
launch<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.500> missile<00:03:37.829> and<00:03:37.950> at<00:03:38.250> that<00:03:38.430> point<00:03:38.730> I

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
launch the missile and at that point I

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.080 
launch the missile and at that point I
am<00:03:39.090> extremely<00:03:40.019> exposed<00:03:40.530> and<00:03:40.889> it<00:03:41.489> resulted<00:03:42.000> in

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
am extremely exposed and it resulted in

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.210
