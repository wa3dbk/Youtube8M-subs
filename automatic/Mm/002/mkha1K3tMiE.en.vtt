00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.020 
test for that many things 1.8 there you
can<00:03:04.519> test<00:03:05.090> for<00:03:05.420> like<00:03:06.100> how<00:03:07.100> many<00:03:07.370> enemies

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
can test for like how many enemies

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.550 
can test for like how many enemies
you've<00:03:08.299> killed<00:03:08.630> or<00:03:08.840> how<00:03:08.959> many<00:03:09.019> times<00:03:09.350> you've

do 1.5 okay and then I can just copy

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.310 
do 1.5 okay and then I can just copy
this<00:03:43.540> command<00:03:43.780> and<00:03:44.850> put<00:03:45.850> it<00:03:45.970> in<00:03:46.060> here<00:03:46.320> so

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
this command and put it in here so

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.000 
this command and put it in here so
what's<00:03:47.680> going<00:03:47.950> on<00:03:48.100> right<00:03:48.340> here<00:03:48.610> is<00:03:48.810> this<00:03:49.810> is<00:03:50.200> um

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
guys can do with it anyway and then this

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.370 
guys can do with it anyway and then this
one<00:04:30.610> what<00:04:30.910> it's<00:04:31.030> doing<00:04:31.360> is<00:04:31.560> its<00:04:32.560> testing<00:04:33.400> for<00:04:33.820> a

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
one what it's doing is its testing for a

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.800 
one what it's doing is its testing for a
score<00:04:35.380> player<00:04:35.800> kill<00:04:36.250> count<00:04:36.790> which<00:04:37.540> is<00:04:37.570> how

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
score player kill count which is how

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.690 
score player kill count which is how
many<00:04:37.990> times<00:04:38.410> they've<00:04:38.740> killed<00:04:38.980> a<00:04:39.100> player<00:04:39.370> or

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
many times they've killed a player or

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.510 
many times they've killed a player or
just<00:04:40.000> any<00:04:40.390> players<00:04:40.990> how<00:04:41.710> many<00:04:41.919> kills<00:04:42.250> they

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
just any players how many kills they

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.020 
just any players how many kills they
have<00:04:42.730> the<00:04:43.450> minimum<00:04:43.870> of<00:04:44.020> 10<00:04:44.290> and<00:04:44.560> a<00:04:45.070> maximum<00:04:45.130> of

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
have the minimum of 10 and a maximum of

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.900 
have the minimum of 10 and a maximum of
10<00:04:46.300> and<00:04:46.570> then<00:04:47.200> if<00:04:47.410> so<00:04:47.680> it<00:04:47.950> does<00:04:48.130> the<00:04:48.280> same<00:04:48.520> thing

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
10 and then if so it does the same thing

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.560 
10 and then if so it does the same thing
it<00:04:49.600> tells<00:04:50.590> that<00:04:50.830> player<00:04:51.310> that<00:04:51.610> has<00:04:51.820> that<00:04:52.090> score

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
it tells that player that has that score

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.720 
it tells that player that has that score
you<00:04:53.230> have<00:04:53.350> just<00:04:53.560> earned<00:04:53.680> achievement<00:04:54.310> but<00:04:54.610> it

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
you have just earned achievement but it

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.680 
you have just earned achievement but it
tells<00:04:54.940> everyone<00:04:55.480> else<00:04:56.340> that<00:04:57.419> another<00:04:58.419> player

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.160 
highly doubt it can be but you know
that's<00:06:04.430> the<00:06:04.550> closest<00:06:04.940> we'll<00:06:05.120> get<00:06:05.330> and<00:06:05.540> I'm

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.170 
that's the closest we'll get and I'm

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.570 
that's the closest we'll get and I'm
probably<00:06:06.650> going<00:06:06.920> to<00:06:06.980> use<00:06:07.040> it<00:06:07.310> for<00:06:07.430> my

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
probably going to use it for my

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.850 
probably going to use it for my
adventure<00:06:08.090> map<00:06:08.270> or<00:06:09.700> probably<00:06:10.700> my<00:06:11.000> next<00:06:11.480> little

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860
