00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
we are looking at a generator in the

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:07.579 
we are looking at a generator in the
motor<00:00:07.319> home

this is our RV generator good solid Onan
let's<00:00:30.250> fire<00:00:30.759> it<00:00:30.789> up<00:00:30.970> this<00:00:31.090> is<00:00:31.240> a<00:00:31.269> cold<00:00:31.720> cold

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
let's fire it up this is a cold cold

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.189 
let's fire it up this is a cold cold
start<00:00:32.860> this<00:00:33.100> is<00:00:33.460> the<00:00:33.600> exhaust<00:00:34.600> pipe<00:00:34.930> right

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:35.199

here we go

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:33.460 
here we go
fire<00:01:22.000> it<00:01:22.090> up

this is a really smooth running quiet
generator<00:01:36.950> cut<00:01:37.540> more<00:01:38.540> kilowatts<00:01:39.050> so<00:01:39.380> it

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
generator cut more kilowatts so it

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.400 
generator cut more kilowatts so it
doesn't<00:01:40.250> suck<00:01:40.400> a<00:01:40.430> whole<00:01:40.700> bunch<00:01:40.940> of<00:01:41.090> gas

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
doesn't suck a whole bunch of gas

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.480 
doesn't suck a whole bunch of gas
alright<00:01:42.410> now<00:01:42.530> we're<00:01:42.650> going<00:01:42.740> to<00:01:42.830> fire<00:01:43.040> up<00:01:43.250> roof
