you're separating it from a ring do not

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.680 
you're separating it from a ring do not
use<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.260> egg<00:01:01.829> for<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.760> meringue<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.300> cannot

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
use that egg for the meringue you cannot

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.899 
use that egg for the meringue you cannot
have<00:01:03.960> any<00:01:04.290> fat<00:01:04.680> at<00:01:04.860> all<00:01:05.100> with<00:01:05.430> your<00:01:05.580> meringue

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
otherwise it will not work so just use

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.539 
otherwise it will not work so just use
it<00:01:09.510> for<00:01:09.540> something<00:01:09.840> else<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.650> just<00:01:10.680> pick<00:01:11.340> your

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
it for something else so just pick your

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.480 
it for something else so just pick your
yolk<00:01:11.880> up<00:01:12.119> run<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.810> between<00:01:12.930> your<00:01:13.320> fingers<00:01:13.680> it's

a<00:01:14.610> bit<00:01:14.729> slimy<00:01:15.119> but<00:01:15.450> it's<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.500> most<00:01:16.680> effective

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
a bit slimy but it's the most effective

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.190 
a bit slimy but it's the most effective
way<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.460> doing<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:18.090> it's<00:01:18.330> quite<00:01:18.600> quick<00:01:18.900> and

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
way of doing it it's quite quick and

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.770 
way of doing it it's quite quick and
your<00:01:19.799> fingers<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.250> are<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.400> lot<00:01:20.580> softer<00:01:20.939> then

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
your fingers that are a lot softer then

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.800 
your fingers that are a lot softer then
what<00:01:22.650> an<00:01:22.860> extra<00:01:23.220> would<00:01:23.369> be<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.939> juggle<00:01:24.720> this

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
what an extra would be to juggle this

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.870 
what an extra would be to juggle this
backwards<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.320> forwards<00:01:25.710> with<00:01:25.950> an<00:01:26.490> egg<00:01:26.610> shell

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
backwards and forwards with an egg shell

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.030 
backwards and forwards with an egg shell
it's<00:01:27.600> just<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.900> little<00:01:28.140> hint<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.650> don't<00:01:28.829> have

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
it's just a little hint you don't have

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.249 
it's just a little hint you don't have
to<00:01:29.159> do<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.579> way<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.270> find<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.840> easier

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259
