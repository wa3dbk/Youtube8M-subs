00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
challenges I did mess up a little low

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.390

because<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:18.060> went<00:01:18.360> over<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.689> $10<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.619> did<00:01:19.950> ten

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
because I went over the $10 I did ten

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.539

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
them quite frequently but they're just a

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.520
