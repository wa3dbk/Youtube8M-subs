time<00:00:16.900> this<00:00:17.590> is<00:00:17.800> my<00:00:17.980> idea<00:00:18.310> on<00:00:18.370> the<00:00:18.790> biogas

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:21.540 
time this is my idea on the biogas

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.140 
time this is my idea on the biogas
multi-purpose<00:00:22.540> stove<00:00:23.160> down<00:00:24.160> here<00:00:24.400> inside<00:00:24.850> we

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
multi-purpose stove down here inside we

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.410 
multi-purpose stove down here inside we
have<00:00:25.330> them<00:00:25.660> coils<00:00:26.260> we<00:00:27.220> have<00:00:27.340> a<00:00:27.400> burner<00:00:27.910> or<00:00:28.210> very

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
have them coils we have a burner or very

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.750 
have them coils we have a burner or very
small<00:00:28.720> burner<00:00:28.990> biogas<00:00:29.619> we<00:00:29.950> have<00:00:30.040> coils<00:00:30.430> when

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
small burner biogas we have coils when

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.519 
small burner biogas we have coils when
it<00:00:30.880> goes<00:00:31.060> up<00:00:31.090> and<00:00:31.510> the<00:00:31.930> heat<00:00:32.140> comes<00:00:32.380> down

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
it goes up and the heat comes down

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.830 
it goes up and the heat comes down
around<00:00:33.190> its<00:00:33.460> insulated<00:00:33.940> walls<00:00:34.150> comes<00:00:34.510> up<00:00:34.720> and

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
around its insulated walls comes up and

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.270 
around its insulated walls comes up and
there's<00:00:35.020> a<00:00:35.080> little<00:00:35.320> radio<00:00:35.680> a<00:00:35.800> circular

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
there's a little radio a circular

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.869 
there's a little radio a circular
radiate<00:00:36.809> radiates<00:00:37.809> and<00:00:38.110> heat<00:00:38.680> it's<00:00:39.430> just<00:00:39.760> a

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
radiate radiates and heat it's just a

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.910 
radiate radiates and heat it's just a
radiator<00:00:40.300> that<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:43.660> heat<00:00:43.870> goes<00:00:44.140> through<00:00:44.620> and

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
radiator that the heat goes through and

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.619 
radiator that the heat goes through and
you<00:00:44.980> can<00:00:45.340> have<00:00:45.520> a<00:00:45.550> fan<00:00:45.820> blow<00:00:46.090> it<00:00:46.210> out<00:00:46.360> and<00:00:46.510> then

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
you can have a fan blow it out and then

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.920 
you can have a fan blow it out and then
it<00:00:46.960> stops<00:00:47.440> on<00:00:47.739> this<00:00:48.010> copper<00:00:48.550> hot<00:00:49.210> plate<00:00:49.629> at<00:00:49.809> the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
it stops on this copper hot plate at the

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.110 
it stops on this copper hot plate at the
top<00:00:50.140> now<00:00:50.409> let's<00:00:50.589> start<00:00:50.860> at<00:00:50.949> the<00:00:51.040> beginning<00:00:51.159> I

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.030 

actually<00:00:55.120> did<00:00:55.510> draw<00:00:55.750> this<00:00:55.930> out<00:00:56.170> step<00:00:56.530> by<00:00:56.559> step

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
actually did draw this out step by step

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.060 
actually did draw this out step by step
as<00:00:57.309> best<00:00:57.670> I<00:00:57.850> could<00:00:57.909> think<00:00:58.300> of<00:00:58.449> it<00:00:58.629> and<00:00:59.409> I<00:01:00.010> do

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
as best I could think of it and I do

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.979 
as best I could think of it and I do
this<00:01:00.430> because<00:01:00.879> of<00:01:01.089> my<00:01:01.239> experience<00:01:01.780> in<00:01:01.870> the

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
this because of my experience in the

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:03.630 
this because of my experience in the
video<00:01:02.199> game<00:01:02.440> industry<00:01:02.620> when<00:01:03.159> I<00:01:03.190> realized

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
video game industry when I realized

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.520 
video game industry when I realized
communicating<00:01:04.390> verbally<00:01:04.570> does<00:01:05.019> one<00:01:05.290> thing

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
communicating verbally does one thing

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.350 
communicating verbally does one thing
and<00:01:05.560> just<00:01:06.250> the<00:01:06.880> route<00:01:07.060> most<00:01:07.300> rudimentary

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
and just the route most rudimentary

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.870 
and just the route most rudimentary
artwork<00:01:10.360> added<00:01:11.140> to<00:01:11.290> it<00:01:11.470> can<00:01:11.710> really<00:01:11.890> help<00:01:12.520> come

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
artwork added to it can really help come

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.780 
artwork added to it can really help come
with<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:13.570> concept<00:01:14.080> so<00:01:14.350> here<00:01:14.560> we<00:01:14.650> have<00:01:14.830> just<00:01:15.190> a

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
with the concept so here we have just a

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.010 
with the concept so here we have just a
very<00:01:16.030> small<00:01:16.830> gas<00:01:17.830> burner<00:01:18.340> and<00:01:18.880> then<00:01:19.420> we<00:01:19.540> have<00:01:19.720> a

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
very small gas burner and then we have a

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.520 
very small gas burner and then we have a
chimney<00:01:20.649> and<00:01:21.549> then<00:01:22.390> this<00:01:22.750> chimney<00:01:23.049> goes<00:01:23.320> up

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
chimney and then this chimney goes up

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.050 
chimney and then this chimney goes up
and<00:01:23.740> it<00:01:23.829> is<00:01:23.950> insulated<00:01:24.490> that's<00:01:24.820> what<00:01:24.969> the

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
and it is insulated that's what the

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.010 
and it is insulated that's what the
yellow<00:01:25.210> represents<00:01:25.450> here<00:01:26.110> and<00:01:26.560> as<00:01:27.310> it<00:01:27.340> goes<00:01:27.520> up

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
yellow represents here and as it goes up

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.420 
yellow represents here and as it goes up
it<00:01:29.020> will<00:01:29.049> then<00:01:29.380> be<00:01:29.530> forced<00:01:29.950> back<00:01:30.280> down<00:01:31.170> which

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
it will then be forced back down which

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.889 
it will then be forced back down which
see<00:01:33.430> there's<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:33.850> whole<00:01:33.969> trim<00:01:34.240> anything<00:01:34.630> and

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
see there's the whole trim anything and

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.679 
see there's the whole trim anything and
this<00:01:35.619> coil<00:01:35.979> is<00:01:36.340> what's<00:01:36.609> going<00:01:36.820> this<00:01:37.210> this<00:01:37.539> is<00:01:37.659> a

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
this coil is what's going this this is a

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.219 
this coil is what's going this this is a
coil<00:01:38.079> of<00:01:38.259> copper<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:40.570> starts<00:01:40.899> at<00:01:40.990> the<00:01:41.079> bottom

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
coil of copper it starts at the bottom

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.469 
coil of copper it starts at the bottom
and<00:01:41.530> it<00:01:41.680> goes<00:01:41.829> around<00:01:42.039> and<00:01:42.729> then<00:01:42.969> once<00:01:43.210> it<00:01:43.329> hits

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
and it goes around and then once it hits

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.630 
and it goes around and then once it hits
the<00:01:43.570> top<00:01:43.780> it<00:01:44.049> goes<00:01:44.229> tighter<00:01:45.130> and<00:01:45.310> tighter<00:01:45.429> and

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
the top it goes tighter and tighter and

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.060 
the top it goes tighter and tighter and
tighter<00:01:45.820> until<00:01:46.500> then<00:01:47.500> it<00:01:47.590> goes<00:01:47.740> out<00:01:47.890> to<00:01:47.920> the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
tighter until then it goes out to the

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.349 
tighter until then it goes out to the
top<00:01:48.450> but<00:01:49.450> this<00:01:49.929> will<00:01:50.350> be<00:01:50.380> air<00:01:50.829> tight<00:01:51.250> and<00:01:51.609> it

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:52.359 
top but this will be air tight and it

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:54.569 
top but this will be air tight and it
will<00:01:52.479> sit<00:01:52.840> over<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.320> top<00:01:53.530> of<00:01:53.740> this<00:01:53.920> which<00:01:54.549> is

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
will sit over the top of this which is

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:56.459 
will sit over the top of this which is
what<00:01:55.119> this<00:01:55.299> graphic<00:01:55.810> is<00:01:56.109> supposed<00:01:56.380> to

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
what this graphic is supposed to

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:59.069 
what this graphic is supposed to
demonstrate<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:58.060> lowering<00:01:58.420> of<00:01:58.659> the<00:01:58.810> coil

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079 
demonstrate the lowering of the coil

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:01.529 
demonstrate the lowering of the coil
here<00:01:59.350> now<00:01:59.710> here's<00:01:59.920> one<00:02:00.579> problem<00:02:01.119> I<00:02:01.270> have<00:02:01.509> I

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
here now here's one problem I have I

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:03.660 
here now here's one problem I have I
don't<00:02:01.840> under<00:02:02.109> I<00:02:02.140> don't<00:02:02.409> have<00:02:02.560> them<00:02:02.799> knowledge

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
don't under I don't have them knowledge

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.289 
don't under I don't have them knowledge
in<00:02:04.030> math<00:02:04.299> and<00:02:04.749> physics<00:02:05.289> to<00:02:05.829> know<00:02:06.579> what<00:02:07.090> the

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
in math and physics to know what the

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.190 
in math and physics to know what the
tolerance<00:02:07.840> factors<00:02:08.320> are<00:02:09.630> to<00:02:10.630> make<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:11.050> air

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
tolerance factors are to make the air

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.950 
tolerance factors are to make the air
ratios<00:02:11.770> work<00:02:12.130> right<00:02:12.460> anyway<00:02:13.360> so<00:02:13.600> you<00:02:13.660> slide

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
ratios work right anyway so you slide

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.990 
ratios work right anyway so you slide
the<00:02:14.110> coil<00:02:14.350> over<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.740> top<00:02:14.890> of<00:02:15.069> this<00:02:15.190> insulated

the coil over the top of this insulated

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.360 
the coil over the top of this insulated
exhaust<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.380> you<00:02:17.440> get<00:02:17.680> a<00:02:17.710> hundred<00:02:17.890> percent<00:02:18.069> of

your exhaust going up it hits the the

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.220 
your exhaust going up it hits the the
top<00:02:20.740> of<00:02:20.920> this<00:02:21.040> coil<00:02:21.340> area<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:22.060> then<00:02:22.780> it<00:02:22.900> has<00:02:23.020> to

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
top of this coil area and then it has to

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.370 
top of this coil area and then it has to
travel<00:02:23.410> back<00:02:23.950> down<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.910> get<00:02:25.480> outside<00:02:25.660> where

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
travel back down and get outside where

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.920 
travel back down and get outside where
it's<00:02:26.590> then<00:02:26.770> forced<00:02:27.250> up<00:02:27.430> around<00:02:28.120> it<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:28.480> over

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
it's then forced up around it and over

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:29.750 
it's then forced up around it and over
across<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.380> top

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
across the top

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.289 
across the top
up<00:02:29.909> which<00:02:30.510> hopefully<00:02:30.959> I<00:02:31.230> drew<00:02:32.010> over<00:02:32.040> here

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.490 

that's<00:02:36.299> just<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.629> back<00:02:36.780> side<00:02:37.019> of<00:02:37.049> that<00:02:39.500> and

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
that's just the back side of that and

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.759 
that's just the back side of that and
yeah<00:02:40.709> here's<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.129> be<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.939> the<00:02:42.180> big<00:02:42.769> expanded

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
yeah here's to be the the big expanded

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.770 
yeah here's to be the the big expanded
version<00:02:44.129> you<00:02:44.280> have<00:02:44.519> the<00:02:44.849> the<00:02:45.150> heat<00:02:45.329> going<00:02:45.510> up

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
version you have the the heat going up

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.410 
version you have the the heat going up
you<00:02:46.110> have<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.379> coil<00:02:46.620> coming<00:02:47.280> down<00:02:47.549> and<00:02:47.940> then

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
you have the coil coming down and then

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.789 
you have the coil coming down and then
you<00:02:48.510> have<00:02:48.659> the<00:02:48.840> heat<00:02:49.049> you<00:02:49.349> know<00:02:49.440> we<00:02:49.680> have

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
you have the heat you know we have

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.830 
you have the heat you know we have
insulated<00:02:50.370> wall<00:02:50.519> insulated<00:02:50.970> wall<00:02:51.239> insulated

insulated wall insulated wall insulated
wall<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:52.409> then<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.280> heat<00:02:53.400> comes<00:02:53.640> back<00:02:53.940> up<00:02:54.209> and

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
wall and then the heat comes back up and

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:08.839 
wall and then the heat comes back up and
comes<00:02:57.450> down<00:02:57.890> he<00:02:58.890> comes<00:02:59.069> up<00:02:59.340> down<00:02:59.720> back<00:03:00.720> up<00:03:07.849> and

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
comes down he comes up down back up and

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.770 
comes down he comes up down back up and
as<00:03:09.480> it<00:03:09.569> comes<00:03:09.870> out<00:03:10.109> here<00:03:11.540> you<00:03:12.540> have<00:03:12.750> a

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
as it comes out here you have a

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.830 
as it comes out here you have a
radiative<00:03:13.530> radiator<00:03:14.400> or<00:03:14.849> a<00:03:14.909> heater<00:03:15.299> it's<00:03:15.599> just

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
radiative radiator or a heater it's just

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.520 
radiative radiator or a heater it's just
you<00:03:16.079> know<00:03:16.230> he<00:03:16.950> this<00:03:17.579> tube<00:03:17.970> here<00:03:18.359> it<00:03:19.109> comes<00:03:19.349> up

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
you know he this tube here it comes up

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.319 
you know he this tube here it comes up
here<00:03:19.799> and<00:03:19.859> then<00:03:20.459> they<00:03:20.519> have<00:03:20.549> smaller<00:03:21.000> tubes

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
here and then they have smaller tubes

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:26.479 
here and then they have smaller tubes
that<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:22.879> exhaust<00:03:23.879> runs<00:03:24.329> through<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:25.590> cut

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
that the exhaust runs through and cut

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.550 
that the exhaust runs through and cut
them<00:03:26.609> then<00:03:26.760> can<00:03:27.000> goes<00:03:27.420> back<00:03:27.629> into<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:28.019> big<00:03:28.319> tube

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
them then can goes back into a big tube

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.330 
them then can goes back into a big tube
and<00:03:29.569> you<00:03:30.569> can<00:03:30.599> then<00:03:30.959> run<00:03:31.530> air<00:03:31.829> through<00:03:32.159> that

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
and you can then run air through that

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.939 
and you can then run air through that
and<00:03:32.579> you've<00:03:32.670> got<00:03:32.940> a<00:03:33.079> radiated<00:03:34.079> heat<00:03:34.109> radiant

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:34.949 
and you've got a radiated heat radiant

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:38.449 
and you've got a radiated heat radiant
heat<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:36.150> then<00:03:36.480> at<00:03:36.599> the<00:03:36.690> top<00:03:36.930> here<00:03:37.290> you<00:03:37.470> have<00:03:38.370> a

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
heat and then at the top here you have a

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.569 
heat and then at the top here you have a
hot<00:03:38.730> plate<00:03:39.199> much<00:03:40.199> hopefully<00:03:40.470> represents<00:03:41.310> over

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
hot plate much hopefully represents over

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.930 
hot plate much hopefully represents over
here<00:03:42.379> you<00:03:43.379> have<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.709> coils<00:03:44.099> all<00:03:44.459> this<00:03:44.639> good

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
here you have the coils all this good

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.729 
here you have the coils all this good
stuff<00:03:45.209> you<00:03:45.419> have<00:03:45.540> going<00:03:45.810> up<00:03:46.019> and<00:03:46.230> down<00:03:46.349> and<00:03:46.620> up

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
stuff you have going up and down and up

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.439 
stuff you have going up and down and up
and<00:03:46.919> down<00:03:47.010> and<00:03:47.160> up<00:03:47.489> and<00:03:47.669> down<00:03:47.760> and<00:03:48.090> you're

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:48.449 
and down and up and down and you're

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:50.839 
and down and up and down and you're
using<00:03:48.780> that<00:03:49.109> energy<00:03:49.349> as<00:03:49.709> many<00:03:50.099> times<00:03:50.489> as<00:03:50.730> you

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
using that energy as many times as you

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:51.949 
using that energy as many times as you
possibly<00:03:51.329> can

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
possibly can

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.770 
possibly can
Radia<00:03:52.590> heat<00:03:52.859> does<00:03:53.310> not<00:03:53.340> need<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:53.910> be<00:03:54.030> there<00:03:54.239> but

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
Radia heat does not need to be there but

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.080 
Radia heat does not need to be there but
at<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:54.989> top<00:03:55.139> you<00:03:55.379> have<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:55.560> copper<00:03:56.099> plate<00:03:56.280> it's

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
at the top you have a copper plate it's

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.689 
at the top you have a copper plate it's
like<00:03:57.269> a<00:03:57.299> circular<00:03:58.019> plate<00:03:58.319> to<00:03:59.220> match<00:03:59.400> the

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
like a circular plate to match the

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
exhaust the exhaust comes up it hits

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.420 
exhaust the exhaust comes up it hits
that<00:04:02.579> and<00:04:02.940> it<00:04:03.120> has<00:04:03.329> to<00:04:03.599> go<00:04:03.780> down<00:04:04.109> I<00:04:04.590> don't<00:04:05.310> know

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
that and it has to go down I don't know

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.189 
that and it has to go down I don't know
if<00:04:05.549> we<00:04:05.699> need<00:04:05.760> another<00:04:06.090> math<00:04:06.359> expert<00:04:06.870> on<00:04:06.989> this

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:07.199 
if we need another math expert on this

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:09.920 
if we need another math expert on this

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
so many half-inch inch quarter inch 3/4

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.140 
so many half-inch inch quarter inch 3/4
inch<00:04:10.139> inch<00:04:10.410> and<00:04:10.500> a<00:04:10.590> half<00:04:10.620> before<00:04:11.579> it<00:04:11.849> can<00:04:12.000> then

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
inch inch and a half before it can then

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.599 
inch inch and a half before it can then
escape<00:04:12.599> out<00:04:12.840> into<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:13.230> atmosphere<00:04:13.379> and<00:04:14.010> you

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
escape out into the atmosphere and you

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.490 
escape out into the atmosphere and you
can<00:04:14.849> then<00:04:15.030> create<00:04:15.299> a<00:04:15.480> hot<00:04:15.840> plate<00:04:16.199> that<00:04:16.409> you

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
can then create a hot plate that you

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.509 
can then create a hot plate that you
could<00:04:16.650> possibly<00:04:16.829> cook<00:04:17.519> on<00:04:18.739> but<00:04:19.739> I<00:04:19.949> mean<00:04:20.280> maybe

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
could possibly cook on but I mean maybe

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.149 
could possibly cook on but I mean maybe
you<00:04:20.760> could<00:04:20.909> get<00:04:21.329> it<00:04:21.620> who<00:04:22.620> knows<00:04:22.830> what<00:04:22.979> you<00:04:23.039> can

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:23.159 
you could get it who knows what you can

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:27.170 
you could get it who knows what you can
do<00:04:23.250> with<00:04:23.370> this<00:04:24.110> anyways<00:04:25.110> that<00:04:25.470> is<00:04:25.500> my<00:04:25.680> idea<00:04:26.280> for

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
do with this anyways that is my idea for

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.200 
do with this anyways that is my idea for
a<00:04:27.539> biogas<00:04:28.320> stove<00:04:28.770> and<00:04:29.070> the<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.460> point<00:04:29.789> of<00:04:30.060> the

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
a biogas stove and the the point of the

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.939 
a biogas stove and the the point of the
flame<00:04:30.449> being<00:04:30.870> small<00:04:31.289> enough<00:04:31.320> that<00:04:31.740> you<00:04:31.830> could

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
flame being small enough that you could

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:34.250 
flame being small enough that you could
run<00:04:32.190> it<00:04:32.340> 24<00:04:32.639> hours<00:04:33.210> a<00:04:33.240> day<00:04:33.360> seven<00:04:33.930> days<00:04:33.960> a<00:04:34.110> week

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
run it 24 hours a day seven days a week

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.339 
run it 24 hours a day seven days a week
and<00:04:35.000> with<00:04:36.000> all<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.300> insulation<00:04:36.750> and<00:04:37.139> you

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:37.349 
and with all the insulation and you

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:40.850 
and with all the insulation and you
would<00:04:37.950> retain<00:04:38.340> and<00:04:38.820> reuse<00:04:39.360> your<00:04:39.659> heat<00:04:39.870> four<00:04:40.650> or

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
would retain and reuse your heat four or

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:41.960 
would retain and reuse your heat four or
five<00:04:41.039> times

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
five times

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.630 
five times
and<00:04:42.750> that's<00:04:43.200> my<00:04:43.470> concept<00:04:43.710> on<00:04:44.100> the<00:04:44.190> biogas

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
and that's my concept on the biogas

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.210 
and that's my concept on the biogas
stove<00:04:44.970> I<00:04:45.300> hope<00:04:45.780> some<00:04:46.470> of<00:04:46.500> that<00:04:46.620> made<00:04:46.980> some

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
stove I hope some of that made some

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.790 
stove I hope some of that made some
sense<00:04:47.490> you'd<00:04:48.300> want<00:04:48.510> to<00:04:48.570> use<00:04:48.720> copper<00:04:49.290> and<00:04:49.620> you'd

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
sense you'd want to use copper and you'd

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.880 
sense you'd want to use copper and you'd
want<00:04:50.040> to<00:04:50.100> insulate<00:04:50.670> as<00:04:50.970> often<00:04:51.510> as<00:04:51.690> possible<00:04:51.890> to

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
want to insulate as often as possible to

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.670 
want to insulate as often as possible to
retain<00:04:53.220> the<00:04:53.370> heat<00:04:53.580> or<00:04:54.210> use<00:04:54.420> the<00:04:54.630> heat<00:04:54.870> move<00:04:55.530> it

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
retain the heat or use the heat move it

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.590 
retain the heat or use the heat move it
over<00:04:55.890> the<00:04:55.980> copper<00:04:56.370> again<00:04:56.490> and<00:04:56.940> Riis<00:04:57.150> it<00:04:57.330> again

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
over the copper again and Riis it again

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.050 
over the copper again and Riis it again
and<00:04:57.750> again<00:04:58.020> and<00:04:58.170> again<00:04:58.350> and<00:04:58.560> again<00:04:59.070> how<00:04:59.760> cool

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
and again and again and again how cool

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.680 
and again and again and again how cool
is<00:05:00.210> that

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
is that

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.170 
is that
