gonna hit OK on that and then once it

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.040 
gonna hit OK on that and then once it
does<00:02:30.550> that<00:02:30.580> it's<00:02:30.940> gonna<00:02:31.060> say<00:02:31.390> launch<00:02:31.780> the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
does that it's gonna say launch the

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.500 
does that it's gonna say launch the
inner<00:02:32.590> browser<00:02:32.920> yes<00:02:33.640> you're<00:02:33.880> going<00:02:34.180> to<00:02:34.300> want

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
inner browser yes you're going to want

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.450 
inner browser yes you're going to want
to<00:02:34.630> do<00:02:34.750> that<00:02:34.900> so<00:02:35.230> it<00:02:35.350> can<00:02:35.440> basically<00:02:35.650> activate

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
to do that so it can basically activate

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.610 
to do that so it can basically activate
the<00:02:36.610> code<00:02:36.850> that<00:02:37.270> you<00:02:37.360> were<00:02:37.450> looking<00:02:37.720> for<00:02:37.960> so

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
the code that you were looking for so

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.620 
the code that you were looking for so
while<00:02:38.800> it<00:02:38.980> does<00:02:39.190> that<00:02:39.220> is<00:02:39.670> going<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.150> say<00:02:40.360> that

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
while it does that is going to say that

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.210 
while it does that is going to say that
it<00:02:40.750> failed<00:02:40.990> to<00:02:41.050> load<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.380> page<00:02:41.590> which<00:02:42.070> is

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
it failed to load the page which is

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.950 
it failed to load the page which is
perfectly<00:02:42.610> okay<00:02:42.970> so<00:02:43.390> it's<00:02:43.660> running<00:02:43.780> the

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
perfectly okay so it's running the

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.420 
perfectly okay so it's running the
exploit<00:02:44.410> which<00:02:44.620> is<00:02:44.770> basically<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.250> thing

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
exploit which is basically the thing

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.130 
exploit which is basically the thing
that<00:02:45.550> you<00:02:45.640> need<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:45.910> get<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.480> be<00:02:46.630> able<00:02:46.780> to<00:02:46.930> run

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
that you need to get to be able to run

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.470 
that you need to get to be able to run
this<00:02:47.350> pokemon<00:02:47.800> so<00:02:48.280> now<00:02:48.370> that's<00:02:48.580> back<00:02:48.940> to<00:02:48.970> here

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
this pokemon so now that's back to here

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.110 
this pokemon so now that's back to here
we<00:02:49.900> are<00:02:49.930> able<00:02:50.140> to<00:02:50.290> go<00:02:50.530> hit<00:02:50.890> okay<00:02:51.190> now<00:02:52.030> we're
