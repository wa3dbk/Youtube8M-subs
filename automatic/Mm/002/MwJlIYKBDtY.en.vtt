00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
is always one tempo too quick

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.490 
is always one tempo too quick
yeah<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.180> guideline<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.960> rook<00:01:28.170> belongs

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.230 
yeah the guideline that the rook belongs
by<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.770> passed<00:01:29.070> pawn<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.549> very<00:01:29.759> good<00:01:30.000> fun

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
by the passed pawn is a very good fun

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.410 
by the passed pawn is a very good fun
and<00:01:30.390> rook<00:01:30.540> endings<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:30.990> course<00:01:31.369> but<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:33.119> also

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
and rook endings of course but it also

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.830 
and rook endings of course but it also
leads<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.560> lot<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.770> mistakes<00:01:35.220> if<00:01:35.579> Otto<00:01:36.240> F

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
leads to a lot of mistakes if Otto F

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.940 
leads to a lot of mistakes if Otto F
applied<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.610> automatically<00:01:39.950> these

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
applied to automatically these

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.850 
applied to automatically these
guidelines<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.549> course<00:01:41.729> must<00:01:41.880> always<00:01:42.060> be

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
guidelines of course must always be

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.649 
guidelines of course must always be
checked<00:01:43.860> with<00:01:44.040> concrete<00:01:44.479> calculation<00:01:45.479> and

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
checked with concrete calculation and

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.660 
checked with concrete calculation and
here<00:01:46.909> f6<00:01:47.909> drawers<00:01:48.360> as<00:01:48.750> now<00:01:49.250> why<00:01:50.250> it's<00:01:50.460> just

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
here f6 drawers as now why it's just

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.139 
here f6 drawers as now why it's just
quick<00:01:50.939> enough<00:01:51.329> in<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.810> races<00:01:52.320> after<00:01:52.590> rook<00:01:53.549> f5

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
quick enough in the races after rook f5

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.899 
quick enough in the races after rook f5
now<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.689> rook<00:01:55.200> can<00:01:55.229> go<00:01:55.799> behind<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.430> pawn<00:01:56.640> and

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
be three there's typical procedure yeah

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.990 
be three there's typical procedure yeah
if<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.349> would<00:02:43.890> have<00:02:44.040> continued<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.610> give

if you would have continued to give

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.039 
if you would have continued to give
checks<00:02:45.930> then<00:02:46.739> our<00:02:47.549> King<00:02:48.420> can<00:02:48.660> find<00:02:48.930> shelter

Rockville<00:02:55.709> result<00:02:56.160> this<00:02:56.519> would<00:02:56.670> also<00:02:56.850> have

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
Rockville result this would also have

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.820 
Rockville result this would also have
been<00:02:57.030> possible<00:02:57.480> in<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.690> game<00:02:57.720> but<00:02:58.319> maybe<00:02:58.560> this

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
been possible in the game but maybe this

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.150 
been possible in the game but maybe this
is<00:02:59.069> yeah<00:03:00.170> yeah<00:03:01.170> this<00:03:01.349> is<00:03:01.440> best<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.769> technique

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
is yeah yeah this is best a technique

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.020 
is yeah yeah this is best a technique
from<00:03:02.340> whites<00:03:02.670> point<00:03:03.030> of<00:03:03.209> view<00:03:03.420> because<00:03:05.030> it

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
from whites point of view because it

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:13.280

and there is no salvation but of course

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.300 
and there is no salvation but of course
for<00:04:19.019> a<00:04:19.079> practical<00:04:19.440> point<00:04:19.739> of<00:04:19.799> view<00:04:19.859> again<00:04:20.070> it

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
for a practical point of view again it

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.830 
for a practical point of view again it
would<00:04:20.430> be<00:04:20.579> better<00:04:20.760> to<00:04:20.910> head<00:04:21.239> for<00:04:21.510> an<00:04:21.599> endgame
