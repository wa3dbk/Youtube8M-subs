00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
lungs collapsed a second time so I

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.760 
lungs collapsed a second time so I
required<00:01:58.670> three<00:01:59.539> more<00:01:59.720> chest<00:02:00.020> tubes<00:02:00.289> so<00:02:00.560> five

hospital-acquired infection in my trach

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.080 
hospital-acquired infection in my trach
which<00:02:05.450> required<00:02:06.160> powerful<00:02:07.160> antibiotics

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
which required powerful antibiotics

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.999 
which required powerful antibiotics
there<00:02:08.330> was<00:02:08.450> one<00:02:08.690> antibiotic<00:02:09.050> that<00:02:09.530> would<00:02:09.590> help

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
there was one antibiotic that would help

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.400 
there was one antibiotic that would help
and<00:02:10.340> they<00:02:11.000> hoped<00:02:11.300> that<00:02:11.510> that<00:02:11.720> would<00:02:11.930> work<00:02:11.959> and

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
and they hoped that that would work and

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.430 
and they hoped that that would work and
it<00:02:12.470> did<00:02:12.739> so<00:02:13.610> during<00:02:14.569> the<00:02:14.690> course<00:02:14.930> of<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.290> eight

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
it did so during the course of the eight

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.229 
it did so during the course of the eight
weeks<00:02:15.769> on<00:02:16.069> the<00:02:16.790> vent<00:02:17.060> I<00:02:18.670> went<00:02:19.670> for<00:02:19.910> and<00:02:20.030> I<00:02:20.120> was

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
weeks on the vent I went for and I was

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.210 
weeks on the vent I went for and I was
very<00:02:20.390> key<00:02:20.629> condition<00:02:21.500> so<00:02:21.769> I<00:02:21.800> required

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
very key condition so I required

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.890 
very key condition so I required
physical<00:02:22.489> therapy<00:02:23.090> occupational<00:02:23.390> therapy

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900

I<00:02:26.030> became<00:02:26.330> vent<00:02:26.599> dependent<00:02:27.260> so<00:02:27.769> I<00:02:27.800> had<00:02:27.950> a<00:02:27.980> very

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
I became vent dependent so I had a very

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.649 
I became vent dependent so I had a very
difficult<00:02:28.459> time<00:02:28.909> getting<00:02:28.970> off<00:02:29.420> the

until I was finally completely off of
the<00:02:40.069> oxygen<00:02:40.760> had<00:02:41.510> my<00:02:41.690> chest<00:02:41.990> tubes<00:02:42.260> pulled<00:02:42.650> out

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
the oxygen had my chest tubes pulled out

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.530 
the oxygen had my chest tubes pulled out
had<00:02:43.850> my<00:02:44.030> NG<00:02:44.390> tube<00:02:44.420> removed

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
had my NG tube removed

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.770 
had my NG tube removed
and<00:02:46.040> walking<00:02:47.040> very<00:02:47.549> very<00:02:47.849> slowly<00:02:48.180> I<00:02:48.360> did<00:02:48.599> walk

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
and walking very very slowly I did walk

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.479 
and walking very very slowly I did walk
out<00:02:48.930> of<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.110> hospital<00:02:49.260> in<00:02:49.709> one<00:02:49.829> hand<00:02:50.099> so<00:02:50.310> my

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
out of the hospital in one hand so my

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.880

ventilator and he even though they tried
to<00:03:07.980> extubate<00:03:08.400> him<00:03:08.879> a<00:03:09.239> few<00:03:09.569> times<00:03:09.870> he<00:03:10.230> had

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
to extubate him a few times he had

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.559 
to extubate him a few times he had
trouble<00:03:10.890> being<00:03:11.310> extubated<00:03:12.000> he<00:03:12.150> suffered

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
trouble being extubated he suffered

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:13.640 
trouble being extubated he suffered
severe<00:03:12.989> delirium

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
severe delirium

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.250 
severe delirium
during<00:03:14.370> his<00:03:14.549> extubation<00:03:15.180> periods<00:03:15.870> of<00:03:16.049> time

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
during his extubation periods of time

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.460 
during his extubation periods of time
and<00:03:17.120> eventually<00:03:18.120> one<00:03:18.810> of<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:18.989> times<00:03:19.230> he<00:03:19.319> was

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
and eventually one of the times he was

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.670 
and eventually one of the times he was
extubated<00:03:20.280> they<00:03:21.000> just<00:03:21.329> discovered<00:03:22.170> he<00:03:22.530> was

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
extubated they just discovered he was

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.309 
extubated they just discovered he was
internally<00:03:23.220> bleeding<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.879> he<00:03:24.180> lost<00:03:24.420> about<00:03:24.599> 11

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
internally bleeding and he lost about 11

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.210 
internally bleeding and he lost about 11
units<00:03:25.709> of<00:03:25.889> blood<00:03:26.010> in<00:03:27.530> approximately<00:03:28.530> two<00:03:29.069> to

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
units of blood in approximately two to

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.399 
units of blood in approximately two to
three<00:03:29.430> hours<00:03:29.790> so<00:03:30.450> he<00:03:30.629> required<00:03:31.049> emergency

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:31.409 
three hours so he required emergency

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:35.899 
three hours so he required emergency
surgery<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:33.090> repair<00:03:33.659> the<00:03:34.430> internals<00:03:35.430> to

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
surgery to repair the internals to

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.690 
surgery to repair the internals to
repair<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.569> internal<00:03:36.959> bleeding<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.700> they

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
repair the internal bleeding and they

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.289 
repair the internal bleeding and they
did<00:03:38.909> not<00:03:39.060> expect<00:03:39.420> him<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.720> survive<00:03:40.790> however<00:03:41.790> he

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
did not expect him to survive however he

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:47.899 
did not expect him to survive however he
also<00:03:42.540> survived<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:44.659> he<00:03:45.659> then<00:03:46.370> eventually<00:03:47.370> was

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
also survived and he then eventually was

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.449 
also survived and he then eventually was
excavated<00:03:48.870> and<00:03:49.109> they<00:03:49.859> changed<00:03:50.310> his

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
excavated and they changed his

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.430 
excavated and they changed his
medication<00:03:50.579> so<00:03:51.359> that<00:03:51.389> the<00:03:51.690> delirium<00:03:52.260> was<00:03:52.410> a

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
medication so that the delirium was a

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.189 
medication so that the delirium was a
little<00:03:52.829> less<00:03:53.010> and<00:03:53.489> but<00:03:54.480> he<00:03:54.569> still<00:03:54.780> suffered

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:55.199 
little less and but he still suffered

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:58.250 
little less and but he still suffered
delirium<00:03:55.620> once<00:03:55.799> he<00:03:55.919> was<00:03:56.069> off<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.910> oxygen<00:03:57.260> he

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
delirium once he was off the oxygen he

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.170 
delirium once he was off the oxygen he
was<00:03:58.440> on<00:03:58.709> and<00:03:58.919> off<00:03:59.010> suffering<00:03:59.489> the<00:03:59.579> delirium

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
was on and off suffering the delirium

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.199 
was on and off suffering the delirium
until<00:04:01.109> he<00:04:01.379> eventually<00:04:01.680> went<00:04:02.370> to<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.760> hospital

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
until he eventually went to the hospital

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.280 
until he eventually went to the hospital
physical<00:04:04.169> therapy<00:04:04.650> unit<00:04:05.010> where<00:04:05.669> he<00:04:05.879> was

physical therapy unit where he was
receiving<00:04:07.290> physical<00:04:07.530> therapy<00:04:08.340> and<00:04:08.489> he<00:04:08.609> was<00:04:08.730> in

receiving physical therapy and he was in
the<00:04:08.910> hospital<00:04:09.060> for<00:04:09.629> about<00:04:09.870> a<00:04:10.019> month<00:04:10.260> and<00:04:11.569> my

the hospital for about a month and my
father<00:04:12.810> was<00:04:13.019> 77<00:04:13.560> years<00:04:13.739> old<00:04:14.010> at<00:04:14.220> the<00:04:14.340> time<00:04:14.449> when

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:15.449 
father was 77 years old at the time when

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:18.529 
father was 77 years old at the time when
I<00:04:15.480> was<00:04:15.720> sick<00:04:15.989> I<00:04:16.109> was<00:04:16.139> 33<00:04:16.620> years<00:04:17.039> old<00:04:17.190> and<00:04:17.539> even

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
I was sick I was 33 years old and even

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.029 
I was sick I was 33 years old and even
though<00:04:18.660> I<00:04:18.690> was<00:04:18.930> in<00:04:19.049> the<00:04:19.109> hospital<00:04:19.289> for<00:04:19.829> more

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
though I was in the hospital for more

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.150 
though I was in the hospital for more
than<00:04:20.099> twice<00:04:20.459> as<00:04:20.669> long<00:04:20.849> as<00:04:21.030> him<00:04:21.389> I<00:04:22.229> think<00:04:22.770> that

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
than twice as long as him I think that

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.790 
than twice as long as him I think that
his<00:04:24.080> post<00:04:25.610> critical<00:04:26.610> care<00:04:27.380> issues<00:04:28.380> were

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
his post critical care issues were

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.110 
his post critical care issues were
exaggerated<00:04:29.789> due<00:04:30.030> to<00:04:30.300> his<00:04:30.570> age<00:04:30.840> and<00:04:31.620> just<00:04:32.400> the

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
exaggerated due to his age and just the

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.339 
exaggerated due to his age and just the
things<00:04:33.270> that<00:04:33.419> he<00:04:33.630> had<00:04:33.720> dealt<00:04:33.930> with<00:04:34.110> while<00:04:34.320> he

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:34.349 
things that he had dealt with while he

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:36.740 
things that he had dealt with while he
was<00:04:34.500> in<00:04:34.740> the<00:04:34.800> ICU<00:04:34.949> however<00:04:35.760> I<00:04:35.880> also<00:04:36.150> think<00:04:36.659> that

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
was in the ICU however I also think that

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.730 
was in the ICU however I also think that
his<00:04:37.560> care<00:04:37.949> post<00:04:38.750> critical<00:04:39.750> care<00:04:40.020> was<00:04:40.470> much

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
his care post critical care was much

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:41.450 
his care post critical care was much
better

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
better

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.990 
better
he<00:04:41.909> received<00:04:42.419> therapies<00:04:43.139> that<00:04:43.320> he<00:04:43.500> needed

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
he received therapies that he needed

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.670 
he received therapies that he needed

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
they were on top of it as soon as he was

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.439 
they were on top of it as soon as he was
in<00:04:46.830> the<00:04:46.860> ICU<00:04:47.070> which<00:04:47.760> was<00:04:47.970> something<00:04:48.300> that<00:04:48.330> I

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
in the ICU which was something that I

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:51.170 
in the ICU which was something that I
did<00:04:48.780> not<00:04:48.900> I<00:04:49.199> would<00:04:49.470> do<00:04:49.590> not<00:04:49.740> benefit<00:04:50.130> from<00:04:50.190> one

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180

each hour in each minute you determine
very<00:05:05.890> quickly<00:05:06.250> how<00:05:06.580> precious<00:05:07.150> life<00:05:07.180> is

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
very quickly how precious life is

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.070 
very quickly how precious life is

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
or maybe you assumed that everything was

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.830 
or maybe you assumed that everything was
just<00:05:11.110> going<00:05:11.620> along<00:05:11.740> hour<00:05:12.550> by<00:05:13.060> hour<00:05:13.090> day<00:05:13.420> by<00:05:13.600> day

just going along hour by hour day by day

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.130 
just going along hour by hour day by day
but<00:05:14.110> now<00:05:14.530> you<00:05:14.590> cling<00:05:15.100> to<00:05:15.310> life<00:05:15.340> and<00:05:15.930> you<00:05:16.930> want

but now you cling to life and you want

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.990 
but now you cling to life and you want
