key<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:28.080> using<00:02:28.290> this<00:02:28.560> is<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:28.950> run<00:02:29.130> water

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
key to using this is to run water

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.060 
key to using this is to run water
through<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:29.820> very<00:02:30.060> slowly<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:31.380> instructions

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
through it very slowly the instructions

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:38.450 
through it very slowly the instructions
say<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:34.100> let<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.190> flow<00:02:35.430> run<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:37.130> fill<00:02:38.130> up<00:02:38.280> the

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
say to let the flow run and fill up the

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.780 
say to let the flow run and fill up the
cup<00:02:38.760> one<00:02:39.180> measuring<00:02:39.570> cup<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:40.080> water<00:02:40.400> within<00:02:41.400> 30

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
cup one measuring cup of water within 30

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.930 
cup one measuring cup of water within 30
seconds<00:02:42.710> well<00:02:43.710> what<00:02:43.860> I<00:02:43.920> do<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.220> adjust<00:02:44.460> mine

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
seconds well what I do I adjust mine

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.290 
seconds well what I do I adjust mine
down<00:02:45.380> it's<00:02:46.380> where<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.680> collects<00:02:47.040> one<00:02:48.030> cut

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
down it's where it collects one cut

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.930 
down it's where it collects one cut
fills<00:02:48.570> up<00:02:48.720> one<00:02:48.900> cup<00:02:49.170> of<00:02:49.290> water<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.980> measuring

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
fills up one cup of water a measuring

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.320 
fills up one cup of water a measuring
cup<00:02:50.970> every<00:02:51.780> minute<00:02:52.310> so<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.550> key<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.820> this<00:02:53.880> is

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
cup every minute so the key to this is

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.699 
cup every minute so the key to this is
the<00:02:54.390> slower<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.200> flow<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:56.010> better<00:02:57.140> okay<00:02:58.140> I'm

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
the slower the flow the better okay I'm

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.040 
the slower the flow the better okay I'm
gonna<00:02:58.830> go<00:02:58.950> down<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.760> my<00:02:59.940> hundred<00:03:00.420> fifty<00:03:00.660> gallon

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
gonna go down to my hundred fifty gallon

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.900 
gonna go down to my hundred fifty gallon
aquarium<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.530> show<00:03:01.709> you<00:03:01.770> how<00:03:02.010> I<00:03:02.040> use<00:03:02.400> this<00:03:02.610> to

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
aquarium to show you how I use this to

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.540 
aquarium to show you how I use this to
top<00:03:03.360> off<00:03:03.540> evaporated<00:03:04.260> water<00:03:04.440> oh<00:03:04.800> I<00:03:05.160> meant<00:03:05.430> to

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
top off evaporated water oh I meant to

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.920 
top off evaporated water oh I meant to
show<00:03:05.730> you<00:03:05.790> something<00:03:06.240> else<00:03:06.390> too<00:03:06.660> when<00:03:06.840> you

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
show you something else too when you

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.380 
show you something else too when you
turn<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.260> unit<00:03:07.500> off<00:03:07.650> you<00:03:08.520> don't<00:03:08.730> want<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.120> ion

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
turn the unit off you don't want the ion

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.530 
turn the unit off you don't want the ion
exchange<00:03:09.900> resin<00:03:10.380> to<00:03:10.770> dry<00:03:11.160> out<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:12.180> just<00:03:12.360> turn

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
exchange resin to dry out to just turn

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.440 
exchange resin to dry out to just turn
the<00:03:12.690> water<00:03:12.870> off

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
the water off

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:21.290 
the water off
remove<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.630> top<00:03:15.810> hose<00:03:18.440> and<00:03:19.440> then<00:03:20.150> take<00:03:21.150> the

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
remove the top hose and then take the

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.330 
remove the top hose and then take the
bottom<00:03:21.630> of<00:03:21.720> hose<00:03:21.870> which<00:03:22.470> still<00:03:22.740> has<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.130> water

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
bottom of hose which still has the water

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:31.580 
bottom of hose which still has the water
in<00:03:23.550> it<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:25.130> plug<00:03:26.130> in<00:03:26.310> at<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.580> top<00:03:30.470> when<00:03:31.470> I<00:03:31.500> do

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
in it and plug in at the top when I do

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.550 
in it and plug in at the top when I do
it<00:03:31.800> just<00:03:32.010> do<00:03:32.160> that<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.840> then<00:03:33.840> store<00:03:34.260> it<00:03:34.410> like

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
it just do that and then store it like

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.970 
it just do that and then store it like
this<00:03:34.860> in<00:03:35.160> my<00:03:35.310> closet<00:03:35.900> so<00:03:36.900> you<00:03:37.620> just<00:03:37.739> want<00:03:37.950> to

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
this in my closet so you just want to

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.830 
this in my closet so you just want to
make<00:03:38.100> sure<00:03:38.130> that<00:03:38.459> that<00:03:38.580> doesn't<00:03:38.850> dry<00:03:39.180> out<00:03:39.209> keep

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
make sure that that doesn't dry out keep

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.550 
make sure that that doesn't dry out keep
water<00:03:40.110> in<00:03:40.230> it<00:03:40.470> that's<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.280> very<00:03:41.489> important<00:03:42.560> when

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
water in it that's a very important when

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.320 
water in it that's a very important when
your<00:03:43.709> aquarium<00:03:44.010> loses<00:03:44.670> water<00:03:44.940> due<00:03:45.209> to

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
your aquarium loses water due to

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.650 
your aquarium loses water due to
evaporation<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:47.160> water<00:03:47.430> evaporates<00:03:48.269> and

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
evaporation the water evaporates and

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.850 
evaporation the water evaporates and
minerals<00:03:49.170> are<00:03:49.380> left<00:03:49.590> behind<00:03:50.330> so<00:03:51.330> if<00:03:51.420> you<00:03:51.540> keep

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
minerals are left behind so if you keep

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.920 
minerals are left behind so if you keep
topping<00:03:52.860> off<00:03:53.010> your<00:03:53.280> aquarium<00:03:53.940> with<00:03:54.299> regular

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
topping off your aquarium with regular

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.440 
topping off your aquarium with regular
tap<00:03:55.200> water<00:03:55.430> you're<00:03:56.430> eventually<00:03:56.640> adding<00:03:57.239> more

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
tap water you're eventually adding more

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
tap water you're eventually adding more
and<00:03:57.780> more<00:03:57.840> and<00:03:58.530> more<00:03:58.680> minerals<00:03:59.220> and<00:03:59.580> over<00:04:00.180> time

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
and more and more minerals and over time

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.110 
and more and more minerals and over time
your<00:04:01.470> general<00:04:02.070> hardness<00:04:02.519> and<00:04:02.700> carbonate

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
your general hardness and carbonate

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.140 
your general hardness and carbonate
hardness<00:04:03.450> is<00:04:03.720> going<00:04:03.900> to<00:04:03.959> go<00:04:04.080> through<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.410> roof

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
hardness is going to go through the roof

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.539 
hardness is going to go through the roof
so<00:04:06.150> what<00:04:07.140> you<00:04:07.260> need<00:04:07.380> to<00:04:07.440> do<00:04:07.620> is<00:04:07.860> use<00:04:08.070> reverse

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
so what you need to do is use reverse

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.720 
so what you need to do is use reverse
osmosis<00:04:08.790> or<00:04:09.570> deionized<00:04:09.900> water<00:04:10.290> to<00:04:11.100> top<00:04:11.519> off

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
osmosis or deionized water to top off

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.780 
osmosis or deionized water to top off
