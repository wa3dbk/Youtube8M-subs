00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
think that I think that with a loss like

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.730 
think that I think that with a loss like
that<00:01:32.960> you<00:01:33.960> know<00:01:33.990> all<00:01:34.200> we<00:01:34.290> can<00:01:34.439> do<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.560> bounce

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
that you know all we can do is bounce

that you know all we can do is bounce
back<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.400> think<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.759> it's<00:01:35.909> really<00:01:36.229> given

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229

we<00:01:50.759> definitely<00:01:50.880> gotten<00:01:51.270> better<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:52.619> think

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
we definitely gotten better and I think

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.620 
we definitely gotten better and I think
that<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.189> loss<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:54.000> really<00:01:54.420> going<00:01:54.540> to

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
that that loss is really going to

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.780 
that that loss is really going to
motivate<00:01:54.780> us<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.170> play<00:01:56.009> extremely<00:01:56.250> well<00:01:56.490> this

one<00:02:09.690> seat<00:02:09.989> in<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.140> while<00:02:10.289> it's<00:02:10.560> like<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:11.069> mean

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
one seat in a while it's like I mean

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.820 
one seat in a while it's like I mean
let's<00:02:12.270> make<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.660> first<00:02:12.900> for<00:02:13.140> our<00:02:13.230> team<00:02:13.470> and

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
let's make it a first for our team and

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.230 
let's make it a first for our team and
all<00:02:14.100> right<00:02:14.850> and<00:02:15.180> so<00:02:16.020> you<00:02:16.080> two<00:02:16.470> have<00:02:17.010> Bonnie<00:02:17.970> or

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
all right and so you two have Bonnie or

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.360 
all right and so you two have Bonnie or
averaging<00:02:18.780> six<00:02:19.050> point<00:02:19.380> eight<00:02:19.650> points<00:02:20.190> per

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
averaging six point eight points per

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.810 
averaging six point eight points per
game<00:02:20.400> Taylor<00:02:21.030> 5.7<00:02:22.020> but<00:02:22.680> I<00:02:22.920> think<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.430> average

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
game Taylor 5.7 but I think the average

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.550 
game Taylor 5.7 but I think the average
of<00:02:24.240> points<00:02:24.570> per<00:02:24.720> game<00:02:24.750> is<00:02:25.140> not<00:02:25.290> really

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
of points per game is not really

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.290 
of points per game is not really
indicative<00:02:25.830> of<00:02:26.070> your<00:02:26.130> level<00:02:26.520> of<00:02:26.610> play<00:02:26.850> you<00:02:27.120> to

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
indicative of your level of play you to

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.600 
indicative of your level of play you to
last<00:02:28.200> year<00:02:28.530> we're<00:02:28.800> kind<00:02:29.130> of<00:02:29.160> three-point

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
last year we're kind of three-point

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.310 
last year we're kind of three-point
shooting<00:02:29.910> specialists<00:02:30.660> but<00:02:30.690> this<00:02:30.960> year<00:02:31.170> have

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
shooting specialists but this year have

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.870 
shooting specialists but this year have
been<00:02:31.350> so<00:02:31.620> aggressive<00:02:31.890> with<00:02:32.370> driving<00:02:32.640> the

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
been so aggressive with driving the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.960 
been so aggressive with driving the
basket<00:02:33.650> making<00:02:34.650> assists<00:02:35.160> getting<00:02:35.610> rebounds

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
basket making assists getting rebounds

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.730 
basket making assists getting rebounds
getting<00:02:36.780> in<00:02:36.870> there<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.260> being<00:02:37.530> aggressive

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
getting in there and being aggressive

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.800 
getting in there and being aggressive
what's<00:02:38.460> kind<00:02:38.670> of<00:02:38.820> changed<00:02:39.240> your<00:02:39.510> your

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
what's kind of changed your your

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.680 
what's kind of changed your your
mentality<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.680> enforce<00:02:41.550> this<00:02:41.940> difference<00:02:42.420> in

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
mentality and enforce this difference in

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.320 
mentality and enforce this difference in
style<00:02:42.960> of<00:02:43.140> play<00:02:43.350> this<00:02:43.560> year<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:44.160> think<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.120> lot<00:02:45.150> of

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
style of play this year I think a lot of

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.670 
style of play this year I think a lot of
it<00:02:45.510> is<00:02:45.720> being<00:02:46.020> a<00:02:46.170> year<00:02:46.320> older<00:02:46.380> and

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
it is being a year older and

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.030 
it is being a year older and
understanding<00:02:47.610> that<00:02:47.820> in<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:49.230> past<00:02:49.410> it's<00:02:49.770> kind

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
understanding that in the past it's kind

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.270 
understanding that in the past it's kind
of<00:02:50.100> been<00:02:50.250> easier<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.820> think<00:02:51.000> like<00:02:51.240> I<00:02:52.280> don't

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
of been easier to think like I don't

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.070 
of been easier to think like I don't
have<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:53.820> do<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:53.970> because<00:02:54.330> there's<00:02:54.690> someone

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
have to do that because there's someone

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.260 
have to do that because there's someone
who's<00:02:55.380> kind<00:02:55.680> of<00:02:55.830> taken<00:02:56.130> that<00:02:56.160> role<00:02:56.490> on<00:02:56.730> of<00:02:57.060> like

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
who's kind of taken that role on of like

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.050 
who's kind of taken that role on of like
I<00:02:57.770> mean<00:02:58.770> we<00:02:58.890> had<00:02:59.010> Tony<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.520> stuff<00:02:59.700> like<00:02:59.820> going

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
I mean we had Tony and stuff like going

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.170 
I mean we had Tony and stuff like going
the<00:03:00.150> basket<00:03:00.510> we<00:03:00.600> are<00:03:00.720> kind<00:03:00.959> of<00:03:01.080> not<00:03:01.820> look<00:03:02.820> to<00:03:03.030> to

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
the basket we are kind of not look to to

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.670 
the basket we are kind of not look to to
do<00:03:03.300> that<00:03:03.510> now<00:03:03.810> this<00:03:04.110> year<00:03:04.290> it's<00:03:04.440> kind<00:03:04.620> of

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
do that now this year it's kind of

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.740 
do that now this year it's kind of
changed<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.100> little<00:03:05.220> bit<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.760> but<00:03:06.420> I<00:03:06.450> think

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
changed a little bit and but I think

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.480 
changed a little bit and but I think
especially<00:03:07.170> for<00:03:07.620> me<00:03:07.709> it's<00:03:07.860> just<00:03:07.980> like<00:03:08.160> being<00:03:08.370> a

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
especially for me it's just like being a

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.670 
especially for me it's just like being a
year<00:03:08.580> older<00:03:08.640> and<00:03:09.080> working<00:03:10.080> with<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.290> system

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
year older and working with the system

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.210 
year older and working with the system
and<00:03:11.010> knowing<00:03:11.400> how<00:03:11.520> everything<00:03:11.910> goes<00:03:12.980> yeah<00:03:13.980> I

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
and knowing how everything goes yeah I

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.449 
and knowing how everything goes yeah I
think<00:03:14.280> that<00:03:14.670> oh<00:03:15.740> sorry<00:03:16.740> all<00:03:16.980> teams<00:03:17.190> looking

think that oh sorry all teams looking

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.449 
think that oh sorry all teams looking
behind<00:03:17.640> them<00:03:18.019> um<00:03:19.019> we've<00:03:19.950> been<00:03:19.980> working<00:03:20.220> really

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
behind them um we've been working really

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.960 
behind them um we've been working really
hard<00:03:20.580> in<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.820> offseason<00:03:21.739> we<00:03:22.739> we<00:03:23.640> were<00:03:23.790> both

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
hard in the offseason we we were both

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.520 
hard in the offseason we we were both
injured<00:03:24.180> over<00:03:24.600> last<00:03:24.780> summer<00:03:25.050> and<00:03:25.260> so<00:03:25.380> I<00:03:25.410> think

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
injured over last summer and so I think

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.900 
injured over last summer and so I think
that<00:03:25.830> getting<00:03:25.950> back<00:03:26.190> out<00:03:26.370> on<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.519> core<00:03:26.760> at<00:03:26.850> the

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
that getting back out on the core at the

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.610 
that getting back out on the core at the
beginning<00:03:27.150> of<00:03:27.239> season<00:03:27.450> was<00:03:27.780> really<00:03:28.320> important

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
beginning of season was really important

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.680 
beginning of season was really important
to<00:03:28.680> us<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:29.040> we<00:03:29.100> wanted<00:03:29.670> we<00:03:29.970> are<00:03:30.120> so<00:03:30.300> excited<00:03:30.450> to

to us and we wanted we are so excited to
play<00:03:30.810> again<00:03:30.989> cuz<00:03:31.110> we<00:03:31.170> haven't<00:03:31.350> played<00:03:31.470> in<00:03:31.590> so

play again cuz we haven't played in so
long<00:03:31.739> and<00:03:32.070> I<00:03:32.880> think<00:03:33.120> that<00:03:33.269> as<00:03:33.690> ty<00:03:33.959> said<00:03:34.200> being

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
long and I think that as ty said being

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.290 
long and I think that as ty said being
juniors<00:03:34.709> we<00:03:35.130> have<00:03:35.400> a<00:03:35.430> lot<00:03:35.580> more<00:03:35.670> confidence<00:03:36.120> we

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300
