00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:06.939
 Hi, I'm investment 3 and I'm going to teach you 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:09.400
 the best zombie nexus trick of call of 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:11.860
 Duty advanced warfare is a very game 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.800
 easy that we need it with cheese 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.869
 we need not have the exoskeleton 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.269
 we just need to open the first door 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.820
 is worth the one that takes us to the central area 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:24.220
 and in it then get on the part of 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.230
 up to get on top of what they would be 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.970
 the desks and already throw us a little 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.310
 back behind what would be the 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.290
 screens there are so that there we do not 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.540
 give the zombies 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.120
 They infected either give us if 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.730
 we throw grenades does not touch us either and 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.450
 well, it 's a very easy way to 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.670
 get many points and pass rounds 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.430
 what is the good thing about this trick that you can 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.800
 get almost all the achievements of the mode 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.070
 exact bis for 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.040
 like wheat or what is Ã¡lex 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:00.120
 what kill 10 zombies in 30 seconds 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:03.080
 because if we get a good urgency that 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.630
 from there we can support the zombies 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.180
 the one of 'the one to pass diego ronda goes to 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.610
 survive 10 rounds I'm alive the 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.619
 rich man who is having more is going to have 15 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.030
 thousand credits in the bank and with these 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.759
 15,000 then you can get the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.670
 next achievement that is doing 15 15 times 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.039

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.360
 we can also get the one from 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:27.960
 survivor who is surviving 20 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.670
 rounds there are 25 rounds and the one of 2020 that 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.979

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.640
 we can improve the weapons at level 20 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.440

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.700
