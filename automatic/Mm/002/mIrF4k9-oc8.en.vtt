 but more important if I saw the future 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.580
 would take advantage of that opportunity or it would be 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.020
 just another missed opportunity 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.630

 started the property that should have 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.260
 bought the opportunity that should not have

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.690
 once in each decade something big 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.420

 social networks took the planet the 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.900
 people who were well positioned 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.090
 in the eighties they became 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.100
 millionaire people who knew 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.830
 take advantage of the nineties is also 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.210
 they made millions you believe that 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.210
 will happen in the following years 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.960
 in his successful books the next three 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.220
 Lyon and the one 2 revolution the famous 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.890
 economist 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.570
 the being says that in this decade a 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.000
 trillion of additional dollars in the 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.900
 USA will be dedicated to the industry of 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.940
 health 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.770
 providing people with products and 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.140
 health services that make them feel 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.910
 well that products look better than 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.400
 stop their aging and that 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.980
 prevent diseases think about 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.560
 this the sale of healthy products does not 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.690
 there were two decades ago those sales 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.330
 produce about 300 million 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.950
 annual dollars almost the same figure of 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.459
 what people spend on buying 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.740
 cars in the usa today are 300 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.560
 trillions of dollars a year and at the end of 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.410
 this decade will be a trillion dollars or 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.790
 be a billion dollars a year for 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.910
 those that we like a lot of the 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.280
 mathematics this is a growth of the 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.980
 300% how is this kind of possible 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.130
 growth how can you predict that 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.560
 growth only two words baby 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.960
 boomer is to say those people who 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.150
 they were born between the years of 1946 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.700
 64 they have been directing our 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.110
 economy for more than 20 years does not believe that 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.390
 it's the right time for you 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.460
 also get some of this 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.530
 the baby boomers are now in their 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.420
 forty and fifty years old when

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.720
 purchasing 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.790
 they are 50 percent of our 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.190
 domestic product but much more than 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.080
 that the baby boomers are about to add 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.970
 one trillion dollars a year for 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.070

 anti-aging health wellness 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.970
 that's the next big opportunity 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.099
 by taking control of their lives where 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.989
 we live are creating a revolution in 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:58.010
 the welfare industry and that's 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.010
 happening fast 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.880
 look at the changes that usually 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.700
 happened for decades now will happen 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.190
 in a few years or less 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.160
 when henry Ford invented the model t in 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.080
 1908 took the industry 70 years 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.989
 automotive become a business of 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.750
 a trillion dollars when ibm debuted 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.940
 his first computer in 1981 took him 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.040
 only 10 years to pass on sales to the 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.840
 automotive industry and become like that 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.270
 in a trillion industry of 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.040
 dollars today the health industry and 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.200
 welfare will only need the 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.090
 following five years to arrive and 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.419
 surpass that figure of the trillion of 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.419
 Dollars 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:43.360
 that's 2.7 million every day 114 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.220
 million every hour 1 million 900 thousand each 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.540
 minute 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.060
 eleconomista skin be tells you that the 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.400
 following five years in the USA there will be 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.690
 3.6 million new families that are 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.700
 they will make millions 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.720
 most working on a candy of the 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.550
 health or wellness 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.140
 what will you do to get some 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.480
 profit of this industry 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.580
 let's see four options 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.530
 as a worker the doctors 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.150
 Chiropractors and masseurs could 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.280
 make fortunes in the coming years 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.990
 clear if they have how to pay for their 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.090
 study if they have how to avoid 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.270
 demands and if you can first invest 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.890
 time and then wait for the money 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.930
 another option would be to be a manufacturer that is 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.700
 an excellent business that if you have 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.400
 several million to invest first in 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:29.390
 infrastructure patents research and 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.390
 in the shipment of merchandise 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.400
 how about selling to the public very clear 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.380
 good but you will have to pay rent to 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.220
 Safe employees work seven days a 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.930
 week 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.350
 invest in advertising and have many 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.350
 headaches 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.560
 exact distribution the new 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.360
 millionaires were made in the delivery of 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.540
 products because they found new way 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.700
 to distribute things 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.890
 people like sam walton from walmart 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.330
 offers federal express smith the new 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.790
 millionaire of this decade in the 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.260
 distribution will make their fortunes 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.360
 delivering things to people who can 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.680
 buy more easily and quickly and 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.660
 more economical 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.660

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.460
 amazon and netflix travelocity and toads 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.530
 they made their fortunes by educating 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.660
 consumers about new products 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.430

 better products better distribution and 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.020
 best opportunity 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.180
