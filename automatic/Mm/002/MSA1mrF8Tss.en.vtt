00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
want to do is take your pattern pieces

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.830 
want to do is take your pattern pieces
there's<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.490> pattern<00:00:18.029> piece<00:00:18.330> for<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.660> door

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
there's a pattern piece for the door

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.590 
there's a pattern piece for the door
hanger<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.470> for<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.580> feathers<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.270> for<00:00:21.510> the

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
hanger and for the feathers and for the

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.870 
hanger and for the feathers and for the
other<00:00:21.720> two<00:00:22.020> pieces<00:00:22.410> on<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.680> turkey<00:00:23.039> I'm<00:00:23.670> going

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
other two pieces on the turkey I'm going

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.310 
other two pieces on the turkey I'm going
to<00:00:23.939> trace<00:00:24.210> around<00:00:24.510> those<00:00:24.779> with<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.109> pencil

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
to trace around those with the pencil

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.560 
to trace around those with the pencil
and<00:00:26.660> because<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.840> foam<00:00:28.080> has<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:29.570> springy

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
and because the foam has a springy

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.830 
and because the foam has a springy
surface<00:00:31.140> when<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.380> put<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.769> when<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.840> trace

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
surface when you put the when you trace

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.780 
surface when you put the when you trace
around<00:00:34.170> with<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.500> pencil<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:35.010> will<00:00:35.130> indent<00:00:35.610> a

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
around with the pencil it will indent a

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.880 
around with the pencil it will indent a
little<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.149> it's<00:00:36.300> real<00:00:36.450> easy<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.840> see<00:00:37.110> even<00:00:37.320> if

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
little so it's real easy to see even if

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.810 
little so it's real easy to see even if
you're<00:00:38.040> using<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.430> pencil<00:00:38.640> on<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> dark<00:00:39.270> color<00:00:40.820> so

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
you're using a pencil on a dark color so

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.810 
you're using a pencil on a dark color so
I'll<00:00:41.910> trace<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.590> then<00:00:43.590> I'll<00:00:43.739> trace<00:00:44.040> out<00:00:44.370> I've

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
I'll trace that then I'll trace out I've

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.660 
I'll trace that then I'll trace out I've
got<00:00:45.329> two<00:00:45.660> here<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.110> orange<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.219> red<00:00:47.460> and

got two here in orange to in red and
I'll<00:00:47.760> do<00:00:47.940> two<00:00:48.120> more<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.480> yellow<00:00:48.750> also<00:00:49.680> do<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
I'll do two more in yellow also do the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.220 
I'll do two more in yellow also do the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
feet and the waddle and then cut these

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.990 
feet and the waddle and then cut these
out<00:00:52.820> now<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> tip<00:00:54.149> about<00:00:54.270> cutting<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.760> go<00:00:56.760> in

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
out now a tip about cutting is to go in

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.080 
out now a tip about cutting is to go in
from<00:00:57.390> an<00:00:57.570> edge<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.230> cut<00:00:58.920> straight<00:00:59.370> down<00:00:59.430> as

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
from an edge and cut straight down as

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.330 
from an edge and cut straight down as
you<00:01:00.539> can<00:01:00.660> see<00:01:00.840> I'm<00:01:01.050> cutting<00:01:01.500> away<00:01:01.649> from<00:01:02.129> myself

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
you can see I'm cutting away from myself

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.030 
you can see I'm cutting away from myself
now<00:01:03.329> if<00:01:03.539> you're<00:01:03.719> cutting<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.110> small<00:01:04.470> piece<00:01:04.769> it's

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
now if you're cutting a small piece it's

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.270 
now if you're cutting a small piece it's
easier<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.519> cut<00:01:05.760> towards<00:01:06.360> yourself<00:01:07.130> and<00:01:08.130> we'll

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
easier to cut towards yourself and we'll

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.250 
easier to cut towards yourself and we'll
just<00:01:08.460> trim<00:01:08.790> around<00:01:08.909> another<00:01:09.780> thing<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.110> might

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
special glue that's just made for this

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.959 
special glue that's just made for this
foam<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.530> way<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.740> apply<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.579> because

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
foam and the way you apply it is because

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.670 
foam and the way you apply it is because
this<00:01:57.119> foam<00:01:57.390> has<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.659> finish<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.290> this<00:01:58.439> has<00:01:58.649> a

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
this foam has a finish and this has a

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.959 
this foam has a finish and this has a
finish<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.549> want<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.880> apply<00:02:00.409> adhesive<00:02:01.939> to<00:02:02.939> the

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
finish you want to apply adhesive to the

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.060 
finish you want to apply adhesive to the
piece<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.659> you're<00:02:03.990> working<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.920> you're

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
piece that you're working that you're

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.130 
piece that you're working that you're
applying<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:08.479> then<00:02:09.479> let<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.690> spread<00:02:09.989> around

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
applying and then let it spread around

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.470 
applying and then let it spread around
but<00:02:10.770> you<00:02:10.860> actually<00:02:11.099> let<00:02:11.580> that<00:02:11.760> dry<00:02:12.090> for<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.420> few

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
but you actually let that dry for a few

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.400 
but you actually let that dry for a few
seconds

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
seconds

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.140 
seconds
then<00:02:13.710> this<00:02:13.950> is<00:02:14.100> going<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.310> go<00:02:14.460> in<00:02:14.580> place<00:02:14.850> right

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
then this is going to go in place right

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.460 
then this is going to go in place right
here<00:02:15.180> so<00:02:15.540> I'm<00:02:15.630> going<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.810> put<00:02:16.020> a<00:02:16.050> little<00:02:16.260> on

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
here so I'm going to put a little on

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.270 
here so I'm going to put a little on
this<00:02:16.680> as<00:02:16.890> well<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:18.710> you<00:02:19.710> would<00:02:19.830> actually<00:02:20.160> let

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
this as well and you would actually let

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.250 
this as well and you would actually let
it<00:02:20.430> dry<00:02:20.610> for<00:02:20.640> 10<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.120> 15<00:02:21.240> seconds<00:02:21.960> but<00:02:22.110> I'm

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
it dry for 10 to 15 seconds but I'm

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.720 
it dry for 10 to 15 seconds but I'm
going<00:02:22.410> to<00:02:22.470> put<00:02:22.770> it<00:02:22.890> right<00:02:23.070> down<00:02:23.130> so<00:02:23.460> you<00:02:23.580> can

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
going to put it right down so you can

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.570 
going to put it right down so you can
see<00:02:23.940> how<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.120> goes<00:02:24.420> on<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:25.100> what<00:02:26.100> this<00:02:26.220> will<00:02:26.280> do

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
see how it goes on and what this will do

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.300 
see how it goes on and what this will do
is<00:02:26.610> form<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.240> real<00:02:27.540> tight<00:02:27.960> bond<00:02:28.290> right<00:02:29.010> now<00:02:29.250> you

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
is form a real tight bond right now you

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.980 
is form a real tight bond right now you
can<00:02:29.640> move<00:02:29.790> it<00:02:29.970> slightly<00:02:30.210> to<00:02:30.450> get<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:30.840> in<00:02:30.960> place

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
can move it slightly to get it in place

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.370 
can move it slightly to get it in place
but<00:02:31.560> after<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.100> dries<00:02:32.340> it'll<00:02:32.640> be<00:02:32.880> secure<00:02:33.540> then

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
but after it dries it'll be secure then

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.220 
but after it dries it'll be secure then
we<00:02:34.530> put<00:02:34.800> our<00:02:35.100> feet<00:02:35.610> on<00:02:35.670> its<00:02:36.000> bottom<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:36.660> then
