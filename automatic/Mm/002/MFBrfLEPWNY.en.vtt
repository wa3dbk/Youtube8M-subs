i<00:00:31.380> need<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.619> do<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:32.009> load<00:00:32.669> up<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.850> boot<00:00:33.030> our

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
i need to do is load up the boot our

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:42.049 
i need to do is load up the boot our
software<00:00:33.980> and<00:00:34.980> plugging<00:00:35.550> into<00:00:35.670> device<00:00:41.059> then

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
software and plugging into device then

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.160 
software and plugging into device then
you<00:00:42.149> just<00:00:42.270> need<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.450> click<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.780> root<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.140> root

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
you just need to click and root the root

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.830 
you just need to click and root the root
button<00:00:43.500> plan<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.980> process<00:00:44.250> begins<00:00:44.840> so

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
button plan the process begins so

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.510 
button plan the process begins so
firstly<00:00:46.110> root<00:00:46.530> our<00:00:46.739> checks<00:00:47.070> all<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.250> vital

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
firstly root our checks all the vital

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.220 
firstly root our checks all the vital
statistics<00:00:48.090> like<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.570> software<00:00:48.989> version

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
statistics like the software version

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.540 
statistics like the software version
baseband<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.950> see<00:00:50.160> if<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.309> device<00:00:50.489> is

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
baseband to see if the device is

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.880 
baseband to see if the device is
rootable<00:00:51.199> and<00:00:53.840> then<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:55.050> prepares<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
rootable and then it prepares the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.189 
rootable and then it prepares the
exploit<00:00:56.280> payment<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.820> sends<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.239> off<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.870> so

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
exploit payment and sends it off and so

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.420 
exploit payment and sends it off and so
the<00:00:58.320> payload<00:00:58.680> itself<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:59.100> actually<00:00:59.190> being

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
the payload itself is actually being

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.200 
the payload itself is actually being
sent<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.879> browser<00:01:00.030> vulnerability<00:01:02.210> so

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
sent to the browser vulnerability so

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.000 
sent to the browser vulnerability so
once<00:01:03.989> i<00:01:04.080> get<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.229> little<00:01:04.320> bit<00:01:04.500> better<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:04.860> i'm

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
once i get a little bit better this i'm

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.380 
once i get a little bit better this i'm
going<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.220> try<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.400> make<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.090> payload

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
going to try and make it so the payload

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.840 
going to try and make it so the payload
can<00:01:06.570> be<00:01:06.630> sent<00:01:06.840> directly<00:01:06.990> from<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.530> browser

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
can be sent directly from the browser

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.160 
can be sent directly from the browser
then<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.939> course<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.180> device<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.540> recent<00:01:09.900> just

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
then of course the device is recent just

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.899 
then of course the device is recent just
like<00:01:10.320> any<00:01:11.070> other<00:01:11.130> routing<00:01:11.490> system<00:01:11.760> but

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
like any other routing system but

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.760 
like any other routing system but
because<00:01:12.510> because<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.049> direct<00:01:13.409> nature<00:01:13.680> of

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
because because of the direct nature of

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.080 
because because of the direct nature of
this<00:01:13.890> it's<00:01:14.369> actually<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.670> little<00:01:14.729> bit<00:01:14.909> faster

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
this it's actually a little bit faster

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.030 
this it's actually a little bit faster
than<00:01:15.360> most<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.170> other<00:01:16.409> routes<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.890> we

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
than most of the other routes that we

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.370 
than most of the other routes that we
get<00:01:17.159> out<00:01:17.250> there

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.160 

and<00:01:24.670> finally<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:25.939> columns<00:01:26.390> rebooted<00:01:26.810> and<00:01:27.020> the

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
and finally the columns rebooted and the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.380 
and finally the columns rebooted and the
process<00:01:27.530> is<00:01:27.560> completed<00:01:28.130> all<00:01:28.969> in<00:01:29.119> less<00:01:29.299> than

process is completed all in less than
about<00:01:29.509> a<00:01:29.600> minute<00:01:34.539> okay<00:01:35.539> and<00:01:35.780> you<00:01:35.899> can<00:01:36.049> see<00:01:36.140> it's

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
about a minute okay and you can see it's

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:37.960 
about a minute okay and you can see it's
completed<00:01:36.590> and<00:01:37.009> my<00:01:37.159> phone<00:01:37.369> is<00:01:37.399> now<00:01:37.640> rooted
