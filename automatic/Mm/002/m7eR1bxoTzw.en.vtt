understand how frustrated I got when

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.120 
understand how frustrated I got when
everything<00:02:14.750> was<00:02:15.020> going<00:02:15.500> at<00:02:15.650> a<00:02:15.680> steady<00:02:15.800> speed

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
everything was going at a steady speed

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.920 
everything was going at a steady speed
limit<00:02:16.790> of<00:02:16.910> 55<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:17.450> then<00:02:17.900> shot<00:02:18.260> into<00:02:18.890> 89<00:02:19.660> it<00:02:20.660> was

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
limit of 55 and then shot into 89 it was

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.070 
limit of 55 and then shot into 89 it was
like<00:02:21.140> everything<00:02:21.560> was<00:02:21.800> thrown<00:02:22.430> together

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
like everything was thrown together

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.420 
like everything was thrown together
which<00:02:24.080> is<00:02:24.110> very<00:02:24.410> different<00:02:24.710> from<00:02:25.070> a<00:02:25.220> book

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
which is very different from a book

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.010 
which is very different from a book

character which I can understand

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.080 
character which I can understand
especially<00:03:46.010> since<00:03:46.459> it's<00:03:46.610> part<00:03:46.760> of<00:03:46.790> a<00:03:46.880> trilogy
