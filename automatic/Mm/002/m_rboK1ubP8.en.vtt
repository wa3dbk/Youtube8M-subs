00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.200
 translated and voiced by some guy with 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.200
 train areas 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.809
 well, we have a great signal here 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.869
 here on it we give an example of what 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.240
 you can do with your f75 first i 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:24.259
 listen this is the first thing i do it listen 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.390
 listen to the sound signal is a good and sound 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.310
 then when you spend a few times 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.750
 on purpose you start to hear the changes 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.480
 addition to the interrupt at the beginning and end 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.019
 wiring ie it is uneven monochromatic 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.800
 whistle sometimes you hear such an iron 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:39.199
 grunting 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.180
 that is, it is such a border guard which 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.160
 sounds good on sometimes gives out good 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.530
 the numbers on the screen although you see that the numbers 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.399
 jump it's almost always iron I you 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:53.890
 I'll show you a little trick right now, but first 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.890
 impression alla good signal more 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:04.129
 sometimes you hear these woe liver know 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:08.270
 that there glands here is a little secret right 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:13.580
 75 top secret however not even 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:15.349
 I know if I can translate this and when 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.720
 you hear a signal like this and 

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:19.819
 suspect that it is iron, I think that 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.869
 this is it because the signal is 

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:25.310
 unstable numbers jump such a trick 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.410
 talk coil up and down like this 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.670
 on purpose 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.500
 an interesting device at the same time gives only 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.500
 trick or nothing at all then rather 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.099
 all the same with spear this target and 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.729
 let's see what is there yes here it is necessary 

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:39.729
 be careful 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:01.360
 Well, somehow so cool I'm iron 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.730
 the record is why we gave the device 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.720
 good signal but it is also a goal 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.580
 curved shape that's why the signal jumped 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.830
 impossible to carry out the coil equally 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.940
 on the purpose of the arcuate form such stops 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.310
 I will not jump numbers 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.830
 it is big therefore the figure shows 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.200
 high tusa broke it great 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.790
 An example of how we understand that there is iron 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.790
 downstairs and digging 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.170
 so what are questionable numbers 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.569
 jump interrupt tone changes in 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.750
 the beginning and end of the signal is sometimes iron 3 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.250
 years old 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.650
 babaeva move the coil up and down 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.330
 on purpose if you don't hear anything either 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.550
 there will be only grunting means rather 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.550
 just down there live iron
