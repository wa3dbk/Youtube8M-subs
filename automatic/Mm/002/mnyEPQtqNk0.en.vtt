00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
another quick look at some of these

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.149 
another quick look at some of these
anomalies<00:01:45.930> here<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.439> what<00:01:46.860> looks<00:01:47.009> like

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
anomalies here and what looks like

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.340 
anomalies here and what looks like
they're<00:01:47.579> also<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:48.000> be<00:01:48.180> some<00:01:48.540> something<00:01:49.200> that's

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
they're also to be some something that's

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.590 
they're also to be some something that's
been<00:01:49.500> blurred<00:01:49.740> out<00:01:49.920> by<00:01:50.130> NASA<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:51.149> right<00:01:51.390> here

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
been blurred out by NASA this right here

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.960 
been blurred out by NASA this right here
looks<00:01:51.810> like<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.990> big<00:01:52.229> circle<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.920> surely<00:01:53.790> does

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
looks like a big circle and surely does

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.910 
looks like a big circle and surely does
look<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.240> be<00:01:54.299> blurred<00:01:54.630> out<00:01:54.840> let<00:01:55.470> me<00:01:55.500> drop<00:01:55.740> the

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
look to be blurred out let me drop the

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.499 
look to be blurred out let me drop the
temperature<00:01:56.340> like<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.640> usually<00:01:56.820> do<00:01:57.180> on<00:01:57.360> these

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
temperature like I usually do on these

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.810 
temperature like I usually do on these
pictures<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.140> as<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.130> can<00:01:59.280> see<00:01:59.310> how<00:01:59.640> much

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
pictures and as you can see how much

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.670 
pictures and as you can see how much
more<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.240> stands<00:02:00.630> out<00:02:00.899> there

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
more that stands out there

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.890 
more that stands out there
and<00:02:01.800> now<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.640> want<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.270> go<00:02:03.360> ahead<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.660> bring<00:02:03.750> it

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
and now I want to go ahead and bring it

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.680 
and now I want to go ahead and bring it
into<00:02:04.020> Photoshop<00:02:04.680> real<00:02:04.950> quick<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.630> do<00:02:06.630> a

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
into Photoshop real quick and do a

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.630 
into Photoshop real quick and do a
couple<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.080> these<00:02:07.170> auto<00:02:07.590> tone<00:02:08.009> color

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
couple of these auto tone color

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.430 
couple of these auto tone color
basically<00:02:09.360> this<00:02:09.630> is<00:02:09.810> going<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.080> make

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
basically this is going to make

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.120 
basically this is going to make
photoshop<00:02:11.070> and<00:02:11.460> do<00:02:11.520> auto<00:02:11.670> color<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.390> makes<00:02:12.870> it

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
photoshop and do auto color and makes it

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.830 
photoshop and do auto color and makes it
like<00:02:14.130> we<00:02:14.400> should<00:02:14.610> see<00:02:14.820> it<00:02:15.300> basically<00:02:15.600> takes

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
like we should see it basically takes

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.530 
like we should see it basically takes
out<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.140> nasty<00:02:16.680> puke<00:02:17.490> heys<00:02:17.940> they<00:02:17.970> stick<00:02:18.510> in

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
out that nasty puke heys they stick in

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.410 
out that nasty puke heys they stick in
there<00:02:18.900> like<00:02:19.110> that<00:02:19.290> orange<00:02:19.770> color<00:02:20.310> let's<00:02:21.270> do

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
there like that orange color let's do

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.330 
there like that orange color let's do
auto<00:02:21.600> contrast<00:02:21.900> not<00:02:22.500> much<00:02:22.680> of<00:02:22.800> a<00:02:22.830> change<00:02:23.040> an

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
auto contrast not much of a change an

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.640 
auto contrast not much of a change an
auto<00:02:24.090> tone<00:02:24.510> not<00:02:24.840> much<00:02:25.050> a<00:02:25.080> little<00:02:25.320> bit<00:02:25.560> of

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
auto tone not much a little bit of

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.170 
auto tone not much a little bit of
change<00:02:25.920> there<00:02:26.190> now<00:02:26.370> let's<00:02:26.520> go<00:02:26.640> see<00:02:26.820> if<00:02:27.000> they

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
change there now let's go see if they

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.060 
change there now let's go see if they
now<00:02:27.360> see<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.690> rocks<00:02:27.930> they<00:02:28.260> pop<00:02:28.530> out<00:02:28.740> a<00:02:28.800> lot

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
now see the rocks they pop out a lot

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.860 
now see the rocks they pop out a lot
more<00:02:29.280> they<00:02:29.490> look<00:02:29.640> more<00:02:29.850> like<00:02:29.910> here<00:02:30.300> on<00:02:30.420> earth<00:02:30.630> I

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
more they look more like here on earth I

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.810 
more they look more like here on earth I
believe<00:02:31.650> this<00:02:31.800> is<00:02:31.860> more<00:02:32.220> what<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.459> looks<00:02:32.640> like

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
believe this is more what it looks like

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.570 
believe this is more what it looks like
now<00:02:33.120> look<00:02:34.050> at<00:02:34.200> this<00:02:34.380> wheel<00:02:34.739> type<00:02:35.100> thing<00:02:35.370> that's

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
now look at this wheel type thing that's

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.080 
now look at this wheel type thing that's
been<00:02:35.760> blurred<00:02:36.000> out<00:02:36.239> see<00:02:36.660> how<00:02:37.700> first<00:02:38.700> I'll<00:02:38.880> see

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
been blurred out see how first I'll see

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.729 
been blurred out see how first I'll see
this<00:02:39.239> anomaly<00:02:39.750> there<00:02:39.959> has<00:02:40.110> been<00:02:40.260> blurred<00:02:40.530> but

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
this anomaly there has been blurred but

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.350 
this anomaly there has been blurred but
check<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.190> out<00:02:41.220> see<00:02:41.730> how<00:02:41.760> they've<00:02:42.060> used<00:02:42.090> a

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
check that out see how they've used a

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.390 
check that out see how they've used a
blur<00:02:42.570> tool<00:02:42.870> on<00:02:43.110> it<00:02:43.260> this<00:02:43.440> was<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.680> circle<00:02:44.190> it

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
blur tool on it this was a circle it

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.310 
blur tool on it this was a circle it
looks<00:02:44.580> like<00:02:44.700> it's<00:02:44.880> even<00:02:45.150> standing<00:02:45.570> and<00:02:45.780> it's

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
looks like it's even standing and it's

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.350 
looks like it's even standing and it's
got<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.560> shadow<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:47.340> looks<00:02:47.550> like<00:02:47.610> a<00:02:47.730> wheel<00:02:48.030> there

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
got a shadow it looks like a wheel there

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.199 
got a shadow it looks like a wheel there
and<00:02:48.770> it's<00:02:49.770> been<00:02:49.980> blurred<00:02:50.250> out<00:02:50.459> for<00:02:50.730> sure<00:02:50.910> and

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
and it's been blurred out for sure and

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.060 
and it's been blurred out for sure and
then<00:02:51.660> up<00:02:51.840> here<00:02:51.870> let's<00:02:52.320> go<00:02:52.440> take<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.709> look<00:02:52.890> and

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
then up here let's go take a look and

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.370 
then up here let's go take a look and
see<00:02:53.130> if<00:02:53.250> we<00:02:53.400> can<00:02:53.580> find<00:02:53.730> our<00:02:53.910> little<00:02:54.150> guy<00:02:54.380> there

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
see if we can find our little guy there

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.949 
see if we can find our little guy there
is<00:02:55.590> right<00:02:55.890> there<00:02:56.239> now<00:02:57.239> let<00:02:57.450> me<00:02:57.480> do<00:02:57.690> something

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
is right there now let me do something

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.190 
is right there now let me do something
else<00:02:58.260> here<00:02:58.470> let's<00:02:58.980> do<00:02:59.160> this<00:02:59.340> let's<00:02:59.520> go<00:02:59.700> image

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
else here let's do this let's go image

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.460 
else here let's do this let's go image
crop<00:03:01.200> now<00:03:02.010> these<00:03:02.190> images<00:03:02.730> are<00:03:02.820> only<00:03:02.970> 72<00:03:03.840> like

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.570 

resolution<00:03:07.470> so<00:03:07.920> we're<00:03:08.130> going<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.310> it's<00:03:08.430> like

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
resolution so we're going to it's like

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.860 
resolution so we're going to it's like
pixels<00:03:08.940> per<00:03:09.120> inch<00:03:09.150> so<00:03:09.330> we're<00:03:09.510> going<00:03:09.600> to<00:03:09.690> move

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
pixels per inch so we're going to move

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.870 
pixels per inch so we're going to move
that<00:03:09.989> up<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.260> 300<00:03:10.830> which<00:03:11.310> is<00:03:11.489> just<00:03:11.700> going<00:03:11.790> to

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
that up to 300 which is just going to

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.610 
that up to 300 which is just going to
make<00:03:11.970> it<00:03:12.120> big<00:03:12.299> on<00:03:12.450> my<00:03:12.600> screen<00:03:12.930> see<00:03:13.320> now<00:03:13.440> that

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
make it big on my screen see now that

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.920 
make it big on my screen see now that
right<00:03:13.769> there<00:03:13.799> now<00:03:14.760> let's<00:03:15.000> get<00:03:15.150> it<00:03:15.299> to<00:03:15.420> 11

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
right there now let's get it to 11

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.210 
right there now let's get it to 11
hundred<00:03:16.019> percent<00:03:16.530> this<00:03:16.650> is<00:03:16.860> a<00:03:16.890> hundred

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
hundred percent this is a hundred

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.810 
hundred percent this is a hundred
percent<00:03:17.340> now<00:03:17.790> on<00:03:18.060> this<00:03:18.150> 115<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.549> now<00:03:20.549> let's<00:03:20.700> do

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
percent now on this 115 and now let's do

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.340 
percent now on this 115 and now let's do
a<00:03:20.850> couple<00:03:21.209> things<00:03:21.239> here<00:03:21.540> let<00:03:21.810> me<00:03:21.870> adjust<00:03:21.989> the

take one more quick look at a couple of
these<00:04:14.670> other<00:04:14.849> anomalies<00:04:15.450> here<00:04:15.659> that<00:04:15.930> were

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
these other anomalies here that were

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.680 
these other anomalies here that were
just<00:04:16.229> two<00:04:16.500> sitting<00:04:16.829> here<00:04:16.979> a<00:04:17.009> thought<00:04:17.690> right

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
just two sitting here a thought right

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.319 
just two sitting here a thought right
here<00:04:18.930> look<00:04:19.139> to<00:04:19.320> be<00:04:19.500> a<00:04:19.739> nice<00:04:20.489> little<00:04:20.699> gash<00:04:21.030> out

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
here look to be a nice little gash out

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.350 
here look to be a nice little gash out
of<00:04:21.479> there<00:04:21.949> once<00:04:22.949> again<00:04:23.250> that<00:04:23.490> wheel<00:04:23.759> over<00:04:24.030> here

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
of there once again that wheel over here

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.830 
of there once again that wheel over here
without<00:04:24.630> this<00:04:24.930> wheel<00:04:25.229> object<00:04:25.800> has<00:04:25.949> me<00:04:26.220> very

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
without this wheel object has me very

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.360 
without this wheel object has me very
because<00:04:27.840> it<00:04:27.990> looks<00:04:28.139> like<00:04:28.199> it<00:04:28.410> has<00:04:28.590> see<00:04:29.250> where

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
because it looks like it has see where

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.920 
because it looks like it has see where
they<00:04:29.430> use<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.699> blur<00:04:29.880> tool<00:04:30.150> once<00:04:30.389> on<00:04:30.599> you<00:04:30.780> could

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
they use the blur tool once on you could

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.330 
they use the blur tool once on you could
tell<00:04:31.080> us<00:04:31.199> when<00:04:31.349> use<00:04:31.530> because<00:04:31.680> it's<00:04:31.889> perfect

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
tell us when use because it's perfect

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.170 
tell us when use because it's perfect
there<00:04:32.580> it<00:04:33.150> looks<00:04:33.360> like<00:04:33.449> it<00:04:33.690> even<00:04:33.840> had<00:04:34.199> a

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
there it looks like it even had a

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.430 
there it looks like it even had a
tentacles<00:04:36.180> or<00:04:36.360> something<00:04:36.690> coming<00:04:36.930> out<00:04:37.139> of<00:04:37.199> it

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
tentacles or something coming out of it

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.140 
tentacles or something coming out of it
I<00:04:37.620> wonder<00:04:38.190> if<00:04:38.250> that<00:04:38.400> was<00:04:38.550> something<00:04:38.699> a<00:04:38.880> lot<00:04:39.060> of

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
I wonder if that was something a lot of

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.430 
I wonder if that was something a lot of
they<00:04:39.240> blurred<00:04:39.509> out<00:04:39.690> not<00:04:40.080> one<00:04:40.199> hundred<00:04:40.259> percent

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
they blurred out not one hundred percent

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.950 
they blurred out not one hundred percent
sure<00:04:40.650> this<00:04:41.550> right<00:04:41.729> here<00:04:41.940> looks<00:04:42.419> like<00:04:42.509> it<00:04:42.810> was<00:04:42.900> a

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
sure this right here looks like it was a

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.070 
sure this right here looks like it was a
perfectly<00:04:43.500> carved<00:04:44.090> stone<00:04:45.090> or<00:04:45.539> something<00:04:45.570> and

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
perfectly carved stone or something and

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.350 
perfectly carved stone or something and
it<00:04:46.199> was<00:04:46.320> cut<00:04:46.650> directly

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.089 

let's<00:04:50.960> see<00:04:51.169> there's<00:04:51.379> one<00:04:51.620> a<00:04:51.650> couple<00:04:51.979> other

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:52.099 
let's see there's one a couple other

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:53.830 
let's see there's one a couple other
ones<00:04:52.189> on<00:04:52.460> here<00:04:52.610> I<00:04:52.639> saw<00:04:52.909> earlier<00:04:53.479> as<00:04:53.599> I<00:04:53.750> was
