00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
ridiculous love to do this like this but

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.320 
ridiculous love to do this like this but
I'm<00:00:22.560> like<00:00:22.710> I'm<00:00:23.070> not<00:00:23.130> really<00:00:23.400> sure<00:00:23.670> how<00:00:24.180> about

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
I'm like I'm not really sure how about

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.660 
I'm like I'm not really sure how about
you<00:00:24.840> know<00:00:25.020> method<00:00:25.770> I<00:00:25.860> can<00:00:26.040> actually<00:00:26.160> show<00:00:26.610> you

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
you know method I can actually show you

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.880 
you know method I can actually show you
how<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.270> do<00:00:27.450> this<00:00:27.600> because<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:28.140> balls<00:00:28.560> all<00:00:28.770> of

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
how to do this because it balls all of

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.590 
how to do this because it balls all of
opening<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.370> closing<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:30.090> pretty<00:00:30.270> much<00:00:30.390> I'm

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:30.600 
opening and closing so pretty much I'm

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.979 
opening and closing so pretty much I'm
showing<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:30.900> guys<00:00:30.960> how<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.800> use<00:00:32.600> dxtory<00:00:33.600> with

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
showing you guys how to use dxtory with

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.200 
showing you guys how to use dxtory with
Call<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.379> Duty<00:00:34.770> ghosts<00:00:35.160> now<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.760> get<00:00:36.059> this

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
Call of Duty ghosts now to get this

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.180 
Call of Duty ghosts now to get this
working<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.780> absolutely<00:00:37.440> ridiculous

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
working is absolutely ridiculous

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.189 
working is absolutely ridiculous
now<00:00:38.640> there's<00:00:38.910> some<00:00:39.270> other<00:00:39.360> fixes<00:00:39.900> where<00:00:40.080> if

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
now there's some other fixes where if

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:43.490 
now there's some other fixes where if
you<00:00:40.260> have<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.620> point<00:00:41.300> dxtory<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.540> point<00:00:42.750> 0.133

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
you have to point dxtory to point 0.133

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.740 
you have to point dxtory to point 0.133
I<00:00:43.739> think<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.430> can<00:00:44.550> get<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:44.820> patch<00:00:45.120> but<00:00:45.630> then

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
I think you can get this patch but then

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.280 
I think you can get this patch but then
sometimes<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.530> shows<00:00:46.770> up<00:00:47.070> like<00:00:47.370> with<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.820> arm

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
sometimes it shows up like with the arm

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.840 
sometimes it shows up like with the arm
the<00:00:49.290> watermark<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.550> how<00:00:50.670> together

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
the watermark so this is how together

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.910 
the watermark so this is how together
working<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.480> any<00:00:51.690> version<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.500> at<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.770> moment

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
working of any version so at the moment

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.810 
working of any version so at the moment
I<00:00:53.220> have<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.670> XOR<00:00:54.059> version<00:00:54.590> 2.0<00:00:55.590> point<00:00:55.829> 1.2<00:00:56.399> my

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
I have the XOR version 2.0 point 1.2 my

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.069 
I have the XOR version 2.0 point 1.2 my
anyway<00:00:57.030> let's<00:00:57.210> get<00:00:57.329> straight<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.719> point

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
anyway let's get straight to the point

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.650 
anyway let's get straight to the point
so<00:00:58.350> pretty<00:00:58.559> much<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.950> do<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.280> you<00:01:00.180> have<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.510> go

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
so pretty much to do this you have to go

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.160 
so pretty much to do this you have to go
armed

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
armed

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.260 
armed
first<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.920> all<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.250> go<00:01:02.399> play<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:02.910> cliff<00:01:03.149> did

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
first of all you go play on cliff did

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.870 
first of all you go play on cliff did
you<00:01:03.360> guys<00:01:03.540> right<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.020> it<00:01:04.680> will<00:01:04.860> open<00:01:05.129> up<00:01:05.460> and

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
you guys right and it will open up and

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.170 
you guys right and it will open up and
then<00:01:06.390> um<00:01:06.780> once<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.680> open<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:07.979> up<00:01:08.160> first<00:01:08.610> once

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
then um once you open it up first once

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.870 
then um once you open it up first once
you<00:01:09.300> open<00:01:09.540> up<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:09.960> fraps<00:01:10.770> open<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.160> wall<00:01:11.369> so

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
you open up this fraps open this wall so

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.520 
you open up this fraps open this wall so
open<00:01:12.180> up<00:01:12.270> fraps<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.810> called<00:01:13.050> video<00:01:13.350> so

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
open up fraps and called video so

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.520 
open up fraps and called video so
obviously<00:01:14.330> so<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.360> know<00:01:15.630> while<00:01:15.869> some<00:01:16.260> you

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
obviously so you know while some you

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.770 
obviously so you know while some you
know<00:01:16.650> how<00:01:16.920> perhaps<00:01:17.100> open<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:18.119> perhaps<00:01:18.570> it's

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
know how perhaps open so perhaps it's

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.969 
know how perhaps open so perhaps it's
going<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:18.990> come<00:01:19.170> up<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.440> counter<00:01:19.710> should<00:01:19.860> be

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
going to come up the counter should be

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.770 
going to come up the counter should be
in<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.159> top<00:01:20.340> left<00:01:20.549> corner<00:01:20.760> of<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.909> screen<00:01:21.119> see

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
in the top left corner of the screen see

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.750 
in the top left corner of the screen see
how<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.080> fat<00:01:22.320> arm<00:01:22.530> it's<00:01:22.799> open<00:01:23.040> there<00:01:23.220> now<00:01:23.700> you

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
how the fat arm it's open there now you

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.609 
how the fat arm it's open there now you
have<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.240> have<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.570> game<00:01:24.750> in<00:01:24.990> windowed<00:01:25.229> mode

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
have to have the game in windowed mode

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.800 
have to have the game in windowed mode
by<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.890> way<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.610> window<00:01:26.970> didn't<00:01:27.299> know<00:01:27.360> Botha

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
by the way so window didn't know Botha

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.960 
by the way so window didn't know Botha
so<00:01:28.140> it's<00:01:28.290> still<00:01:28.470> pretty<00:01:28.530> much<00:01:28.740> full<00:01:29.010> screen<00:01:29.340> by

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
so it's still pretty much full screen by

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.670 
so it's still pretty much full screen by
just<00:01:30.299> windows<00:01:30.659> no-boil<00:01:31.020> now<00:01:31.290> which<00:01:31.470> one<00:01:31.590> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
just windows no-boil now which one the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.380 
just windows no-boil now which one the
Division<00:01:31.890> one<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.070> whole<00:01:32.220> tap<00:01:32.490> out<00:01:32.790> but<00:01:33.330> they

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
Division one the whole tap out but they

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.690 
Division one the whole tap out but they
go<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.659> fraps<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.650> want<00:01:34.830> the<00:01:34.920> clothes<00:01:35.280> for

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
go the fraps you want the clothes for

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.300 
go the fraps you want the clothes for
apps<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.689> close<00:01:36.990> you're<00:01:37.140> right<00:01:37.260> there<00:01:37.530> are<00:01:37.890> and

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
apps so close you're right there are and

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.600 
apps so close you're right there are and
then<00:01:38.549> now<00:01:38.760> you<00:01:38.820> want<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.360> go<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.689> desktop<00:01:40.610> you

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
then now you want to go to desktop you

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.050 
then now you want to go to desktop you
want<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.880> open<00:01:42.119> up<00:01:42.479> at<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.900> X<00:01:43.170> Torre<00:01:43.729> like<00:01:44.729> that

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
want to open up at the X Torre like that

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.920 
want to open up at the X Torre like that
yes<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.430> then<00:01:47.430> if<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.880> might<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.150> X<00:01:48.479> or<00:01:48.720> should

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
yes and then if I might the X or should

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.490 
yes and then if I might the X or should
start<00:01:49.200> playing<00:01:49.470> in<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.950> top<00:01:50.130> left-hand

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
start playing in the top left-hand

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.590 
start playing in the top left-hand
corner<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.740> screen<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.090> there<00:01:54.570> you

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
corner of the screen like that there you

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.260
