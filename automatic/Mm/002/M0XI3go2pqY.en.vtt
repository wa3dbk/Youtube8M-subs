00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:09.179
 Hello friends with you and you and 921 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.549
 today we'll talk about pc 1c 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.740
 This is a German light tank of the third level 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.320
 a unique machine is just a beast 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.119
 the car has recently been a stock with everyone there 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.429
 fivefold experience yes it was pretty 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.560
 a long time ago and the fight just lied to me but 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:24.359
 yet how not to ride on any here 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.279
 such here and the little things when for 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.750
 it also gives fivefold experience 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.179
 I can not resist and periodically 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.460
 what time do these stocks drive the same 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.750
 just a holiday not tanks once again decided 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.540
 tell you about him because 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.160
 surely somebody about him yes not 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.750
 knows though I think that as much as possible 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.610
 he doesn't know because he is dating 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.130
 almost immediately appeared in the game 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.750
 quite a long time and a unique tank of course 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.370
 but I know that there are a lot of players who 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.500
 recently start the game and about that 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.200
 Heard not heard probably and he is true 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.270
 super car that we have here super 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.650
 first crazy machine gun such a 2 in 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:03.090
 the game does not have him in the cage in the store 5 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:06.840
 8 cassettes each in total 40 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.000
 just a barrage of fire 40 shells crashes 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.390
 out of it at a speed well very quickly you 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.880
 you see 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.679
 why just out of something is it all that 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.770
 more or less kept us in sight 

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:18.990
 for a while dies swiftly and in 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.509
 this is his greatest merit 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.969
 Of course this tank and then it does not 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.460
 only in this unique comrades he is still 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:28.799
 and the gun down to as much as 10 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.259
 maximum speed he has the highest in 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.719
 the game 79 then meters an hour there is no such second 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.090
 the truth is he himself is gaining and and not very much 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:38.549
 willingly even needed too big 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.990
 the distance i'm here maneuvering yes and 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.729
 In general, Himmelsdorf, we do not about 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.069
 maximum plot speed target city 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.560
 no special well, as if there are but enemies there 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:48.899
 no, but there are enemies here and you fly into it 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.450
 here are swarms and just cut them off on 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.409
 the left and the right of all these comrades 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.749
 mobility dynamics we have here 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.569
 twenty two and three horses per tonne what 

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:59.999
 also very much shorter than the truth 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:02.550
 the tank is unique and unique above all 

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:04.650
 all but one 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.840
 moment from moment is called the level of battles 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.390
 throws it even before peter therefore 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.090
 let's say all that fun which 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.320
 provided in the top in the top battles 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.870
 list with threes 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.570
 it completely disappears 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.220
 when you fight already at the bottom of the list with 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.830
 the fives himself is already very difficult for someone 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.710
 punch give a machine gun has crazy 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.200
 single damage on average 8 rarely at 9 and 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.030
 token but very low 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.580
 armor penetration which is not so you just 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.740
 take advantage of playing at the bottom of the list of everything 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.720
 only some kind of pathetic 33 millimeters 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.030
 armor penetration here subcaliber 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.400
 he 43 punch 10 millimeters more 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.490
 he himself is still short here in places where 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.840
 could this gun have split 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.090
 splitting up just waiting not 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.280
 lack of growth and forced and here 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.200
 go around our allies while that whole 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.660
 batch in the show as something actively were cut 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.850
 to enemies and i'm left alone with 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.170
 I know with this gun that alpha is not a hundred with 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.790
 one shot I will not kill you 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.920
 I want to get something, I'm waiting for what can 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.990
 be back and kill for now 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.820
 before going back I already take away anything 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.890
 I myself will not stay 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.060
 get the hell out how they tank 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.360
 boards for what they get 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.720
 sure of the tower well the matter remains 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.140
 small 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.959
 in general, of course, any battle on pc 1c in 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.080
 at the top of the list it's like you're playing 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.780
 the plane he swiftly flies just 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.930
 barrage all makes and demolishes 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.400
 This is awesome adore let 1c and this we with 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.709
 you today are watching the first fight right now 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.630
 see another bottle is also not 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.510
 less hilarious but here it will end altogether 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.360
 everything is just ridiculous i think one hippie 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.489
 medium right now I'm on the move to heal 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.989
 and just study it with him there 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:47.610
 home and think he was waiting for me 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.920
 the only enemies around here around 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.110
 He apparently can not break you 18 me 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.030
 waited like sadness didn't end 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.200
 all positive on my next 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.200
 let's see what will happen 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.570
 your desire to fly and shoot at 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.240
 to the relay is realizable on pc very much 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.550
 note down from the hill and already 80 meters 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.250
 at one o'clock we hardly any other tank so 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.720
 almost never overclock 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.090
 what the main thing is not on such a cat 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.950
 fly into it not to show your 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.410
 harp because you know that speed 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.480
 Is any one so small 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.270
 roughness on the way she is already capable 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.710
 I'll run off the trail in general, I fly into my pants 1 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.660
 since none of the enemies here are 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.120
 it turned out that in the first row all my places 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.250
 immediately take better places 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.680
 I go uphill knowing that the enemy is 2 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.080
 brown tusks are necessary 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.480
 somehow be ready for this and i'm here 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.760
 you know, even on the go a couple of times 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.100
 get to try the enemy and here already 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.930
 all effects can be simply all 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.390
 shoot them why am I showing you 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.550
 video on this seems to be like that but 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.010
 some lit sandy tank because 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.500
 what is our game so good they 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.120
 there are good tanks there is not very so 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.370
 good tanks they should be for everyone 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.070
 in the garage on a good sled ride 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.229
 nice nice tanks are usually good 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.840
 so that pump out anything on them 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:14.320
 nice in one pleasure regret 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.630
 pc 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.940
 nothing much too long pump out 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.970
 I have everything usually takes a very 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.890
 little time and for that reason I ride 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.700
 on it just to fly 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.150
 to pound 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.220
 one pleasure fight in the top when in battle 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.560
 with the fives, then as a rule such a video 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.720
 Such a battle video does not fall because 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.940
 most often well at best there is nothing 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.560
 especially strong you will not do at 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.020
 some kind of pro already very strong 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.150
 Naguiba there more often does not occur but the top 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.250
 list is just a holiday which 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.690
 comes here now don't need 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.180
 some kind of premier tanchik to buy for 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.890
 order to have a holiday right now and 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.169
 here is all pcc needs 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:56.080
 worth pennies pumped out 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:57.400
 literally there in 2 3 in two three fights on 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.140
 some kind of friend there 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.300
 I remember the previous danchik in general all this 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:04.060
 done quickly rapidly and with 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.950
 iwangaya just so everything is just why 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.450
 deny myself why should I ride 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.700
 him when you can drive on it 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.860
 even now I see that before that this 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.410
 standing for whom and then immediately rush to the attack 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.020
 and not stopping for a second we learn 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.870
 simply 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:20.180
 he with a top bend and fly just here 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.069
 real plane they are so important here 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.830
 understand that in some enemies 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:27.530
 principles are held strategies are not 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.930
 move and everything goes but how do you see 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.280
 not everyone has it for some 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.310
 truth passes but with it and 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:37.159
 their life near the guitar passes bt-7 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.990
 I think now is great just and so far 

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:40.669
 he begins to unfold to me i 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.979
 they start punching they are unlucky 

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:45.259
 3 bullets did not have literally four 

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:47.630
 Okay, to destroy the water and here I am 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:49.490
 found himself in a delicate situation he did not 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:52.220
 kill the commander I immediately repaired him 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:54.250
 because I will remind you of the pcc case 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.599
 so extensive that there are only two 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.970
 beds if your one member 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:07:01.370
 crew kills if it will be a misfortune 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.259
 commander tones the course a lot there not 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.479
 hold on immediately starts recharging 

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:07.759
 slower and do everything else worse 

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:10.130
 therefore, you need to repair it quickly as well 

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:13.219
 also for the reason that killing the second 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:15.199
 your crew member is immediately considered a tank 

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:18.110
 destroyed already even if hp remained 

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:21.500
 ability to play does not remain you see 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:24.110
 just just flew like a summer wind 

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.460
 and all the leaves washed away that were there 

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.560
 the number and brown with large 

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.380
 I will gladly destroy all that remains 

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:33.229
 only eat the remnants that are in the corners 

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:36.740
 smeared and that's all amazing 

00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:38.840
 pcc tank ride it explores it 

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:41.870
 it's all done just cheap and cheerful 

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.440
 and get unlimited fun 

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:45.110
 which 

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:47.630
 and carries this tank why ride 

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:50.060
 all there cacti suffer and suffer 

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:52.430
 when there is such a wonderful abundance 

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.479
 in the game about it was a video and thank you all 

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.550
 who looked
