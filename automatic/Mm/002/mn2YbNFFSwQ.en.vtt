can<00:01:21.689> enjoy<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.650> lush<00:01:22.890> green<00:01:23.159> grasses<00:01:23.549> as<00:01:23.640> you

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
can enjoy the lush green grasses as you

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.240 
can enjoy the lush green grasses as you
see<00:01:23.909> here<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.330> pasture<00:01:24.600> well<00:01:25.590> build<00:01:25.830> how

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
see here in this pasture well build how

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.649 
see here in this pasture well build how
are<00:01:26.310> we<00:01:26.520> going<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.790> start<00:01:27.030> taking<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.390> soil

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
are we going to start taking the soil

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.359 
are we going to start taking the soil
sample<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.140> what<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.470> have<00:01:28.740> here<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.159> have<00:01:29.189> a

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
sample so what I have here is I have a

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.859 
sample so what I have here is I have a
soil<00:01:29.729> probe<00:01:30.060> but<00:01:30.210> if<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.360> don't<00:01:30.509> have<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.630> soil

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
soil probe but if you don't have a soil

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.719 
soil probe but if you don't have a soil
probe<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.439> can<00:01:31.590> use<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.799> garden<00:01:32.310> Spade<00:01:32.549> or<00:01:32.700> a

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
probe you can use a garden Spade or a

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:33.890 
probe you can use a garden Spade or a
shovel<00:01:32.970> what<00:01:33.240> we're<00:01:33.360> going<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.509> do<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:33.810> we're

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
shovel what we're going to do is we're

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.840 
shovel what we're going to do is we're
going<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.049> walk<00:01:34.259> across<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.799> pasture<00:01:35.040> take

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
going to walk across the pasture take

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.850 
going to walk across the pasture take
little<00:01:36.119> samples<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.659> soil<00:01:36.869> mix<00:01:37.710> them

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
little samples of the soil mix them

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.990 
little samples of the soil mix them
together<00:01:37.920> in<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.340> bucket<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.820> have<00:01:38.909> an

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
together in a bucket and have an

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.030 
together in a bucket and have an
analysis<00:01:39.509> run<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.990> once<00:01:40.680> again<00:01:40.799> if<00:01:40.979> you

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
analysis run on it once again if you

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.319 
analysis run on it once again if you
don't<00:01:41.189> have<00:01:41.280> one<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.549> these<00:01:41.640> probes<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.150> can

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
don't have one of these probes you can

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.719 
don't have one of these probes you can
do<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.570> with<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.689> simple<00:01:42.990> garden<00:01:43.409> Spade<00:01:43.740> yes

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
do it with a simple garden Spade yes

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.039 
do it with a simple garden Spade yes
sure<00:01:45.030> Steve<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.600> little<00:01:45.810> bit<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:45.990> a

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
sure Steve this is a little bit of a

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.389 
sure Steve this is a little bit of a
high-tech<00:01:46.200> version<00:01:46.829> but<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.070> makes<00:01:47.280> it

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
high-tech version but this makes it

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.160 
high-tech version but this makes it
pretty<00:01:47.549> easy<00:01:47.820> I'm<00:01:48.210> not<00:01:48.479> putting<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.780> much<00:01:49.020> of

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
pretty easy I'm not putting that much of

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.450 
pretty easy I'm not putting that much of
an<00:01:49.259> area<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.590> disturbance<00:01:50.100> with<00:01:50.189> just<00:01:50.369> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
an area of disturbance with just the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.730 
an area of disturbance with just the
area<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.790> this<00:01:50.880> core<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.630> it's<00:01:52.049> quite<00:01:52.380> simple

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
area of this core and it's quite simple

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.050 
area of this core and it's quite simple
all<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:53.009> do<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.399> take<00:01:53.759> my<00:01:53.939> foot<00:01:54.229> push<00:01:55.229> down<00:01:56.060> pull

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
all I do is take my foot push down pull

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.300 
all I do is take my foot push down pull
it<00:01:57.210> out<00:01:57.360> about<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.290> four<00:01:58.500> inch<00:01:58.680> depth<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.159> have

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
it out about the four inch depth I have

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.330 
it out about the four inch depth I have
a<00:01:59.549> first<00:01:59.880> sample<00:02:00.240> for<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.020> composite<00:02:01.340> okay

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
a first sample for the composite okay

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.590 
a first sample for the composite okay
and<00:02:02.460> we're<00:02:02.579> simply<00:02:02.729> going<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.060> mix<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.450> a

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
and we're simply going to mix that in a

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.630 
and we're simply going to mix that in a
bucket<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.049> take<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.979> sample<00:02:05.189> from<00:02:05.460> there

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
bucket and take the sample from there

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.219 
bucket and take the sample from there
well<00:02:06.240> bill<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.509> seems<00:02:06.719> like<00:02:06.869> that's<00:02:06.960> one<00:02:07.200> of

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
well bill it seems like that's one of

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.600 
well bill it seems like that's one of
the<00:02:07.380> best<00:02:07.560> things<00:02:07.829> we<00:02:07.979> could<00:02:08.160> do<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.310> probably

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
the best things we could do and probably

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.040 
the best things we could do and probably
one<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.000> cheapest<00:02:09.390> inputs<00:02:09.780> we're<00:02:09.929> going

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
one of the cheapest inputs we're going

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.020 
one of the cheapest inputs we're going
to<00:02:10.110> put<00:02:10.289> into<00:02:10.410> our<00:02:10.530> farm<00:02:10.979> as<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.640> all<00:02:11.730> know<00:02:11.879> it

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
to put into our farm as you all know it

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.760 
to put into our farm as you all know it
cost<00:02:12.209> lots<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.510> money<00:02:12.569> for<00:02:12.900> fertilizer<00:02:13.349> and

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
cost lots of money for fertilizer and

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.740 
cost lots of money for fertilizer and
and<00:02:13.860> seed<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.640> everything<00:02:14.970> like<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.150> so

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
and seed and everything like that so

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.670 
and seed and everything like that so
this<00:02:15.840> is<00:02:15.990> probably<00:02:16.260> one<00:02:16.350> of<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.560> most

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
this is probably one of the most

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.410 
this is probably one of the most
affordable<00:02:17.250> things<00:02:17.700> we're<00:02:17.880> going<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.030> ever<00:02:18.180> do

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
affordable things we're going to ever do

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.210 
affordable things we're going to ever do
on<00:02:18.450> our<00:02:18.750> pasture<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.440> one<00:02:19.860> of<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.010> best

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
on our pasture and one of the best

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.010 
on our pasture and one of the best
management<00:02:20.700> tools<00:02:20.880> that<00:02:21.030> we<00:02:21.120> can<00:02:21.240> possibly<00:02:21.450> do

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
management tools that we can possibly do

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.560 
management tools that we can possibly do
in<00:02:22.260> fact<00:02:23.040> we<00:02:23.220> can't<00:02:23.490> make<00:02:23.640> recommendations<00:02:24.450> on

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
in fact we can't make recommendations on

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.240 
in fact we can't make recommendations on
what<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:24.900> need<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.140> fertilize<00:02:25.500> your<00:02:25.920> your

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
what you need to fertilize your your

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.790 
what you need to fertilize your your
pasture<00:02:26.730> without<00:02:27.420> having<00:02:27.780> soil<00:02:28.050> test<00:02:28.350> kit<00:02:28.440> and

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
pasture without having soil test kit and

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.160 
pasture without having soil test kit and
a<00:02:29.220> soil<00:02:29.550> test<00:02:29.790> results<00:02:29.970> for<00:02:30.420> us<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.630> look<00:02:30.810> over

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
a soil test results for us to look over

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.290 
a soil test results for us to look over
so<00:02:31.530> it's<00:02:31.680> really<00:02:31.860> really<00:02:32.070> important<00:02:32.700> so<00:02:33.180> what

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
so it's really really important so what

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.400 
so it's really really important so what
do<00:02:33.360> you<00:02:33.420> say<00:02:33.540> we<00:02:33.660> go<00:02:33.780> out<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.020> take<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.200> soil

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
do you say we go out and take a soil

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:42.830 
do you say we go out and take a soil
sample<00:02:34.830> in<00:02:34.890> this<00:02:35.010> field<00:02:35.280> okay<00:02:36.000> let's<00:02:36.180> go

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.050 

again<00:02:43.840> we<00:02:43.959> took<00:02:44.110> 10<00:02:44.319> to<00:02:44.439> 15<00:02:44.799> cores<00:02:45.129> as<00:02:45.459> we<00:02:45.849> walk

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
again we took 10 to 15 cores as we walk

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.580 
again we took 10 to 15 cores as we walk
through<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:46.659> now<00:02:47.140> we're<00:02:47.260> going<00:02:47.349> to<00:02:47.409> prepare

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
through and now we're going to prepare

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.920 
through and now we're going to prepare
the<00:02:47.769> sample<00:02:48.159> to<00:02:48.280> send<00:02:48.459> it<00:02:48.519> to<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.700> laboratory

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
the sample to send it to the laboratory

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.270 
the sample to send it to the laboratory
all<00:02:49.930> right<00:02:50.079> see<00:02:50.260> we<00:02:50.349> got<00:02:50.470> all<00:02:50.530> our<00:02:50.709> samples<00:02:50.950> now

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
all right see we got all our samples now

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.580 
all right see we got all our samples now
well<00:02:51.819> bill<00:02:51.970> we<00:02:52.090> took<00:02:52.180> our<00:02:52.329> cores<00:02:52.599> so<00:02:52.930> we<00:02:53.439> have

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
well bill we took our cores so we have

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.350 
well bill we took our cores so we have
if<00:02:53.860> you<00:02:53.950> see<00:02:54.129> we<00:02:54.310> have<00:02:54.430> a<00:02:54.459> bucket<00:02:54.730> full<00:02:55.030> of<00:02:55.180> soil

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
if you see we have a bucket full of soil

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.449 
if you see we have a bucket full of soil
what's<00:02:55.930> our<00:02:56.049> next<00:02:56.140> step<00:02:56.349> we<00:02:56.500> do<00:02:56.650> now<00:02:57.189> we<00:02:57.310> gotta

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
what's our next step we do now we gotta

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:58.589 
what's our next step we do now we gotta
get<00:02:57.549> the<00:02:57.670> sample<00:02:58.000> ready<00:02:58.120> to<00:02:58.239> go<00:02:58.359> over<00:02:58.420> to<00:02:58.480> the

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
get the sample ready to go over to the

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.390 
get the sample ready to go over to the
laboratory<00:02:59.109> so<00:02:59.859> we're<00:02:59.950> going<00:03:00.040> out<00:03:00.129> to<00:03:00.220> break

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
laboratory so we're going out to break

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.429 
laboratory so we're going out to break
up<00:03:00.579> the<00:03:00.700> sample<00:03:01.090> mix<00:03:01.329> it<00:03:01.510> up<00:03:01.629> and<00:03:01.930> dry<00:03:02.170> it<00:03:02.230> out<00:03:02.379> a

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:02.439 
up the sample mix it up and dry it out a

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:04.199 
up the sample mix it up and dry it out a
little<00:03:02.620> bit<00:03:02.799> okay<00:03:03.519> so<00:03:03.579> it's<00:03:03.790> important<00:03:04.120> to

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
little bit okay so it's important to

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.910 
little bit okay so it's important to
make<00:03:04.359> sure<00:03:04.390> that<00:03:04.540> that<00:03:05.079> we<00:03:05.200> pull<00:03:05.409> any<00:03:05.590> debris

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
make sure that that we pull any debris

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.920 
make sure that that we pull any debris
out<00:03:06.159> of<00:03:06.310> here<00:03:06.579> as<00:03:06.730> you<00:03:07.150> can<00:03:07.269> see<00:03:07.420> we<00:03:07.540> have<00:03:07.659> some

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
out of here as you can see we have some

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.589 
out of here as you can see we have some
some<00:03:08.349> weeds<00:03:08.680> and<00:03:08.980> a<00:03:09.250> couple<00:03:09.730> of<00:03:09.939> twigs<00:03:10.209> so<00:03:10.510> we

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
some weeds and a couple of twigs so we

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:11.610 
some weeds and a couple of twigs so we
want<00:03:10.750> to<00:03:10.810> make<00:03:10.900> sure<00:03:10.989> that<00:03:11.079> those<00:03:11.230> are<00:03:11.290> pulled

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
want to make sure that those are pulled

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.810 
want to make sure that those are pulled
out<00:03:11.739> so<00:03:11.890> we<00:03:12.010> don't<00:03:12.099> skew<00:03:12.430> our<00:03:12.459> sample

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.890

the<00:03:38.890> soil<00:03:39.250> nutrients<00:03:39.970> from<00:03:40.270> it<00:03:40.480> and<00:03:41.470> measure

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
the soil nutrients from it and measure

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.100 
the soil nutrients from it and measure
how<00:03:42.340> appropriate<00:03:42.970> they<00:03:43.210> are<00:03:43.360> for<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.750> plants

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
how appropriate they are for the plants

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.410 
how appropriate they are for the plants
that<00:03:44.230> you're<00:03:44.350> growing<00:03:44.410> we'll<00:03:45.310> also<00:03:45.490> do<00:03:45.880> a<00:03:45.910> test

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
that you're growing we'll also do a test

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.930 
that you're growing we'll also do a test
for<00:03:46.690> soil<00:03:47.110> pH<00:03:47.590> to<00:03:47.920> see<00:03:48.100> if<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.340> pH<00:03:48.700> is

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
for soil pH to see if the pH is

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.420 
for soil pH to see if the pH is
appropriate<00:03:49.660> for<00:03:49.810> that<00:03:50.140> plant<00:03:50.470> and<00:03:50.740> then

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
appropriate for that plant and then

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.540 
appropriate for that plant and then
we'll<00:03:51.580> provide<00:03:52.330> a<00:03:52.390> soil<00:03:53.140> test<00:03:53.500> report<00:03:53.710> which

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
we'll provide a soil test report which

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.860 
we'll provide a soil test report which
looks<00:03:54.760> something<00:03:54.940> like<00:03:55.180> this<00:03:55.450> which<00:03:55.690> will

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
looks something like this which will

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.470 
looks something like this which will
give<00:03:56.020> your<00:03:56.370> results<00:03:57.370> and<00:03:57.550> interpretation<00:03:58.360> of
