 First, search for tig for tig and go to leaguecraft site 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.720
 From the tab above me 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.720
 2 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.869

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.410
 Have 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.210
 To the foot 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.210
 I will try to put a little skin 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.920
 This is my favorite choice 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.070
 Where a 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.710
 8 rates 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:59.800
 Display the highest ones in order 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.820
 Display from the new update , etc. 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.820
 Unexpected are various Ijiku 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.990
 I want to put in 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.170
 Had 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.170
 Areola are visible lightly 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:36.920
 I want to put this in 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:39.460
 First of all say the software you need on top 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.460
 Under the 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.650
 Where Kana in Tsu install 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.650
 Flying to url 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.010
 soft 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.900
 I said that there is an update at the top red point 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.000
 Because it is compressed by zip 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.000
 It is intended 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.319
 If you are Kurito and this software is called Skinny Stolger Ultimate 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:23.069
 I will open the shaft and I will specify the launcher of the troll but I myself 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.819
 I have installed Rol 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:31.719
 Please look for the file 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.719
 I think that it is in the c Riot game if it is not set up in particular 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.769
 I put it in a place not funny 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.769

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.730
 There is a person Rob launcher , select it, open it and press 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.930
 You can expect a location meeting 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:02.390
 I think that the load is 45% and you do not download 100% or your previous skin 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.810
 Back to page 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.550

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:58.780
 If you press the ok by specifying the unzipped folder 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.830
