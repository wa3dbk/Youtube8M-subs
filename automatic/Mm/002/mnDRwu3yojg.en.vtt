00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
killed him but he had the as50 and

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.389 
killed him but he had the as50 and
allowing<00:01:42.780> me<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.290> be<00:01:43.409> able<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.680> get<00:01:43.799> this<00:01:43.920> Moab

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
allowing me to be able to get this Moab

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.780 
allowing me to be able to get this Moab
so<00:01:45.000> yeah<00:01:45.479> all<00:01:45.840> 25<00:01:46.470> kills<00:01:46.799> were<00:01:47.009> with<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.250> as50

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
so yeah all 25 kills were with the as50

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.200 
so yeah all 25 kills were with the as50
and

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
and

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.730 
and
and<00:01:49.330> I<00:01:49.450> even<00:01:49.720> kept<00:01:49.900> the<00:01:49.960> street<00:01:50.200> going<00:01:50.380> just

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
and I even kept the street going just

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.649 
and I even kept the street going just
like<00:01:50.920> I<00:01:51.040> think<00:01:51.250> I<00:01:51.369> got<00:01:51.520> like<00:01:51.729> two<00:01:51.970> three<00:01:52.000> kills

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
like I think I got like two three kills

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.380 
like I think I got like two three kills
after<00:01:53.110> but<00:01:53.350> you<00:01:53.979> know<00:01:54.340> I<00:01:54.369> really<00:01:54.760> enjoy<00:01:55.180> using

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
after but you know I really enjoy using

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.090 
after but you know I really enjoy using
the<00:01:55.570> as50<00:01:56.020> it's<00:01:56.380> probably<00:01:56.619> one<00:01:56.770> of<00:01:56.799> the<00:01:56.920> best

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
the as50 it's probably one of the best

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.310 
the as50 it's probably one of the best
snipers<00:01:57.610> in<00:01:57.640> modern<00:01:58.000> warfare<00:01:58.150> 3<00:01:58.360> and<00:01:58.869> the<00:01:59.200> only

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
snipers in modern warfare 3 and the only

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.380 
snipers in modern warfare 3 and the only
reason<00:01:59.409> why<00:01:59.740> I<00:01:59.770> say<00:02:00.070> that<00:02:00.100> is<00:02:00.310> because<00:02:00.700> of<00:02:01.240> how

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
reason why I say that is because of how

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.920 
reason why I say that is because of how
good<00:02:01.750> it<00:02:01.900> is<00:02:01.930> I<00:02:02.530> mean<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:04.119> know<00:02:04.240> you'll<00:02:04.750> get<00:02:04.869> a

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
good it is I mean you know you'll get a

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.719 
good it is I mean you know you'll get a
hitmarker<00:02:05.140> here<00:02:05.680> in<00:02:05.800> there<00:02:06.009> but<00:02:06.490> for<00:02:06.610> the<00:02:06.670> most

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
hitmarker here in there but for the most

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.699 
hitmarker here in there but for the most
part<00:02:06.970> the<00:02:07.240> as50<00:02:07.750> is<00:02:08.020> not<00:02:08.289> going<00:02:08.470> to<00:02:08.560> let<00:02:08.679> you

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
part the as50 is not going to let you

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.010 
part the as50 is not going to let you
down<00:02:08.830> and<00:02:09.369> if<00:02:09.940> you're<00:02:10.060> trying<00:02:10.270> to<00:02:10.420> quickscope

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
down and if you're trying to quickscope

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.809 
down and if you're trying to quickscope
I<00:02:11.200> mean<00:02:11.440> it's<00:02:11.650> possible<00:02:12.190> to<00:02:12.280> quickscope<00:02:12.700> with

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
I mean it's possible to quickscope with

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.840 
I mean it's possible to quickscope with
the<00:02:12.910> as50<00:02:13.420> but<00:02:14.200> if<00:02:14.319> you're<00:02:14.530> trying<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:15.040> snipe

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
the as50 but if you're trying to snipe

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.120 
the as50 but if you're trying to snipe
and<00:02:16.150> actually<00:02:16.540> be<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.750> real<00:02:17.020> sniper<00:02:17.440> then<00:02:18.010> I

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
and actually be a real sniper then I

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.040 
and actually be a real sniper then I
would<00:02:18.280> suggest<00:02:18.430> using<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.150> as50<00:02:19.660> because

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
would suggest using the as50 because

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.350 
would suggest using the as50 because
it's<00:02:20.170> going<00:02:20.290> to<00:02:20.350> help<00:02:20.410> you<00:02:20.739> out<00:02:20.770> so<00:02:21.340> much<00:02:21.790> as

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
it's going to help you out so much as

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.840 
it's going to help you out so much as
accurate<00:02:23.140> it<00:02:23.320> jumps<00:02:23.769> back<00:02:23.920> on<00:02:24.130> it<00:02:24.280> was<00:02:24.370> shot<00:02:24.640> I

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
accurate it jumps back on it was shot I

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.610 
accurate it jumps back on it was shot I
mean<00:02:25.060> once<00:02:25.239> you<00:02:25.360> shoot<00:02:25.600> it<00:02:25.870> locks<00:02:26.110> back<00:02:26.350> great

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
mean once you shoot it locks back great

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.100 
mean once you shoot it locks back great
back<00:02:26.830> on<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.310> where<00:02:27.430> it<00:02:27.519> was<00:02:27.550> originally<00:02:27.880> and<00:02:28.510> I

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
back on to where it was originally and I

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.830 
back on to where it was originally and I
mean<00:02:29.260> it's<00:02:29.709> a<00:02:29.769> helpful<00:02:30.070> sniper<00:02:30.489> and<00:02:30.820> um<00:02:31.540> you

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
mean it's a helpful sniper and um you

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.729 
mean it's a helpful sniper and um you
know<00:02:31.959> I<00:02:31.989> don't<00:02:32.230> think<00:02:32.380> a<00:02:32.440> lot<00:02:32.560> of<00:02:32.620> people

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
know I don't think a lot of people

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.699 
know I don't think a lot of people
really<00:02:33.010> kind<00:02:33.760> of<00:02:33.910> like<00:02:34.269> it<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:34.660> you<00:02:35.560> know<00:02:35.680> I

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
really kind of like it and you know I

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.410 
really kind of like it and you know I
kind<00:02:35.890> of<00:02:36.040> understand<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:36.610> quick<00:02:36.820> scoping<00:02:37.269> on

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
kind of understand the quick scoping on

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.080 
kind of understand the quick scoping on
it<00:02:37.600> is<00:02:37.690> a<00:02:37.720> little<00:02:37.989> bit<00:02:38.200> tough<00:02:38.500> to<00:02:38.530> you<00:02:38.950> know

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
it is a little bit tough to you know

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.610 
it is a little bit tough to you know
compared<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:40.390> other<00:02:40.600> snipers<00:02:41.170> that<00:02:41.200> would

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
compared to the other snipers that would

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.949 
compared to the other snipers that would
be<00:02:41.950> so<00:02:42.430> much<00:02:42.550> better<00:02:42.610> but<00:02:43.450> on<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.750> other<00:02:43.840> hand

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
be so much better but on the other hand

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.870 
be so much better but on the other hand
the<00:02:44.290> as50<00:02:44.769> is<00:02:45.070> probably<00:02:45.340> one<00:02:45.489> of<00:02:45.519> the<00:02:45.640> funnest

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
the as50 is probably one of the funnest

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.970 
the as50 is probably one of the funnest
snipers<00:02:46.390> to<00:02:46.540> use<00:02:46.810> because<00:02:47.110> it's<00:02:47.410> so<00:02:47.590> different

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
snipers to use because it's so different

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.000 
snipers to use because it's so different
and<00:02:48.930> especially<00:02:49.930> if<00:02:50.200> you're<00:02:50.350> trying<00:02:50.380> a<00:02:50.769> hard

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
and especially if you're trying a hard

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.220 
and especially if you're trying a hard
scope<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:51.489> snipe<00:02:51.850> like<00:02:52.120> a<00:02:52.150> real<00:02:52.480> sniper<00:02:52.840> like

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
scope and snipe like a real sniper like

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.199 
scope and snipe like a real sniper like
I<00:02:53.380> stated<00:02:53.650> it<00:02:54.010> is<00:02:54.480> perfect<00:02:55.480> it's<00:02:55.810> perfect<00:02:56.079> and

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
I stated it is perfect it's perfect and

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.030 
I stated it is perfect it's perfect and
you<00:02:58.209> know<00:02:58.329> especially<00:02:58.600> like<00:02:59.019> I<00:02:59.140> said<00:02:59.410> bokaro

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
you know especially like I said bokaro

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.240 
you know especially like I said bokaro
it's<00:03:00.640> the<00:03:01.390> car<00:03:01.630> is<00:03:01.810> like<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.410> best<00:03:02.650> sniping

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
it's the car is like the best sniping

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.069 
it's the car is like the best sniping
map<00:03:03.430> because<00:03:03.730> there<00:03:03.880> are<00:03:04.000> so<00:03:04.030> many<00:03:04.329> sponse<00:03:04.930> you

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
map because there are so many sponse you

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.620 
map because there are so many sponse you
can<00:03:05.230> just<00:03:05.410> relax<00:03:05.709> and<00:03:06.130> this<00:03:07.120> building<00:03:07.540> right

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
can just relax and this building right

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.750 
can just relax and this building right
here<00:03:07.690> I<00:03:07.989> pointed<00:03:08.410> this<00:03:08.500> out<00:03:08.680> on<00:03:08.829> my<00:03:08.920> first<00:03:09.160> as50

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
here I pointed this out on my first as50

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.650 
here I pointed this out on my first as50
Moab<00:03:10.329> that<00:03:10.930> this<00:03:11.560> spot<00:03:11.860> is<00:03:12.130> so<00:03:12.670> hot<00:03:12.940> but<00:03:13.510> i'll

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
Moab that this spot is so hot but i'll

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.340 
Moab that this spot is so hot but i'll
drop<00:03:13.959> zone<00:03:14.290> it's<00:03:14.530> not<00:03:15.870> that<00:03:16.870> kind<00:03:16.989> of<00:03:17.110> rhyme

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
drop zone it's not that kind of rhyme

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.370 
drop zone it's not that kind of rhyme
but<00:03:17.799> in<00:03:18.220> java<00:03:18.640> zone<00:03:18.940> it's<00:03:19.510> different<00:03:20.049> ok

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
but in java zone it's different ok

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.900 
but in java zone it's different ok
because<00:03:20.590> you<00:03:20.829> know<00:03:20.950> people<00:03:20.980> were<00:03:21.430> going<00:03:21.459> to

the fact that they're all going for the

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.659 
the fact that they're all going for the
drop<00:05:19.720> zone<00:05:20.020> made<00:05:20.229> it<00:05:20.350> so<00:05:20.560> much<00:05:20.620> easier<00:05:20.740> for<00:05:21.430> me

series<00:06:06.400> and<00:06:06.639> i<00:06:06.720> completely<00:06:07.720> forgot<00:06:08.320> about

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
series and i completely forgot about

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.450 
series and i completely forgot about
this<00:06:09.720> so<00:06:10.720> for<00:06:10.960> example<00:06:10.990> if<00:06:11.440> i<00:06:11.530> get<00:06:11.680> 24<00:06:12.190> kills

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
this so for example if i get 24 kills

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.730 
this so for example if i get 24 kills
with<00:06:12.759> my<00:06:12.880> a<00:06:12.910> s<00:06:13.210> 50<00:06:13.660> and<00:06:13.840> then<00:06:14.229> I<00:06:14.289> get<00:06:14.530> another

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
with my a s 50 and then I get another

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.790 
with my a s 50 and then I get another
key<00:06:14.979> with<00:06:15.099> my<00:06:15.220> mp9<00:06:15.610> that<00:06:16.360> I<00:06:16.449> got<00:06:16.630> the<00:06:16.780> Moab<00:06:17.139> but

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
key with my mp9 that I got the Moab but

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.520 
key with my mp9 that I got the Moab but
I<00:06:18.099> didn't<00:06:18.820> fully<00:06:19.090> get<00:06:19.419> the<00:06:19.570> Moab<00:06:19.870> with<00:06:20.050> my<00:06:20.199> a<00:06:20.229> s

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:20.530 
I didn't fully get the Moab with my a s

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.439 
I didn't fully get the Moab with my a s
50<00:06:20.979> instead<00:06:21.250> I<00:06:21.400> got<00:06:21.580> another<00:06:21.820> kill<00:06:22.150> with<00:06:22.300> my

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:22.449 
50 instead I got another kill with my

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:26.100 
50 instead I got another kill with my
mp9<00:06:22.840> so<00:06:23.620> that<00:06:23.770> means<00:06:24.039> that<00:06:24.370> after<00:06:25.270> i<00:06:25.690> got<00:06:25.930> the

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 
mp9 so that means that after i got the

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.409
