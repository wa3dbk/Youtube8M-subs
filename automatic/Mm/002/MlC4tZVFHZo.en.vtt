like I now I have my garbled or out and
play<00:03:24.599> but<00:03:24.870> I'm<00:03:25.170> gonna<00:03:25.290> play<00:03:25.530> n<00:03:25.709> since<00:03:26.040> my

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
play but I'm gonna play n since my

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.309 
play but I'm gonna play n since my
opponent<00:03:26.489> does<00:03:26.579> have<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:26.790> lot<00:03:26.970> of<00:03:27.030> hand<00:03:27.630> yeah

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
opponent does have a lot of hand yeah

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.099 
opponent does have a lot of hand yeah
cars<00:03:28.590> in<00:03:28.709> his<00:03:28.829> hand<00:03:29.040> so<00:03:29.730> right<00:03:30.299> now<00:03:30.329> go<00:03:30.870> for<00:03:31.079> the

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
cars in his hand so right now go for the

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.009 
cars in his hand so right now go for the
muscle<00:03:31.470> band<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:31.859> you<00:03:32.100> 2x<00:03:32.519> and<00:03:32.790> then<00:03:33.019> yeah

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
muscle band to you 2x and then yeah

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.809 
muscle band to you 2x and then yeah
another<00:03:34.200> regular<00:03:34.620> water<00:03:34.859> energy<00:03:35.040> to<00:03:35.370> MU<00:03:35.549> to<00:03:35.730> be

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
another regular water energy to MU to be

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.150 
another regular water energy to MU to be
X<00:03:35.970> to<00:03:36.060> actually<00:03:36.420> have<00:03:36.959> that<00:03:36.989> axle<00:03:37.680> right<00:03:37.889> now

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
X to actually have that axle right now

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.110 
X to actually have that axle right now
so<00:03:38.760> X<00:03:39.239> vol<00:03:39.480> 4<00:03:39.690> 80<00:03:39.900> damage<00:03:40.170> so<00:03:40.620> we're<00:03:41.190> as<00:03:41.340> I<00:03:41.370> don't

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
so X vol 4 80 damage so we're as I don't

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.120 
so X vol 4 80 damage so we're as I don't
know<00:03:42.209> how<00:03:42.450> many<00:03:42.660> times<00:03:42.750> we<00:03:43.139> have<00:03:43.290> but<00:03:43.560> if<00:03:43.980> he

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
know how many times we have but if he

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.490 
know how many times we have but if he
attaches<00:03:44.400> another<00:03:44.760> energy<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:45.540> his<00:03:45.690> virizion

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
attaches another energy to his virizion

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.400 
attaches another energy to his virizion
he'll<00:03:46.950> be<00:03:47.100> knocked<00:03:47.280> out<00:03:47.430> anyway<00:03:47.910> so<00:03:48.230> he<00:03:49.230> can

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
he'll be knocked out anyway so he can
