00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:08.580
 in one of the videos we showed you how 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:14.219
 sowing tomato seeds means everything or we 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:18.990
 March 12th is our twenty-seventh today. 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.390
 April has been a month and a half from 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.710
 see the moment of sowing the seeds 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.710
 how grown seedlings 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.480
 here in the foreground this seedling 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:47.579
 grown from their seeds pretty 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:51.890
 thick seeds sprung good turned 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.829
 seedlings but i think what else 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:01:02.339
 it is too early to plant because there are 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:06.630
 frosts early and in the month of May but on 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:08.040
 in the background now we will show you here 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.060
 there are already spans 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.720
 there are places pustovaty and where the seeds are not 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.690
 ascended 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.880
 But I already told you that we are seeds 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.960
 bought in the store and ate their own 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.100
 here you are on the face of the result here 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.729
 there is not very good germination of seeds 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:32.880
 You can see the seeds in the store 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:38.569
 I sowed others in places where it is empty 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:44.970
 here they must ascend here and here 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:49.590
 seedlings a little less 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.840
 the seedlings were strong as she was already 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.090
 it is said too early, it seems to be planted 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.069
 Yes, but so that it does not stretch 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.920
 and here is a good drug that 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:01.500
 called an athlete here we will be this 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.160
 I shall water you the seedlings now 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.160
 show here 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:09.929
 drug from years which i will 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.970
 use to seedlings not 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.500
 overgrown to be thick 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.940
 stems 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:24.030
 green leaves but you can 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.340
 spray the seedlings on top of the glass before 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.160
 drops of leaves can be 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.349
 watering is suitable but it needs to be repeated 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.040
 mean several times since by 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.190
 expiry 5 8 days sturgeon garden again 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.620
 starts 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.550
 grow vigorously grow by someone two three times 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.310
 need to repeat 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:47.670
 spraying or watering means well here 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.420
 so this drug prevents 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.300
 seedling growth 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.720
 means forms a strong root 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.060
 the system and the seedlings are obtained very 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.930
 beautiful but it means this drug 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:05.430
 used not only for vegetable crops 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.170
 you can spray and water the flowers 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.420
 everything is written in the instructions is written as 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.660
 use it and for what purpose 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.490
 this drug from years seedlings i will 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.330
 land when the threat passes 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.720
 frost 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.670
 Well, there will be the month of May and here 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.220
 results of what the seedlings turned out 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.260
 after watering this drug or after 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.760
 spraying them we will you 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.760
 show the next video 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.470
 when we prepared the land for sowing 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:42.730
 tomato seed showed you teaches how we 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:44.709
 planted figs and pomegranates from the open 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.650
 soil from a cop in order to 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.320
 before meditation began so that when we 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.790
 we will be planted in open ground 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.520
 at least there were already these podroschennye 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:58.810
 plants not see the result here 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.120
 our figs let loose leaves 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:05.560
 of course small 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:09.850
 Now, but already moved to the growth means he 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:18.010
 living well tolerated by a cop in the ground in 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:22.570
 open ground and side by side in the tank 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:27.310
 the pomegranate also sent out the leaves too 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:29.620
 wintered them in the pot and those plants 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.110
 which we have figs and pomegranates 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.890
 are in the ground in at the copy still there 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:41.190
 there are no signs of life 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:41.190
 these our plants will grow earlier 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.290
 we want to try growing figs and 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.820
 pomegranate in our locality in the east 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:54.840
 Ukraine of course will need to work hard 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:59.740
 cover these plants as they are southern 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:04.710
 But I really want to see how that 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.710
 get and show you a video movie
