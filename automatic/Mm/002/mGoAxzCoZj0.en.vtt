00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
we're going to connect to our MySQL

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.070 
we're going to connect to our MySQL
server<00:00:12.059> and<00:00:12.360> then<00:00:12.450> connect<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.809> our<00:00:12.900> database

demonstrating<00:00:16.250> SQL<00:00:17.250> injection<00:00:17.760> so<00:00:18.539> I'm<00:00:18.630> just

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
demonstrating SQL injection so I'm just

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.570 
demonstrating SQL injection so I'm just
going<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:19.020> use<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.199> standard<00:00:19.470> MySQL<00:00:19.859> connect

going to use a standard MySQL connect

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.420 
going to use a standard MySQL connect
function<00:00:21.289> it<00:00:22.289> takes<00:00:22.560> three<00:00:22.769> parameters<00:00:22.920> if

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
function it takes three parameters if

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.560 
function it takes three parameters if

okay so we are checking just doing some
basic<00:03:45.020> form<00:03:45.410> validation<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:46.040> username<00:03:46.430> and

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
basic form validation the username and

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.240 
basic form validation the username and
password<00:03:46.970> must<00:03:47.180> exist<00:03:47.680> okay<00:03:48.680> so<00:03:48.740> now<00:03:48.980> what<00:03:49.160> we

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
password must exist okay so now what we

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.000 
password must exist okay so now what we
need<00:03:49.280> to<00:03:49.430> do<00:03:49.700> is<00:03:49.970> we<00:03:50.420> need<00:03:50.600> to<00:03:50.980> structure<00:03:51.980> our

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
need to do is we need to structure our

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.210 
need to do is we need to structure our
query<00:03:52.460> so<00:03:53.240> our<00:03:53.330> query<00:03:53.570> is<00:03:53.930> going<00:03:53.990> to<00:03:54.110> equal<00:03:54.320> and

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
query so our query is going to equal and

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.620 
query so our query is going to equal and
like<00:03:55.610> I<00:03:55.640> said<00:03:55.820> if<00:03:55.910> you've<00:03:56.030> already<00:03:56.180> seen<00:03:56.480> this

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
like I said if you've already seen this

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.270 
like I said if you've already seen this
you'll<00:03:56.810> know<00:03:56.900> exactly<00:03:56.990> what<00:03:57.440> we're<00:03:57.560> doing<00:03:57.680> the

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
you'll know exactly what we're doing the

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.260 
you'll know exactly what we're doing the
query<00:03:58.580> is<00:03:58.790> going<00:03:58.880> to<00:03:59.000> equal<00:03:59.630> select<00:04:00.940> ID<00:04:02.140> from

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
query is going to equal select ID from

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.030 
query is going to equal select ID from
users<00:04:05.270> much<00:04:05.480> like<00:04:05.690> I<00:04:05.720> demonstrated<00:04:06.290> just

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
users much like I demonstrated just

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.340 
users much like I demonstrated just
about<00:04:07.220> five<00:04:07.490> minutes<00:04:07.700> ago<00:04:08.000> so<00:04:08.270> select<00:04:08.690> ID<00:04:08.960> from

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
about five minutes ago so select ID from

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:15.460 
about five minutes ago so select ID from
users<00:04:09.800> where<00:04:10.000> username<00:04:12.880> equals<00:04:14.470> something

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
users where username equals something

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.720 
users where username equals something
here<00:04:15.920> and<00:04:17.020> password<00:04:18.020> equals<00:04:18.890> something<00:04:19.310> here

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
here and password equals something here

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.750 
here and password equals something here
so<00:04:20.300> let's<00:04:20.450> just<00:04:20.510> put<00:04:20.870> them<00:04:21.080> in<00:04:21.340> apostrophes<00:04:22.370> so

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
so let's just put them in apostrophes so

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.160 
so let's just put them in apostrophes so
where<00:04:23.120> username<00:04:23.420> equals<00:04:23.840> something<00:04:23.990> and

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.170 
where username equals something and

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.330 
where username equals something and
possibly<00:04:24.530> become<00:04:24.710> something<00:04:24.950> this<00:04:25.190> is

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
possibly become something this is

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.550 
possibly become something this is
obvious<00:04:25.700> it's<00:04:25.940> where<00:04:26.510> username<00:04:26.900> equals<00:04:27.110> user

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
obvious it's where username equals user

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.550 
obvious it's where username equals user
name<00:04:27.770> and<00:04:28.060> password<00:04:29.060> equals<00:04:29.390> password<00:04:29.840> so<00:04:30.440> now

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
name and password equals password so now

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.380 
name and password equals password so now
we<00:04:30.620> can<00:04:30.920> create<00:04:31.490> a<00:04:31.580> new<00:04:31.820> variable<00:04:32.240> called

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
we can create a new variable called

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.080 
we can create a new variable called
query<00:04:32.930> run<00:04:33.290> and<00:04:33.830> we<00:04:33.950> can<00:04:34.100> run<00:04:34.340> this<00:04:34.460> query<00:04:34.760> so

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
query run and we can run this query so

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.650 
query run and we can run this query so
MySQL<00:04:35.330> query<00:04:36.110> and<00:04:36.500> actually<00:04:37.480> process<00:04:38.480> that

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
MySQL query and actually process that

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:44.770 
MySQL query and actually process that
query<00:04:39.160> through<00:04:41.140> pH<00:04:42.140> sorry<00:04:42.830> through<00:04:43.160> MySQL<00:04:44.120> now

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
query through pH sorry through MySQL now

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.390 
query through pH sorry through MySQL now
this<00:04:44.990> is<00:04:45.140> the<00:04:45.260> dangerous<00:04:45.650> line<00:04:45.920> because<00:04:46.250> what

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
this is the dangerous line because what

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.070 
this is the dangerous line because what
we've<00:04:46.520> done<00:04:46.700> here<00:04:47.090> is<00:04:47.210> we've<00:04:47.390> processed<00:04:47.720> this

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
we've done here is we've processed this

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.650 
we've done here is we've processed this
query<00:04:48.500> and<00:04:48.740> so<00:04:49.340> far<00:04:49.610> we've<00:04:49.760> given<00:04:49.970> absolutely

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
query and so far we've given absolutely

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.650 
query and so far we've given absolutely
no<00:04:50.870> protection<00:04:51.080> whatsoever<00:04:52.300> to<00:04:53.300> protect

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
no protection whatsoever to protect

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.960 
no protection whatsoever to protect
against<00:04:53.930> the<00:04:54.080> SQL<00:04:54.680> injection<00:04:55.250> and<00:04:55.670> I'll<00:04:55.760> show

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
against the SQL injection and I'll show

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.070 
against the SQL injection and I'll show
you<00:04:56.060> in<00:04:56.210> a<00:04:56.300> minute<00:04:56.420> we're<00:04:56.600> going<00:04:56.690> to<00:04:56.750> look<00:04:56.930> at

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
you in a minute we're going to look at

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.250 
you in a minute we're going to look at
something<00:04:57.590> inside<00:04:58.070> the<00:04:58.190> PHP<00:04:58.760> dot<00:04:58.910> ini<00:04:59.030> file<00:04:59.660> so

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
something inside the PHP dot ini file so

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.210 
something inside the PHP dot ini file so
the<00:05:00.380> PHP<00:05:00.860> configuration<00:05:01.610> file<00:05:01.850> which<00:05:03.220> which

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
the PHP configuration file which which

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.600 
the PHP configuration file which which
doesn't<00:05:05.150> automatically<00:05:05.960> escape<00:05:06.610> characters

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
doesn't automatically escape characters

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.590 
doesn't automatically escape characters
such<00:05:08.390> as<00:05:08.420> a<00:05:09.310> single<00:05:10.310> quotation<00:05:10.670> mark<00:05:10.880> so

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
such as a single quotation mark so

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.970 
such as a single quotation mark so
usually<00:05:12.020> when<00:05:12.140> you<00:05:12.260> submit<00:05:12.620> data<00:05:12.770> with<00:05:12.950> a

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
usually when you submit data with a

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.430 
usually when you submit data with a
single<00:05:13.340> quotation<00:05:13.640> I<00:05:13.850> can<00:05:14.260> automatically<00:05:15.260> put

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
single quotation I can automatically put

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.650 
single quotation I can automatically put
a<00:05:15.470> forward<00:05:15.740> slash<00:05:15.890> in<00:05:16.130> front<00:05:16.400> of<00:05:16.520> it<00:05:16.640> as<00:05:17.600> a

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
a forward slash in front of it as a

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.990 
a forward slash in front of it as a
security<00:05:18.200> measure<00:05:18.500> but<00:05:19.160> at<00:05:19.280> the<00:05:19.400> moment<00:05:19.820> I've

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
security measure but at the moment I've

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.960 
security measure but at the moment I've
got<00:05:20.180> it<00:05:20.300> disabled<00:05:20.930> in<00:05:21.020> my<00:05:21.140> PHP<00:05:21.560> ini<00:05:22.040> file<00:05:22.460> so

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
got it disabled in my PHP ini file so

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.460 
got it disabled in my PHP ini file so
that's<00:05:23.150> the<00:05:23.270> first<00:05:23.570> way<00:05:23.810> we're<00:05:24.080> going<00:05:24.230> to<00:05:24.320> look

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
that's the first way we're going to look

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.550 
that's the first way we're going to look
at<00:05:24.650> protecting<00:05:25.280> against<00:05:25.790> SQL<00:05:26.300> injection<00:05:26.810> so

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
at protecting against SQL injection so

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.900 
at protecting against SQL injection so
let's<00:05:27.740> first<00:05:27.920> of<00:05:28.040> all<00:05:28.160> just<00:05:28.340> comment<00:05:28.760> out

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
let's first of all just comment out

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.750 
let's first of all just comment out
these<00:05:29.210> and<00:05:29.650> let's<00:05:30.650> go<00:05:30.830> ahead<00:05:31.070> and<00:05:31.280> echo<00:05:31.730> out

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
these and let's go ahead and echo out

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.620 
these and let's go ahead and echo out
the<00:05:32.060> username

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
the username

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.600 
the username
and<00:05:33.720> we'll<00:05:34.230> break<00:05:34.440> down<00:05:34.500> the<00:05:34.770> line<00:05:35.100> and<00:05:35.430> we

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
and we'll break down the line and we

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.030 
and we'll break down the line and we
will<00:05:35.790> echo<00:05:36.150> out<00:05:36.180> the<00:05:36.630> password<00:05:37.290> as<00:05:37.410> well<00:05:37.440> and

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
will echo out the password as well and

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.470 
will echo out the password as well and
I'm<00:05:38.280> going<00:05:38.430> to<00:05:38.490> show<00:05:38.640> you<00:05:38.700> exactly<00:05:39.120> what<00:05:39.450> I

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
I'm going to show you exactly what I

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.980 
I'm going to show you exactly what I
mean

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
mean

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.340 
mean
now<00:05:40.530> remember<00:05:40.890> earlier<00:05:41.010> we<00:05:41.340> talked<00:05:41.640> about

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.350 
now remember earlier we talked about

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.880 
now remember earlier we talked about
quotation<00:05:43.350> marks<00:05:43.740> inside<00:05:45.620> inside<00:05:46.620> our

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
quotation marks inside inside our

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.720 
quotation marks inside inside our
queries<00:05:47.640> and<00:05:48.140> quotation<00:05:49.140> marks<00:05:49.380> are<00:05:49.730> deadly

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730 
queries and quotation marks are deadly

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.760 
queries and quotation marks are deadly
as<00:05:50.850> far<00:05:51.120> as<00:05:51.300> query<00:05:51.780> goes<00:05:52.080> because<00:05:52.320> what<00:05:52.590> people

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
as far as query goes because what people

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.590 
as far as query goes because what people
can<00:05:53.040> do<00:05:53.190> like<00:05:53.430> we<00:05:53.550> like<00:05:54.000> we<00:05:54.150> and<00:05:54.300> looked<00:05:54.480> at

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 
can do like we like we and looked at

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.150 
can do like we like we and looked at
earlier<00:05:54.930> is<00:05:55.110> end<00:05:55.710> a<00:05:56.010> specific<00:05:57.890> statement<00:05:58.890> if

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
earlier is end a specific statement if

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.580 
earlier is end a specific statement if
you<00:05:59.190> like<00:05:59.310> and<00:05:59.820> and<00:06:00.420> create<00:06:01.140> something<00:06:01.350> else

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
you like and and create something else

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.430 
you like and and create something else

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
so we can add or key words in and we can

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.760 
so we can add or key words in and we can

end different in different lines or n

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.980 
end different in different lines or n
different<00:06:08.010> like<00:06:08.370> we're<00:06:08.820> equals<00:06:09.390> and<00:06:09.780> we<00:06:09.870> can
