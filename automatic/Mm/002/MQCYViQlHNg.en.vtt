you'll see that we have a battery that's

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.679 
you'll see that we have a battery that's
sticking<00:00:29.039> out<00:00:29.189> right<00:00:29.460> now<00:00:30.029> we<00:00:30.090> have<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> nine

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
sticking out right now we have a nine

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.139 
sticking out right now we have a nine
cell<00:00:31.019> battery<00:00:31.439> in<00:00:31.619> there<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.790> can<00:00:32.969> also

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
cell battery in there and you can also

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.810 
cell battery in there and you can also
get<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.930> six<00:00:34.440> cell<00:00:34.739> battery<00:00:34.770> which<00:00:35.370> would<00:00:35.579> not

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
get a six cell battery which would not

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.720 
get a six cell battery which would not
stick<00:00:36.180> out<00:00:36.890> obviously<00:00:37.890> advantage<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.520> nine

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
stick out obviously advantage the nine

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.959 
stick out obviously advantage the nine
cell<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.750> have<00:00:40.260> longer<00:00:40.680> battery<00:00:40.890> life<00:00:41.100> at

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
cell is that have longer battery life at

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.350 
cell is that have longer battery life at
the<00:00:42.180> cost<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.840> being<00:00:43.410> heavier<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.430> also<00:00:44.730> is

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
the cost of it being heavier it also is

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.119 
the cost of it being heavier it also is
sticking<00:00:45.899> out<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.200> raises<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.739> notebook

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
mention about the XPS 713 30 is the fact

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.020 
mention about the XPS 713 30 is the fact
it<00:02:33.220> has<00:02:33.370> an<00:02:33.580> LED<00:02:33.760> backlit<00:02:34.540> display<00:02:35.820> that<00:02:36.820> means

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
it has an LED backlit display that means

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.710 
it has an LED backlit display that means
a<00:02:37.120> few<00:02:37.330> things<00:02:37.600> first<00:02:38.290> of<00:02:38.470> all<00:02:38.590> it's<00:02:38.890> more

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
a few things first of all it's more

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.270 
a few things first of all it's more
energy-efficient<00:02:40.720> than<00:02:40.840> your<00:02:41.200> regular<00:02:41.410> type

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
energy-efficient than your regular type

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.270 
energy-efficient than your regular type
of<00:02:42.310> display<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:42.820> get<00:02:43.060> from<00:02:43.239> their<00:02:43.390> books<00:02:44.280> also

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
of display to get from their books also

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.460 
of display to get from their books also
it<00:02:45.610> enables<00:02:45.850> Dell<00:02:46.390> to<00:02:46.660> keep<00:02:47.020> the<00:02:47.170> weight<00:02:47.440> down

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
it enables Dell to keep the weight down

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.630 
it enables Dell to keep the weight down
off<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.520> screen<00:02:48.880> it's<00:02:49.150> a<00:02:49.320> much<00:02:50.320> lighter<00:02:50.860> type

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
off the screen it's a much lighter type

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.550 
off the screen it's a much lighter type
of<00:02:51.820> screen<00:02:52.120> it<00:02:52.690> also<00:02:52.810> means<00:02:53.140> it's<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.380> little

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
of screen it also means it's a little

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.199 
of screen it also means it's a little
thinner<00:02:53.920> so<00:02:54.130> you<00:02:54.220> can<00:02:54.400> see<00:02:54.610> there's<00:02:54.880> a<00:02:54.940> little

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
thinner so you can see there's a little

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.630 
thinner so you can see there's a little
bit<00:02:55.330> of<00:02:55.360> flex<00:02:56.290> going<00:02:56.560> on<00:02:56.769> with<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.250> screen

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
bit of flex going on with the screen

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.050 
bit of flex going on with the screen
because<00:02:57.940> it's<00:02:58.299> thinner<00:02:58.630> but<00:02:59.410> it's<00:02:59.709> also<00:03:00.060> it's

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
because it's thinner but it's also it's

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.930 
because it's thinner but it's also it's
also<00:03:01.299> more<00:03:01.600> resistant<00:03:02.260> to<00:03:02.489> bumps<00:03:03.489> and<00:03:03.670> getting

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
also more resistant to bumps and getting

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.060 
also more resistant to bumps and getting
damaged<00:03:04.360> so<00:03:04.630> there's<00:03:05.290> no<00:03:05.500> concern<00:03:05.890> with

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
damaged so there's no concern with

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.460 
damaged so there's no concern with
having<00:03:06.459> some<00:03:06.700> of<00:03:06.790> that<00:03:06.910> flex<00:03:07.299> there<00:03:07.600> that<00:03:07.870> you

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
having some of that flex there that you

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.199 
having some of that flex there that you
wouldn't<00:03:09.040> normally<00:03:09.130> be<00:03:09.459> somewhere<00:03:09.820> concerned

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
wouldn't normally be somewhere concerned

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.650 
wouldn't normally be somewhere concerned
about<00:03:10.480> on<00:03:10.890> regular<00:03:11.890> notebooks<00:03:12.400> now<00:03:13.030> you'll

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
about on regular notebooks now you'll

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.570 
about on regular notebooks now you'll
see<00:03:13.840> it's<00:03:14.049> a<00:03:14.110> glossy<00:03:14.350> screen<00:03:14.739> I've<00:03:15.130> got<00:03:15.400> the

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
see it's a glossy screen I've got the

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.550 
see it's a glossy screen I've got the
brightest<00:03:15.940> down<00:03:16.390> all<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:16.959> way<00:03:17.049> to<00:03:17.110> the<00:03:17.380> bottom

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
brightest down all the way to the bottom

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.949 
brightest down all the way to the bottom
level<00:03:17.890> but<00:03:18.190> if<00:03:18.280> I<00:03:18.430> start<00:03:19.299> increasing<00:03:19.450> in

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
level but if I start increasing in

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.110 
level but if I start increasing in
theory<00:03:20.200> it<00:03:20.380> gets<00:03:20.560> right<00:03:21.400> enough<00:03:21.610> to<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:21.910> point

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
theory it gets right enough to the point

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.050 
theory it gets right enough to the point
that<00:03:22.299> you<00:03:22.480> will<00:03:22.660> have<00:03:23.260> reduced<00:03:23.970> reflection<00:03:24.970> on

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
that you will have reduced reflection on

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.690 
that you will have reduced reflection on
the<00:03:25.180> screen<00:03:25.540> is<00:03:25.780> actually<00:03:26.680> a<00:03:26.709> 300<00:03:27.459> NIT

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
thing about an LED backlit display is

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.930 
thing about an LED backlit display is
it's<00:03:40.840> more<00:03:41.019> power<00:03:41.290> efficient<00:03:41.920> so<00:03:42.190> you<00:03:42.760> have<00:03:42.910> a

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
it's more power efficient so you have a

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:43.860 
it's more power efficient so you have a
