00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.219
 hello thank you very much for being in a 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.929
 new video of this channel today 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.730
 let's talk about a new fashion that 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.670
 is emerging in the world of 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.400
 smartphones and it's what I call fashion 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.740
 premium this fashion that I really do not 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.570
 It is pleasing me at all but 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.609
 let's start talking about a bit of 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.039
 history in the fashions of smartphones 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.679
 and it's like everything in the commercial world 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.300
 there are tendencies which most 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.280
 the competitors continue to be able 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.829
 remain in the market for example 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.870
 before the first iphone came out the 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.910
 most mobile devices and 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.100
 smartphones were not totally from 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.260
 touch screen once the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.870
 iphone marked a very very trend 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.460
 important by making almost all 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.160
 smartphones now use screens 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.500
 tactile another very marked trend was 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.780
 the one shown by the galaxy note to 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.000
 introduce an extremely large screen 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.160
 by then some started to 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.189
 laugh at that device to say that 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.970
 it was ridiculous however some months 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.890
 after 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.480
 most companies started to launch 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.790
 also devices with screens 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.250
 huge which are now extremely 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.560
 common among those who like the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.210
 technology after going to the extreme of 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.430
 the big screens came the fashion of 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.890
 the minis that are from before and with the 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.620
 xperia had tried to introduce and if 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.320
 with some success with the x8 mini and the 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.540
 x10 mini if ​​you know someone else 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.880
 precursor of mini fashion would be good 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.800
 I mentioned it because many times you 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.570
 you know more than me so it would be good if 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.670
 the mentions in the comments but in 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.890
 they are and had already tried the mini 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.410
 however afterwards he abandoned them and 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.960
 then samsung also tried with the 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.300
 s3 mini and from there came more minis and 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.130
 right now there are many minis that actually 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.850
 they are not so small anymore because they come with 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.410
 4.5 inch screens 4.7 but in 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.750
 order is a fashion that some can 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.850
 like and some others are not and by their 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.240
 part no longer calls them minis as in their 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.680
 beginnings but changed to z1 compact that the 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.869
 it's really interesting because 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.030
 keeps all the power in one size 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.310
 smaller but anyway here we are 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.270
 to talk about premium fashion and how to 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.610
 said 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.500
 of the other fashions that maybe yes we 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.450
 may everyone like it, I think this 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.730
 new premium we will not like the 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.830
 most since it tries to introduce 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.530
 market devices that had already been 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.780
 presented a few months ago but with 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.360
 reinforced specifications like that a 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.180
 little more powerful and obviously to a 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.910
 highest price yet but there is something 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.010
 that caused this trend or this fashion 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.290
 premium and is that rumors indicate that 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.860
 the galaxy s 5 will be coming soon 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.930
 premium or prime and the htc one m 8 premium 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.030
 or prime too but there is a brand that 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.910
 has caused this movement by 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.160
 of htc and samsung and it's the jee since 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.440
 soon the next week is going to 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.010
 officially present to the whole world 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.230
 he chooses three and he has already had this 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.540
 power to influence other 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.300
 marks because of the success he had with him 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.310
 the g2 the truth a very very device 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.350
 good so with this axis 3 is 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.150
 creating a lot of expectation and so much 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.490
 samsung as htc know they can lose 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.459
 a lot of market and try to reinforce 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.840
 launching premium or prime versions of 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.510
 your devices 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.530
 it is assumed that they were already premium or the most 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.720
 high of its range 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.670
 this trend disgusts me completely 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.160
 especially by the people who 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.010
 they just bought a galaxy s 5 or a htc 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.230
 one thinking that it would be the maximum in 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.090
 long these people who already 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.890
 they bought they will be very disappointed 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.470
 to see that they just bought it and now 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.810
 a new premium or premium version came out 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.940
 with better specifications with better 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.620
 camera or with other features that 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.840
 they do not have the device they just 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.180
 buy and in personal opinion I feel that 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.440
 they will not be so successful because the 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.930
 most of the people who are 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.239
 eager to buy the device already 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.829
 they bought it and I do not think that in a few 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.650
 months buy a new device 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.780
 even if it's your favorite brand but that 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.610
 is my opinion to me I do not like this 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.319
 premium trend however I 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.810
 I would like to read your comments 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.370
 you think of these premiums you think they are 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.829
 good for the market for the 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.690
 competition or you think they are bad leave it 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:18.200
 in the comments and see you the 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.200
 next
