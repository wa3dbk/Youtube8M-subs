that to replicate the scale of ant-man
we've<00:02:41.579> built<00:02:41.879> the<00:02:42.000> ant<00:02:42.180> here<00:02:42.599> but<00:02:43.260> then<00:02:43.409> we've

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
we've built the ant here but then we've

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.380 
we've built the ant here but then we've
given<00:02:43.859> kids<00:02:44.219> the<00:02:44.430> opportunity<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.239> build

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
given kids the opportunity to build

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.690 
given kids the opportunity to build
large<00:02:45.840> Lego<00:02:46.230> bricks<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:46.859> simulate<00:02:47.099> the<00:02:47.489> fact

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
large Lego bricks to simulate the fact

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.300 
large Lego bricks to simulate the fact
that<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.970> ant<00:02:48.150> is<00:02:48.450> actually<00:02:49.260> scaled<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.280> the

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
that the ant is actually scaled to the

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.410 
that the ant is actually scaled to the
