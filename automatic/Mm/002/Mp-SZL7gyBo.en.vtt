let's<00:00:58.949> go<00:00:59.070> guys<00:00:59.280> here's<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.940> neat<00:01:00.120> concept<00:01:00.329> this

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
let's go guys here's a neat concept this

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.090 
let's go guys here's a neat concept this
one<00:01:00.989> actually<00:01:01.109> spent<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> lot<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.620> time<00:01:01.739> with

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
one actually spent a lot of time with

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.560 
one actually spent a lot of time with
but<00:01:02.550> not<00:01:02.760> for<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.059> reasons<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.510> might

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
but not for the reasons that you might

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.210 
but not for the reasons that you might
be<00:01:03.719> thinking<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.199> whole<00:01:04.290> point<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.830> this

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
be thinking the whole point of this

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.690 
be thinking the whole point of this
particular<00:01:05.640> map<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.479> stay<00:01:06.950> above<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.549> know

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
particular map is to stay above you know

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.300 
particular map is to stay above you know
ground<00:01:09.060> by<00:01:09.360> holding<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.229> various<00:01:11.070> items

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
ground by holding on to various items

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.830 
ground by holding on to various items
and<00:01:11.670> beans<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.090> all<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.390> stuff<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:12.600> it's<00:01:12.750> an

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
and beans and all that stuff so it's an

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.690 
and beans and all that stuff so it's an
earthquake<00:01:12.960> going<00:01:13.470> on<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.250> just<00:01:14.400> have<00:01:14.610> to

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
earthquake going on and you just have to

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.370 
earthquake going on and you just have to
hold<00:01:14.909> on<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.299> something<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.869> prevent

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
hold on to something and prevent

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.020 
hold on to something and prevent
yourself<00:01:16.710> from<00:01:16.890> falling<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.549> it's<00:01:17.790> that

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
yourself from falling that it's that

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.270 
yourself from falling that it's that
sounds<00:01:18.420> totally<00:01:18.659> easy<00:01:19.020> right<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.590> try<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.100> watch

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
sounds totally easy right I try to watch

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.380 
sounds totally easy right I try to watch
where<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.580> replay<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.939> see<00:01:21.060> what<00:01:21.240> other

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
where the replay to see what other

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.280 
where the replay to see what other
people<00:01:21.689> were<00:01:21.780> doing<00:01:21.840> but<00:01:22.200> unfortunately

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
people were doing but unfortunately

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.840 
people were doing but unfortunately
because<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.040> randomness<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.490> things

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
because of the randomness of things

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.999 
because of the randomness of things
moving<00:01:24.150> around<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.869> didn't<00:01:25.229> get<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.439> see<00:01:25.710> what

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
moving around you didn't get to see what

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.410 
moving around you didn't get to see what
people<00:01:26.220> are<00:01:26.280> actually<00:01:26.400> doing<00:01:26.790> because<00:01:27.119> even

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
people are actually doing because even

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.780 
people are actually doing because even
the<00:01:27.540> replays<00:01:28.080> would<00:01:28.590> have<00:01:28.770> randomness<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.549> it

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
the replays would have randomness in it

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.460 
the replays would have randomness in it
therefore<00:01:30.390> making<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.750> replay<00:01:31.049> completely

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
therefore making the replay completely

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.109 
therefore making the replay completely
useless<00:01:31.650> don't<00:01:32.369> worry<00:01:32.549> I'm<00:01:32.759> gonna<00:01:32.909> show<00:01:33.090> you

was like man after like 16 minutes I was

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.660 
was like man after like 16 minutes I was
like<00:03:28.109> whoo<00:03:28.290> i'm<00:03:28.739> a-goin<00:03:29.129> just<00:03:29.310> kill<00:03:29.489> myself

like whoo i'm a-goin just kill myself

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.509 
like whoo i'm a-goin just kill myself
because<00:03:30.269> I<00:03:30.659> think<00:03:30.989> that's<00:03:31.379> enough<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:32.310> then<00:03:32.489> I

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
because I think that's enough and then I

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.490 
because I think that's enough and then I
went<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:32.909> checked<00:03:33.120> out<00:03:33.329> the<00:03:33.599> person<00:03:33.989> that<00:03:34.140> had

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
went and checked out the person that had

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.140 
went and checked out the person that had
the<00:03:34.709> highest<00:03:34.980> score<00:03:35.549> you<00:03:35.579> see<00:03:35.819> here's<00:03:36.000> what

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
the highest score you see here's what

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.720 
the highest score you see here's what
happens<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.810> game<00:03:37.049> lasts<00:03:37.409> for<00:03:37.950> a<00:03:38.159> fixed

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
happens the game lasts for a fixed

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.129 
happens the game lasts for a fixed
amount<00:03:38.849> of<00:03:39.060> time<00:03:39.239> and<00:03:39.420> I<00:03:39.450> think<00:03:39.510> it's<00:03:39.810> about<00:03:39.989> an

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
amount of time and I think it's about an

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.020 
amount of time and I think it's about an
hour<00:03:40.290> but<00:03:40.829> the<00:03:40.920> difficulty<00:03:41.280> level<00:03:41.549> stopped

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
hour but the difficulty level stopped

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.940 
hour but the difficulty level stopped
after<00:03:42.269> about<00:03:42.690> 20<00:03:43.200> minutes<00:03:43.230> or<00:03:43.560> so<00:03:43.680> after<00:03:43.889> you

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
after about 20 minutes or so after you

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.289 
after about 20 minutes or so after you
get<00:03:44.069> through<00:03:44.099> it<00:03:44.310> X<00:03:44.489> number<00:03:44.670> of<00:03:44.819> ways<00:03:45.060> it

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
get through it X number of ways it

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:46.430 
get through it X number of ways it
seemed<00:03:45.510> that<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.750> difficulty<00:03:46.200> kind<00:03:46.349> of

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
seemed that the difficulty kind of

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.869 
seemed that the difficulty kind of
plateaus<00:03:46.799> and<00:03:46.829> that's<00:03:47.190> pretty<00:03:47.280> much<00:03:47.400> it<00:03:47.519> so

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
plateaus and that's pretty much it so

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.280 
plateaus and that's pretty much it so
what<00:03:48.030> you<00:03:48.120> end<00:03:48.269> up<00:03:48.299> doing<00:03:48.359> after<00:03:48.900> that<00:03:49.079> is<00:03:49.260> just

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
what you end up doing after that is just

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.440 
what you end up doing after that is just
racing<00:03:49.650> it's<00:03:50.040> time<00:03:50.250> to<00:03:50.459> get<00:03:50.549> as<00:03:50.670> many<00:03:50.760> of<00:03:51.030> your

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
racing it's time to get as many of your

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.690 
racing it's time to get as many of your
squirrels<00:03:51.900> across<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.409> the<00:03:52.530> other<00:03:52.560> side<00:03:52.709> now
