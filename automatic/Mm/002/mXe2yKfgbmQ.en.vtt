00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:14.269
 today is May 10th on a grape bush 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.750
 inflorescence period 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:23.359
 that is, the bush advances begins to grow 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:28.949
 inflorescences here they are the size of the inflorescence now 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:32.840
 from two to four centimeters and I 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.130
 I want to tell you now about one 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.460
 operations 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:44.610
 optional but desirable on grades 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:47.300
 with tight breasts this operation is called 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.300
 treatment 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:55.540
 undress for extension 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.040
 gibberellin concentration solution 15 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.620
 20 milligrams per liter 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.020
 not on the channel there are several videos 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.680
 about applying or being pregnant on 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:10.470
 Vineyard ssylochku and not one 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:13.630
 several links you see at the top left 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.210
 in these videos I tell what is 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.720
 gabi relay how to use it on 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.140
 a vineyard but I will say a few now 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.220
 of words 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:27.670
 short and beryllium in the league gave novaya 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.100
 acid is a plant phyto hormone 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:34.060
 which is present in all greens 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:37.420
 parts of plants and grapes he also 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:41.130
 present in particular berries 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:45.880
 berries hormone phytohormones and berlin 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:51.390
 is produced by seeds and contributes 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:56.640
 growth of sugar accumulation 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:03.420
 ripening berries increase their size 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.420
 growth regulator and berlin lengthens 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.729
 lengthens plant stems improves 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.860
 seed germination 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.750
 improves flowering and 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.890
 is absolutely harmless to 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:20.800
 warm-blooded animals for humans for bees 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.459
 so how do you get it microbiologically 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:30.280
 through the waste products 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:32.580
 fungus and how henry lynn lengthens plants 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.250
 and when processing 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.400
 gibberellin solution 15-20 milligrams 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.910
 per liter of inflorescences of grape inflorescences 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.410
 on the nomination when they are sized from 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.810
 two to four centimeters 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:52.880
 allows you to lengthen the bunch 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:56.690
 one and a half to two times to increase its size 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.180
 thus to varieties with dense breasts is 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.920
 allows you to discharge a bunch 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:06.670
 that is, the berries will not choke will not 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:11.030
 they will not appear in the berries berries 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:13.400
 deform when ling is white 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.190
 powder well soluble in alcohol and 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.150
 poorly soluble in water and here it is 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.500
 i cooked 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:24.380
 choose the solution lina I poured the sample 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.620
 dry and berlin here's a bottle 300 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.350
 milligrams but I bought such a hinge he 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.960
 sold in specialized 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.700
 horticultural stores 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:38.840
 I poured it out at 300 mg 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:41.870
 here the bottle and poured 10 milliliters 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.450
 Alcohol took a syringe 10 milliliters 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.330
 alcohol and dissolved perfectly 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.700
 soluble in alcohol ie 300 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.190
 milligrams did not believe in 10 milliliters 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.820
 alcohol that is in one milliliter 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:59.660
 is 30 milligrams and pregnant 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:02.650
 to take 15 milligrams of death to us 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:06.830
 no need to type half a milliliter of solution 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:10.270
 that is, half a cube like this one here 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.270
 cubes im syringe 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:24.689
 so I scored half a cube 

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:29.129
 solution and berylin and dissolve 

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:33.680
 it's 15 milligrams and dissolve it in 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:33.680
 one liter of water 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:44.509
 water and mix everything now 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:46.800
 me solution and pregnant 15 milligrams 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:50.360
 on 1 liter 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:55.680
 this solution we will process 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:58.500
 Inflorescence on the nomination by the way such 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.900
 alcohol solution and berlin solution 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:08.150
 can be stored for a year in the dark 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:13.830
 cool place pour solution 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:21.259
 we need the capacity and immerse 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:24.259
 the inflorescences in the solution did not take one 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:24.259
 the second 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:33.590
 third and so all 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:41.320
 inflorescences and berlin only works there 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:41.320
 where does he get contact action 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:49.940
 So I go through the bush 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:52.250
 which has very dense clusters here 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.740
 look at two identical inflorescences 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.550
 about the same with the same 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.030
 section 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:02.480
 and one of them here is this inflorescence 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:06.020
 escape with two inflorescences I circled him 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.280
 I will leave the white cambric for control 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.430
 i mean i won't these 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.440
 inflorescences handle and Berlin and about 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.910
 after some time we 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.060
 compare the treated in your mouth here with 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:21.230
 unprocessed 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:24.820
 and continue to process 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:31.730
 inflorescence and pregnant this operation 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:35.780
 allows not to manually cut 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:41.560
 berries with nail scissors or 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:44.560
 other devices if the bunch is very 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.560
 dense 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:55.129
 we'll see 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:07:01.479
 and I hope we will see from you in this 

00:06:55.129 --> 00:07:01.479
 and this is a tree peony
