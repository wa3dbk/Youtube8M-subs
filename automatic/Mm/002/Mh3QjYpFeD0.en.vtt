used<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.719> own<00:00:54.899> but<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.140> think<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.469> got<00:00:55.680> it

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
used to own but I think I got it

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.860 
used to own but I think I got it
second<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.610> Charles<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.149> after<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.420> realized<00:00:57.750> I

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
second in Charles and after I realized I

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.869 
second in Charles and after I realized I
didn't<00:00:58.140> like<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.620> gave<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.129> back<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.670> that

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
didn't like it I gave it back and that

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.660 
didn't like it I gave it back and that
was<00:01:00.059> life<00:01:00.629> after<00:01:00.870> life<00:01:01.230> by<00:01:01.500> Kate<00:01:01.770> Atkinson<00:01:01.949> I

I've<00:01:49.560> been<00:01:49.740> very<00:01:49.950> excited<00:01:50.939> for<00:01:51.090> this<00:01:51.210> one<00:01:51.479> this

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
I've been very excited for this one this

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.200 
I've been very excited for this one this
is<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.229> bit<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.770> fairy<00:01:53.040> tale<00:01:53.369> retelling<00:01:54.030> but

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
is a bit of a fairy tale retelling but

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.300 
is a bit of a fairy tale retelling but
with<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.390> darker<00:01:54.899> element<00:01:55.470> very<00:01:55.890> strange

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
with a darker element very strange

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.399 
with a darker element very strange
aspects<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.119> book<00:01:57.509> seem<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.960> right<00:01:58.110> up<00:01:58.290> my

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
aspects to this book seem to right up my

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.410 
aspects to this book seem to right up my
alley<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:58.829> think<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.250> do<00:01:59.310> have<00:01:59.579> this<00:01:59.939> marked<00:02:00.270> as

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
alley I think I do have this marked as

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.300 
alley I think I do have this marked as
red<00:02:00.689> because<00:02:01.079> technically<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.770> think<00:02:01.950> I

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
red because technically I think I

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.340 
red because technically I think I
finished<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.880> but<00:02:03.030> if<00:02:03.149> I'm<00:02:03.270> honest<00:02:03.659> my<00:02:04.140> eyes

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
finished it but if I'm honest my eyes

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.800 
finished it but if I'm honest my eyes
glazed<00:02:04.860> over<00:02:05.070> for<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.460> lot<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:05.790> this<00:02:06.240> so

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
glazed over for a lot of this so

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.979 
glazed over for a lot of this so
realistically<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.560> probably<00:02:07.950> read<00:02:08.340> maybe<00:02:08.989> 85%

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
realistically I probably read maybe 85%

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.230 
realistically I probably read maybe 85%
or<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:11.129> for<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:11.940> I

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
or so for this I

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.150 
or so for this I
do<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.390> have<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.660> say<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:13.140> just<00:02:13.470> was<00:02:13.800> wasn't<00:02:14.010> a

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
do you have to say I just was wasn't a

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.680 
do you have to say I just was wasn't a
fan<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.550> writing<00:02:14.880> style<00:02:15.060> on<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.360> one<00:02:15.480> hand

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
fan of the writing style on the one hand

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.080 
fan of the writing style on the one hand
it<00:02:15.810> did<00:02:15.960> feel<00:02:16.170> quite<00:02:16.500> beautiful<00:02:17.250> but<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.760> felt

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
it did feel quite beautiful but I felt

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.630 
it did feel quite beautiful but I felt
myself<00:02:18.270> really<00:02:18.990> detached<00:02:19.470> from<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.490> just

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
myself really detached from it I just

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.880 
myself really detached from it I just
never<00:02:20.970> felt<00:02:21.270> engaged<00:02:21.840> with<00:02:22.320> the<00:02:22.410> story<00:02:22.770> I

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
never felt engaged with the story I

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.320 
never felt engaged with the story I
never<00:02:23.010> connected<00:02:23.430> with<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.880> characters<00:02:24.270> and

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
never connected with the characters and

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.330 
never connected with the characters and
I<00:02:24.480> don't<00:02:24.660> ever<00:02:24.900> I'm<00:02:25.320> not<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.980> kind<00:02:26.160> of<00:02:26.190> person

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
I don't ever I'm not the kind of person

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.060 
I don't ever I'm not the kind of person
who<00:02:26.610> has<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:27.060> like<00:02:27.330> a<00:02:27.570> character<00:02:28.140> at<00:02:28.260> all<00:02:28.410> but

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
who has to like a character at all but

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.800 
who has to like a character at all but
but<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.310> at<00:02:29.400> least<00:02:29.430> have<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.790> feel<00:02:30.030> engaged<00:02:30.300> with

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
but I at least have to feel engaged with

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.710 
but I at least have to feel engaged with
them<00:02:30.990> and<00:02:31.260> in<00:02:31.320> this<00:02:31.500> book<00:02:32.130> I<00:02:32.310> did<00:02:32.640> not<00:02:32.820> really

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
them and in this book I did not really

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.660 
them and in this book I did not really
feel<00:02:34.110> for<00:02:34.530> anybody<00:02:35.010> so<00:02:35.310> it's<00:02:35.430> just<00:02:35.520> really

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
feel for anybody so it's just really

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.280

hard<00:02:35.880> for<00:02:35.970> me<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.210> feel<00:02:36.540> connected<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:37.080> this

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
hard for me to feel connected to this

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.810 
hard for me to feel connected to this

these books probably pretty obviously

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.820 
these books probably pretty obviously
since<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:42.900> is<00:03:42.990> about<00:03:43.110> books<00:03:43.380> I<00:03:43.530> won't<00:03:43.710> be

that<00:04:59.260> I<00:04:59.350> didn't<00:04:59.620> finish<00:04:59.830> but<00:05:00.460> for<00:05:00.640> me<00:05:00.730> to

that I didn't finish but for me to

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.900 
that I didn't finish but for me to
invest<00:05:01.270> so<00:05:01.780> much<00:05:01.840> time<00:05:02.250> into<00:05:03.250> a<00:05:03.280> series<00:05:03.700> and

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
invest so much time into a series and

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.910 
invest so much time into a series and
upfront<00:05:04.420> I<00:05:04.660> just<00:05:04.930> don't<00:05:05.110> like<00:05:05.320> series<00:05:05.710> very

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:05.920 
upfront I just don't like series very

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.620 
upfront I just don't like series very
much<00:05:06.070> to<00:05:06.250> begin<00:05:06.370> with<00:05:06.610> I<00:05:06.730> first<00:05:07.120> stand-alones

it has to be just I have to feel that

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.760 
it has to be just I have to feel that
it's<00:05:10.750> one<00:05:10.900> of<00:05:10.990> the<00:05:11.080> best<00:05:11.320> books<00:05:11.500> I've<00:05:11.740> ever

thought<00:05:14.020> it<00:05:14.140> was<00:05:14.260> great<00:05:14.530> I<00:05:14.560> would<00:05:14.800> probably

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
thought it was great I would probably

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.040 
thought it was great I would probably
have<00:05:15.190> given<00:05:15.400> it<00:05:15.640> an<00:05:15.790> 8<00:05:16.000> out<00:05:16.150> of<00:05:16.180> 10<00:05:16.480> if<00:05:16.810> I<00:05:16.930> had

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
have given it an 8 out of 10 if I had

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
finished it maybe 4 out of 5 but this

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.610 
finished it maybe 4 out of 5 but this
wasn't<00:05:19.390> enough<00:05:19.600> for<00:05:20.080> me<00:05:20.200> to<00:05:20.290> feel<00:05:20.440> like<00:05:20.500> I

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
wasn't enough for me to feel like I

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.650 
wasn't enough for me to feel like I
wanted<00:05:20.980> to<00:05:21.100> finish<00:05:21.400> it<00:05:21.610> but<00:05:22.180> if<00:05:22.300> you<00:05:22.390> want<00:05:22.570> to
