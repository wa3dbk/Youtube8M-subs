current project or one of them this is
going<00:00:06.660> to<00:00:06.990> be<00:00:07.109> a<00:00:07.189> cordwood<00:00:09.170> constructed

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:10.700 
going to be a cordwood constructed

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.910 
going to be a cordwood constructed
building<00:00:11.750> just<00:00:12.750> an<00:00:12.900> outbuilding<00:00:13.259> keep<00:00:13.710> some

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
building just an outbuilding keep some

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.800 
building just an outbuilding keep some
things<00:00:13.950> in<00:00:14.370> there<00:00:14.549> maybe<00:00:15.299> some<00:00:15.599> chickens<00:00:17.810> and

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
things in there maybe some chickens and

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.380 
things in there maybe some chickens and
right<00:00:19.050> now<00:00:19.289> what<00:00:19.740> I've<00:00:19.890> got<00:00:19.920> so<00:00:20.520> far<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:21.119> the

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
right now what I've got so far is the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.990 
right now what I've got so far is the
foundation<00:00:22.170> built<00:00:22.410> out<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:22.970> River<00:00:23.970> rocks<00:00:24.269> and

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
foundation built out of River rocks and

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.870 
foundation built out of River rocks and
I'm<00:00:27.000> in<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.240> process<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:28.400> stacking<00:00:29.400> the

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
I'm in the process of stacking the

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.830 
I'm in the process of stacking the
lumber<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:31.520> cementing<00:00:32.520> them<00:00:32.640> together<00:00:32.840> so

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
lumber and cementing them together so

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.920 
lumber and cementing them together so
I'm<00:00:33.899> doing<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.350> couple<00:00:35.120> shortcuts<00:00:36.120> because<00:00:36.390> you

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
I'm doing a couple shortcuts because you

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.760 
I'm doing a couple shortcuts because you
know<00:00:37.050> it's<00:00:37.230> not<00:00:37.350> my<00:00:37.559> house<00:00:39.469> it's<00:00:40.469> gonna<00:00:40.559> be

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
know it's not my house it's gonna be

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.619 
know it's not my house it's gonna be
still<00:00:41.070> hollow<00:00:41.399> inside<00:00:43.070> normally<00:00:44.450> what<00:00:45.450> you'd

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
still hollow inside normally what you'd

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.270 
still hollow inside normally what you'd
want<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.870> do<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.050> put<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.350> dab<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.620> cement<00:00:47.129> on

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
want to do is put a dab of cement on

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.450 
want to do is put a dab of cement on
each<00:00:47.430> side<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.180> then<00:00:49.020> stop<00:00:49.530> some<00:00:49.890> sort<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.340> an

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
each side and then stop some sort of an

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.639 
each side and then stop some sort of an
installation<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:51.480> between<00:00:54.320> sawdust<00:00:55.320> mixed

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
installation in between sawdust mixed

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.689 
installation in between sawdust mixed
with<00:00:55.829> some<00:00:56.039> lime<00:00:56.280> or<00:00:57.210> could<00:00:57.870> be<00:00:57.960> fiberglass

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
with some lime or could be fiberglass

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.119 
with some lime or could be fiberglass
it's<00:00:59.699> something<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.149> keep<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.449> air<00:01:00.600> flow<00:01:00.870> down

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
it's something to keep the air flow down

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.789 
it's something to keep the air flow down
but<00:01:02.129> again<00:01:02.760> for<00:01:03.210> my<00:01:03.660> purposes<00:01:04.170> here<00:01:04.439> I'm<00:01:04.589> not

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
but again for my purposes here I'm not

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.500 
but again for my purposes here I'm not
worried<00:01:05.159> about<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.960> and<00:01:06.960> also<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.890> cement

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
worried about it and also in the cement

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.340 
worried about it and also in the cement
what<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.750> would<00:01:09.900> normally<00:01:10.470> do<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.979> add<00:01:11.640> some

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
what you would normally do is add some

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.649 
what you would normally do is add some
sawdust<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.500> has<00:01:13.740> been<00:01:13.979> soaked<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.520> water<00:01:14.760> to

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
sawdust that has been soaked in water to

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.679 
sawdust that has been soaked in water to
allow<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.820> mortar<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.850> set<00:01:18.180> up<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.390> little<00:01:18.540> bit

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
allow the mortar to set up a little bit

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.800 
allow the mortar to set up a little bit
more<00:01:18.869> slowly<00:01:19.340> also<00:01:20.340> with<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:21.060> little<00:01:21.390> bit<00:01:21.630> more

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
more slowly also with a little bit more

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.429 
more slowly also with a little bit more
porous<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:23.509> won't<00:01:24.509> conduct<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.020> heat<00:01:25.170> quite

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
porous and won't conduct the heat quite

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.960 
porous and won't conduct the heat quite
as<00:01:25.590> well<00:01:25.830> but<00:01:26.070> again<00:01:26.790> it's<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.840> chicken<00:01:28.049> coop<00:01:28.290> so

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
as well but again it's a chicken coop so

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.890 
as well but again it's a chicken coop so
that's<00:01:29.970> about<00:01:30.090> where<00:01:30.390> I'm<00:01:30.509> at<00:01:30.659> right<00:01:30.840> now

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
that's about where I'm at right now

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.230 
that's about where I'm at right now
these<00:01:31.439> are<00:01:31.619> gonna<00:01:31.710> be<00:01:31.890> my<00:01:32.040> corner<00:01:32.430> beans<00:01:32.640> I'm

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
these are gonna be my corner beans I'm

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.850 
these are gonna be my corner beans I'm
just<00:01:33.420> gonna<00:01:33.600> go<00:01:33.780> stack<00:01:34.110> straight<00:01:34.560> up<00:01:34.680> each

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
just gonna go stack straight up each

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.060 
just gonna go stack straight up each
side<00:01:35.570> you<00:01:36.570> don't<00:01:36.810> need<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.259> do<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:38.299> you<00:01:39.299> could

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
side you don't need to do that you could

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.730 
side you don't need to do that you could
like<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:41.280> my<00:01:41.460> corner<00:01:41.820> beam<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.810> could<00:01:43.500> just

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
like in my corner beam I could just

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.160 
like in my corner beam I could just
zigzag<00:01:44.540> with<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.659> course<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:47.720> just<00:01:48.720> overlap

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
zigzag with the course of just overlap

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.590 
zigzag with the course of just overlap
the<00:01:49.409> side<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.040> balls<00:01:50.250> basically<00:01:50.600> overlap

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
the side so the balls basically overlap

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.010 
the side so the balls basically overlap
this<00:01:52.290> side<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:53.340> at<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.490> side<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.869> would

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
this side to at that side and that would

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.899 
this side to at that side and that would
make<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.200> good<00:01:55.439> good<00:01:55.799> strong<00:01:56.070> structure<00:01:56.520> either

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
make a good good strong structure either

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.190 
make a good good strong structure either
way<00:01:57.030> there<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.869> is

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
way there it is

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.039 
way there it is
once<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.070> get<00:01:59.130> the<00:02:00.090> wall<00:02:00.270> up<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.479> where<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.780> want

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
once I get the wall up to where I want

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.670 
once I get the wall up to where I want
it<00:02:01.229> I'll<00:02:01.920> cut<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.280> two<00:02:02.520> end<00:02:02.909> walls

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
it I'll cut the two end walls

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.240 
it I'll cut the two end walls
level<00:02:05.400> with<00:02:05.550> one<00:02:05.760> another<00:02:06.060> can<00:02:06.360> do<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.930> later

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
level with one another can do that later

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.840 
level with one another can do that later
but<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.429> gotta<00:02:09.360> go<00:02:09.979> here<00:02:10.979> we<00:02:11.100> are<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.280> just<00:02:11.400> put<00:02:11.819> a

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
but it gotta go here we are I just put a

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.230 
but it gotta go here we are I just put a
couple<00:02:11.940> bags<00:02:12.300> and<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.750> few<00:02:12.990> more<00:02:13.230> logs<00:02:14.010> on<00:02:14.340> it

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.170 

she's<00:02:18.240> certainly<00:02:18.660> shape<00:02:18.930> up
