00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.570
 hello today we are going to prepare a chicken 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.700
 curry let's assign 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.430
 and about half chicken I'm going to 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:16.240
 Use a curry in coconut milk pasta 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:18.520
 carrots apple onion garlic and bay leaf 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.630
 a squeeze of lemon and a little 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.630
 oil let's start 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.110
 The first thing we are going to do is leave 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.520
 bigger chicken 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.520
 let's put a pinch of salt 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.009
 let's squeeze the lemon over 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.380
 We will add spices to taste 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.260
 how the curry we have is in pasta what 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.360
 what we have to do is to let go 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.490
 let's put a little oil and what 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.100
 we are going to remove so that they are released 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.200
 this way we will get a curry 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.210
 liquid that will help the chicken 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.170
 take much more flavor during the time 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.170
 that is macerating 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.180
 and once we have it ready we 're going 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.129
 to wish on the chicken and we'll leave it 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.879
 macerating while we prepare all the 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.879
 other ingredients 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.549
 The first thing we are going to do is chop 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.060
 all the vegetables to prepare a sauce 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.060
 with her 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.460
 we will apply it with a comfortable cut 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.830
 because then once except the sofrito 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.570
 done let's go through the blender 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.220
 and finally we are going to chop a little 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.140
 garlic let's put these three 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.720
 ingredients and then continue with the 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.240
 rest 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.270
 we already have a ready sofrito we're going to 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.920
 beat everything we have added the 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.100
 apples in the sauce but you can 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.210
 put once you 're down all 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.400
 depending on whether you like them to remain 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.970
 whole or they remain within the 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.970
 what is the cream 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.890
 we have that mash ready that we have 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.620
 made with the sofrito so let's 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.050
 put the chicken in the pan 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.810
 We have left more veiling what we take with the 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.909
 liquid with that oil that we made with 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.510
 curry and now we are going to add the 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.510
 rest of the ingredients 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.330
 we add the puree that we have made with the 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.730
 sofrito 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.400
 the next thing is going to be add a glass of 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.920
 coconut milk 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.280
 and we're going to finish covering all the 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.200
 ingredients with water 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.920
 and would leave the following fire 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.260
 slow we are going to put it approximately 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.209
 one hour let's go letting it go 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.400
 doing very little by little and leave 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.440
 evaporating in this way then the cream 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.890
 that we have the sauce will be much more 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.890
 thick 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.060
 and we already have a delicious chicken ready 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.069
 curry we have put a 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.930
 garrison of rice so that it is a 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.159
 much more complete dish if you
