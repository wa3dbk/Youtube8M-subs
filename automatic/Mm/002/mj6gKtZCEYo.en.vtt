00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.619
 installed on your computer you can 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.029

 computer and download and use a 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.700
 image duty tool 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.410
 to take a dvd and use it on your console 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.950
 in case you have the console 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.570
 so come on, this post here is 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.870
 I'll leave the link in the video description 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.379
 As I said, here's the thing you can do. 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.930
 download here for this first link that 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.579
 if you have fast connection recommends 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.899
 that you drop down here if you have 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.270
 Slow connection 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.160
 I recommend that you use manager 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.430
 of downloads if the connection drops you 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.049
 You can continue your download later 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.750
 beauty of some problem that in this link 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.630
 You can try to click here for it to be. 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.130
 redirected to another page for 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.799
 try to download or you can 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.490
 torrent download also if you have 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.490
 Slow connection 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.689
 just remembering to download via torrent 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.780
 you need to have an intimate tone of 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:28.890
 installed on your machine is recommended 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.590
 then the torrent and here are the links need 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.700
 download the three that find one is already 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.229
 enough 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.150
 beauty then you need to download the 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.360
 emulator ii 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.560
 the iso so come on then I will not 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.940
 need to download because it already has in its 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:50.440
 files on my machine are here 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:53.560
 Good if you are of those two files but 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.450
 if you have downloaded this first link 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.220
 which will be compressed this way 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.830
 so you need to unzip 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.250
 it every one that you need to be 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.350
 to compress iso now if you download 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.330
 by torrent it already comes unzipped 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.460
 so you do not have to unpack beauty 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:14.560
 so let's first pack the 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:21.370
 one-click emulator 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:23.170
 right and I'm going to distract here just remembering 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.820
 that to unpack locker room that you 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.820
 need to have an error on your machine 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:37.630
 another uncompressed computer now 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:42.670
 whether to compact iso or bad for whom 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:47.740
 prefer not to extract here will start the 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.040
 extraction process so that this one 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.080
 O 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.850
 if you download by torrent only aiming 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.430
 again it will already be that way 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.940
 so you do not need to unpack until 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.709
 why is not beauty unpacked then 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.780
 being're percent that will take a pause 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.550
 when recording video 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.550
 I'm still beautiful 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:18.160
 beauty then finished unpacking 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:22.090
 here the file beauty then we go 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:27.400
 do now take this file cut 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:29.860
 it and play inside the folder isos that 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.750
 is in here let me come back here okay 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:38.049
 here inside the emulator folder that was 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:46.780
 uncompressed beauty nor here open think 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:51.970
 That's enough laughs and I put it here. 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:54.390
 here I ran away word to this 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.390
 beauty 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:08.019
 so let's go there in the previous folder and let's go 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:10.290
 execute here the pc sx2 none in having and 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.910
 will open here open that the same donor 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.470
 if this is your first time 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.060
 running it will appear a 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.940
 here for you to configure the 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.639
 plugins to bios and such 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.669
 it is recommended that you watch another 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:28.600
 video description in description 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:30.340
 not what's in the post that explains 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.500
 how to configure plugins 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.830
 now if you have already set before not 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:39.039
 will open this screen there you just need 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:42.580
 there on cd and dvd selection trial and 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:47.139
 locate seek we will find 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:50.280
 here on my workday journey 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:57.940
 work says compactei the emulator 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:05:04.570
 chain of command in the folder this where I 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:08.139
 I put there the final fantasy in April 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:11.560
 notice that it is already selected here 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:13.260
 O I on system load the cd / dvd fast 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.860
 to go faster then 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.659
 I'll give it a click then 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.460
 so these two videos explaining I'm going to 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:22.889
 put it in the posting if you have 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.919
 difficulty you can watch the videos 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:26.699
 from there to try to solve the 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:30.979
 problem 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:30.979
 Let's see if it will run from April here. 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:42.550
 This is it so it worked out, we'll just see 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.550
 if it will not lock in the simulation 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:02.530
 however they are here have the initial scene 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:05.230

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:10.300
