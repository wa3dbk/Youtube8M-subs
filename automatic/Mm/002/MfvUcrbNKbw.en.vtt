adjunct professor of biology and we're

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.790 
adjunct professor of biology and we're
going<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.540> talk<00:00:09.660> about<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:10.170> blood<00:00:10.320> cells<00:00:10.559> of

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
going to talk about the blood cells of

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.129 
going to talk about the blood cells of
the<00:00:10.860> human<00:00:11.010> body<00:00:11.160> we<00:00:12.150> have<00:00:12.240> three<00:00:12.630> types<00:00:12.960> of

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
the human body we have three types of

red blood cells white blood cells and
platelets<00:00:16.940> I'm<00:00:17.940> gonna<00:00:18.119> do<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.270> little<00:00:18.420> analogy

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
platelets I'm gonna do a little analogy

platelets I'm gonna do a little analogy
for<00:00:19.199> you<00:00:19.289> our<00:00:20.070> bodies<00:00:20.490> are<00:00:20.699> much<00:00:20.850> like<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.090> big

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
for you our bodies are much like a big

that<00:00:45.690> special<00:00:46.079> oxygen<00:00:46.500> cargo<00:00:46.829> they're<00:00:47.250> gonna

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
that special oxygen cargo they're gonna

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.840 
that special oxygen cargo they're gonna
pick<00:00:47.550> up<00:00:47.700> co2<00:00:47.989> now<00:00:48.989> co2<00:00:49.379> or<00:00:49.800> carbon<00:00:49.980> dioxide<00:00:50.250> is

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
pick up co2 now co2 or carbon dioxide is

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.400 
pick up co2 now co2 or carbon dioxide is
a<00:00:51.059> waste<00:00:51.360> product<00:00:51.780> from<00:00:51.930> our<00:00:52.170> cellular

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
a waste product from our cellular

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.020 
a waste product from our cellular
metabolism<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.309> we<00:00:53.489> don't<00:00:53.670> like<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.910> keep

metabolism and we don't like to keep
waste<00:00:54.270> around<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:55.079> they<00:00:55.170> take<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.559> co2<00:00:55.800> back

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
waste around so they take that co2 back

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.430 
waste around so they take that co2 back
to<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.610> lungs<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.270> be<00:00:57.390> exhaled<00:00:57.809> out<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.350> the
