00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
that was pretty nice I thought this

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.959 
that was pretty nice I thought this
would<00:00:30.179> be<00:00:30.210> better<00:00:31.130> stat<00:00:32.130> wise<00:00:32.369> little<00:00:32.669> but

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
would be better stat wise little but

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.810 
would be better stat wise little but
this<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.540> exact<00:00:34.110> same<00:00:34.739> thing<00:00:35.309> as<00:00:35.579> the

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
this is the exact same thing as the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.510 
this is the exact same thing as the
regular<00:00:36.120> p90<00:00:37.100> except<00:00:38.100> for<00:00:38.690> two<00:00:39.829> reasons<00:00:40.829> one

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
regular p90 except for two reasons one

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.510 
regular p90 except for two reasons one
is<00:00:41.640> kind<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.000> obvious<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.750> um<00:00:43.489> it<00:00:44.489> looks

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
is kind of obvious that um it looks

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.510

because it's just yeah so the answer

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.340 
because it's just yeah so the answer
ation<00:02:29.100> on<00:02:29.250> here<00:02:30.050> terrible<00:02:31.050> oh<00:02:32.660> I<00:02:33.660> hate<00:02:34.170> the

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
seem to be running out of ammo faster

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
comparing the two up I went to

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.740 
comparing the two up I went to
elimination<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:50.970> test<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.270> out<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.540> regular

gun<00:03:04.260> is<00:03:04.500> places<00:03:05.220> where<00:03:05.430> it's<00:03:05.520> like<00:03:05.790> close<00:03:06.270> up

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
gun is places where it's like close up

like Egypt are way too close and by that

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.600 
like Egypt are way too close and by that

under<00:03:20.520> four<00:03:20.790> seconds<00:03:21.240> most<00:03:21.510> likely<00:03:22.160> throw<00:03:23.160> it

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
under four seconds most likely throw it

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.520 
under four seconds most likely throw it
around<00:03:23.340> where<00:03:23.640> it's<00:03:23.790> at<00:03:23.940> so<00:03:24.600> really<00:03:25.260> long

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
around where it's at so really long

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.460 
around where it's at so really long
reload<00:03:25.830> time<00:03:26.570> so<00:03:27.570> that's<00:03:27.810> why<00:03:28.020> you<00:03:28.050> don't<00:03:28.230> want

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
reload time so that's why you don't want

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.850 
reload time so that's why you don't want
it<00:03:28.530> really<00:03:28.709> to<00:03:28.920> be<00:03:29.010> too<00:03:29.220> close<00:03:29.490> because<00:03:30.860> if

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
it really to be too close because if

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.280 
it really to be too close because if
