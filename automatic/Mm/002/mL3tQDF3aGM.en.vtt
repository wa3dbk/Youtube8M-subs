00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.170
 well guys with the fa bsj welcome in 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.590
 this new video 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:20.770
 I'm here today to introduce you to that 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.240
 and that even commenting on that is 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.580
 precisely what he showed the 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.800
 sony in his meeting last night 20 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.720
 February 2013 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.119
 this meeting was organized by 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.120
 beginning of February 15th it was one thing 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.910
 improvised but let's see what he has 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.610
 showed the sony is about the new one 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.010
 playstation 4 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.489
 and here he is gentlemen here it is the 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:48.430
 new joypad joystick for the new 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.320
 playstation 4 announced precisely for the 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.440
 first time last night showed up for 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.380
 the first time this is the new one here 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.760
 dualshock 4 controller unlike 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.350
 what we have now that is a dual 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.969
 shock 3 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.460
 ok now we see it in the part 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.910
 front where we have the usual arrows i 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.550
 usual square hicks triangle buttons 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.770
 circle we also have the ps in key 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.539
 middle of the peaks 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.030
 here we begin so that the levers are 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:18.460
 changed are no longer all round like 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.100
 there are in workshop 3 but here they have 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.170
 that kind of circle on the edge 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.369
 which should make it more ergonomic then 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.959
 we have the touchpad that bit above 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.959
 the levers that should work here 

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:33.610
 by mouse for example if we browse on 

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:36.429
 internet with the playstation we should 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.580
 being able to use it as a mouse is not mistaken 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:42.849
 more importantly we have a 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.099
 new button the share button 

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:48.160
 here now I'll show you better 

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:49.660
 here with this button the sony ha 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.640
 introduced these new features 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:56.920
 social media such as sharing 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.959
 video images or even ours 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.330
 game session then what 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:04.300
 we are doing in the game with ours 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.160
 friends and I think though I'm not sure 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.530
 even on social networks this though 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.060
 we'll have to see it later 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.739
 let's return to the image of 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.170
 first because I wanted to show you that in 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:17.110
 top right next to the touchpad 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.050
 there is a new key called 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:24.060
 options that should be in my opinion 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.750
 the old select among other things the sonia 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:31.470
 even with this dualshock 4 ha 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:33.630
 decreased latency between controls and 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.910
 the playstation and increased again by 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.560
 plus the vibration of the joystick 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.410
 let's move on to the back now 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.640
 where we find the keys as usual l1 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:47.340
 and r1 l2 r2 where l2 and r2 are always 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.640
 those the peaks that can be bent 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.819
 but we find more small with more 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.250
 better design we also find another 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.870
 little where to connect the cable for 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.510
 connect the joystick to the playstation 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.130
 that if I'm not mistaken the thinner then 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.860
 the cables should be mini usb 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.830
 like those of mobile phones and no longer the 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.040
 usually cable but I think so 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.930
 because from the photos you don't see very well 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.910
 always on the back we find 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:20.970
 this blue bar is a light bar then 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.900
 a light bar that also serves for 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.780
 connect to the speech I will make shortly 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.650
 need to find let's say the 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.380
 joystick to the playstation so far 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:38.070
 detect the position of the joystick in the 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:41.069
 space in front of the TV and here it is 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:43.290
 finally the second accessory he has 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.150
 showed the sony last night at 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.989
 conference here we have the new one 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.620
 camera 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:52.290
 the new sony and icam that takes the place 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.350
 of the old is that it also serves as 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.959
 I was just saying to find the 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.130
 joystick in the space in front of the TV 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.950
 to the playstation 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.350
 here we see that it can also be explained 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.019
 like the 360 ​​kinect 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.590
 the pat should be almost equal if 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:14.400
 I am not mistaken here it is a normal bar 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:17.609
 like the wii bar also like the 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.709
 wii bar and 360 bar 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.019
 alright guys this is all that 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.990
 that showed the sony last night 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.570
 unfortunately he did not show the new one 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.669
 playstation 4 15 left again of 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:35.470
 more on the thorns, however, he announced us 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:39.310
 which will be offered for sale in 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:42.370
 in the Christmas of 2013 then for December 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:45.160
 2013 the new playstation 4 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:48.670
 you can buy it sincerely I am 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.740
 a little in doubt not on the matter of 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.560
 buy it because i will buy it for sure i am 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:57.040
 in doubt about what to do with the old one 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.170
 ps3 of the old poor ps3 that for me 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.280
 it could still last so many in my opinion 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:05.140
 this was a bit hasty move 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.050
 in fact guys I don't know whether to leave it 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.750
 in a box so in the garage or if 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.640
 wenner but then I would mind 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.920
 a lot to both sell and kick 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.990
 a box then kids of themes in the 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.670

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.520

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.980
