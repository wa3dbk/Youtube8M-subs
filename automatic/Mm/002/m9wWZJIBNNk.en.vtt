00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:01.699
Hey guys!

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:10.849
Today I'm coming with a check in for the castor
oil challenge.

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:21.100
Today is December 31st so we need to do a
check in.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.340
So here is my check in.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:35.650
Now I'm at 6 inches in the front.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:44.430
I have about 5 and a half inches now so it
grew about 2 inches.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.190
Now I'll measure the right side.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.430
My right side seems to grow much quicker than
the left.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.420
I don't know why.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.420
I'm at 6 and a half inches on the right side.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.110
I started at 3 and a half so about 2 inches.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.400
So in a month, my hair grew 2 inches with
the castor oil.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.660
My hair usually grows about a half inch.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:13.450
As far as my routine went for the past month,
I started off just spraying the spray bottle

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.409
directly to my scalp.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.409
I was just wearing puffs.

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:18.409
Then I went and installed a frohawk.

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.970
I had it braided up and I had the curls in
the middle.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.070
I'll have a picture of it right here.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.102
With that hairstyle I did the same thing.

00:01:30.102 --> 00:01:34.670
I sprayed the oil directly to my scalp.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.670
Now I have mini braids in.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.670
I installed them a couple weeks ago.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.670
I do the same thing and spray it directly
to my scalp.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.670
I don't really worry too much about my ends.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.670
I just moisturize my ends.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.670
But I focus the oil directly on my scalp.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.670
I'll show you guys these mini braids since
I really haven't done a video on them.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.670
This is what they're looking like.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:43.670
They're really small.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:02:01.079
I wanted to make sure that they were going
to last for a little bit.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:33.340

about 2 inches within a month with the castor
