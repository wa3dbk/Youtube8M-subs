and<00:02:21.599> 100<00:02:22.049> but<00:02:22.410> basically<00:02:22.860> this<00:02:23.130> is<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.400> way<00:02:23.489> it

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
and 100 but basically this is the way it

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.610 
and 100 but basically this is the way it
arise<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.269> have<00:02:24.450> those<00:02:24.690> fittings<00:02:25.170> just<00:02:25.410> there

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
arise you have those fittings just there

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.870 
arise you have those fittings just there
and<00:02:25.680> they<00:02:25.769> can<00:02:25.920> see<00:02:26.099> that<00:02:26.370> that's<00:02:26.489> your<00:02:26.640> valve

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.150 
and they can see that that's your valve
and<00:02:27.180> this<00:02:27.660> is<00:02:27.780> what<00:02:27.930> goes<00:02:28.109> on<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.410> your<00:02:28.560> tap<00:02:28.799> ok

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
and this is what goes on to your tap ok

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.009 
and this is what goes on to your tap ok
so<00:02:29.220> this<00:02:29.549> goes<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.760> your<00:02:29.910> tap<00:02:30.120> this<00:02:30.660> is<00:02:30.870> your

so this goes to your tap this is your

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.050 
so this goes to your tap this is your
valve<00:02:31.230> at<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.560> end<00:02:31.709> so<00:02:32.160> all<00:02:32.190> I'm<00:02:32.549> going<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.819> do

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
valve at the end so all I'm going to do

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.970 
valve at the end so all I'm going to do
is<00:02:33.269> with<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.900> other<00:02:34.139> one<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:34.590> bring<00:02:34.829> in

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
is with the other one that I bring in

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.039 
is with the other one that I bring in
I'm<00:02:35.160> going<00:02:35.549> to<00:02:35.760> use<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.389> bit<00:02:36.600> where<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.840> valve

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
I'm going to use the bit where the valve

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.740 
I'm going to use the bit where the valve
is<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.889> simply<00:02:38.370> screw<00:02:38.730> on<00:02:38.940> like<00:02:39.180> that<00:02:39.420> so<00:02:39.630> they

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
is to simply screw on like that so they

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.210 
is to simply screw on like that so they
take<00:02:39.870> this<00:02:40.019> out<00:02:40.170> of<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.290> way<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.920> once<00:02:41.100> you

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
take this out of the way and once you

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.199 
take this out of the way and once you
screw<00:02:41.459> that<00:02:41.639> on<00:02:41.790> there

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
screw that on there

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.539 
screw that on there
