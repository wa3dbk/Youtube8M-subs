hey<00:00:00.780> guys<00:00:00.960> continuing<00:00:01.530> the<00:00:01.740> windows<00:00:02.010> 8<00:00:02.159> series

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
hey guys continuing the windows 8 series

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.460 
hey guys continuing the windows 8 series
we<00:00:02.730> have<00:00:02.760> a<00:00:02.850> computer<00:00:03.270> here<00:00:03.470> freshly

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
we have a computer here freshly

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.900 
we have a computer here freshly
installed<00:00:04.529> with<00:00:05.040> windows<00:00:05.400> 8<00:00:05.580> or<00:00:05.790> I'm<00:00:05.879> just

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
installed with windows 8 or I'm just

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.390 
installed with windows 8 or I'm just
going<00:00:06.210> to<00:00:06.270> show<00:00:06.359> you<00:00:06.540> how<00:00:06.870> fast<00:00:07.259> windows<00:00:07.770> 8<00:00:08.040> can

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
going to show you how fast windows 8 can

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.870 
going to show you how fast windows 8 can
boot<00:00:08.639> up<00:00:08.790> so<00:00:09.540> I'm<00:00:09.780> going<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.080> head<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.880> power

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
boot up so I'm going to head and power

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.169 
boot up so I'm going to head and power
on<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.120> computer<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:13.469> granted<00:00:14.460> this<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.150> a

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
on the computer and granted this is a

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.810 
on the computer and granted this is a
fresh<00:00:15.450> install<00:00:15.929> so<00:00:16.830> basically<00:00:17.640> there<00:00:17.789> is

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
fresh install so basically there is

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.900 
fresh install so basically there is
pretty<00:00:18.480> much<00:00:18.630> no<00:00:19.070> extra<00:00:20.070> programs<00:00:20.609> and

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
pretty much no extra programs and

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.120 
pretty much no extra programs and
applications<00:00:21.000> installed<00:00:21.990> on<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.170> which

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
applications installed on it which

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.390 
applications installed on it which
certainly<00:00:23.760> affects<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.600> boot<00:00:24.840> up<00:00:24.990> time<00:00:25.400> but

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
certainly affects the boot up time but

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.670 
certainly affects the boot up time but
it<00:00:26.550> shouldn't<00:00:26.820> affect<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.240> on<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.480> large<00:00:28.349> scale

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
it shouldn't affect it on a large scale

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.820 
it shouldn't affect it on a large scale
so<00:00:29.689> we<00:00:30.689> should<00:00:30.840> get<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:30.990> pretty<00:00:31.260> good<00:00:31.349> idea<00:00:31.560> of

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
so we should get a pretty good idea of

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.040 
so we should get a pretty good idea of
how<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.850> windows<00:00:33.180> 8<00:00:33.300> boot<00:00:33.570> up<00:00:33.719> will<00:00:33.899> be

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
how the windows 8 boot up will be

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.139 
how the windows 8 boot up will be
compared<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.890> other<00:00:35.040> Windows<00:00:36.000> operating

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
compared to other Windows operating

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:45.319 
compared to other Windows operating
systems<00:00:41.180> okay<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.239> here<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:44.180> boot<00:00:45.180> up

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
systems okay so here is the boot up

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.150 
systems okay so here is the boot up
screen<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:46.260> allows<00:00:46.350> us<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.770> select<00:00:46.920> the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
screen that allows us to select the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.430 
screen that allows us to select the
operating<00:00:47.370> system<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.090> basically<00:00:49.050> right

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
operating system and basically right

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.319 
operating system and basically right
after<00:00:49.770> i<00:00:49.800> selected<00:00:50.219> windows<00:00:50.489> 8<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.850> booted<00:00:51.180> up

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
after i selected windows 8 it booted up

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.889 
after i selected windows 8 it booted up
right<00:00:51.930> here<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:53.390> basically<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.510> home

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
right here is the basically the home

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.770 
right here is the basically the home
screen<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.489> Windows<00:00:56.489> 8<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.270> actually<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
screen of Windows 8 this is actually the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.770 
screen of Windows 8 this is actually the
lock<00:00:57.960> screen<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.559> once<00:00:58.859> we<00:00:59.039> unlock<00:00:59.660> we<00:01:00.660> could

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
lock screen and once we unlock we could

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.770 
lock screen and once we unlock we could
type<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.079> our<00:01:01.199> password<00:01:01.760> login<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.180> here<00:01:03.600> is

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
type in our password login and here is

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.870 
type in our password login and here is
the<00:01:03.989> Start<00:01:04.290> screen<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:05.100> as<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.339> see<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.760> was

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the Start screen so as you see it was

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.719 
the Start screen so as you see it was
very<00:01:06.330> fast<00:01:06.869> in<00:01:07.260> booting<00:01:07.650> up<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.979> lot<00:01:08.430> faster

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
very fast in booting up a lot faster

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.910 
very fast in booting up a lot faster
than<00:01:09.630> other<00:01:09.810> versions<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.380> Windows<00:01:10.710> would

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
than other versions of Windows would

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.600 
than other versions of Windows would
have<00:01:10.979> booted<00:01:11.490> up<00:01:12.110> so<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.130> basically<00:01:14.250> just

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
have booted up so this is basically just

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.320 
have booted up so this is basically just
a<00:01:15.180> show<00:01:15.869> down<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.229> see<00:01:16.439> how<00:01:17.340> fast<00:01:17.670> windows<00:01:18.180> 8

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
a show down to see how fast windows 8

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.420 
a show down to see how fast windows 8
can<00:01:18.509> be<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.869> I'm<00:01:18.960> really<00:01:19.170> excited<00:01:19.290> based<00:01:20.220> on

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
this to see how Windows 8 performs with

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.149 
this to see how Windows 8 performs with
other<00:01:24.030> processor<00:01:24.720> heavy<00:01:24.930> programs<00:01:25.470> how<00:01:26.009> it

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
other processor heavy programs how it

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.179 
other processor heavy programs how it
handles<00:01:26.580> those<00:01:26.820> how<00:01:27.780> well<00:01:28.049> they<00:01:28.200> run<00:01:28.470> on<00:01:28.710> this

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189
