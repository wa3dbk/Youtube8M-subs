to<00:03:11.849> the<00:03:11.970> person<00:03:12.180> with<00:03:12.390> escape<00:03:12.690> it<00:03:13.590> comes<00:03:13.950> off

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
to the person with escape it comes off

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.320 
to the person with escape it comes off
of<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.430> board<00:03:14.640> and<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:14.849> can<00:03:15.030> take<00:03:15.180> that

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
of the board and you can take that

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.789 
of the board and you can take that
person<00:03:15.630> put<00:03:15.780> him<00:03:15.870> back<00:03:15.989> in<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.260> starting<00:03:16.470> area

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
person put him back in the starting area

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.680 
person put him back in the starting area
so<00:03:17.100> if<00:03:17.190> he<00:03:17.310> needs<00:03:17.489> to<00:03:17.579> get<00:03:17.730> out<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:18.390> can<00:03:18.570> use

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
so if he needs to get out you can use

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.060 
so if he needs to get out you can use
this<00:03:18.810> escape<00:03:19.109> ability<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.530> move<00:03:19.650> them<00:03:19.769> back<00:03:19.920> to

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
this escape ability to move them back to

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.560 
this escape ability to move them back to
the<00:03:20.160> start<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.609> then<00:03:21.269> you<00:03:21.359> have<00:03:21.480> an

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
the start and then you have an

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.120 
the start and then you have an
interesting<00:03:21.840> one<00:03:22.109> which<00:03:22.290> is<00:03:22.410> called<00:03:22.590> ransom

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
interesting one which is called ransom

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.500 
interesting one which is called ransom
which<00:03:23.489> allows<00:03:23.730> you<00:03:23.850> to<00:03:23.940> do<00:03:24.030> one<00:03:24.209> of<00:03:24.239> two<00:03:24.480> things

pieces<00:03:38.010> from<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.489> board<00:03:38.730> you<00:03:39.239> may<00:03:39.420> go<00:03:39.630> ahead

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
pieces from the board you may go ahead

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.569 
pieces from the board you may go ahead
and<00:03:40.109> return<00:03:40.500> one<00:03:40.709> of<00:03:40.799> your<00:03:40.920> captured<00:03:41.280> pieces

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
to your opponent and they'll put it back

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.930 
to your opponent and they'll put it back
in<00:03:42.900> their<00:03:43.019> bag<00:03:43.230> so<00:03:43.829> there<00:03:44.430> are<00:03:44.549> two<00:03:44.700> different

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
in their bag so there are two different

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.400 
in their bag so there are two different
ways<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.209> use<00:03:45.329> that<00:03:45.540> both<00:03:45.750> of<00:03:45.900> them<00:03:46.019> involve<00:03:46.319> a

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
ways to use that both of them involve a

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.840 
ways to use that both of them involve a
somewhat<00:03:46.680> of<00:03:46.739> a<00:03:46.799> trade<00:03:47.100> in<00:03:47.310> order<00:03:47.459> to<00:03:47.670> get<00:03:47.819> a

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
somewhat of a trade in order to get a

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.610 
somewhat of a trade in order to get a
piece<00:03:48.090> back<00:03:48.359> or<00:03:48.600> to<00:03:48.690> prevent<00:03:48.989> a<00:03:49.049> piece<00:03:49.230> from

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
piece back or to prevent a piece from

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.259 
piece back or to prevent a piece from
having<00:03:49.889> to<00:03:50.040> die<00:03:50.250> in<00:03:50.609> order<00:03:50.700> to<00:03:50.880> use<00:03:51.000> an<00:03:51.120> ability

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
having to die in order to use an ability

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.900 
having to die in order to use an ability
so<00:03:52.019> that's<00:03:52.200> those<00:03:52.530> in<00:03:52.799> addition<00:03:53.459> to<00:03:53.670> that<00:03:53.790> we

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
so that's those in addition to that we

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.640 
so that's those in addition to that we
can<00:03:54.060> see<00:03:54.209> that<00:03:54.329> we<00:03:54.420> have<00:03:54.630> of<00:03:54.870> course<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.170> board

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
can see that we have of course the board

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.620 
can see that we have of course the board
now<00:03:56.069> it's<00:03:56.250> a<00:03:56.310> very<00:03:56.459> plain<00:03:56.760> board<00:03:57.120> it's<00:03:57.299> a<00:03:57.389> grid

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
now it's a very plain board it's a grid

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.559 
now it's a very plain board it's a grid
of<00:03:57.930> squares<00:03:58.430> but<00:03:59.430> it's<00:03:59.639> printed<00:04:00.030> front<00:04:00.299> and

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
of squares but it's printed front and

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.090 
of squares but it's printed front and
back<00:04:00.780> with<00:04:00.989> all<00:04:01.170> of<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:01.470> names<00:04:01.739> of<00:04:01.980> the

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
back with all of the names of the

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.979 
back with all of the names of the
backers<00:04:02.549> that<00:04:02.579> pledge<00:04:03.090> to<00:04:03.299> certain<00:04:03.569> levels<00:04:03.840> on

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
backers that pledge to certain levels on

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.170 
backers that pledge to certain levels on
the<00:04:04.139> back<00:04:04.319> very<00:04:04.859> well<00:04:05.069> printed<00:04:05.549> very

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
the back very well printed very

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.150 
the back very well printed very
functional<00:04:06.690> nice<00:04:06.900> and<00:04:07.109> solid<00:04:07.319> I<00:04:07.650> think<00:04:08.040> it'll

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
functional nice and solid I think it'll

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.160 
functional nice and solid I think it'll
be<00:04:08.280> very<00:04:08.310> good<00:04:08.549> or<00:04:08.940> it<00:04:09.120> is<00:04:09.239> very<00:04:09.569> good<00:04:09.810> I<00:04:09.840> should

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
be very good or it is very good I should

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.430 
be very good or it is very good I should
say<00:04:10.380> for<00:04:10.889> playing<00:04:11.250> on<00:04:11.519> so<00:04:11.900> you<00:04:12.900> have<00:04:13.049> your<00:04:13.230> grid
