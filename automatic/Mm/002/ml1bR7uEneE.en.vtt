00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
playoffs next year I think the obvious

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.500 
playoffs next year I think the obvious
choices<00:00:48.520> are<00:00:48.940> the<00:00:49.030> Philadelphia<00:00:49.450> Eagles

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
because even if they don't make

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.560 
because even if they don't make
improvements<00:00:51.820> I<00:00:51.910> think<00:00:52.060> they've<00:00:52.180> got<00:00:52.390> the

improvements I think they've got the

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.660 
improvements I think they've got the
