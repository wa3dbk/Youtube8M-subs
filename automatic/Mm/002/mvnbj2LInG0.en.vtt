floored of God it has been attacking him
if<00:01:27.759> so<00:01:28.060> that's<00:01:28.270> kind<00:01:28.539> of<00:01:28.569> cool<00:01:28.780> um<00:01:30.509> that's<00:01:31.509> all

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:31.749 
if so that's kind of cool um that's all

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:35.700 
if so that's kind of cool um that's all
right<00:01:31.899> I<00:01:32.079> guess

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.520 

but<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:38.020> is<00:01:38.170> my<00:01:38.350> 55<00:01:39.270> gallon<00:01:40.270> freshwater<00:01:40.810> okay

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.980 
but this is my 55 gallon freshwater okay
i<00:01:41.890> guess<00:01:42.820> going<00:01:42.970> to<00:01:43.090> be<00:01:43.150> semi<00:01:43.450> aggressive<00:01:43.869> now

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
i guess going to be semi aggressive now

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.990 
i guess going to be semi aggressive now
since<00:01:44.530> we<00:01:44.680> have<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:45.190> air<00:01:45.820> one<00:01:46.180> and<00:01:46.510> the

see she's all friends didn't sin but

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:15.110 
see she's all friends didn't sin but
when<00:02:05.979> I<00:02:06.009> had<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:07.500> when<00:02:08.500> I<00:02:08.530> had<00:02:08.769> the<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.940> arm

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
when I had the when I had the the arm

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.970 
when I had the when I had the the arm
clown<00:02:16.120> I<00:02:16.300> from<00:02:16.480> there<00:02:16.630> I'm<00:02:17.080> pretty<00:02:17.650> sure<00:02:17.800> the

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
clown I from there I'm pretty sure the

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.290 
clown I from there I'm pretty sure the
climax<00:02:18.430> didn't<00:02:18.670> do<00:02:18.760> it<00:02:18.850> because<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.120> clown

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
climax didn't do it because the clown

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.050 
climax didn't do it because the clown
life<00:02:19.510> will<00:02:20.050> just<00:02:20.290> ate<00:02:20.440> them<00:02:20.590> hope<00:02:20.970> so<00:02:21.970> i<00:02:22.000> think

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
life will just ate them hope so i think

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.259 
life will just ate them hope so i think
this<00:02:22.330> uh<00:02:22.390> this<00:02:23.640> Florida<00:02:24.640> guard<00:02:24.850> here<00:02:25.060> got<00:02:25.239> a

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
this uh this Florida guard here got a

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.340 
this uh this Florida guard here got a
whole<00:02:25.510> tool<00:02:25.810> somehow<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:28.690> I<00:02:28.810> didn't<00:02:29.019> see<00:02:29.230> it

care<00:04:18.790> I<00:04:19.120> mean<00:04:19.989> I<00:04:20.080> did<00:04:20.440> but<00:04:20.650> you<00:04:20.830> know<00:04:20.980> once<00:04:21.489> you

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640
