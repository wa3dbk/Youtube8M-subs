the other dancing games this is both
hands<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:19.920> feet<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:20.699> it's<00:00:20.730> talking<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.119> lot

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
hands and feet so it's talking a lot

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.269 
hands and feet so it's talking a lot
about<00:00:21.300> using<00:00:22.170> both<00:00:22.320> who<00:00:22.680> he<00:00:22.800> was<00:00:22.920> who<00:00:23.130> was

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
about using both who he was who was

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.279 
about using both who he was who was
talked<00:00:23.580> about<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.850> one<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.180> can<00:00:24.630> do<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:24.990> yet

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
talked about that one I can do that yet

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.230 
talked about that one I can do that yet
okay<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.640> key<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.910> think<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.119> key

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
okay so the key I think the key

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.730 
okay so the key I think the key
difference<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:28.109> most<00:00:28.289> games<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.650> might

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
difference to to most games you might

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.250 
difference to to most games you might
know<00:00:28.920> with<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:30.240> terms<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.570> we<00:00:30.720> dance<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.109> the

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
know with in terms of we dance is the

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.930 
know with in terms of we dance is the
fact<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.529> can<00:00:31.650> use<00:00:31.890> your<00:00:32.189> hands<00:00:32.430> which<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.820> the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
fact you can use your hands which is the

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.880 
fact you can use your hands which is the
kind<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.239> gesture<00:00:33.960> mode<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.530> kind<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.770> easy

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
kind of gesture mode the kind of easy

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.970 
kind of gesture mode the kind of easy
mode<00:00:35.160> we<00:00:35.280> call<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.500> also<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.710> can<00:00:37.950> use

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
mode we call in it and also you can use

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.700 
mode we call in it and also you can use
your<00:00:38.430> feet<00:00:38.670> solely<00:00:39.570> solely<00:00:40.020> hands<00:00:40.350> solely

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
your feet solely solely hands solely

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.310 
your feet solely solely hands solely
feats<00:00:41.040> but<00:00:41.280> also<00:00:42.120> rather<00:00:42.660> uniquely<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.200> can

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
feats but also rather uniquely you can

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.410 
feats but also rather uniquely you can
use<00:00:43.500> both<00:00:43.680> together<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.370> we're<00:00:45.059> calling<00:00:45.300> that

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
use both together so we're calling that

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.549 
use both together so we're calling that
the<00:00:45.510> hard<00:00:45.660> mode<00:00:45.840> because<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.110> takes<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.410> bit<00:00:46.530> of

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
the hard mode because it takes a bit of

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.069 
the hard mode because it takes a bit of
getting<00:00:46.649> used<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.850> sore<00:00:48.450> feet<00:00:48.690> on<00:00:48.840> its<00:00:48.960> own

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
getting used to and sore feet on its own

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.619 
getting used to and sore feet on its own
is<00:00:49.230> basically<00:00:49.649> medium<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.280> that's<00:00:51.239> its<00:00:51.420> kind

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
is basically medium so that's its kind

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.569 
is basically medium so that's its kind
of<00:00:51.719> key<00:00:51.930> point<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.710> differentiation<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.460> guess

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
of key point of differentiation I guess

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.860 
of key point of differentiation I guess
with<00:00:53.730> other<00:00:53.910> game<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.329> that's<00:00:54.510> what<00:00:54.629> makes<00:00:54.780> it

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
with other game so that's what makes it

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.180 
with other game so that's what makes it
unique<00:00:54.930> that's<00:00:55.350> what<00:00:55.500> makes<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.829> kind<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.100> a

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
unique that's what makes it kind of a

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.250 
unique that's what makes it kind of a
bit<00:00:56.309> more<00:00:56.460> about<00:00:56.670> sort<00:00:57.449> realistic<00:00:57.899> dance

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
bit more about sort realistic dance

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.049 
bit more about sort realistic dance
experience<00:00:58.649> so<00:01:00.920> know<00:01:01.920> what<00:01:02.489> other<00:01:02.609> kind<00:01:03.030> of

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
experience so know what other kind of

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.549 
experience so know what other kind of
modes<00:01:03.239> cuz<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.570> isn't<00:01:03.719> just<00:01:03.809> dancing<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.470> it

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
modes cuz it isn't just dancing is it

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.710 
modes cuz it isn't just dancing is it
awesome<00:01:04.769> as<00:01:05.100> many<00:01:05.309> games<00:01:05.580> as<00:01:06.000> dancing<00:01:06.450> schools

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720

talk<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.960> little<00:01:07.049> bit<00:01:07.200> about<00:01:07.290> those<00:01:07.470> people<00:01:07.770> who

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
talk a little bit about those people who

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.070 
talk a little bit about those people who
like<00:01:07.860> haven't<00:01:08.369> aren't<00:01:09.119> used<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.390> playing<00:01:09.570> your

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
like haven't aren't used to playing your

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.960 
like haven't aren't used to playing your
dancing<00:01:10.380> games<00:01:10.500> cuz<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.770> was<00:01:10.860> pretty<00:01:11.670> hardcore

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
dancing games cuz it was pretty hardcore

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.010 
dancing games cuz it was pretty hardcore
if<00:01:12.180> you've<00:01:12.270> not<00:01:12.360> played<00:01:12.479> dancing<00:01:12.869> games

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
if you've not played dancing games

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.200 
if you've not played dancing games
before<00:01:13.200> it's<00:01:13.409> not<00:01:13.470> easy<00:01:13.680> at<00:01:13.890> first<00:01:14.210> absolutely

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
before it's not easy at first absolutely

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.249 
before it's not easy at first absolutely
that's<00:01:15.390> why<00:01:15.540> we've<00:01:15.689> got<00:01:15.720> three<00:01:15.960> different

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
that's why we've got three different

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.170 
that's why we've got three different
modes<00:01:16.350> easy<00:01:16.680> medium<00:01:17.130> hard<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.369> think<00:01:17.610> what<00:01:18.000> you

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
modes easy medium hard I think what you

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.210 
modes easy medium hard I think what you
would<00:01:18.240> do<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.600> get<00:01:18.869> progressively<00:01:19.439> sort<00:01:20.159> of

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
would do you get progressively sort of

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.469 
would do you get progressively sort of
work<00:01:20.400> with<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.700> game<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.119> got<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> lot<00:01:21.450> of

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
work with the game it's got a lot of

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.030 
work with the game it's got a lot of
debt<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:21.930> you'd<00:01:22.080> probably<00:01:22.290> start<00:01:22.680> with<00:01:22.890> your

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
debt so you'd probably start with your

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.310 
debt so you'd probably start with your
hands<00:01:23.400> move<00:01:24.000> through<00:01:24.030> two<00:01:24.330> feet<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.960> then<00:01:25.110> put

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
hands move through two feet and then put

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.870 
hands move through two feet and then put
the<00:01:25.380> two<00:01:25.530> together<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:26.189> terms<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
the two together in terms of the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.999 
the two together in terms of the
different<00:01:27.180> modes<00:01:27.299> there's<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:28.080> warm-up<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:28.799> is

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
different modes there's a warm-up so is

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.590 
different modes there's a warm-up so is
really<00:01:29.310> energetic<00:01:29.670> as<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.210> probably<00:01:30.390> just

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
really energetic as you probably just

obviously so there's a whole whole host
of<00:02:11.009> different<00:02:11.129> sort<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.700> areas<00:02:12.120> different

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
of different sort of areas different

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.700

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
core gameplay does involve obviously the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.120 
core gameplay does involve obviously the
mapped<00:02:15.270> all<00:02:15.570> control<00:02:16.470> or<00:02:16.620> putting<00:02:16.890> them<00:02:17.010> both

mapped all control or putting them both

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.080 
mapped all control or putting them both
together<00:02:17.310> that's<00:02:17.610> that's<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:17.970> real

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
together that's that's the real

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.850 
together that's that's the real
challenge<00:02:18.120> when<00:02:18.660> you<00:02:18.690> sort<00:02:18.960> of<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.170> when<00:02:19.740> you

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
challenge when you sort of a when you

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.080 
challenge when you sort of a when you
spent<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.190> few<00:02:20.340> hours<00:02:20.400> with<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:20.970> you've

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
spent a few hours with it and you've

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.300 
spent a few hours with it and you've
you've<00:02:21.480> learned<00:02:21.960> some<00:02:22.170> of<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.320> moves<00:02:22.500> now<00:02:23.070> as

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.670 
does it come with Matt we get both mats
or<00:02:27.270> things<00:02:27.600> bought<00:02:27.780> separately<00:02:28.230> what<00:02:28.440> is<00:02:28.560> it

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
or things bought separately what is it

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.470 
or things bought separately what is it
sort<00:02:28.890> of<00:02:28.920> all<00:02:29.070> come<00:02:29.250> with<00:02:29.370> okay<00:02:29.970> so<00:02:30.030> what<00:02:30.390> we

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
sort of all come with okay so what we

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.300 
sort of all come with okay so what we
learnt<00:02:30.660> with<00:02:30.750> we<00:02:30.930> sink<00:02:31.230> was<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.830> consumers

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
learnt with we sink was that consumers

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.290

experience and you can't do that by

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.560 
experience and you can't do that by
itself<00:02:34.920> so<00:02:35.550> we<00:02:35.760> saw<00:02:35.910> we<00:02:36.120> sing<00:02:36.330> with<00:02:36.450> two
