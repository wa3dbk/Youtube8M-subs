this<00:00:00.420> project<00:00:01.020> is<00:00:01.199> a<00:00:01.290> cherry<00:00:02.190> blossom<00:00:03.030> ball

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
this project is a cherry blossom ball

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.499 
this project is a cherry blossom ball
this<00:00:03.899> is<00:00:04.110> a<00:00:04.140> model<00:00:04.710> I<00:00:04.920> learned<00:00:05.250> at<00:00:05.549> the<00:00:05.580> origami

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
this is a model I learned at the origami

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.730 
this is a model I learned at the origami
us<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:07.140> convention<00:00:07.799> in<00:00:07.980> New<00:00:08.610> York<00:00:08.820> City<00:00:09.740> the

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
us a convention in New York City the

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.749 
us a convention in New York City the
original<00:00:11.309> piece<00:00:12.049> that<00:00:13.049> I<00:00:13.080> folded<00:00:13.740> with<00:00:14.009> was

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
original piece that I folded with was

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.060 
original piece that I folded with was
one<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:15.960> three-quarter<00:00:16.920> inches<00:00:17.900> by<00:00:19.070> three

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
one and three-quarter inches by three

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.599 
one and three-quarter inches by three
inches<00:00:20.180> but<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.210> found<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:21.869> two<00:00:22.199> inch<00:00:22.680> by<00:00:23.580> 3

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
inches but I found that two inch by 3

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.560 
inches but I found that two inch by 3
inch<00:00:24.210> works<00:00:24.570> well<00:00:25.260> as<00:00:25.529> well<00:00:26.000> here<00:00:27.000> i<00:00:27.029> am<00:00:27.269> going

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
inch works well as well here i am going

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.140 
inch works well as well here i am going
to<00:00:27.689> fold<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.170> on<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.320> larger<00:00:28.890> scale<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:29.910> can

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
to fold it on a larger scale so you can

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.770 
to fold it on a larger scale so you can
see<00:00:30.390> better<00:00:30.949> take<00:00:31.949> your<00:00:32.099> sheet<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.460> paper<00:00:32.780> with

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
see better take your sheet of paper with

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.000 
see better take your sheet of paper with
the<00:00:33.899> color<00:00:34.140> side<00:00:34.290> up<00:00:34.590> fold<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.969> in<00:00:36.090> half<00:00:40.010> along

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
the color side up fold it in half along

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.310 
the color side up fold it in half along
the<00:00:41.300> long<00:00:42.300> horizontal<00:00:44.270> take<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.480> top<00:00:46.020> edge

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
the long horizontal take this top edge

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.950 
the long horizontal take this top edge
of<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.680> top<00:00:47.010> layer<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.730> fold<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.270> back<00:00:48.510> down

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
of the top layer and fold it back down

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.200 
of the top layer and fold it back down
to<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.469> bait<00:00:50.000> bottom<00:00:51.000> crease<00:00:52.550> the<00:00:53.550> same<00:00:53.940> thing

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
to the bait bottom crease the same thing

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.799 
to the bait bottom crease the same thing

with the other side fold it fold the
edge<00:00:59.210> essentially<00:01:00.210> what<00:01:00.510> we're<00:01:00.690> doing<00:01:01.050> is

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
edge essentially what we're doing is

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.660 
edge essentially what we're doing is
doing<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.160> cupboard<00:01:02.460> fold<00:01:04.489> folding<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.640> edges

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
doing a cupboard fold folding the edges

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.190 
doing a cupboard fold folding the edges
to<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.270> center<00:01:07.670> flipping<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:09.270> unit<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
to the center flipping this unit to the

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.700 
to the center flipping this unit to the
other<00:01:10.320> side<00:01:11.360> so<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.540> open<00:01:12.900> sides<00:01:13.170> are<00:01:13.409> on<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
other side so the open sides are on the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.670 
other side so the open sides are on the
bottom<00:01:14.070> take<00:01:15.030> one<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> top<00:01:15.840> corners<00:01:16.380> and

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
bottom take one of the top corners and

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.399 
bottom take one of the top corners and
fold<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.850> down<00:01:18.830> into<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> triangle<00:01:21.140> note<00:01:22.140> this

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
fold it down into a triangle note this

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.390 
fold it down into a triangle note this
little<00:01:23.180> white<00:01:24.180> triangle<00:01:24.810> or<00:01:25.020> white<00:01:25.979> square

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
little white triangle or white square

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.940 
little white triangle or white square
that<00:01:26.640> shows<00:01:26.880> up

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
that shows up

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
that shows up
do<00:01:30.060> do<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.210> same<00:01:31.510> thing<00:01:31.810> on<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.170> other<00:01:32.200> corner

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
do do the same thing on the other corner

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:41.390 
do do the same thing on the other corner
flip<00:01:33.970> the<00:01:34.150> model<00:01:34.860> 180<00:01:35.860> degrees<00:01:36.340> and<00:01:38.730> fold<00:01:39.730> that

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
flip the model 180 degrees and fold that

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:50.550 
flip the model 180 degrees and fold that
fold<00:01:42.400> that<00:01:42.580> triangle<00:01:42.970> down<00:01:43.479> as<00:01:43.750> well

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.050 

now<00:01:51.560> flip<00:01:52.010> your<00:01:52.520> unit<00:01:52.910> back<00:01:53.530> open<00:01:54.530> up<00:01:54.650> those

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
now flip your unit back open up those

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.250 
now flip your unit back open up those
triangles<00:01:56.060> that<00:01:56.330> we<00:01:56.570> made<00:01:57.490> we<00:01:58.490> are<00:01:58.670> going<00:01:58.970> to

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
triangles that we made we are going to

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.240 
triangles that we made we are going to
inside<00:02:00.260> reverse<00:02:00.290> fold<00:02:01.280> this<00:02:01.850> triangle
