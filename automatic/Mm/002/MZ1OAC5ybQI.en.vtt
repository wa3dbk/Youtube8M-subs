00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:06.310
 very good sniper kids I am 

00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:09.820
 kryptonite and good as you see 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:13.360
 We are in a Facebook game 2 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:16.000
 against 2 and he was with yuri and good is 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.269
 a game that lasts two and a half minutes 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.539
 as you will see how good we played 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:25.269
 against the typical rat children that 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.760
 will end up watching the game they left 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:31.240
 simply because it is 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.740
 I make a 90 in a minute and a half 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.420
 practically that's what I've seen 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:41.140
 when I have seen the repetition a minute 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:44.650
 and half and the jury a 30 and since good 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:48.309
 you take them all from the bastard and good 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:51.910
 saco is repair the cobra and the predictor 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.890
 I did not have time since they left in 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.440
 river also does not finish it is just when 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.159
 reaper pulled the helicopter kills 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.999
 one and the two uncles of these went away 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:06.000
 well there you see 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:08.790
 the good cobra I do not like to take the ones that 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.210
 without it we are good is a little 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.020
 weird I do not know why but 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.359
 the blow does not look the same 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.200
 so nothing kids, I'm going to let what 

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:24.799
 you watch a short gameplay but what 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.860
 I was able to climb today on top of something 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:30.890
 well, we all will have to 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.679
 settle with that so nothing I leave you 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.679
 I hope you like like and favorites and 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:38.929
 good if you see a part that is cut 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:42.409
 and I put another one is because the 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:45.380
 hosting migration and I had to 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.989
 put together recording twice and put it together and 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.530
 it looks a bit weird like that so you can not see anything 

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:55.039
 This is where the uncles and 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:58.039
 good so nothing I leave you good this and 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.799
 they are the seconds behind without anything likes 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:03.009
 favorites and see you in the next chao 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.009
