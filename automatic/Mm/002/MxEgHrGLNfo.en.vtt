space you like Starbase space stuff so
you<00:00:16.170> love<00:00:16.350> space<00:00:16.619> when<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:16.980> live<00:00:17.190> in<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.340> and

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
latest episode this newly born star is

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.390 
latest episode this newly born star is
over<00:01:18.509> 20<00:01:18.990> times<00:01:19.259> more<00:01:19.710> massive<00:01:19.950> than<00:01:20.130> our<00:01:20.340> Sun

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
over 20 times more massive than our Sun

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.870 
over 20 times more massive than our Sun
and<00:01:20.880> burns<00:01:21.630> much<00:01:22.140> hotter<00:01:22.619> which<00:01:23.430> makes<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
and burns much hotter which makes the

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.700 
and burns much hotter which makes the
light<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.360> pours<00:01:24.780> from<00:01:25.110> its<00:01:25.320> surface<00:01:25.619> blue

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.130 

so<00:01:29.710> it's<00:01:30.130> 20<00:01:30.850> times<00:01:31.149> more<00:01:31.540> massive<00:01:31.780> than<00:01:31.960> the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
so it's 20 times more massive than the

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.660 
so it's 20 times more massive than the
Sun<00:01:32.290> this<00:01:32.740> we're<00:01:33.130> still<00:01:33.340> talking<00:01:33.640> about
