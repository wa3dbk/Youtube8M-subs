00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
mean it doesn't seem to me to be a

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.099

particularly<00:00:24.150> appropriate<00:00:24.539> Easter<00:00:24.960> message

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109

an<00:00:27.869> insult<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.529> Christians<00:00:29.310> who<00:00:29.490> are

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
an insult to Christians who are

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.240 
an insult to Christians who are
persecuted<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.840> places<00:00:31.439> like<00:00:31.619> Iran<00:00:31.800> and

in the world where Christians are

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.400 
in the world where Christians are
persecuted<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:36.030> idea<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:37.200> we<00:00:37.380> are

they are now part of in the quote is the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.810 
they are now part of in the quote is the
persecuted<00:00:52.160> minority<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.190> mean<00:00:53.699> there

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
persecuted minority I mean there

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.279 
persecuted minority I mean there
obviously<00:00:54.059> has<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.210> voice<00:00:54.390> there<00:00:54.660> somewhere<00:00:55.079> I

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
obviously has a voice there somewhere I

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.380 
obviously has a voice there somewhere I
mean<00:00:55.860> we're<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.430> an<00:00:56.520> increasingly<00:00:57.030> secular

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
mean we're in an increasingly secular

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.860 
mean we're in an increasingly secular
society<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.280> I<00:00:59.280> think<00:00:59.699> Christians<00:01:00.239> feel<00:01:00.570> that

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
society and I think Christians feel that

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.599 
society and I think Christians feel that
you<00:01:01.260> know<00:01:01.379> often<00:01:01.590> feel<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.039> they're<00:01:02.370> not

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
you know often feel that they're not

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.759 
you know often feel that they're not
they're<00:01:03.120> not<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.329> sort<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.750> dominant<00:01:04.229> narrative

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
they're not a sort of dominant narrative

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.250 
they're not a sort of dominant narrative
well<00:01:05.280> that's<00:01:05.519> just<00:01:05.790> how<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:07.140> know

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
well that's just how it is and you know

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.649 
well that's just how it is and you know
learn<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.740> learn<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.250> be<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.330> not<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
learn to learn to be the not the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.080 
learn to learn to be the not the
dominant<00:01:10.110> narrative<00:01:10.740> it's<00:01:11.280> not<00:01:13.909> that's<00:01:14.909> just

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
dominant narrative it's not that's just

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.850 
dominant narrative it's not that's just
how<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.450> these<00:01:15.720> days<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.560> mean<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:16.799> think

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
how it is these days and I mean I think

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.980 
how it is these days and I mean I think
Christians<00:01:17.400> have<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.700> sort<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:17.909> like<00:01:18.119> proclaim

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
Christians have to sort of like proclaim

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.160 
Christians have to sort of like proclaim
their<00:01:19.229> faith<00:01:19.470> talk<00:01:19.860> about<00:01:20.130> Easter<00:01:20.700> now<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
their faith talk about Easter now in the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.170 
their faith talk about Easter now in the
context<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.740> they<00:01:22.950> are<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.490> that's<00:01:23.820> just

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
context that they are and that's just

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.999 
context that they are and that's just
but<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.780> only<00:01:24.900> did<00:01:25.110> they<00:01:25.200> just<00:01:25.350> whinge<00:01:25.619> about

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
but the only did they just whinge about

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.980 
but the only did they just whinge about
it<00:01:26.250> or<00:01:26.369> feel<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:27.210> themselves<00:01:27.330> sort<00:01:27.869> of

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
it or feel that themselves sort of

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.740 
it or feel that themselves sort of
coveted<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.560> persecution<00:01:29.100> complex<00:01:29.280> it's<00:01:30.119> so

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
coveted a persecution complex it's so

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.140 
coveted a persecution complex it's so
unattractive<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.770> actually<00:01:32.490> as<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.820> say<00:01:33.030> it's

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
unattractive and actually as I say it's

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.370 
unattractive and actually as I say it's
an<00:01:33.210> insult<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.659> people<00:01:33.900> who<00:01:33.960> were<00:01:34.020> genuinely

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
an insult to people who were genuinely

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.990 
an insult to people who were genuinely
persecuted<00:01:35.220> what<00:01:35.340> does<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.520> say<00:01:35.790> about<00:01:35.820> the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
persecuted what does that say about the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.609 
persecuted what does that say about the
relationship<00:01:36.210> between<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:37.110> church<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.500> the

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
relationship between the church and the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
seems to think that gay marriage is

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.090 
seems to think that gay marriage is
somehow<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.930> threat<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.409> marriage<00:02:04.710> in<00:02:04.890> general

somehow a threat to marriage in general

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.730 
somehow a threat to marriage in general
I<00:02:05.430> can't<00:02:05.880> see<00:02:06.090> how<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.570> gay<00:02:06.780> people<00:02:06.990> loving

that<00:02:15.099> that's<00:02:15.400> what<00:02:15.520> they<00:02:15.730> see<00:02:15.790> they<00:02:16.030> see

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
that that's what they see they see

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.520 
that that's what they see they see
people<00:02:16.480> loving<00:02:16.720> each<00:02:16.780> other<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:17.230> that's

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
people loving each other and that's

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.140 
people loving each other and that's
