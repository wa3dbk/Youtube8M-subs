00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.690
 Y 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.300
 hi imbeciles today I bring you a new 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.590
 indie video and this time I come with a 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.780
 video that has called me a lot the 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.880
 Attention a video where I will talk about the 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.890
 10 ways in which the 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.720
 world where he lives some of the 10 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.910
 ways in which the 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.100
 It should be noted that each end of the 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.840
 world may be very likely or nothing 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.690
 likely or maybe even too much 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.680
 fanciful I hope you like the video well 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.730
 how I liked editing it x of 1 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.400
 transformation of the sun into a supernova 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.530
 according to wikipedia when a star 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.580
 dies does it producing a great 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.170
 explosion 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.180
 your center experiences a collapse 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.160
 gravitational and then bursts to a 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.130
 speed of up to 50 million 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.500
 kilometers per hour which means that 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.539
 If our sun were to die, it would destroy 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.729
 minimum the first part of the system 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:21.800
 solar where logically the earth is 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.380
 there although this form is almost impossible 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.600
 according to discovery scientists 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.610
 chanel xd to the sun you have thousands of 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.590
 millions of years of life for me is more 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.740
 likely that the human race is already the 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.229
 extinct for then 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.420
 environmental disaster this is more than 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.420
 simple is the end of the world caused by 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.700
 the human race with all the pollution 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.799
 Yes , and we have the ozone layer very 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.080
 worn out but despite that we continue 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.450
 contaminating the earth by destroying the 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.610
 forests and polluting the air the earth 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.649
 and the water will see this is one of the 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.720
 most probable endings and not too far away 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.820
 but as I unfortunately read in a 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.890
 national geographic magazine despite 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.560
 that we are inventing more energies 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.049
 clean as solar wind etc. 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.100
 the process is very slow and we destroy more 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:12.470
 fast of what we protect 3 impact of 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.299
 a great asteroid remember the theory of 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.220
 the extinction of dinosaurs 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:18.620
 the great asteroid extinguished the 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.750
 dinosaurs and only survived the 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.090
 animals that could hide under the 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.430
 land I also understand that the 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.650
 asteroids are difficult to track and 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.690
 will one fall down to earth could 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.680
 mean the end of life as the 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.870
 we know four black holes this 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.880
 it's also a very unlikely ending but 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.160
 it's not as unlikely as the supernova 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.200
 sun since according to facebook 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.450
 there are studies have shown that 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.370
 there are 10 million black holes 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.680
 in the Milky Way and if a black hole 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.990
 come to swallow the earth because it would be 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.240
 an extremely fast death but 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.700
 there is no animal living plant or 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:59.570
 cell would survive or we fuck 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.760
 without anything we can do 5 invasion 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.250
 alien since it was time to put a 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.020
 final fantasioso because in itself is not 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.910
 proven that there is life in others 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.580
 planets or at least in the milky way 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.770
 but this is nothing as far as it has 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.960
 could reach the man is to the moon the 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.940
 really if it would be controversial to think that 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.490
 we are the only ones who have life in this 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.950
 gigantic universe but that's not what 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.290
 important if some day will come some 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.750
 alien race to the earth can only 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.910
 mean two things one that come in 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.310
 peace to know more about our life or two 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.650
 to end the human race to be 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.020
 so this would not be like in the movies 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.540
 in the movies the human race fights 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.640
 to the aliens and sometimes win something 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.160
 which is ridiculous if the Martian race 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.530
 dominates space flights us ni 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.910
 although all governments not join 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.750
 we would not even tickle him 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.940
 the aliens 6 that the earth will 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.250
 stop just imagine that one day 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.500
 normal the earth would stop out of nowhere 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.810
 that is, the earth will stop spinning in 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.670
 its own axis that would be fatal to the 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.220
 land since the earth needs to 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.140
 force that movement if this happened the 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.420
 side of the earth with a view of the sun 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.820
 all those countries together with their inhabitants 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.610
 they would burn everything would burn the 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.950
 oceans lakes and rivers would dry up and 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.080
 equal plants would burn while 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.000
 the other side of the planet would freeze 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.310
 for the lack of the sun no one could 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.710
 survive those temperatures the 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.400
 plants would no longer bear fruit besides 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.860
 the water would freeze 7 disaster 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.410
 biological a biological disaster are the 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.180
 errors of genetic engineering 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.850
 let's say scientists already create 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.100
 transgenic foods alter plants and 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.230
 They have even cloned animals but 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.750
 if something went wrong like some animal 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.850
 mutant or some mutant plant this 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.610
 could pose a great threat to the 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.640
 human life is more in fact up could 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.600
 come true the fantasies of many 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:58.100
 could reach the 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:00.170
 of the zombies 8 robotic revolution this 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.240
 she is also in the fantasy range 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.400
 there are many movies where you see this 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.440
 way in which the robots rebel 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.480
 before the human race and they want 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.790
 dominate the world even if it sounds something 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.740
 illogical could well be true for 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.200
 example one of the most famous movies 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.870
 of this subject is I robot and the 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.390
 exterminator if this were to happen 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.550
 well we could struggle but not for 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.440
 a lot since if the robots rebel 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.180
 it would only be because they are already the 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.310
 smart enough to 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:32.300
 do it and we could not give them much 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:34.070
 battle 9 world epidemic remember 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.350
 when the flu became fashionable 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:39.620
 all shopping centers cinemas 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.390
 school and so on they were until closed and 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.790
 a true global epidemic will 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.530
 will come to untie we not only died for 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.780
 the great disease all over the world 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.980
 would enter into chaos would all be killed by 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:53.930
 a cure and the rest is history 10 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:56.240
 nuclear war sadly mankind 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.700
 is very selfish every nation think of 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.990
 themselves, let's put as an example the 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.270
 Americans this 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.670
 the most selfish and most hypocritical country in 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.710
 world if they were they should 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.990
 dominate the world since the Americans 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.810
 they unleash wars to other countries for purposes 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:14.720
 stupid as money remember the 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.850
 Second World War USA ended that 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.010
 great war with your nuclear bomb thrown 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.710
 to hiroshima and nagasaki killing more than 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.780
 200,000 people so far that has been 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.060
 the only nuclear attack in history 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:29.150
 it was even banned worldwide 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:31.520
 use that kind of weapons years later already 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:34.160
 all world powers count 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.140
 with nuclear weapons which means that 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.120
 if there was a third world war 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.980
 most likely that would be the last 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.410
 war since everyone will use weapons 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.330
 nuclear weapons not only killing those who 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.610
 they will throw them but the earth will not 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:49.520
 could withstand so much nuclear energy and 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:51.860
 the earth would die good friends that was 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.200
 I hope everything you liked, do not believe 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.120
 that this can happen this is not a video 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.920
 amarillista solo is a video to know 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.470
 what kind of end could the 

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.930
 Earth commented that they thought the video 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.880
 comment if there is any other famous ending 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.889
 What happened to me, please give him 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.499
 like to my facebook page 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:11.360

 100 followers upload photos from crazy to 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.240
 melon bone good we'll see you in the
