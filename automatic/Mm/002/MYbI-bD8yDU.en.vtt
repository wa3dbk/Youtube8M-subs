then create a new layer that's going to

00:01:47.729 --> 00:02:07.680

I'm<00:02:08.350> going<00:02:08.619> to<00:02:08.710> multiply<00:02:09.100> the<00:02:09.160> blue<00:02:09.400> layer

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
I'm going to multiply the blue layer

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.520 
I'm going to multiply the blue layer
with<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:09.940> previous<00:02:10.330> one<00:02:10.540> then<00:02:11.140> put<00:02:11.410> the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
with the previous one then put the

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:19.350 
with the previous one then put the
opacity<00:02:11.800> down<00:02:12.190> a<00:02:12.250> bit<00:02:17.040> on<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:19.000> third<00:02:19.180> layer

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
opacity down a bit on the third layer

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.940 
opacity down a bit on the third layer
you<00:02:19.690> need<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:19.870> create<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.260> tribal<00:02:20.650> design

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
you need to create the tribal design

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.850 
you need to create the tribal design
than<00:02:21.190> tattoos<00:02:21.610> for<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:21.940> character<00:02:22.860> don't

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
than tattoos for the character don't

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.350 
than tattoos for the character don't
worry<00:02:24.040> about<00:02:24.160> going<00:02:24.340> over<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.730> eyes<00:02:24.880> because

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
worry about going over the eyes because

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:32.970 
worry about going over the eyes because
this<00:02:25.540> is<00:02:25.660> just<00:02:25.870> a<00:02:25.960> skin<00:02:26.200> texture<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:32.860> can

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
this is just a skin texture you can

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.380 
this is just a skin texture you can
blend<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.220> tattoos<00:02:33.610> a<00:02:33.640> bit<00:02:33.880> around<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.180> edges

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
blend the tattoos a bit around the edges

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:56.740 
blend the tattoos a bit around the edges
so<00:02:34.690> they<00:02:34.780> look<00:02:34.960> more<00:02:35.140> natural

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.570 

here<00:02:57.380> I<00:02:57.410> have<00:02:57.590> my<00:02:57.740> finished<00:02:57.950> facial<00:02:58.430> design
