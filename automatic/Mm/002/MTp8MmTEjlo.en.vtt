00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.749
 ah 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.639
 very well then let's start modeling 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.219
 our phone booth will start 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:16.099
 for making the piece of the base for it 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.140
 let's create a polygon cube 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:20.930
 remember that there are two ways to 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.660
 create a juice in mesh the first and more 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.410
 simple is to click on the tap of 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:32.050
 polygon and select the option of 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:35.360
 cube the second is in the create menu 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.730
 polygon primitives that can use 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.309
 either of the two 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.530
 and we will create the cube that is put here 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:46.610
 directly in the center of our 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.530
 grid I'm going to press the number 5 on my 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.800
 keyboard to see the faces of my 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.220
 polygon and the letter f to get closer 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.190
 to him 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.200
 here I have it then I 'm going to modify 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.680
 your measurements so that it serves me as a base 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.720
 for my telephone booth to modify 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.120
 these measures I will not go to the channel box 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.540
 which is on the right side if not what 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.970
 they have open they can open it in the 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.700
 icon that is in the extreme part 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.010
 top right this that is here 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.590
 where is the mouse cursor click 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.630
 there and the channel box opens very well 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.340
 here we are going to download this bar 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.250
 displacement and where are the 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.110
 tickets we are going to give a click to poli 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.230
 coupon that is the 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:36.270
 the piece that we created very well 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:40.590
 in the width I'm going to put 6 units in 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.140
 the height I'm going to put point 4 and in 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.480
 depth another 6 units so that I 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.750
 there is a square base like that 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.960
 the subdivisions in 1 1 and 1 are very 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.960
 all right 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.160
 I already have here my base what I'm going to do 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:02.460
 now it is to apply a tool 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.090
 so that the edges do not leave them so 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.149
 sharp that makes them a little rounded 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:12.420
 and it looks less artificial in the render 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.790
 final very well then I'm going to go to 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.840
 menu must be sure that he is here 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:22.350
 selected the polygon edit option more 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:25.590
 and we are going to give a click on the part 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.680
 right where is this box that will do 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.630
 reference in the future as an option box 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.840
 we click on the option box of the 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:37.680
 tool and we get these options 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.270
 ok, let's reset it well 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.450
 it's how it should come out to you 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.220
 first time when they use it and we're going to 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.150
 change these values ​​because they are 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.180
 facts d 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.280
 so it's very big 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.420
 because we want something smaller more 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:58.650
 subtle then here we are going to put a 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:02.459
 width of 0.05 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:05.160
 and put two segments when we give 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.280
 click on the baby button 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.580
 I'm going to bring you here and you can see what 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.980
 what he did is on the edge 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:19.350
 that was in the middle put two more 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:21.630
 edges around and one with a kind 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.510
 of minimum roundness that makes the piece 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.070
 look much more appealing to the eye it 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.410
 see the edge much better so 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:31.170
 completely square to 90 degrees very 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.390
 well select my piece here in 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.080
 the channel box double click on the name 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.590
 and modified it I'm going to put tardis and a 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.730
 under base 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.890
 and that is the basis of my telephone booth 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.630
 The next thing I will do is put a 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.720
 flat 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.300
 polygon plane up here I give a click 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.460
 to the icon the plane was created in here 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.940
 press the number 4 on the keyboard to 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.350
 see it here it is and the letter w brings out the 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.350
 translation manipulator 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.430
 I will upload it and press again 5 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.859
 very well 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.680
 with this I'm going to leave I'll go to the 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:12.450
 side view remember that to change 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.150
 views by pressing the space key 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.180
 we can do it 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.639
 and to choose some nothing else there is 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.470
 put the mouse cursor over the one 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.860
 we want to see and press space another 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.470
 time and there we go very well what I 'm going 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.320
 to do here is 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.810
 put it just above the base 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:38.630
 This is the template that will help us 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.630
 to put the columns I'm going to see 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.520
 in a corner I press efe for 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.520
 get closer 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.620
 and here I have it very well 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.560
 let's change the measures so that 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:56.610
 serve us as a column we are going to put 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:05:00.870
 wide point 6 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:05.220
 of high point 6 and we are going to change the 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:09.000
 divisions we are going to put 4 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.330
 and 4 well I'll put it right in the 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.330
 corner 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.729
 and good 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.930
 with this plane I will start modeling the 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.930
 column the column 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.920
 of those who hold the four walls 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:30.620
 because they are here 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.620
 and that we will do in the next video
