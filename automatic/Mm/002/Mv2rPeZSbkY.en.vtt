00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.610
 from a team from another band instead of taking tnt is a point to come 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.050
 what is that anyway 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.750
 it's a nice website 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.750
 as a writer you can place ten pages of your future 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:12.719
 but with readers 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.439
 can buy shares in that 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:15.250
 but the striker 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.630
 do not post 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.779
 June it should be the project NPS point is booked evolutionary 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:22.800
 what exactly can we see 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.960
 I also think the most isolated is that the reader decides what is there 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.699
 finally in the bookstore 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.859
 can buy and read the right of construction there 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.780
 and if you still look at him 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.160
 when development it was like your inbox of money in fact just about the 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.400
 they put this on a book I studied they spread under 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.240
 consumers among readers 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.550
 but keep booking yourself only the distribution form is different when you look 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.380
 it a bit it could really go on to read on and there it has 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.830
 in this statement the foundation contain that it is innovative 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.640
 It is a new investor especially afraid that would of course always be 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.310
 interested night you can explain exactly how 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.260
 how those investments and they work 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.460
 yes you invest as held as a reader 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.970
 15 euros per share in its manifesto 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.300
 if it is not issued you will get it 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.200
 yes i am going back with deduction of the cost of saxony costs 4 euro per share 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.030
 back 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.410
 And if it is published, do not earn from selling the book 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.450
 then together with all shareholders you earn ten percent of the 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.300
 men a competitive price excluding VAT 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.020
 so that was also an author within four months 2000 shares must see 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.290
 to sell 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.900
 do you think this is going well 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.160
 yes i think the catch up number ex 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.580
 I am even in the west and the middle east 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.240
 that best sold for the first time since itself is eight times five by the way 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.480
 has been sold for years 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.080
 if you continue like that he made the crew of his five kids out of it 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.350
 twelve different to sell 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.770
 I think the attack they believe does not compensate anyone for damage 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.549
 a starter 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.360
 the book world known as conservative appearance 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.280
 that thinks they will accept this as a new concept 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.670
 and if you look at the mr business 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.519
 the extra companies in the book trade 10 I expect it tells the gentlemen 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.420
 I have had quite a few conversations with publishers following the first 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:19.059
 pair from gent x factor 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:21.839
 who have indicated that they want to work together 

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:25.459
 the company also has a branch in the store does not exist 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.269
 only 14 as an online store 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.099
 who has the origin provision here and now 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.160
 to be able to set up a very nice collaboration that is the judge for a short time 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.159
 was by distracting traditional contain 

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:41.289
 so directly on innovation 

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:43.979
 what does the traditional publishers broadcast 

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:47.799
 That often makes it difficult with the huge amount of risk he was sent 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:53.259
 The line selection make money must be refused tens of thousands 

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:55.849
 ships returned after such a sale 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.340
 it is the second and not in the mood for a book that he is going to say the 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.979
 issue price stack of fishes 

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:02.559
 the minister said Tuesday 

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:06.019
 with the platform also do not spend on the viewer's ability 

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:11.859
 interest is planned for paid somewhere in the world of governance 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.049
 is for his book 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.370
 We can also provide renowned authors at Utrecht 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.459
 yes of course there is no more than welcome afterwards 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.209
 has a partnership 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.019
 and then we do not have a really big major the well-known Dutch authors 

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:32.189
 It is soon that you end up in the hospital if you do not spend money on it 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:34.279
 contain looking 

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:38.629
 I do have a few well-known people such as the South region 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:40.789
 the Rose 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:43.039
 and columns the in 

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:44.409
 but also 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:47.209
 that is an organ in northern ireland and 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.769
 the action has let minister 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.289
 step down 

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:54.289
 recently the cinema has been placed on the roads blacksmith 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.730
 and also before and after the launch of tijn pacers 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.489
 when the compass is in stock 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.739
 quite a bit of discussion about this project 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.509
 Could you explain your answer 

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:07.100
 we have been working for the past six months 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.339
 the working title the police in publishing country 

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:13.999
 the formation then we also approached a number of aspiring writers to participate 

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:14.659
 to do 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:17.690
 Unfortunately, they could not tell the concept if you can imagine that 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.519
 some of them 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.430
 kiekens region visitors is something dear in the popular mouth or not 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.540
 there is a lot of confidence that it was pretty awkward india period 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.979
 at the same time it is true that fortunately most reactions are positive but also 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.569
 the concept was not yet known 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:35.569
 and still positive news 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.180
 were able to launch that with 70 manuscripts 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.889
 it is already difficult to get a good start on the superstar website 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:43.690
 and now 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.280
 now of course hope that he is the new harry potter a file the team 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.530
 not childish until then may smoke and indirectly restart for it 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.879
 difference is in hengelo 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:52.900
 I hope they do 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.379
 to be able to publish the book 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:56.309
 can come through his games 

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:59.439
 or can place them with publishing houses that are read by a large audience
