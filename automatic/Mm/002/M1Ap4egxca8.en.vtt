invention a new back roller for you and

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.810 
invention a new back roller for you and
before<00:00:10.170> I<00:00:10.200> show<00:00:10.559> it<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.769> you<00:00:10.950> I<00:00:11.130> want<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.580> show

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
before I show it to you I want to show

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.660 
before I show it to you I want to show
you<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.179> original<00:00:12.630> one<00:00:13.320> which<00:00:14.160> was<00:00:14.400> made<00:00:14.639> out

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
you the original one which was made out

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.800 
you the original one which was made out
of<00:00:15.000> foam<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:16.730> you<00:00:17.730> know<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.000> foam<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.449> fine

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
of foam and you know the foam is fine

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.010 
of foam and you know the foam is fine
except<00:00:19.529> it's<00:00:19.949> made<00:00:20.310> out<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.520> petroleum

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
except it's made out of petroleum

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.109 
except it's made out of petroleum
products<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.130> it<00:00:23.130> only<00:00:23.310> lasts<00:00:23.820> for<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.060> few

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
products and it only lasts for a few

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.330 
products and it only lasts for a few
months<00:00:24.750> because<00:00:24.930> after<00:00:25.410> you've<00:00:25.560> rolled<00:00:25.800> on<00:00:26.099> it

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
months because after you've rolled on it

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.120 
months because after you've rolled on it
so<00:00:26.580> much<00:00:26.849> then<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.420> squishes<00:00:28.019> down<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:29.039> it

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
so much then it squishes down and it

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.170 
so much then it squishes down and it
will<00:00:29.279> not<00:00:29.550> roll<00:00:30.000> anymore<00:00:31.309> and<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:32.610> what<00:00:33.030> we

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
will not roll anymore and so what we

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.630 
will not roll anymore and so what we
needed<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.660> do<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.050> find<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.640> natural

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
needed to do is find a natural

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.729 
needed to do is find a natural
substitute<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.660> would<00:00:36.809> last<00:00:37.050> for<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.500> long

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
substitute that would last for a long

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.910 
substitute that would last for a long
time<00:00:38.250> not<00:00:38.879> out<00:00:39.149> gas<00:00:39.510> any<00:00:39.840> chemicals<00:00:40.530> like<00:00:40.860> a

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
time not out gas any chemicals like a

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.779 
time not out gas any chemicals like a
petroleum<00:00:41.700> product<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:43.550> something<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.670> you

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
petroleum product and something that you

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.049 
petroleum product and something that you
could<00:00:44.969> touch<00:00:45.239> on<00:00:45.539> bare<00:00:45.840> skin<00:00:46.469> with<00:00:47.309> no<00:00:47.489> problem

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
could touch on bare skin with no problem

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.150 
could touch on bare skin with no problem
so<00:00:48.539> what<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.719> did<00:00:48.840> was<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.289> created<00:00:49.620> this

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
so what I did was I created this

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.439 
so what I did was I created this
prototype<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:52.309> it's<00:00:53.309> made<00:00:53.550> out<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.820> wood

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
prototype and it's made out of wood

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.869 
prototype and it's made out of wood
this<00:00:54.780> one<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.110> made<00:00:55.260> out<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.559> cherry<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.280> it's

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
this one is made out of cherry and it's

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.150 
this one is made out of cherry and it's
got<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.120> channel<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> center<00:00:58.440> as<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.829> can

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
got a channel in the center as you can

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.819 
got a channel in the center as you can
see<00:00:59.399> for<00:01:00.030> your<00:01:00.300> vertebrae<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:00.989> pass<00:01:01.379> through

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
see for your vertebrae to pass through

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.039 
see for your vertebrae to pass through
without<00:01:02.100> touching<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.600> then<00:01:03.719> it's<00:01:03.899> got

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
without touching it and then it's got

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.289 
without touching it and then it's got
latex<00:01:04.739> rubber<00:01:05.010> on<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.460> outside<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:07.159> so<00:01:08.299> it's

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
latex rubber on the outside and so it's

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.140 
latex rubber on the outside and so it's
all<00:01:09.479> healthy<00:01:09.810> but<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:11.280> problem<00:01:11.790> with<00:01:11.970> this

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
all healthy but the problem with this

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.410 
all healthy but the problem with this
one<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.890> needs<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.369> be<00:01:14.549> adjustable

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
one is that it needs to be adjustable

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.670 
one is that it needs to be adjustable
see<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.110> each<00:01:16.979> side<00:01:17.750> needs<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.930> be<00:01:19.110> adjustable

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
see the each side needs to be adjustable

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.030 
see the each side needs to be adjustable
so<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.549> center<00:01:21.150> portion<00:01:21.590> can<00:01:22.590> be<00:01:22.830> as

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
so that the center portion can be as

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.179 
so that the center portion can be as
wide<00:01:23.610> or<00:01:24.119> as<00:01:24.360> thin<00:01:24.750> as<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.049> need<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.770> be<00:01:25.799> for

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
wide or as thin as you need it to be for

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.749 
wide or as thin as you need it to be for
your<00:01:26.490> own<00:01:26.729> back<00:01:27.380> so<00:01:28.380> what<00:01:29.040> did<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.430> do

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
your own back so what did I do

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.609 
your own back so what did I do
I<00:01:30.140> made<00:01:31.140> them<00:01:31.380> separate<00:01:31.860> sides<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:33.619> created

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
I made them separate sides I created

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.300 
I made them separate sides I created
separate<00:01:35.100> sides<00:01:36.290> with<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> half-inch<00:01:37.979> rod

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
separate sides with a half-inch rod

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.359 
separate sides with a half-inch rod
going<00:01:38.729> through<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.180> center<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.979> you<00:01:40.979> can<00:01:41.009> put

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
going through the center and you can put

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.389 
going through the center and you can put
as<00:01:41.490> many<00:01:41.610> shims<00:01:42.210> on<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.720> inside<00:01:43.170> as<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:44.159> need

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
as many shims on the inside as you need

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.609 
as many shims on the inside as you need
so<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.880> can<00:01:45.149> make<00:01:45.420> them<00:01:45.659> as<00:01:45.810> wide<00:01:46.170> apart

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
so that you can make them as wide apart

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.899 
so that you can make them as wide apart
from<00:01:47.520> each<00:01:47.700> other<00:01:47.939> as<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.750> need<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.909> how

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
from each other as you need to and how

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.580 
from each other as you need to and how
does<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.090> work<00:01:52.549> perfect<00:01:53.930> absolutely<00:01:54.930> awesome

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
does it work perfect absolutely awesome

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.190 
does it work perfect absolutely awesome
and<00:01:56.600> this<00:01:57.600> will<00:01:57.990> last<00:01:58.259> for<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.740> long<00:01:59.780> time<00:02:00.780> as

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
and this will last for a long time as

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.840 
and this will last for a long time as
you<00:02:01.380> can<00:02:01.560> imagine<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:02.219> one<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.490> made<00:02:02.640> out<00:02:02.820> of

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
you can imagine this one is made out of

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.359 
you can imagine this one is made out of
pine<00:02:03.299> but<00:02:04.229> in<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.500> future<00:02:04.860> they're<00:02:05.070> going<00:02:05.100> to

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
pine but in the future they're going to

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.190 
pine but in the future they're going to
be<00:02:05.490> made<00:02:05.700> out<00:02:05.909> of

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
be made out of

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
be made out of
maple<00:02:07.330> and<00:02:08.330> so<00:02:08.720> let<00:02:09.500> me<00:02:09.530> just<00:02:09.770> do<00:02:09.979> a<00:02:10.009> little

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
maple and so let me just do a little

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.759 
maple and so let me just do a little
demonstration<00:02:10.750> for<00:02:11.750> you<00:02:11.989> here<00:02:12.290> and<00:02:12.470> I'm<00:02:12.560> going

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
demonstration for you here and I'm going

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.800 
demonstration for you here and I'm going
to<00:02:12.830> do<00:02:13.010> it<00:02:13.190> with<00:02:13.370> no<00:02:13.400> shirt<00:02:13.910> on<00:02:14.150> because<00:02:14.569> that's

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
to do it with no shirt on because that's

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.670

don't see anything on them that could
possibly<00:05:00.490> break<00:05:00.910> it's<00:05:01.300> a<00:05:01.450> solid<00:05:01.870> piece<00:05:02.050> of

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
possibly break it's a solid piece of

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.850 
possibly break it's a solid piece of
wood<00:05:02.700> latex<00:05:03.700> rubber<00:05:04.000> that<00:05:04.360> is<00:05:04.419> not<00:05:04.750> glued<00:05:05.380> but

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
wood latex rubber that is not glued but

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.940 
wood latex rubber that is not glued but
it's<00:05:06.250> glued<00:05:06.580> but<00:05:06.910> not<00:05:07.150> with<00:05:07.419> toxic<00:05:08.140> glue<00:05:08.350> this

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
it's glued but not with toxic glue this

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.440 
it's glued but not with toxic glue this
is<00:05:09.220> pure<00:05:09.729> liquid<00:05:10.270> latex<00:05:10.780> rubber<00:05:11.430> and<00:05:12.430> so<00:05:13.270> it's

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
is pure liquid latex rubber and so it's

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.719
