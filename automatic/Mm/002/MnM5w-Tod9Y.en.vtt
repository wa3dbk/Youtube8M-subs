00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.070 
continue i'll just give you a bit of a
step<00:02:38.540> through<00:02:38.750> this<00:02:39.710> here<00:02:39.950> is<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.070> march<00:02:40.370> pump

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
step through this here is the march pump

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.980 
step through this here is the march pump
magnetically<00:02:42.080> coupled<00:02:42.260> pump<00:02:43.480> what<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:44.510> do<00:02:44.630> here

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
magnetically coupled pump what I do here

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.160 
magnetically coupled pump what I do here
is<00:02:45.080> I<00:02:45.200> mess<00:02:45.800> up<00:02:45.950> here<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.400> match<00:02:46.550> time<00:02:47.170> so

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
is I mess up here to the match time so

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.480 
is I mess up here to the match time so
it<00:02:48.230> comes<00:02:48.410> out<00:02:48.650> from<00:02:48.860> underneath<00:02:49.100> it<00:02:49.310> feels

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
it comes out from underneath it feels

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.270 
it comes out from underneath it feels
better<00:02:49.790> through<00:02:50.600> the<00:02:50.720> March<00:02:50.930> pump<00:02:51.290> up<00:02:51.980> through

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
better through the March pump up through

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.730 
better through the March pump up through
the<00:02:52.400> heating<00:02:52.700> elements<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:53.330> then<00:02:53.810> back<00:02:54.020> in<00:02:54.230> so

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
the heating elements and then back in so

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.530 
the heating elements and then back in so
it<00:02:54.860> recirculates<00:02:55.160> the<00:02:55.640> water<00:02:55.880> during<00:02:56.390> the

alright<00:03:32.540> so<00:03:32.780> 15<00:03:33.530> liters<00:03:33.860> then<00:03:34.090> we'll<00:03:35.090> just

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
alright so 15 liters then we'll just

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.060 
alright so 15 liters then we'll just
pour<00:03:35.630> that<00:03:35.870> into<00:03:36.020> the<00:03:36.140> mesh<00:03:36.290> time<00:03:36.560> here<00:03:36.770> making

pour that into the mesh time here making

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.710 
pour that into the mesh time here making
sure<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.340> taps<00:03:37.580> are<00:03:37.730> off<00:03:40.390> like<00:03:41.390> I<00:03:41.480> said<00:03:41.600> the

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
sure the taps are off like I said the

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.290 
sure the taps are off like I said the
recipe<00:03:42.140> requires<00:03:42.470> I'm<00:03:42.860> 22<00:03:43.700> liters<00:03:44.000> of<00:03:44.120> water

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
recipe requires I'm 22 liters of water

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.530 
recipe requires I'm 22 liters of water
that's<00:03:45.260> our<00:03:45.440> first<00:03:45.620> thing<00:03:45.980> I<00:03:46.250> can<00:03:47.180> go<00:03:47.300> over

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
that's our first thing I can go over

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.350 
that's our first thing I can go over
here<00:03:47.870> and<00:03:48.190> lock<00:03:49.190> that<00:03:49.370> down<00:03:49.610> on<00:03:49.790> my<00:03:49.910> computer

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
here and lock that down on my computer

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.200 
here and lock that down on my computer
to<00:03:50.420> send<00:03:50.600> out<00:03:50.960> of<00:03:51.080> 10<00:03:51.290> liters<00:03:51.590> of<00:03:51.710> water<00:03:55.210> then

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.210 
to send out of 10 liters of water then

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:01.380 
to send out of 10 liters of water then
we<00:03:56.300> start<00:03:56.570> measuring<00:03:56.780> out<00:03:57.050> the<00:03:57.140> next<00:03:57.410> 10

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.900 

I<00:04:01.450> always<00:04:02.170> start<00:04:02.440> on<00:04:02.620> my<00:04:02.860> water<00:04:03.130> first<00:04:03.430> if<00:04:03.790> you

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
I always start on my water first if you

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.090 
I always start on my water first if you
like<00:04:04.060> obviously<00:04:04.390> start<00:04:04.720> the<00:04:04.840> system<00:04:05.260> running

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
like obviously start the system running

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.059 
like obviously start the system running
to<00:04:06.819> get<00:04:06.940> it<00:04:07.060> up<00:04:07.180> to<00:04:07.209> strike<00:04:07.600> temperature<00:04:08.110> the

water down there if you see a water
right<00:05:45.490> there<00:05:45.570> here's<00:05:46.570> a<00:05:46.660> temperature<00:05:47.140> probe

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
right there here's a temperature probe

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.529 
right there here's a temperature probe
here<00:05:47.710> you<00:05:48.400> can<00:05:48.520> see<00:05:48.669> the<00:05:48.700> filter<00:05:49.150> beds<00:05:49.330> and<00:05:49.479> I

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:49.539 
here you can see the filter beds and I

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:50.820 
here you can see the filter beds and I
installed<00:05:49.930> a<00:05:49.990> little<00:05:50.200> bit<00:05:50.320> earlier<00:05:50.650> in<00:05:50.740> the

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
installed a little bit earlier in the

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.340 
installed a little bit earlier in the
segment<00:05:51.090> I'm<00:05:52.090> pretty<00:05:52.570> much<00:05:52.720> that<00:05:52.960> is<00:05:53.080> all

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:53.350 
segment I'm pretty much that is all

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.050 
segment I'm pretty much that is all
ready<00:05:53.710> to<00:05:53.800> go<00:05:53.890> to<00:05:54.039> start<00:05:54.400> heating<00:05:54.610> up<00:05:54.820> for<00:05:55.000> the

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
ready to go to start heating up for the

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.120 
ready to go to start heating up for the
strike<00:05:55.390> what<00:05:56.020> I'll<00:05:56.140> do<00:05:56.289> now<00:05:56.500> is<00:05:56.530> I'll<00:05:56.770> install

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
strike what I'll do now is I'll install

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.710 
strike what I'll do now is I'll install
some<00:05:57.370> insulation<00:05:57.760> around<00:05:58.060> the<00:05:58.300> mash<00:05:58.450> time

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
some insulation around the mash time

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.390 
some insulation around the mash time
here<00:05:58.960> so<00:05:59.140> that<00:05:59.620> we're<00:05:59.710> not<00:05:59.740> wasting<00:06:00.039> too<00:06:00.370> much

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
here so that we're not wasting too much

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.770 
here so that we're not wasting too much
energy<00:06:01.710> just<00:06:02.710> heating<00:06:02.950> up<00:06:03.010> the<00:06:03.070> air<00:06:03.190> so<00:06:03.780> I'll

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:04.780 
energy just heating up the air so I'll

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.210 
energy just heating up the air so I'll
give<00:06:05.140> handy<00:06:05.440> back<00:06:05.590> to<00:06:05.680> the<00:06:05.770> cameraman<00:06:06.160> and

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.220 
give handy back to the cameraman and

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.850 
give handy back to the cameraman and
we'll<00:06:06.520> go<00:06:06.729> from<00:06:06.760> it<00:06:07.030> alright<00:06:07.810> this<00:06:07.930> is<00:06:07.990> it<00:06:08.110> this

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
we'll go from it alright this is it this

we'll go from it alright this is it this
is<00:06:09.010> my<00:06:09.160> very<00:06:09.430> primitive<00:06:09.870> installation<00:06:10.870> it's

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
is my very primitive installation it's

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.510 
is my very primitive installation it's
actually<00:06:11.979> a<00:06:12.300> polyester<00:06:13.300> insulation<00:06:14.110> back<00:06:14.520> by

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
actually a polyester insulation back by

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.060 
actually a polyester insulation back by
the<00:06:15.580> table<00:06:15.910> what<00:06:16.030> it<00:06:16.120> works<00:06:16.270> a<00:06:16.419> treat<00:06:16.570> I<00:06:17.070> really

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.070 
the table what it works a treat I really

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.980 
the table what it works a treat I really
do<00:06:18.190> want<00:06:18.370> to<00:06:18.430> get<00:06:18.550> around<00:06:18.789> to<00:06:19.030> making<00:06:19.240> a<00:06:19.600> proper

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
do want to get around to making a proper

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:25.350 
do want to get around to making a proper
removable<00:06:22.680> insulation<00:06:23.680> body<00:06:23.919> for<00:06:24.280> it<00:06:24.360> but

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
removable insulation body for it but

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.470 
removable insulation body for it but
till<00:06:25.960> I<00:06:25.990> get<00:06:26.229> round<00:06:26.440> to<00:06:26.590> that<00:06:26.940> this<00:06:27.940> thing

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:28.480 
till I get round to that this thing

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.610 
till I get round to that this thing
track<00:06:29.110> and<00:06:29.260> mobile<00:06:29.800> continual<00:06:30.280> illusion<00:06:31.620> so

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
track and mobile continual illusion so

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.310 
track and mobile continual illusion so
fall<00:06:32.860> be<00:06:32.980> honest<00:06:33.220> here<00:06:33.810> guys<00:06:34.810> around<00:06:35.020> there

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:37.320 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:45.170 

goes<00:06:38.320> there<00:06:40.650> pull<00:06:41.650> that<00:06:41.830> up<00:06:41.860> sit<00:06:42.490> up<00:06:42.550> like<00:06:42.760> that

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:50.430 

piece<00:06:46.180> of<00:06:46.210> it<00:06:46.450> over<00:06:46.630> here<00:06:48.480> it<00:06:49.480> seems<00:06:49.780> I'm<00:06:49.990> here

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 
piece of it over here it seems I'm here

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.920 
piece of it over here it seems I'm here
to<00:06:50.680> form<00:06:51.630> from<00:06:52.630> the<00:06:53.700> insulation<00:06:54.700> as<00:06:55.540> I<00:06:55.720> said

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:55.930 
to form from the insulation as I said

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.720 
to form from the insulation as I said
very<00:06:56.200> primitive<00:06:56.530> before<00:06:57.160> the<00:06:57.280> board<00:06:57.490> as<00:06:57.610> it

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:57.730 
very primitive before the board as it

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.260 
very primitive before the board as it
