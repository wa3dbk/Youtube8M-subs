we<00:00:02.920> already<00:00:03.100> learned<00:00:03.429> how<00:00:03.610> to<00:00:03.670> name<00:00:03.909> ionic

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
we already learned how to name ionic

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.230 
we already learned how to name ionic
compounds<00:00:05.350> but<00:00:05.590> we<00:00:06.069> need<00:00:06.279> to<00:00:06.430> go<00:00:06.580> over<00:00:06.879> the

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:07.240 
compounds but we need to go over the

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.480 
compounds but we need to go over the
naming<00:00:07.629> conventions<00:00:08.139> for<00:00:08.410> ionic<00:00:08.950> compounds

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:09.490 
naming conventions for ionic compounds

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.000 
naming conventions for ionic compounds
with<00:00:09.670> transition<00:00:10.389> metals<00:00:10.750> because

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
with transition metals because

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.629 
with transition metals because
transition<00:00:12.010> metals<00:00:12.400> often<00:00:13.090> have<00:00:13.629> different

transition metals often have different

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.750 
transition metals often have different
charges<00:00:15.639> for<00:00:15.940> each<00:00:16.209> element

3 let's look at iron plus 2 when it

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.929 
3 let's look at iron plus 2 when it
combines<00:00:28.670> with<00:00:29.180> the<00:00:29.510> oxygen<00:00:29.890> anion<00:00:30.890> when<00:00:31.790> we

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
combines with the oxygen anion when we

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.229 
combines with the oxygen anion when we
crossed<00:00:32.210> the<00:00:32.330> charges<00:00:32.870> we<00:00:33.230> get<00:00:33.440> Fe<00:00:33.980> 2<00:00:34.309> O<00:00:34.340> 2<00:00:34.580> and

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
crossed the charges we get Fe 2 O 2 and

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.450 
crossed the charges we get Fe 2 O 2 and
we<00:00:35.690> know<00:00:35.840> from<00:00:35.870> before<00:00:36.200> that<00:00:36.739> when<00:00:36.980> both<00:00:37.250> of

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
we know from before that when both of

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.520 
we know from before that when both of
the<00:00:37.730> coefficients<00:00:38.390> are<00:00:38.510> the<00:00:38.629> same<00:00:38.870> they

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
the coefficients are the same they

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.490 
the coefficients are the same they
cancel<00:00:40.010> out<00:00:40.190> giving<00:00:40.489> us<00:00:41.120> a<00:00:41.270> chemical<00:00:42.110> formula

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
cancel out giving us a chemical formula

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.150 
cancel out giving us a chemical formula
of<00:00:42.530> FeO<00:00:43.250> now<00:00:43.910> how<00:00:44.180> do<00:00:44.239> we<00:00:44.420> say<00:00:44.809> this<00:00:45.110> we<00:00:45.890> say

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
of FeO now how do we say this we say

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.830 
of FeO now how do we say this we say
iron<00:00:46.809> Roman<00:00:47.809> numeral<00:00:48.290> 2<00:00:48.590> oxide<00:00:49.489> and<00:00:49.850> you<00:00:50.510> say

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
iron Roman numeral 2 oxide and you say

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.290 
iron Roman numeral 2 oxide and you say
it<00:00:50.960> that<00:00:51.140> way<00:00:51.199> because<00:00:51.620> the<00:00:52.580> chart<00:00:52.970> of<00:00:53.180> the

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:01.159 
numeral two oxide now what if we were

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:03.310 
numeral two oxide now what if we were
looking<00:01:01.460> at<00:01:01.550> the<00:01:01.729> iron<00:01:01.940> with<00:01:02.510> the<00:01:02.809> charge<00:01:03.110> of

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
looking at the iron with the charge of

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.940 
looking at the iron with the charge of
plus<00:01:03.620> 3<00:01:04.040> when<00:01:04.760> that<00:01:04.909> combines<00:01:05.330> with<00:01:05.570> oxygen<00:01:05.950> we

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
plus 3 when that combines with oxygen we

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.890 
plus 3 when that combines with oxygen we
cross<00:01:07.250> those<00:01:07.549> charges<00:01:08.030> and<00:01:08.360> we<00:01:08.810> get<00:01:09.020> fe<00:01:09.799> 2<00:01:10.100> o<00:01:10.430> 3

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
cross those charges and we get fe 2 o 3

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.620 
cross those charges and we get fe 2 o 3
this<00:01:11.900> will<00:01:12.110> be<00:01:12.260> called<00:01:12.590> iron<00:01:13.280> Roman<00:01:13.820> numeral<00:01:14.180> 3

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
this will be called iron Roman numeral 3

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.430 
this will be called iron Roman numeral 3
oxide<00:01:15.760> the<00:01:16.760> reason<00:01:17.120> being<00:01:17.150> is<00:01:17.690> because<00:01:17.750> the

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
oxide the reason being is because the

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.660 
oxide the reason being is because the
charge<00:01:18.770> of<00:01:19.040> the<00:01:19.549> iron<00:01:19.850> cation<00:01:20.750> is<00:01:21.080> plus<00:01:21.680> 3<00:01:22.070> so

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
charge of the iron cation is plus 3 so

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.630 
charge of the iron cation is plus 3 so
you<00:01:22.760> have<00:01:23.090> an<00:01:23.360> a<00:01:23.900> cation<00:01:24.620> which<00:01:24.650> can<00:01:24.950> form<00:01:25.190> more

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
you have an a cation which can form more

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.540 
you have an a cation which can form more
than<00:01:25.940> one<00:01:26.270> kind<00:01:26.720> of<00:01:27.080> charge<00:01:27.470> you<00:01:28.220> need<00:01:28.400> to

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
than one kind of charge you need to

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.760 
than one kind of charge you need to
determine<00:01:28.910> what<00:01:29.330> charge<00:01:29.720> it<00:01:30.020> has<00:01:30.320> when<00:01:30.680> you

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
determine what charge it has when you

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.190 
determine what charge it has when you
say<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.100> name<00:01:31.310> if<00:01:31.610> it<00:01:32.240> has<00:01:32.390> a<00:01:32.420> charge<00:01:32.780> of<00:01:32.930> plus

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
say the name if it has a charge of plus

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.580 
say the name if it has a charge of plus
2<00:01:33.470> then<00:01:34.400> you<00:01:34.490> need<00:01:34.700> to<00:01:34.820> say<00:01:35.000> iron<00:01:35.330> to<00:01:35.750> oxide<00:01:36.320> if

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
2 then you need to say iron to oxide if

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.070 
2 then you need to say iron to oxide if
it<00:01:37.190> has<00:01:37.340> a<00:01:37.370> charge<00:01:37.670> of<00:01:37.790> plus<00:01:38.060> 3<00:01:38.390> you<00:01:38.780> need<00:01:38.930> to

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
it has a charge of plus 3 you need to

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.480 
it has a charge of plus 3 you need to
say<00:01:39.260> iron<00:01:39.500> 3<00:01:40.280> oxide

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.980 

next<00:01:44.490> let's<00:01:44.670> look<00:01:44.820> at<00:01:45.000> copper<00:01:45.300> which<00:01:45.630> forms

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
next let's look at copper which forms

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.480 
next let's look at copper which forms
cations<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.770> charge<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.340> plus<00:01:47.760> 1<00:01:48.120> and<00:01:48.360> plus<00:01:48.930> 2

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
cations of charge of plus 1 and plus 2

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.030 
cations of charge of plus 1 and plus 2
now<00:01:50.600> let's<00:01:51.600> start<00:01:51.780> with<00:01:51.870> the<00:01:52.020> plus<00:01:52.320> 2<00:01:52.500> cation

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
now let's start with the plus 2 cation

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.870 
now let's start with the plus 2 cation
combining<00:01:53.729> with<00:01:54.140> chlorine<00:01:55.550> when<00:01:56.550> you<00:01:56.640> cross

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
combining with chlorine when you cross

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.609 
combining with chlorine when you cross
the<00:01:57.090> charges<00:01:57.660> we<00:01:58.229> get<00:01:58.820> cucl<00:01:59.820> two<00:01:59.820> now<00:02:00.750> we<00:02:00.810> swipe

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
the charges we get cucl two now we swipe

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.620 
the charges we get cucl two now we swipe
this<00:02:01.920> we<00:02:02.820> say<00:02:03.000> this<00:02:03.240> as<00:02:03.390> copper<00:02:04.290> two<00:02:04.680> chloride

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
this we say this as copper two chloride

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.870 
this we say this as copper two chloride
because<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.780> charge<00:02:07.050> of<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.410> cation<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.160> plus

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
because the charge of the cation is plus

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.300 
because the charge of the cation is plus
two<00:02:09.259> now<00:02:10.259> let's<00:02:10.500> look<00:02:10.619> at<00:02:10.740> the<00:02:10.860> copper<00:02:11.160> would

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
two now let's look at the copper would

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.699 
two now let's look at the copper would
such<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.640> charge<00:02:11.910> of<00:02:12.090> +1<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.870> that<00:02:13.290> combines

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
such a charge of +1 and that combines

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.280 
such a charge of +1 and that combines
with<00:02:14.010> chlorine<00:02:15.020> we<00:02:16.020> get<00:02:17.000> cucl<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.330> we<00:02:19.080> will

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
with chlorine we get cucl and we will

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.270 
with chlorine we get cucl and we will
say<00:02:19.470> that<00:02:19.709> as<00:02:19.980> copper<00:02:20.940> one<00:02:21.450> chloride<00:02:22.350> and<00:02:23.160> we

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
say that as copper one chloride and we

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.500 
say that as copper one chloride and we
say<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.610> because<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:24.000> charge<00:02:24.239> of<00:02:24.420> the

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
say that because the charge of the

say that because the charge of the
cation<00:02:25.080> is<00:02:25.430> +1<00:02:26.430> so<00:02:27.360> whenever<00:02:27.840> there<00:02:28.230> are

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
cation is +1 so whenever there are

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.740 
cation is +1 so whenever there are
different<00:02:28.950> charges<00:02:29.400> for<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.670> same<00:02:29.880> cation<00:02:30.510> we

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
different charges for the same cation we

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.410 
different charges for the same cation we
need<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:31.140> specify<00:02:31.770> which<00:02:32.459> one<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:32.910> with

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
need to specify which one it is with

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.860 
need to specify which one it is with
