well<00:01:09.659> made<00:01:11.060> solid<00:01:12.060> metal<00:01:12.390> but<00:01:13.049> there<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.380> a

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
well made solid metal but there is a

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.880 
well made solid metal but there is a
little<00:01:13.890> spring<00:01:15.110> they<00:01:16.110> don't<00:01:16.290> really<00:01:16.470> tell<00:01:16.740> you

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
little spring they don't really tell you

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.289 
little spring they don't really tell you
much<00:01:16.920> about<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.549> but<00:01:17.670> there's<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.939> little

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
much about that but there's a little

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.660 
much about that but there's a little
spring<00:01:19.229> catch<00:01:19.680> here<00:01:21.110> and<00:01:22.110> what<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.380> do<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.830> you

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
spring catch here and what you do is you

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.890 
spring catch here and what you do is you
line<00:01:23.939> up<00:01:25.580> these<00:01:26.580> orange<00:01:27.119> dots<00:01:29.630> where<00:01:30.630> are<00:01:30.810> you

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
line up these orange dots where are you

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.899 
line up these orange dots where are you
horns<00:01:31.229> dot<00:01:32.420> they're<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.869> orange<00:01:34.140> dot<00:01:34.729> to<00:01:35.729> that

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
horns dot they're the orange dot to that

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.420 
horns dot they're the orange dot to that
orange<00:01:36.329> dot<00:01:37.430> and<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.729> kind<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.030> turn<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:40.430> but

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
orange dot and you kind of turn it but

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.020 
orange dot and you kind of turn it but
you'll<00:01:41.579> notice<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.360> right<00:01:43.020> there<00:01:44.240> oops<00:01:47.030> that

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
you'll notice that right there oops that

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.219 
you'll notice that right there oops that
spring<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:49.020> preventing<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:50.070> from<00:01:51.229> actually

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
spring is preventing that from actually

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.840 
spring is preventing that from actually
going<00:01:52.439> completely<00:01:53.009> over<00:01:55.490> now<00:01:56.490> all<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.790> have

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
going completely over now all you have

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.429 
going completely over now all you have
to<00:01:56.969> do<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.420> reach<00:01:57.630> in<00:01:57.810> with<00:01:58.020> your<00:01:58.170> thumbnail

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
to do is reach in with your thumbnail

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.270 
to do is reach in with your thumbnail
and<00:01:59.130> lift<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.490> up<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.969> then<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:01.130> bring<00:02:02.130> that

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
and lift that up and then you bring that

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.359 
and lift that up and then you bring that
all<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.700> way<00:02:02.790> around<00:02:03.860> and<00:02:04.860> then<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.070> snaps

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
all the way around and then it snaps

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.150 
all the way around and then it snaps
into<00:02:05.579> place<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:06.149> then<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.990> spring<00:02:07.380> catches

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
into place and then the spring catches

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.729 
into place and then the spring catches
right<00:02:08.759> there<00:02:09.149> now<00:02:10.080> that's<00:02:10.410> secure

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
right there now that's secure

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.929 
right there now that's secure
and<00:02:13.739> it<00:02:14.099> melts<00:02:14.459> perfectly<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:15.299> the<00:02:15.420> cannon<00:02:16.939> and

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939 
and it melts perfectly to the cannon and

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:21.259 
and it melts perfectly to the cannon and
to<00:02:18.299> get<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.540> off<00:02:18.689> you<00:02:18.989> simply<00:02:19.819> lift<00:02:20.819> that<00:02:20.999> up

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
to get it off you simply lift that up

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:28.490 
to get it off you simply lift that up
and<00:02:22.170> slide<00:02:22.709> it<00:02:22.859> around<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.280> other<00:02:23.430> way<00:02:27.500> which

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
and slide it around the other way which

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:44.410 
and slide it around the other way which
is<00:02:28.530> easier<00:02:29.069> said<00:02:29.129> that<00:02:29.430> done

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.090 

it's<00:02:45.420> really<00:02:45.660> hard<00:02:45.900> when<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.290> get<00:02:46.410> this<00:02:46.830> piece

it's really hard when you get this piece

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.970 
it's really hard when you get this piece
moving<00:02:47.610> this<00:02:47.820> piece<00:02:48.060> moving<00:02:51.680> see<00:02:52.680> if<00:02:52.740> I<00:02:52.830> can

lenses<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.880> I<00:03:02.880> don't<00:03:03.300> think<00:03:03.720> it's<00:03:03.870> a<00:03:04.020> good

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
lenses and I don't think it's a good

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.530 
lenses and I don't think it's a good
idea<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.890> use<00:03:05.130> this<00:03:05.280> inner<00:03:05.670> interchangeably

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
idea to use this inner interchangeably

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.020 
idea to use this inner interchangeably
with<00:03:06.660> differently<00:03:07.380> I<00:03:07.680> would<00:03:08.220> suggest<00:03:08.460> getting

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
with differently I would suggest getting

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.770 
with differently I would suggest getting
one<00:03:09.600> of<00:03:09.630> these<00:03:09.840> for<00:03:10.800> every<00:03:11.210> lens<00:03:12.210> that<00:03:12.720> you

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
one of these for every lens that you

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.500 
one of these for every lens that you
have<00:03:13.140> one<00:03:13.500> of<00:03:13.560> these<00:03:13.650> old<00:03:13.860> lenses<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:14.510> just

have one of these old lenses and just

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.130 
have one of these old lenses and just

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
dedicate it to that lens because what

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.490 
dedicate it to that lens because what
happens<00:03:19.560> is<00:03:21.320> these<00:03:22.760> visa<00:03:23.760> I<00:03:24.480> don't<00:03:25.290> know<00:03:25.380> what

bigger and sometimes some of them are
smaller<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.310> what<00:03:32.670> happened<00:03:33.330> what<00:03:33.630> I<00:03:33.660> found

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
smaller and what happened what I found

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.740 
smaller and what happened what I found
was<00:03:34.320> I<00:03:34.530> tried<00:03:35.190> it<00:03:35.310> with<00:03:35.400> a<00:03:35.430> different<00:03:35.670> lens<00:03:36.360> and

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
was I tried it with a different lens and

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.830 
was I tried it with a different lens and
it<00:03:37.560> causes<00:03:38.070> this<00:03:39.000> right<00:03:39.270> here

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
it causes this right here

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.680 
it causes this right here
not<00:03:40.260> sure<00:03:40.560> if<00:03:40.680> you<00:03:40.800> can<00:03:40.920> see<00:03:41.130> that<00:03:41.420> right<00:03:42.420> here

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
not sure if you can see that right here

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.990 
not sure if you can see that right here
it<00:03:42.870> caused<00:03:43.170> that<00:03:43.760> to<00:03:44.760> compress<00:03:45.390> and<00:03:46.340> then<00:03:47.340> when

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
it caused that to compress and then when

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.520 
it caused that to compress and then when
I<00:03:48.030> took<00:03:48.269> it<00:03:48.390> off<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.510> other<00:03:48.750> lens<00:03:48.989> and<00:03:49.260> try<00:03:49.470> to

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
I took it off the other lens and try to

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.440 
I took it off the other lens and try to
put<00:03:49.739> it<00:03:49.769> back<00:03:49.860> on<00:03:49.980> this<00:03:50.280> one<00:03:50.519> it<00:03:50.670> was<00:03:51.060> loose<00:03:51.239> it

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
put it back on this one it was loose it

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.960 
put it back on this one it was loose it
just<00:03:51.630> kept<00:03:51.840> wobbling<00:03:52.350> around<00:03:52.550> and<00:03:53.550> like<00:03:53.760> oh

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
just kept wobbling around and like oh

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.390 
just kept wobbling around and like oh
this<00:03:54.300> is<00:03:54.450> terrible<00:03:54.900> but<00:03:55.530> what<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:55.739> found<00:03:56.040> is

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
this is terrible but what I found is

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.900 
this is terrible but what I found is
that<00:03:57.239> you<00:03:57.450> can<00:03:57.660> take<00:03:57.989> a<00:03:58.320> small<00:03:59.220> screwdriver

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
that you can take a small screwdriver

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.070 
that you can take a small screwdriver
like<00:04:00.510> this<00:04:01.459> and<00:04:02.459> put<00:04:02.700> it<00:04:02.730> down<00:04:03.090> into<00:04:03.690> there<00:04:03.870> and

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
like this and put it down into there and

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.640 
like this and put it down into there and
you<00:04:04.200> can<00:04:04.380> expand<00:04:05.269> you<00:04:06.269> can<00:04:06.330> expand<00:04:07.019> that<00:04:07.260> back

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
you can expand you can expand that back

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.680 
you can expand you can expand that back
up<00:04:07.980> and<00:04:08.310> that<00:04:08.430> will<00:04:08.610> tighten<00:04:09.680> that<00:04:10.680> lens<00:04:11.690> so

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
up and that will tighten that lens so

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.000 
up and that will tighten that lens so
like<00:04:12.930> I<00:04:13.049> said<00:04:14.900> by<00:04:15.900> several<00:04:16.560> of<00:04:16.620> these<00:04:16.799> if

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
like I said by several of these if

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.380
