 everything ends at that moment 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.459
 some jump from one relationship to another in 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.069

 from time to time without having any idea of 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.980
 what is the real problem to be clear 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.260
 addiction can be defined in a way 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.450
 general as a compulsive pattern a 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.640

 you feel at the beginning of the relationship you 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.079
 believes that this security has been achieved 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.000
 to feel disappointed and empty another 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:41.000
 time when the intensity of that desire 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.220
