coach<00:00:43.629> Tyler<00:00:43.960> mayor<00:00:44.140> I'm<00:00:44.920> not<00:00:45.129> sure<00:00:45.190> if<00:00:45.489> that

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
coach Tyler mayor I'm not sure if that

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.639 
coach Tyler mayor I'm not sure if that
day<00:00:45.969> where<00:00:46.690> my<00:00:46.870> weight<00:00:47.079> was<00:00:47.199> really<00:00:47.469> low<00:00:47.620> I

could have just been dehydrated so

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.200 
could have just been dehydrated so
that's<00:00:50.170> why<00:00:50.320> the<00:00:50.379> scale<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.879> scale<00:00:52.030> is

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
pie if I way that I'm probably just

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.330

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
house so that's like I said probably the

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.510 
house so that's like I said probably the
number<00:02:59.110> one<00:02:59.140> reason<00:02:59.500> why<00:02:59.860> the<00:02:59.920> flexible

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
number one reason why the flexible

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.300 
number one reason why the flexible
dieting<00:03:00.820> is<00:03:01.120> so<00:03:01.300> much<00:03:01.450> better<00:03:01.800> at<00:03:02.800> least<00:03:02.920> in<00:03:03.160> my

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
dieting is so much better at least in my

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.600 
dieting is so much better at least in my
eyes<00:03:03.340> is<00:03:03.820> just<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:05.560> flexibility<00:03:06.310> hence

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
eyes is just the the flexibility hence

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.240 
eyes is just the the flexibility hence
the<00:03:06.820> name<00:03:06.990> being<00:03:07.990> able<00:03:08.290> to<00:03:08.500> live<00:03:08.830> your<00:03:09.040> life

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
and not obsessed so much some would say

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.940 
and not obsessed so much some would say
that<00:03:13.810> you<00:03:13.990> actually<00:03:14.140> spend<00:03:14.530> more<00:03:14.740> time

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
that you actually spend more time

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.650 
that you actually spend more time
because<00:03:15.190> you're<00:03:15.490> calculating<00:03:16.150> your<00:03:16.240> food<00:03:16.480> and

my fitness pal and whatnot but in

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.880 
my fitness pal and whatnot but in
reality<00:03:20.350> it's<00:03:20.740> it's<00:03:20.950> it's<00:03:21.220> not<00:03:21.460> that<00:03:21.700> hard

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
reality it's it's it's not that hard

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.040 
reality it's it's it's not that hard
yeah<00:03:23.890> you<00:03:24.070> can<00:03:24.250> you<00:03:24.940> could<00:03:25.090> make<00:03:25.300> excuses<00:03:25.870> not

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
yeah you can you could make excuses not

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.190

to<00:03:26.110> do<00:03:26.350> anything<00:03:26.680> so<00:03:27.190> if<00:03:28.150> you're<00:03:28.390> able<00:03:28.840> to<00:03:29.050> eat

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
to do anything so if you're able to eat

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.350 
to do anything so if you're able to eat
the<00:03:29.380> types<00:03:29.590> of<00:03:29.770> food<00:03:29.950> that<00:03:29.980> you<00:03:30.280> want<00:03:30.580> and

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
the types of food that you want and
