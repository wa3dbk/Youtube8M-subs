00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.060 

alright<00:00:00.840> so<00:00:01.050> in<00:00:01.199> this<00:00:01.260> video<00:00:01.410> we're<00:00:01.770> gonna<00:00:01.829> do

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
alright so in this video we're gonna do

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.770 
alright so in this video we're gonna do
one<00:00:02.280> more<00:00:02.310> example<00:00:02.490> using<00:00:03.300> Heron's<00:00:03.659> formula

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
one more example using Heron's formula

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.710 
one more example using Heron's formula
so<00:00:04.500> we're<00:00:05.130> gonna<00:00:05.220> find<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:05.670> area<00:00:06.540> of<00:00:06.629> the

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
so we're gonna find the area of the

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.169 
so we're gonna find the area of the
triangle<00:00:06.930> PQR<00:00:07.680> given<00:00:08.280> that<00:00:08.429> little<00:00:08.610> p<00:00:08.940> has

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
triangle PQR given that little p has

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.160 
triangle PQR given that little p has
length<00:00:09.480> 18<00:00:10.040> little<00:00:11.040> Q<00:00:11.280> has<00:00:11.519> length<00:00:11.880> 21<00:00:12.599> point<00:00:12.900> 6

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
length 18 little Q has length 21 point 6

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.349 
length 18 little Q has length 21 point 6
inches<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.420> angle<00:00:15.420> Q<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:15.839> 52<00:00:16.440> degrees<00:00:16.880> so<00:00:17.880> to

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
inches and angle Q is 52 degrees so to

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.060 
inches and angle Q is 52 degrees so to
use<00:00:18.510> Heron's<00:00:18.869> formula<00:00:18.960> we<00:00:19.500> just<00:00:19.650> need<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.890> find

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
use Heron's formula we just need to find

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.400 
use Heron's formula we just need to find
the<00:00:20.609> length<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.359> missing<00:00:21.689> side<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:22.260> we

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
the length of the missing side and we

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.840 
the length of the missing side and we
can<00:00:22.560> just<00:00:22.680> plug<00:00:22.949> everything<00:00:23.250> in<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.670> be<00:00:23.730> in

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
can just plug everything in and be in

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.240 
can just plug everything in and be in
business<00:00:24.210> but<00:00:24.560> to<00:00:25.560> figure<00:00:25.830> out<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.070> missing

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
business but to figure out the missing

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.250 
business but to figure out the missing
side<00:00:26.609> well<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.420> think<00:00:27.570> we're<00:00:27.840> actually<00:00:27.990> gonna

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
side well I think we're actually gonna

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.900 
side well I think we're actually gonna
have<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.529> use<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.800> law<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.010> sines<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.609> couple

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
have to use the law of sines a couple

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.200 
have to use the law of sines a couple
times<00:00:30.119> or<00:00:30.390> at<00:00:30.449> least<00:00:30.510> that'll<00:00:31.109> work<00:00:31.230> for<00:00:31.500> us

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
times or at least that'll work for us

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.389 
times or at least that'll work for us
but<00:00:33.210> first<00:00:33.600> off<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.989> figure<00:00:34.290> out<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.739> know<00:00:34.860> to

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
but first off to figure out you know to

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.630 
but first off to figure out you know to
use<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.579> law<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:35.910> sines<00:00:36.649> we're<00:00:37.649> given<00:00:37.950> angle<00:00:38.129> Q

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
use the law of sines we're given angle Q

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.880 
use the law of sines we're given angle Q
and<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.910> side<00:00:39.090> opposite<00:00:39.690> opposite<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.590> the

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
and the side opposite opposite that the

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.520 
and the side opposite opposite that the
length<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.460> we're<00:00:42.000> only<00:00:42.120> given<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:43.200> side

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
length of it we're only given the side

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.610 
length of it we're only given the side
length<00:00:44.100> opposite<00:00:44.760> angle<00:00:45.149> P<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> first

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
length opposite angle P so the first

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.020 
length opposite angle P so the first
thing<00:00:46.800> I'm<00:00:46.920> going<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.100> do<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.340> figure<00:00:47.579> out<00:00:47.730> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
thing I'm going to do is figure out the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.510 
thing I'm going to do is figure out the
angle<00:00:48.420> P<00:00:48.690> we<00:00:49.559> can<00:00:49.710> use<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.280> help<00:00:50.309> us

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
angle P we can use that to help us

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.700 
angle P we can use that to help us
figure<00:00:50.879> out<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.090> angle<00:00:51.480> R<00:00:51.660> then<00:00:52.379> we'll<00:00:52.559> use

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
figure out the angle R then we'll use

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.010 
figure out the angle R then we'll use
that<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.100> figure<00:00:53.280> out<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.699> side<00:00:53.940> length<00:00:54.300> and

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
that to figure out the side length and

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.750 
that to figure out the side length and
then<00:00:55.199> we'll<00:00:55.379> finally<00:00:55.649> be<00:00:56.039> in<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.219> position<00:00:56.399> to

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
then we'll finally be in a position to

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.369 
then we'll finally be in a position to
where<00:00:57.090> we<00:00:57.270> can<00:00:57.390> actually<00:00:57.420> use<00:00:57.960> Heron's

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
where we can actually use Heron's

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.369 
where we can actually use Heron's
formula<00:00:59.930> all<00:01:00.930> right<00:01:01.140> so

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
formula all right so

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.740 
formula all right so
so<00:01:03.949> let's<00:01:04.129> see<00:01:04.280> we<00:01:04.460> could<00:01:04.549> say<00:01:04.760> the<00:01:05.059> sine<00:01:05.330> of

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
so let's see we could say the sine of

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.320 
so let's see we could say the sine of
angle<00:01:06.590> P<00:01:07.720> over<00:01:08.720> 18<00:01:09.409> that's<00:01:10.369> gonna<00:01:10.580> equal<00:01:10.820> sine

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
angle P over 18 that's gonna equal sine

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.270 
angle P over 18 that's gonna equal sine
of<00:01:11.560> 52<00:01:12.560> degrees<00:01:13.930> over<00:01:14.930> twenty<00:01:15.380> one<00:01:15.530> point<00:01:15.890> six

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
of 52 degrees over twenty one point six

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.190 
of 52 degrees over twenty one point six
so<00:01:17.240> all<00:01:17.330> I'm<00:01:17.450> gonna<00:01:17.570> do<00:01:17.780> here<00:01:18.080> is<00:01:18.110> just

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
so all I'm gonna do here is just

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.050 
so all I'm gonna do here is just
multiply<00:01:18.860> both<00:01:19.040> sides<00:01:19.340> by<00:01:19.460> 18<00:01:19.820> and<00:01:21.940> we'll<00:01:22.940> get

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
multiply both sides by 18 and we'll get

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.370 
multiply both sides by 18 and we'll get
sine<00:01:23.390> of<00:01:23.720> P<00:01:24.440> is<00:01:24.920> gonna<00:01:25.250> be<00:01:25.430> so<00:01:26.390> sine<00:01:26.630> of<00:01:26.659> 52

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
sine of P is gonna be so sine of 52

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.460 
sine of P is gonna be so sine of 52
degrees<00:01:29.170> times<00:01:30.170> 18<00:01:31.570> over<00:01:32.570> twenty<00:01:32.990> one<00:01:33.140> point

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
degrees times 18 over twenty one point

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.760 
degrees times 18 over twenty one point
six

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.670 

let's<00:01:37.369> see<00:01:37.579> here<00:01:37.820> so

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.420 

let's<00:01:41.280> do<00:01:41.460> sign<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:42.030> 52°<00:01:42.900> I'm<00:01:43.680> getting<00:01:43.950> sign<00:01:44.220> of

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
let's do sign of 52° I'm getting sign of

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.750 
let's do sign of 52° I'm getting sign of
52<00:01:44.940> degrees<00:01:45.330> to<00:01:45.600> be<00:01:45.720> roughly<00:01:46.080> point<00:01:46.760> seven

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
52 degrees to be roughly point seven

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.360 
52 degrees to be roughly point seven
eight<00:01:48.030> eight<00:01:48.650> we'll<00:01:49.650> multiply<00:01:49.830> that<00:01:50.310> by

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
eight eight we'll multiply that by

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.790 
eight eight we'll multiply that by
eighteen<00:01:52.550> over<00:01:53.550> twenty<00:01:53.880> one<00:01:54.030> point<00:01:54.330> six<00:01:54.800> so

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
eighteen over twenty one point six so

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.040 
eighteen over twenty one point six so
point<00:01:56.100> seven<00:01:56.520> eight<00:01:56.670> eight<00:01:57.080> x<00:01:58.130> 18<00:01:59.900> divided<00:02:00.900> by

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
point seven eight eight x 18 divided by

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.130 
point seven eight eight x 18 divided by
twenty<00:02:01.590> one<00:02:01.800> point<00:02:02.550> six<00:02:05.540> I'm<00:02:06.540> getting<00:02:06.870> that<00:02:06.990> to

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
twenty one point six I'm getting that to

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.460 
twenty one point six I'm getting that to
be<00:02:07.260> roughly<00:02:07.560> point<00:02:07.950> six<00:02:08.520> five<00:02:08.940> seven<00:02:09.780> after

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
be roughly point six five seven after

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.680 
be roughly point six five seven after
rounding<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.760> now<00:02:12.000> we<00:02:12.060> can<00:02:12.270> just<00:02:12.420> do<00:02:12.570> the

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
rounding so now we can just do the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.900 
rounding so now we can just do the
inverse<00:02:13.020> sine<00:02:13.290> of<00:02:13.320> both<00:02:13.500> sides<00:02:13.620> so<00:02:14.370> we'll<00:02:14.730> get

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
inverse sine of both sides so we'll get

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.380 
inverse sine of both sides so we'll get
P<00:02:15.210> is<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.990> inverse<00:02:16.350> sine<00:02:16.680> at<00:02:17.100> point<00:02:17.520> six<00:02:17.970> five

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
P is the inverse sine at point six five

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.870 
P is the inverse sine at point six five
seven<00:02:20.690> so<00:02:21.690> let's<00:02:21.720> see<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:23.250> inverse<00:02:23.610> sine<00:02:23.850> of

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
seven so let's see the inverse sine of

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.570 
seven so let's see the inverse sine of
point<00:02:24.480> six<00:02:24.660> five<00:02:24.930> seven<00:02:25.260> I'm<00:02:25.980> getting<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.460> to

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
point six five seven I'm getting that to

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.120 
point six five seven I'm getting that to
be<00:02:26.700> roughly<00:02:27.180> forty<00:02:27.570> one<00:02:27.750> point<00:02:28.140> zero<00:02:28.260> seven

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
be roughly forty one point zero seven

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.400 
be roughly forty one point zero seven
degrees<00:02:29.550> I<00:02:29.910> think<00:02:30.570> I'm<00:02:30.840> just<00:02:30.960> gonna<00:02:31.080> round

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
degrees I think I'm just gonna round

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.480 
degrees I think I'm just gonna round
that<00:02:31.620> off<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.880> 41<00:02:32.880> degrees<00:02:33.950> so<00:02:34.950> now<00:02:35.100> we<00:02:35.160> can<00:02:35.370> go

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
that off to 41 degrees so now we can go

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.490 
that off to 41 degrees so now we can go
back<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.700> our<00:02:35.940> triangle<00:02:36.480> we<00:02:36.810> know<00:02:36.960> that<00:02:37.140> angle

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
back to our triangle we know that angle

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.750 
back to our triangle we know that angle
P<00:02:37.710> here<00:02:38.070> is<00:02:38.160> now<00:02:38.340> 41<00:02:39.030> degrees<00:02:39.890> well<00:02:40.890> we<00:02:41.160> can<00:02:41.340> add

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
P here is now 41 degrees well we can add

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.330 
P here is now 41 degrees well we can add
these<00:02:42.030> together<00:02:42.270> right<00:02:43.140> we<00:02:43.290> can<00:02:43.440> do<00:02:43.590> 52

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
these together right we can do 52

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.060 
these together right we can do 52
degrees<00:02:46.070> plus<00:02:47.070> 41<00:02:48.000> degrees<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.350> then

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
degrees plus 41 degrees and then

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.050 
degrees plus 41 degrees and then
whatever<00:02:51.290> angle<00:02:52.290> R<00:02:52.500> is<00:02:52.830> when<00:02:53.610> we<00:02:53.700> add<00:02:53.880> all

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
whatever angle R is when we add all

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.520 
whatever angle R is when we add all
those<00:02:54.239> up<00:02:54.300> we've<00:02:54.690> got<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.870> get<00:02:55.050> a<00:02:55.080> hundred<00:02:55.290> and

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
those up we've got to get a hundred and

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.530 
those up we've got to get a hundred and
eighty<00:02:55.680> degrees<00:02:55.800> since<00:02:56.430> they're<00:02:56.640> all<00:02:56.940> inside

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
eighty degrees since they're all inside

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.080 
eighty degrees since they're all inside
of<00:02:57.600> a<00:02:57.750> triangle<00:02:58.110> so<00:02:58.980> that's<00:02:59.130> going<00:02:59.220> to<00:02:59.280> be<00:02:59.430> 93

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
of a triangle so that's going to be 93

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.870 
of a triangle so that's going to be 93
degrees<00:03:00.650> plus<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:02.070> angle<00:03:02.730> R<00:03:02.910> is<00:03:03.660> 180<00:03:04.410> degrees

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
degrees plus the angle R is 180 degrees

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.479 
degrees plus the angle R is 180 degrees
we<00:03:05.880> can<00:03:06.000> always<00:03:06.239> subtract<00:03:06.690> 93<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:08.280> if<00:03:08.370> we

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
we can always subtract 93 and if we

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.910 
we can always subtract 93 and if we
subtract<00:03:08.880> 93<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.720> believe<00:03:10.140> we<00:03:10.320> should<00:03:10.380> be<00:03:10.560> left

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
subtract 93 I believe we should be left

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.990 
subtract 93 I believe we should be left
with<00:03:11.130> 87<00:03:12.030> degrees<00:03:12.770> so<00:03:13.770> now<00:03:13.950> really<00:03:14.310> angle<00:03:14.820> R

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
with 87 degrees so now really angle R

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.370 
with 87 degrees so now really angle R
here<00:03:15.360> is<00:03:15.390> 87<00:03:16.350> degrees<00:03:17.010> so<00:03:18.140> definitely<00:03:19.140> not<00:03:19.260> to

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
here is 87 degrees so definitely not to

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.930 
here is 87 degrees so definitely not to
scale<00:03:19.650> here

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
scale here

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.760 
scale here
and<00:03:21.150> now<00:03:21.450> I'm<00:03:21.630> gonna<00:03:21.750> use<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.170> law<00:03:22.350> signs

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
and now I'm gonna use the law signs

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:28.460 
and now I'm gonna use the law signs
again<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.760> figure<00:03:23.940> out<00:03:24.210> this<00:03:24.420> side<00:03:24.660> length<00:03:27.470> all

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
again to figure out this side length all

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.130 
again to figure out this side length all
right<00:03:28.590> so<00:03:28.890> again<00:03:29.820> maybe<00:03:30.450> we'll<00:03:30.750> call<00:03:30.960> this

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
right so again maybe we'll call this

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.860 
right so again maybe we'll call this
little<00:03:31.650> R<00:03:31.860> so<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.790> side<00:03:33.000> length<00:03:33.240> little<00:03:33.660> R

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
little R so the side length little R

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.180 
little R so the side length little R
over<00:03:34.650> sine<00:03:34.980> of<00:03:35.340> a<00:03:35.670> T<00:03:35.880> seven<00:03:36.480> degrees<00:03:37.190> that's

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
over sine of a T seven degrees that's

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.550 
over sine of a T seven degrees that's
gonna<00:03:38.430> equal<00:03:38.700> it<00:03:39.660> doesn't<00:03:39.930> matter<00:03:40.080> which<00:03:40.350> one

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
gonna equal it doesn't matter which one

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.720 
gonna equal it doesn't matter which one
we<00:03:40.590> use<00:03:40.980> I<00:03:41.280> think<00:03:41.370> I'll<00:03:41.700> use<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:42.320> 21.6<00:03:43.730> over

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
we use I think I'll use the 21.6 over

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.260 
we use I think I'll use the 21.6 over
sine<00:03:45.090> of<00:03:45.260> 52<00:03:46.260> degrees<00:03:46.940> now<00:03:47.940> we<00:03:48.000> could<00:03:48.240> just

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
sine of 52 degrees now we could just

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.930 
sine of 52 degrees now we could just
multiply<00:03:48.570> both<00:03:49.140> sides<00:03:49.470> by<00:03:49.740> sine<00:03:50.130> of<00:03:50.190> 87

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
multiply both sides by sine of 87

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.949 
multiply both sides by sine of 87
degrees

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.589 

so<00:03:56.560> we'll<00:03:56.739> get<00:03:56.829> that<00:03:56.890> R<00:03:57.250> equals<00:03:57.969> twenty<00:03:58.420> one

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
so we'll get that R equals twenty one

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:04.830 
so we'll get that R equals twenty one
point<00:03:58.959> six<00:03:59.909> times<00:04:00.909> sine<00:04:01.659> of<00:04:01.859> 87<00:04:02.859> degrees<00:04:03.840> over

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
point six times sine of 87 degrees over

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:12.780 
point six times sine of 87 degrees over
sine<00:04:05.200> of<00:04:05.609> 52<00:04:06.609> degrees<00:04:10.920> so<00:04:11.920> let's<00:04:11.950> see<00:04:12.280> I<00:04:12.549> think

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
sine of 52 degrees so let's see I think

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.699 
sine of 52 degrees so let's see I think
we<00:04:13.060> said<00:04:13.239> somewhere<00:04:13.540> sign<00:04:13.840> of<00:04:14.079> did<00:04:14.620> we

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
we said somewhere sign of did we

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.449 
we said somewhere sign of did we
calculate<00:04:14.889> sine<00:04:15.430> of<00:04:15.720> 52<00:04:16.720> degrees<00:04:17.109> we<00:04:17.350> did<00:04:17.530> we

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
calculate sine of 52 degrees we did we

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.070 
calculate sine of 52 degrees we did we
said<00:04:18.609> sine<00:04:18.880> of<00:04:18.910> 52<00:04:19.509> degrees<00:04:19.539> was<00:04:20.190> 0.788<00:04:22.080> so

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
said sine of 52 degrees was 0.788 so

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.879 
said sine of 52 degrees was 0.788 so
that's<00:04:23.229> what's<00:04:23.380> gonna<00:04:23.500> go<00:04:23.710> in<00:04:23.800> the

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
that's what's gonna go in the

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.810 
that's what's gonna go in the
denominator<00:04:24.039> the<00:04:24.729> point<00:04:25.000> seven<00:04:25.570> eight<00:04:25.750> eight

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
denominator the point seven eight eight

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.540 
denominator the point seven eight eight
we've<00:04:27.820> also<00:04:27.970> got<00:04:28.240> to<00:04:28.360> calculate<00:04:28.810> sine<00:04:29.169> of<00:04:29.550> 87

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
we've also got to calculate sine of 87

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.460 
we've also got to calculate sine of 87
degrees<00:04:30.910> I<00:04:31.300> don't<00:04:31.539> know<00:04:31.660> if<00:04:31.780> we<00:04:31.930> did<00:04:32.169> that<00:04:32.320> when

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
degrees I don't know if we did that when

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.050 
degrees I don't know if we did that when
I<00:04:32.500> don't<00:04:32.710> think<00:04:32.889> we<00:04:32.979> did<00:04:34.949> so<00:04:35.949> sine<00:04:36.160> of<00:04:36.220> 87

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
I don't think we did so sine of 87

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.320 
I don't think we did so sine of 87
degrees<00:04:37.389> I'm<00:04:37.690> getting<00:04:38.020> point<00:04:38.410> nine<00:04:40.380> nine<00:04:41.380> nine

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
degrees I'm getting point nine nine nine

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.860 
degrees I'm getting point nine nine nine
after<00:04:43.330> rounding<00:04:45.240> so<00:04:46.240> let's<00:04:46.419> see<00:04:46.570> we'll<00:04:46.750> do

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
after rounding so let's see we'll do

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.969 
after rounding so let's see we'll do
twenty<00:04:47.199> one<00:04:47.349> point<00:04:47.860> six<00:04:47.979> times<00:04:48.789> 0.99<00:04:49.780> nine<00:04:50.380> not

twenty one point six times 0.99 nine not

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.350 
twenty one point six times 0.99 nine not
going<00:04:51.130> to<00:04:51.190> change<00:04:51.370> that<00:04:51.490> much<00:04:52.080> divided<00:04:53.080> by

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
going to change that much divided by

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:00.120 
going to change that much divided by
0.788<00:04:56.070> I'm<00:04:57.070> getting<00:04:57.430> this<00:04:57.610> to<00:04:57.820> equal<00:04:59.130> twenty

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
0.788 I'm getting this to equal twenty

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.560 
0.788 I'm getting this to equal twenty
seven<00:05:00.610> point<00:05:01.320> three<00:05:02.320> eight<00:05:02.530> I<00:05:03.400> guess<00:05:04.150> inches

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
seven point three eight I guess inches

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.469 
seven point three eight I guess inches
since<00:05:04.810> we<00:05:05.080> were<00:05:05.229> using<00:05:05.440> before<00:05:06.240> so<00:05:07.240> okay<00:05:07.449> so

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479 
since we were using before so okay so

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:12.350 
since we were using before so okay so
we're<00:05:07.750> getting<00:05:07.840> a<00:05:08.020> little<00:05:08.229> bit<00:05:08.620> closer

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.810 

I<00:05:12.390> think<00:05:12.750> I'll<00:05:12.870> round<00:05:13.110> this<00:05:13.320> off<00:05:13.530> so<00:05:14.520> twenty

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
I think I'll round this off so twenty

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.060 
I think I'll round this off so twenty
seven<00:05:15.120> point<00:05:15.360> three<00:05:15.840> eight<00:05:16.170> I'm<00:05:16.620> gonna<00:05:16.860> round

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
seven point three eight I'm gonna round

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.850 
seven point three eight I'm gonna round
that<00:05:17.310> off<00:05:17.340> to<00:05:17.490> twenty<00:05:18.210> seven<00:05:18.600> point<00:05:18.900> four<00:05:19.500> and

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
that off to twenty seven point four and

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.260 
that off to twenty seven point four and
now<00:05:20.760> we've<00:05:21.000> got<00:05:21.180> all<00:05:21.300> the<00:05:21.420> side<00:05:21.660> links<00:05:22.940> so<00:05:23.940> we

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
now we've got all the side links so we

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.210 
now we've got all the side links so we
can<00:05:24.480> finally<00:05:24.870> use<00:05:24.900> Heron's<00:05:25.530> formula<00:05:25.620> to

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
can finally use Heron's formula to

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:31.970 
can finally use Heron's formula to
actually<00:05:27.170> simply<00:05:28.700> find<00:05:29.700> the<00:05:29.820> area<00:05:30.710> so<00:05:31.710> okay<00:05:31.920> to

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980 
actually simply find the area so okay to

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.740 
actually simply find the area so okay to
use<00:05:32.190> Heron's<00:05:32.580> formula<00:05:32.670> we<00:05:33.240> first<00:05:33.510> have<00:05:33.720> to

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
use Heron's formula we first have to

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.150 
use Heron's formula we first have to
find<00:05:34.020> the<00:05:34.230> semi-perimeter

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
find the semi-perimeter

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.490 
find the semi-perimeter
twenty<00:05:35.910> seven<00:05:36.240> point<00:05:36.510> four<00:05:37.190> plus<00:05:38.190> 18<00:05:38.790> plus

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
twenty seven point four plus 18 plus

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.830 
twenty seven point four plus 18 plus
twenty<00:05:40.500> one<00:05:40.680> point<00:05:41.040> six<00:05:41.660> all<00:05:42.660> over<00:05:43.110> two<00:05:43.320> I

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
twenty one point six all over two I

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.690 
twenty one point six all over two I
think<00:05:45.840> this<00:05:46.140> is<00:05:46.290> definitely<00:05:46.470> stuff<00:05:46.980> that<00:05:47.280> at

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
think this is definitely stuff that at

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.190 
think this is definitely stuff that at
the<00:05:47.880> end<00:05:48.000> of<00:05:48.060> the<00:05:48.120> day<00:05:48.270> I<00:05:48.300> plug<00:05:48.810> all<00:05:48.960> into<00:05:49.170> a

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.200 
the end of the day I plug all into a

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.890 
the end of the day I plug all into a
calculator<00:05:49.470> so<00:05:50.250> twenty<00:05:50.610> seven<00:05:50.910> point<00:05:51.660> four

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
calculator so twenty seven point four

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.960 
calculator so twenty seven point four
plus<00:05:52.320> 18<00:05:52.920> plus<00:05:53.570> twenty<00:05:54.570> one<00:05:54.720> point<00:05:55.110> six

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
plus 18 plus twenty one point six

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.680 
plus 18 plus twenty one point six
hey<00:05:56.970> that's<00:05:57.210> exactly<00:05:57.690> 67<00:05:58.650> on<00:05:58.770> top<00:05:59.330> sixty<00:06:00.330> seven

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
hey that's exactly 67 on top sixty seven

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.660 
hey that's exactly 67 on top sixty seven
divided<00:06:00.990> by<00:06:01.140> two<00:06:01.290> is<00:06:01.830> gonna<00:06:01.980> be<00:06:02.160> what<00:06:02.370> I

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:02.670 
divided by two is gonna be what I

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:07.280 
divided by two is gonna be what I
believe<00:06:02.990> thirty<00:06:03.990> three<00:06:04.380> point<00:06:04.920> five<00:06:06.170> so<00:06:07.170> now

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.290 
believe thirty three point five so now

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.710 
believe thirty three point five so now
we<00:06:07.350> can<00:06:07.680> just<00:06:07.830> use<00:06:08.010> Heron's<00:06:08.430> formula<00:06:08.720> whoops

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
we can just use Heron's formula whoops

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.720 
we can just use Heron's formula whoops
so<00:06:10.140> not<00:06:10.290> s<00:06:10.500> but<00:06:10.800> now<00:06:10.920> we're<00:06:11.070> getting<00:06:11.370> the<00:06:11.400> area

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:11.730 
so not s but now we're getting the area

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.549 
so not s but now we're getting the area
a

00:06:14.549 --> 00:06:14.559 

00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:18.539 

so<00:06:15.159> it<00:06:15.279> says<00:06:15.459> we<00:06:15.609> take<00:06:16.079> 33.5<00:06:17.219> then<00:06:18.219> we<00:06:18.339> have<00:06:18.459> to

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:18.549 
so it says we take 33.5 then we have to

00:06:18.549 --> 00:06:21.659 
so it says we take 33.5 then we have to
take<00:06:18.839> 33.5<00:06:19.839> and<00:06:20.259> just<00:06:20.409> subtract<00:06:20.919> away<00:06:21.099> each<00:06:21.459> of

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:21.669 
take 33.5 and just subtract away each of

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:24.299 
take 33.5 and just subtract away each of
the<00:06:21.759> different<00:06:22.119> links<00:06:22.329> so<00:06:22.959> let's<00:06:23.889> see<00:06:24.009> one<00:06:24.219> of

00:06:24.299 --> 00:06:24.309 
the different links so let's see one of

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:26.539 
the different links so let's see one of
the<00:06:24.369> links<00:06:24.609> was<00:06:24.819> twenty<00:06:25.149> seven<00:06:25.329> point<00:06:26.049> four

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:26.549 
the links was twenty seven point four

00:06:26.549 --> 00:06:29.609 
the links was twenty seven point four
then<00:06:27.549> we<00:06:27.669> would<00:06:27.789> have<00:06:27.879> to<00:06:27.999> take<00:06:28.149> 33<00:06:28.929> point<00:06:29.289> five

00:06:29.609 --> 00:06:29.619 
then we would have to take 33 point five

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:34.319 
then we would have to take 33 point five
and<00:06:30.129> subtract<00:06:30.639> away<00:06:31.379> 18<00:06:32.939> and<00:06:33.939> then<00:06:34.059> we<00:06:34.209> would

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:34.329 
and subtract away 18 and then we would

00:06:34.329 --> 00:06:37.129 
and subtract away 18 and then we would
have<00:06:34.479> to<00:06:34.599> take<00:06:34.779> thirty<00:06:35.289> three<00:06:35.619> point<00:06:35.889> five

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:37.139 
have to take thirty three point five

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:39.779 
have to take thirty three point five
subtract<00:06:38.139> away<00:06:38.289> the<00:06:38.379> other<00:06:38.739> length<00:06:39.099> which<00:06:39.609> was

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:39.789 
subtract away the other length which was

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:44.069 
subtract away the other length which was
twenty<00:06:40.119> one<00:06:40.239> point<00:06:40.569> six<00:06:42.509> squeeze<00:06:43.509> all<00:06:43.779> that<00:06:43.929> in

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:44.079 
twenty one point six squeeze all that in

00:06:44.079 --> 00:06:47.669 
twenty one point six squeeze all that in
there<00:06:44.669> and<00:06:45.669> again<00:06:45.819> now<00:06:46.119> it's<00:06:46.329> just<00:06:46.589> just<00:06:47.589> a

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:47.679 
there and again now it's just just a

00:06:47.679 --> 00:06:49.349 
there and again now it's just just a
bunch<00:06:47.859> of<00:06:47.919> arithmetic<00:06:48.519> nothing<00:06:48.939> worse<00:06:49.089> than

00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:49.359 
bunch of arithmetic nothing worse than

00:06:49.359 --> 00:06:49.769 
bunch of arithmetic nothing worse than
that

00:06:49.769 --> 00:06:49.779 
that

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:53.429 
that
so<00:06:50.619> thirty<00:06:51.099> three<00:06:51.399> point<00:06:51.639> five<00:06:51.999> let's<00:06:52.629> see<00:06:52.809> if

00:06:53.429 --> 00:06:53.439 
so thirty three point five let's see if

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:55.079 
so thirty three point five let's see if
we<00:06:53.589> take<00:06:53.709> thirty<00:06:54.009> three<00:06:54.279> point<00:06:54.489> five<00:06:54.729> and

00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:55.089 
we take thirty three point five and

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:57.899 
we take thirty three point five and
subtract<00:06:55.569> twenty<00:06:56.139> seven<00:06:56.469> point<00:06:56.679> four<00:06:57.009> we

00:06:57.899 --> 00:06:57.909 
subtract twenty seven point four we

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:02.759 
subtract twenty seven point four we
should<00:06:58.119> just<00:06:58.269> get<00:06:58.479> six<00:06:59.169> point<00:06:59.469> one<00:07:01.409> so<00:07:02.409> thirty

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:02.769 
should just get six point one so thirty

00:07:02.769 --> 00:07:07.139 
should just get six point one so thirty
three<00:07:03.009> point<00:07:03.219> five<00:07:03.459> minus<00:07:03.909> eighteen<00:07:06.149> that's

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:07.149 
three point five minus eighteen that's

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:10.069 
three point five minus eighteen that's
just<00:07:07.389> going<00:07:07.479> to<00:07:07.539> give<00:07:07.719> us<00:07:07.869> fifteen<00:07:08.769> point<00:07:09.039> five

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:10.079 
just going to give us fifteen point five

00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:12.629 
just going to give us fifteen point five
and<00:07:11.079> then<00:07:11.499> if<00:07:11.589> we<00:07:11.679> do<00:07:11.829> thirty<00:07:12.129> three<00:07:12.429> point

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:12.639 
and then if we do thirty three point

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:16.199 
and then if we do thirty three point
five<00:07:12.929> and<00:07:13.929> if<00:07:14.499> we<00:07:14.619> subtract<00:07:15.069> away<00:07:15.369> twenty<00:07:16.029> one

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:16.209 
five and if we subtract away twenty one

00:07:16.209 --> 00:07:18.839 
five and if we subtract away twenty one
point<00:07:16.659> six<00:07:17.279> that's<00:07:18.279> just<00:07:18.459> gonna<00:07:18.549> give<00:07:18.759> us

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:18.849 
point six that's just gonna give us

00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:22.919 
point six that's just gonna give us
eleven<00:07:19.360> point<00:07:19.689> nine<00:07:21.029> so<00:07:22.029> let's<00:07:22.209> see<00:07:22.449> I'm<00:07:22.779> gonna

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:22.929 
eleven point nine so let's see I'm gonna

00:07:22.929 --> 00:07:24.899 
eleven point nine so let's see I'm gonna
multiply<00:07:23.229> all<00:07:23.709> these<00:07:23.860> together<00:07:24.279> now<00:07:24.549> so

00:07:24.899 --> 00:07:24.909 
multiply all these together now so

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:27.920 
multiply all these together now so
thirty<00:07:25.209> three<00:07:25.509> point<00:07:25.749> five

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:27.930 
thirty three point five

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:31.380 
thirty three point five
thirty<00:07:28.930> three<00:07:29.230> point<00:07:29.470> five<00:07:29.770> times<00:07:30.460> six<00:07:31.030> point

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:31.390 
thirty three point five times six point

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:36.690 
thirty three point five times six point
one<00:07:32.370> times<00:07:33.370> fifteen<00:07:34.330> point<00:07:34.810> five<00:07:35.700> times

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:36.700 
one times fifteen point five times

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.110 
one times fifteen point five times
eleven<00:07:37.660> point<00:07:38.140> nine<00:07:38.460> getting<00:07:39.460> a<00:07:39.520> pretty<00:07:39.940> big

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:40.120 
eleven point nine getting a pretty big

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.150 
eleven point nine getting a pretty big
number<00:07:40.270> underneath<00:07:40.660> there<00:07:40.990> which<00:07:41.260> makes

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:42.160 
number underneath there which makes

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.800 
number underneath there which makes
sense<00:07:42.810> three<00:07:43.810> seven<00:07:44.320> six<00:07:44.860> nine<00:07:45.400> two<00:07:45.970> point

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:46.810 
sense three seven six nine two point

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:50.400 
sense three seven six nine two point
three<00:07:47.440> five<00:07:47.950> seven<00:07:48.790> five<00:07:49.080> so<00:07:50.080> now<00:07:50.110> I'm<00:07:50.320> just

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:50.410 
three five seven five so now I'm just

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:53.610 
three five seven five so now I'm just
going<00:07:50.650> to<00:07:50.770> square<00:07:51.520> root<00:07:51.700> that<00:07:52.050> and<00:07:53.050> it<00:07:53.410> says

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:53.620 
going to square root that and it says

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.860 
going to square root that and it says
the<00:07:53.740> area<00:07:54.130> is<00:07:54.190> roughly<00:07:54.550> equal<00:07:54.940> to<00:07:55.120> one<00:07:55.480> ninety

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:55.870 
the area is roughly equal to one ninety

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:59.970 
the area is roughly equal to one ninety
four<00:07:56.170> point<00:07:56.650> one<00:07:57.280> five<00:07:57.570> square<00:07:58.570> inches<00:07:59.080> and

00:07:59.970 --> 00:07:59.980 
four point one five square inches and

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.650 
four point one five square inches and
I'm<00:08:00.070> just<00:08:00.220> going<00:08:00.340> to<00:08:00.370> round<00:08:00.550> that<00:08:00.790> off<00:08:00.820> to<00:08:00.970> one

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:01.660 
I'm just going to round that off to one

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:06.330 
I'm just going to round that off to one
hundred<00:08:02.080> and<00:08:02.380> ninety<00:08:02.500> four<00:08:03.160> square<00:08:03.940> inches
