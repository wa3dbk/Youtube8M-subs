00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 I present you crossbows interloper 

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:08.450
 scorpion looks like a tension force 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.800
 shoulders 43 kilograms 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.080
 I will not tell you the rules 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.880
 I want to show technical specifications 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.880
 how does he break the boards 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.559
 can see the board split 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:46.210
 the arrow went right through you have to carry another 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:48.720
 the board if now this board is not 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.339
 split see how deep 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:56.190
 Iâ€™m going to open up to 5 meters 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:56.190
 22 mm pine board 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:14.600
 Here now we see went through and 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:19.970
 stopped better than board wine 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:24.650
 the little finger there for god was rubber 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.640
 so the rubber stopped her boom 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:31.020
 now try to shoot 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:34.070
 somewhere from 20 meters the same board will score 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.330
 Bali enough for even the most 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.350
 allowed in Russia 43 kilograms 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.350
 key tension 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:00.530
 20 meters arrow hit the center of the board 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.009
 I split it and climbed the whole tip 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.869
 the board itself 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.170
 conclusion I want to say broke through that 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:11.160
 he is very pleased with his short 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.590
 cost it looks very nice and 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.910
 stylishly hang on the wall where he 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.670
 accordingly hangs well as for 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.330
 for its application where it is possible 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.069
 use 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.940
 Russia is known for betrayal 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:31.950
 hunting with crossbows is prohibited but by its 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.660
 breaking ability i think he 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:40.140
 tasks and any cope 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:45.540
 on accuracy of 20 meters stood in a board 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:48.750
 got into the force of tension that's enough I think 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.670
 shoot 50 meters well here you already need it 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:58.760
 shoot the way on the crossbow 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:58.760
 very convenient change mechanism 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.799
 provisions that can be very simple 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.799
 shoot him and a different distance 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:14.640
 I will immediately say that it is better to buy stores 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:16.290
 spare arrows because these when 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.079
 falling tree tips die 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:24.530
 practically there at 5 shot comes 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:24.530
 some kind of ballet
