usually<00:02:14.130> don't<00:02:14.310> want<00:02:14.460> to<00:02:14.550> do<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.910> but<00:02:15.330> in<00:02:15.480> this

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
usually don't want to do it but in this

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.330 
usually don't want to do it but in this
case<00:02:15.960> I<00:02:16.170> could<00:02:16.410> see<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.650> being<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.920> good<00:02:17.130> thing

little<00:04:01.140> bit<00:04:01.350> it's<00:04:01.560> a<00:04:01.680> it's<00:04:02.160> a<00:04:02.310> groundhog<00:04:03.000> man

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
little bit it's a it's a groundhog man

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.560 
little bit it's a it's a groundhog man
it<00:04:03.900> might<00:04:04.530> it's<00:04:04.680> just<00:04:04.890> like<00:04:05.130> wanted<00:04:06.090> some<00:04:06.300> food

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
it might it's just like wanted some food

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.660 
it might it's just like wanted some food
if<00:04:06.870> it<00:04:07.020> came<00:04:07.230> and<00:04:07.590> check<00:04:07.800> came<00:04:08.250> up<00:04:08.430> from<00:04:08.580> the

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
if it came and check came up from the

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.900 
if it came and check came up from the
ground<00:04:08.940> and<00:04:09.270> you<00:04:10.110> know<00:04:10.230> supposedly<00:04:11.010> predicted

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
ground and you know supposedly predicted

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.910 
ground and you know supposedly predicted
that<00:04:12.600> there's<00:04:13.140> gonna<00:04:13.260> be<00:04:13.410> more<00:04:13.530> winter<00:04:13.769> it

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
that there's gonna be more winter it

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.290 
that there's gonna be more winter it
just<00:04:14.100> it<00:04:14.340> just<00:04:14.370> wanted<00:04:14.790> to<00:04:14.850> come<00:04:15.000> out<00:04:15.060> of<00:04:15.180> the

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
just it just wanted to come out of the

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.289 
just it just wanted to come out of the
ground<00:04:15.420> you<00:04:16.350> know<00:04:16.470> it<00:04:16.830> was<00:04:16.980> it's<00:04:17.669> not<00:04:17.880> actually

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
ground you know it was it's not actually

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.409 
ground you know it was it's not actually
making<00:04:18.419> any<00:04:18.870> predictions<00:04:20.180> actually<00:04:21.180> I<00:04:21.239> don't

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
making any predictions actually I don't

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:22.730 
making any predictions actually I don't
know<00:04:21.510> how<00:04:21.660> that<00:04:21.810> works<00:04:21.960> maybe<00:04:22.260> there<00:04:22.590> is

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
know how that works maybe there is

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.550 
know how that works maybe there is
strong<00:04:23.340> scientific<00:04:23.760> evidence<00:04:24.690> about

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
strong scientific evidence about

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.820 
strong scientific evidence about
groundhogs<00:04:26.100> and<00:04:26.310> predicting

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
groundhogs and predicting

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.830 
groundhogs and predicting
the<00:04:27.400> weather<00:04:27.610> whatever<00:04:28.180> i<00:04:28.389> don't<00:04:28.689> know<00:04:28.810> i
