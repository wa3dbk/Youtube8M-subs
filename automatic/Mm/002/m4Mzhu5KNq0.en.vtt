00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.930
 Hello my name is Olga Ermilova and 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:09.599
 today I want to tell you one 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.870
 very important thought I often enough 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.880
 saying that you should not be afraid 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.190
 make some decisions regarding 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.199
 order to change your life and 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.539
 do what brings you 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.779
 pleasure or at least try 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:29.210
 do it but i never told you 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.210
 about the fact that you do not need as afraid 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:35.610
 dump ballast dump what you 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.200
 today stopping today i would 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.469
 I wanted you to think about it 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.149
 because in the life of each of us there is 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:44.100
 some kind of a series of actions yes there 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.110
 this work is not important or what 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.329
 concrete actions that we have burdened 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.149
 that is, when we start thinking about it 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.649
 we are somehow uncomfortable we 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.719
 we can for example come up with some 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.270
 new projects open some new 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.329
 poisoning and here 's something going something 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.570
 It ignites something seems to us it gives the shaft 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.339
 us the power of energy we think about it we 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.630
 we can not sleep at night 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.670
 we always something to put that is, 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.610
 do not stop us i will say so 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.619
 actually this is an indication that as 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.170
 the least you burn business you get from 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.900
 of this pleasure and most often if 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.520
 you really like that you 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.250
 still go out for what it brings 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.170
 you profit and not just pleasure well 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.330
 and actually you get high 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.130
 if you have a long time or if 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.369
 in principle, you suddenly started doing something 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.409
 it seemed to you that this is what you need 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.090
 but in the process you began to understand that I 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.850
 all the time it's put off that all of you 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.820
 time is hard now that you are constantly like 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.640
 there you have this bet up straining the fact that 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.460
 stopping you say no closed 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.229
 direction and don't know maybe this 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.539
 connected even with relationships where are you 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.039
 afraid of food breaking off with 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.360
 partner but they are not long ago 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.179
 brings you pleasure it can 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.060
 don't touch anything 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:06.580
 say no don't be afraid to tell yourself 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.440
 don't be afraid to tell yourself this to me 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.539
 it really bothers me 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.959
 understand this and see if it can 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.480
 fix or better this principle close 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.549
 better lose it cut it off 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.269
 yourself and finally stop losing your 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:24.760
 energy stop losing your strength 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.620
 you will feel an incredible tide when 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.810
 you dump yourself this score when you 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.230
 tell yourself the truth 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.880
 maybe it was the wrong move but 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.060
 thank yourself up praise yourself for 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.890
 what you tried at least 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.880
 maybe it's not what you need but you 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.950
 did they understand it 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.900
 it’s quite possible that if you do n’t 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.700
 would try so all my life and thought 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.280
 about what could be your 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.680
 present purpose and do not be afraid 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.310
 do not be afraid to change anything 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.970
 be afraid 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.859
 recognize that yes it is not something that is not necessary 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.340
 revive and do not stretch it faster 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:02.260
 leg yes don't tell yourself what i need 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.180
 still try still if you feel 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.780
 that your soul does not lie that for you it 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.090
 become a burden say goodbye to him and live 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.230
 further and release this energy 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.720
 release power 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.989
 and we never know where we will find 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.780
 and where we will lose and certainly trying 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.819
 something investing money in it there sometimes 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.489
 sorry well how did I invest the money and 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:27.100
 think about your energy 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.720
 strength your time your mood is 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.990
 priceless it costs much more 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.330
 so 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.530
 don't be afraid to dump it all don't be afraid 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.300
 be with yourself and frank truthful and 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.520
 live high we do not know when 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.370
 will end our life at what instant 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.750
 it happens so what's the point 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.090
 spend and make waste your time 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.460

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.350
