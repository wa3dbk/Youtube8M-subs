compare first off there's clearly a big
difference<00:00:29.640> in<00:00:29.849> size<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:31.019> shouldn't<00:00:31.500> be

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
difference in size and that shouldn't be

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.910 
difference in size and that shouldn't be
surprising<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.910> 85<00:00:33.360> millimeter<00:00:33.750> F<00:00:33.989> 1.2<00:00:34.680> L

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.639 
surprising the 85 millimeter F 1.2 L
lens<00:00:35.399> can<00:00:36.000> let<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.360> twice<00:00:36.690> as<00:00:36.930> much<00:00:37.110> light<00:00:37.440> as

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
lens can let in twice as much light as

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.190 
lens can let in twice as much light as
the<00:00:37.890> 1.8<00:00:38.460> with<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> maximum<00:00:39.600> aperture<00:00:39.780> that's

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
the 1.8 with a maximum aperture that's

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.310 
the 1.8 with a maximum aperture that's
double<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.739> size<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:42.030> as<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.420> can<00:00:42.540> see<00:00:42.600> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
double the size so as you can see the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.740 
double the size so as you can see the
front<00:00:43.559> element<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.160> enormous<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:44.940> comparison

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
front element is enormous in comparison

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.840 
front element is enormous in comparison
double<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.680> amount<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:47.010> light<00:00:47.219> means<00:00:47.610> that

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
double the amount of light means that

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.299 
double the amount of light means that
the<00:00:47.969> 1.2<00:00:48.539> lens<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:49.050> pretty<00:00:49.379> fantastic<00:00:49.680> for

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
the 1.2 lens is pretty fantastic for

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.630 
the 1.2 lens is pretty fantastic for

any other dark place and that amount of

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.250 
any other dark place and that amount of
light<00:00:56.340> gathering<00:00:56.789> can<00:00:57.120> be<00:00:57.239> pretty<00:00:57.539> useful<00:00:57.840> for

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
light gathering can be pretty useful for

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.950 
light gathering can be pretty useful for
video<00:00:58.530> work<00:00:58.800> too<00:00:59.270> having<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.329> wider<00:01:00.600> aperture

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
video work too having a wider aperture

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.579 
video work too having a wider aperture
also<00:01:01.590> means<00:01:02.100> having<00:01:02.340> blurrier<00:01:02.910> backgrounds

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
also means having blurrier backgrounds

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.609 
also means having blurrier backgrounds

millimeter F 1 point 2 is built to like
it<00:01:42.210> tank<00:01:42.540> big<00:01:43.439> sturdy<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.430> tightly<00:01:45.149> assembled

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
it tank big sturdy and tightly assembled

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.710 
it tank big sturdy and tightly assembled
it<00:01:45.780> handles<00:01:46.560> like<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.799> dream<00:01:46.920> its<00:01:47.509> focus<00:01:48.509> system

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
it handles like a dream its focus system

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.870 
it handles like a dream its focus system
is<00:01:49.020> electronically<00:01:49.799> coupled<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.520> camera

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
is electronically coupled to the camera

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.060 
is electronically coupled to the camera
so<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.570> will<00:01:51.750> only<00:01:51.869> work<00:01:52.020> when<00:01:52.439> your<00:01:52.649> camera<00:01:52.829> is

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
so it will only work when your camera is

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.670 
so it will only work when your camera is
turned<00:01:53.340> on<00:01:53.520> but<00:01:54.090> other<00:01:54.299> than<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:55.290> focus

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
turned on but other than that the focus

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.590 
turned on but other than that the focus
ring<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:55.890> amazingly<00:01:56.520> smooth<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.390> has<00:01:57.570> a

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
ring is amazingly smooth and it has a

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.230 
ring is amazingly smooth and it has a
very<00:01:57.899> long<00:01:58.200> travel<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.790> precise

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
very long travel to it so precise

so<00:04:43.000> let's<00:04:43.180> look<00:04:43.390> in<00:04:43.480> a<00:04:43.510> cornet<00:04:43.900> the<00:04:44.650> L<00:04:44.860> lens<00:04:45.160> has

so let's look in a cornet the L lens has

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.150 
so let's look in a cornet the L lens has
the<00:04:45.610> very<00:04:45.910> slightest<00:04:46.630> advantage<00:04:46.840> in<00:04:47.590> terms<00:04:47.890> of

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
the very slightest advantage in terms of

the very slightest advantage in terms of

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.980

although<00:05:46.270> I'd<00:05:46.540> say<00:05:46.750> that<00:05:46.930> the<00:05:47.050> L<00:05:47.260> is<00:05:47.530> fairly

although I'd say that the L is fairly
slightly<00:05:48.370> smoother<00:05:48.760> although<00:05:49.390> only<00:05:49.570> slightly

1.2<00:05:55.150> as<00:05:55.780> you<00:05:56.110> can<00:05:56.260> see<00:05:56.440> the<00:05:56.860> background<00:05:57.310> really

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
1.2 as you can see the background really

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.810 
1.2 as you can see the background really
is<00:05:57.790> much<00:05:58.150> blurrier<00:05:58.650> one<00:05:59.650> similarity<00:06:00.130> is<00:06:00.610> that

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.820 
is much blurrier one similarity is that

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.490 
is much blurrier one similarity is that
both<00:06:01.030> lenses<00:06:01.360> struggle<00:06:02.080> with<00:06:02.260> longitudinal

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
both lenses struggle with longitudinal

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
chromatic aberrations as you can see by

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.770 
chromatic aberrations as you can see by
the<00:06:05.530> unwelcome<00:06:06.060> colorful<00:06:07.060> highlights<00:06:07.570> in

these pictures both taken at F 1.8 so

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:14.430 
these pictures both taken at F 1.8 so
what<00:06:12.250> can<00:06:12.400> we<00:06:12.460> say<00:06:12.729> overall<00:06:13.270> both<00:06:14.169> lenses

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
what can we say overall both lenses

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.130 
what can we say overall both lenses
really<00:06:14.890> are<00:06:14.979> fantastic<00:06:15.270> performers<00:06:16.270> in<00:06:16.419> terms

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:09.930 
of the F 1.8 it's certainly not 5 times
