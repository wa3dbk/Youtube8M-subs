that<00:03:19.840> game<00:03:20.049> I<00:03:20.290> just<00:03:20.680> believe<00:03:20.920> that<00:03:21.040> we<00:03:21.130> were

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
that game I just believe that we were

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.070 
that game I just believe that we were
playing<00:03:21.549> right<00:03:21.700> now<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:22.090> most<00:03:22.420> most<00:03:22.870> of<00:03:22.989> the

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
playing right now and most most of the

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.509 
playing right now and most most of the
games<00:03:23.320> you<00:03:23.500> know<00:03:23.709> what<00:03:23.860> give<00:03:24.010> them<00:03:24.160> good

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
games you know what give them good

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:25.890 
games you know what give them good
performances<00:03:25.120> we<00:03:25.269> just<00:03:25.420> need<00:03:25.570> to<00:03:25.660> get<00:03:25.780> that

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
performances we just need to get that

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.380 
performances we just need to get that
win<00:03:26.110> and<00:03:26.650> away<00:03:26.980> we<00:03:27.010> go<00:03:27.130> it<00:03:27.850> got<00:03:27.970> tighter<00:03:28.180> have

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
win and away we go it got tighter have

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.729 
win and away we go it got tighter have
in<00:03:28.540> terms<00:03:28.690> of<00:03:28.870> not<00:03:29.049> having<00:03:29.260> to<00:03:29.290> travel<00:03:29.530> that

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
in terms of not having to travel that

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.710 
in terms of not having to travel that
far<00:03:29.920> yeah<00:03:30.190> I<00:03:30.220> think<00:03:30.370> so<00:03:30.580> I<00:03:30.640> think<00:03:30.670> you<00:03:31.480> always

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
far yeah I think so I think you always

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.970 
far yeah I think so I think you always
see<00:03:31.989> that<00:03:32.110> for<00:03:32.230> managers<00:03:32.650> you<00:03:32.739> know<00:03:32.830> I<00:03:32.860> think

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
see that for managers you know I think

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.320 
see that for managers you know I think
the<00:03:33.220> traveling<00:03:33.610> takes<00:03:33.760> are<00:03:33.880> like<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.120> players

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
the traveling takes are like the players

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.810 
the traveling takes are like the players
so<00:03:34.570> we<00:03:34.810> have<00:03:35.230> not<00:03:35.380> too<00:03:35.590> far<00:03:35.769> they<00:03:35.890> go<00:03:36.070> we're

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
so we have not too far they go we're

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:37.920 
so we have not too far they go we're
looking<00:03:37.060> forward<00:03:37.239> to<00:03:37.390> the<00:03:37.480> game<00:03:37.510> there<00:03:37.810> will

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
looking forward to the game there will

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.509 
looking forward to the game there will
be<00:03:38.019> one<00:03:38.170> or<00:03:38.260> two<00:03:38.290> opportunities<00:03:39.160> for<00:03:39.340> younger

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
be one or two opportunities for younger

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.570 
be one or two opportunities for younger
players<00:03:39.730> and<00:03:40.090> once<00:03:40.209> you<00:03:40.299> ever<00:03:40.420> go
