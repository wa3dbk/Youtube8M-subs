00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.210
 for the company's first coming to 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.410
 paris au tc the it seemed to me 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:17.510
 important to have a program that speaks 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.660
 really from the company of his youth 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.800
 of the energy of this being a program 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.929
 very dynamic 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.849
 that's why I chose to have 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:29.240
 three very different pieces but at the 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.710
 complementary times we saved 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.630
 itzig ali l'insee a choreographer 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.810
 Israeli who did a choreography 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.670
 with a lot of energy for 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.219
 men of the company are seven dancers 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.489
 that go to exhaustion in fact 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.469
 it's very very very dynamic and it's 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.750
 completely a contrast with extremely 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.940
 clauses of the Spanish choreographer 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.719
 alejandro do buttons or it's a 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:57.170
 very sensual piece that gently 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.609
 transports us into a world almost a 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.660
 little Japanese by the time it is 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.000
 Spanish 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.910
 but in full of calm and I believe that 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.020
 in today's society where one is 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.670
 always running in 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.200
 the place where another bath looking 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.830
 this room there is a moment where time 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.780
 stop 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.250
 and I find it very beautiful and at the same time 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.800
 it's quite a contrast with the 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.810
 previous piece and the show ends 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.570
 by casillas to maths it's someone 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.590
 current that we present more 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.300
 personally I had a lot of 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.160
 good experiences and he made me 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.320
 grow as a dancer and that's me 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.700
 seemed interesting first of all that the 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.950
 dancers my company may have 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.990
 this experience there and then of being able 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.690
 show the public the result of the 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.910
 collaboration between well great artist 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.240
 what is macek and the dancers of the 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.790
 company 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.250
 binational in the company we have 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.649
 fourteen nationalities with people with 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.080
 very strong personalities who are 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.600
 very different and so for the purpose 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.820
 of doctors blow he's talking about the report 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.369
 with each other love hate 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.140
 does not start relationship with each other 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.090
 other 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.530
 it was the ideal casting in fact of two 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.039
 used the dancers of the company 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.039
 for this show
