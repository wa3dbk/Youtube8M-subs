00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
over-the-shoulder for example now it

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.030 
over-the-shoulder for example now it
doesn't<00:01:38.610> look<00:01:38.640> too<00:01:39.030> good<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.540> looks<00:01:39.750> like<00:01:40.259> you

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.280 
can't hit anything I'll just end the
tutorial<00:02:32.970> but<00:02:33.239> I'm<00:02:33.569> gonna<00:02:33.780> go<00:02:33.930> for<00:02:34.079> a<00:02:34.140> couple

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
tutorial but I'm gonna go for a couple

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.569 
tutorial but I'm gonna go for a couple
of<00:02:34.380> shots<00:02:34.620> with<00:02:34.799> it<00:02:34.890> so<00:02:34.980> you<00:02:35.069> can<00:02:35.190> see<00:02:35.340> how<00:02:35.370> it

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
of shots with it so you can see how it

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.380 
of shots with it so you can see how it
looks<00:02:36.410> in<00:02:37.410> my<00:02:37.590> opinion<00:02:37.829> is<00:02:38.069> it's<00:02:38.760> really<00:02:39.030> like

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
looks in my opinion is it's really like

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.900 
looks in my opinion is it's really like
it's<00:02:39.630> not<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:40.140> hard<00:02:40.530> shot<00:02:40.739> guess<00:02:41.190> most<00:02:41.730> of<00:02:41.819> the

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
it's not a hard shot guess most of the

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.330 
it's not a hard shot guess most of the
people<00:02:42.299> can<00:02:42.510> do<00:02:42.690> even<00:02:42.989> like<00:02:43.380> barely<00:02:43.920> anyone

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
people can do even like barely anyone

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.940 
people can do even like barely anyone
knows<00:02:44.519> how<00:02:44.849> to<00:02:44.910> do<00:02:45.209> it<00:02:45.360> that's<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.660> thingy<00:02:45.950> and

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
knows how to do it that's the thingy and

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.520 
knows how to do it that's the thingy and
as<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.400> said<00:02:47.549> earlier<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:48.030> shoot<00:02:48.420> YX<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.410> you

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
as I said earlier is shoot YX and you

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.110 
as I said earlier is shoot YX and you
kind<00:02:49.739> of<00:02:49.829> want<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.010> press<00:02:50.220> X<00:02:50.459> a<00:02:50.610> bit<00:02:50.849> later

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
kind of want to press X a bit later

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.750 
kind of want to press X a bit later
because<00:02:52.019> I<00:02:52.349> think<00:02:52.410> if<00:02:52.650> you<00:02:52.739> press<00:02:52.980> all<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.640> them

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
because I think if you press all of them

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.410 
because I think if you press all of them
together<00:02:53.910> yeah<00:02:54.329> it<00:02:54.540> just<00:02:54.569> reloads<00:02:56.420> okay

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
together yeah it just reloads okay

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.360 
together yeah it just reloads okay
