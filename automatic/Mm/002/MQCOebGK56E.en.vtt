this<00:02:34.519> is<00:02:34.609> the<00:02:34.730> one<00:02:34.880> area<00:02:35.150> we<00:02:35.510> can<00:02:35.690> really<00:02:35.989> pump

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
this is the one area we can really pump

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.319 
this is the one area we can really pump
as<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:36.769> we<00:02:36.950> want<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.310> do<00:02:37.459> that<00:02:37.670> everything<00:02:38.209> was

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
as so we want to do that everything was

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:39.759 
as so we want to do that everything was
pulled<00:02:38.600> all<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.930> colors<00:02:39.200> were<00:02:39.350> pulled<00:02:39.650> from

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
pulled all the colors were pulled from

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.610 
pulled all the colors were pulled from
Lautrec<00:02:40.370> prints<00:02:41.030> so<00:02:41.720> their<00:02:41.900> colors<00:02:42.200> from<00:02:42.470> the

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
Lautrec prints so their colors from the

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.559 
Lautrec prints so their colors from the
period<00:02:42.889> that<00:02:43.040> he<00:02:43.160> would<00:02:43.310> have<00:02:43.400> used<00:02:43.609> in<00:02:44.090> the

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
period that he would have used in the

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.800 
period that he would have used in the
prints<00:02:45.280> yeah<00:02:46.280> it's<00:02:46.730> great<00:02:46.910> idea<00:02:47.329> that<00:02:47.540> all<00:02:47.569> the

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
prints yeah it's great idea that all the

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.210 
prints yeah it's great idea that all the
parents<00:02:48.139> folks<00:02:48.350> that<00:02:48.560> are<00:02:48.650> sitting<00:02:48.889> watching

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
parents folks that are sitting watching

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.290 
parents folks that are sitting watching
the<00:02:49.609> show

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
the show

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.990 
the show
black<00:02:50.840> so<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.740> men<00:02:51.980> are<00:02:52.130> in<00:02:52.220> black<00:02:52.430> and<00:02:52.670> women

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
black so the men are in black and women

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.890 
black so the men are in black and women
or<00:02:53.090> black<00:02:53.300> and<00:02:53.330> we're<00:02:53.540> looking<00:02:53.810> at

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
or black and we're looking at

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.560 
or black and we're looking at
silhouettes<00:02:54.470> so<00:02:55.250> that<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.550> can-can<00:02:55.790> girls<00:02:56.420> to

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
silhouettes so that the can-can girls to

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.230 
silhouettes so that the can-can girls to
talk<00:02:56.840> more<00:02:57.200> they<00:02:57.950> are<00:02:58.570> I<00:03:00.880> think<00:03:01.880> that<00:03:01.910> we<00:03:02.120> can

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
talk more they are I think that we can

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.670 
talk more they are I think that we can
both<00:03:02.420> be<00:03:02.630> really<00:03:02.870> honest<00:03:03.230> with<00:03:03.290> each<00:03:03.410> other

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
both be really honest with each other

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.580 
both be really honest with each other
and<00:03:03.950> we<00:03:04.100> can<00:03:04.280> be<00:03:04.400> really<00:03:04.760> Frank<00:03:05.120> and<00:03:05.480> Frank<00:03:06.350> is

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
and we can be really Frank and Frank is

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.310 
and we can be really Frank and Frank is
sort<00:03:06.920> of<00:03:06.980> my<00:03:07.040> second<00:03:07.490> name<00:03:07.640> everybody<00:03:08.180> but<00:03:09.020> it

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
sort of my second name everybody but it

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.980 
sort of my second name everybody but it
it<00:03:09.830> works<00:03:10.550> out<00:03:10.760> that<00:03:10.820> way<00:03:11.090> I'm<00:03:11.570> a<00:03:11.600> more

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
it works out that way I'm a more

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.900 
it works out that way I'm a more
functional<00:03:12.350> because<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:13.160> tore<00:03:13.460> it<00:03:13.490> and<00:03:13.850> I

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
functional because I tore it and I

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.600 
functional because I tore it and I
maintain<00:03:14.510> it<00:03:14.740> history<00:03:15.740> you<00:03:15.890> have<00:03:15.920> a<00:03:16.310> longer

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
maintain it history you have a longer

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.420 
maintain it history you have a longer
history<00:03:16.880> with<00:03:17.300> dance<00:03:17.600> yeah<00:03:18.020> I<00:03:18.290> understand<00:03:18.770> so

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
history with dance yeah I understand so

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.250 
history with dance yeah I understand so
I<00:03:19.460> think<00:03:19.580> what's<00:03:19.880> needed<00:03:20.090> a<00:03:20.330> little<00:03:20.510> more<00:03:20.750> yeah

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
I think what's needed a little more yeah

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.800 
I think what's needed a little more yeah
yeah<00:03:21.680> Shannon<00:03:22.460> understands<00:03:23.120> color<00:03:23.510> better

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
yeah Shannon understands color better

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.440 
yeah Shannon understands color better
than<00:03:24.140> I<00:03:24.290> do<00:03:24.350> but<00:03:25.310> I<00:03:25.370> think<00:03:25.460> even<00:03:25.940> though<00:03:26.210> we

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
than I do but I think even though we

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.270 
than I do but I think even though we
design<00:03:27.140> things<00:03:27.170> a<00:03:27.530> little<00:03:27.650> bit<00:03:27.800> differently<00:03:28.190> I

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
design things a little bit differently I

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.010 
design things a little bit differently I
think<00:03:28.610> we<00:03:28.760> both<00:03:28.910> have<00:03:29.150> a<00:03:29.180> very<00:03:29.390> similar<00:03:29.600> line

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
think we both have a very similar line

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.320 
think we both have a very similar line
on<00:03:30.200> what<00:03:30.380> we<00:03:30.500> yeah<00:03:31.160> what<00:03:31.460> we<00:03:31.580> consider<00:03:31.970> correct

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
on what we yeah what we consider correct

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.410 
on what we yeah what we consider correct
we<00:03:33.050> draw<00:03:33.260> so<00:03:33.470> differently<00:03:33.920> and<00:03:34.190> I'm<00:03:35.000> so

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
we draw so differently and I'm so

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.510 
we draw so differently and I'm so
retentive<00:03:35.750> in<00:03:36.020> my<00:03:36.110> drawing<00:03:36.410> and<00:03:36.770> Shannon<00:03:37.370> is

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
retentive in my drawing and Shannon is

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.850 
retentive in my drawing and Shannon is
so<00:03:37.760> loose<00:03:38.110> between<00:03:39.110> us<00:03:39.140> we<00:03:39.470> know<00:03:39.680> they're

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
so loose between us we know they're

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.560 
so loose between us we know they're
exactly<00:03:40.130> the<00:03:40.340> same<00:03:40.490> but<00:03:40.730> no<00:03:41.000> one<00:03:41.150> else<00:03:41.330> in<00:03:41.510> the

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
exactly the same but no one else in the

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.600 
exactly the same but no one else in the
world<00:03:41.720> could<00:03:41.990> tell<00:03:42.170> that<00:03:42.380> with<00:03:42.590> us<00:03:42.770> so<00:03:43.460> we'll

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
world could tell that with us so we'll

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.210 
world could tell that with us so we'll
each<00:03:43.790> to<00:03:44.060> say<00:03:44.480> three<00:03:44.870> can<00:03:45.080> cans<00:03:45.380> worth<00:03:45.680> you

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
each to say three can cans worth you

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.010 
each to say three can cans worth you
know<00:03:46.250> for<00:03:46.610> rehearsals<00:03:47.090> and<00:03:47.300> on<00:03:47.540> paper<00:03:47.750> they

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
know for rehearsals and on paper they

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.420 
know for rehearsals and on paper they
look<00:03:48.200> very<00:03:48.230> different<00:03:48.500> but<00:03:48.890> on<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.160> stage

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
look very different but on the stage

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.400 
look very different but on the stage
then<00:03:50.150> I<00:03:50.180> plant<00:03:50.600> in<00:03:50.720> treating<00:03:50.960> and<00:03:51.200> when<00:03:51.290> we

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
then I plant in treating and when we

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.220 
then I plant in treating and when we
talk<00:03:51.650> and<00:03:51.860> describe<00:03:52.310> it<00:03:52.690> we<00:03:53.690> know<00:03:53.900> exactly

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
talk and describe it we know exactly

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.790 
talk and describe it we know exactly
