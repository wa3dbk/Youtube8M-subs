00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
women's chances a couple of years ago

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.250 
women's chances a couple of years ago
when<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.550> competed<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.510> nowadays<00:01:03.750> I

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
when you competed and and nowadays I

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.679 
when you competed and and nowadays I
think<00:01:04.979> there<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.159> no<00:01:05.489> difference<00:01:05.909> it's<00:01:06.299> maybe

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
think there is no difference it's maybe

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.630 
think there is no difference it's maybe
maybe<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.350> little<00:01:07.590> bit<00:01:07.830> more<00:01:08.010> difficult<00:01:08.520> today

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
maybe a little bit more difficult today

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.440 
maybe a little bit more difficult today
but<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.659> also<00:01:09.869> difficult<00:01:10.170> for<00:01:10.470> men<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.130> I

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
but it's also difficult for men so I

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.810 
but it's also difficult for men so I
think<00:01:12.450> we<00:01:12.630> have<00:01:13.070> we<00:01:14.070> have<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.340> chance<00:01:14.610> you

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
think we have we have the chance you

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.969 
think we have we have the chance you
know<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.090> have<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.360> fight<00:01:15.619> nothing<00:01:16.619> is

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
know you have to fight nothing is

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.890 
know you have to fight nothing is
happening<00:01:17.130> if<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.119> don't<00:01:18.299> fight<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.750> if<00:01:18.869> you

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
happening if you don't fight and if you

try to work I think it's only only
chance

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
chance

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.660 
chance
nothing<00:01:58.240> is<00:01:58.950> arriving<00:01:59.950> like<00:02:00.100> this<00:02:00.310> you<00:02:00.550> know

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
nothing is arriving like this you know

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.880 
nothing is arriving like this you know

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
just hit you clap in your hand so you

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.430 
just hit you clap in your hand so you
have<00:02:03.070> ready<00:02:03.280> to<00:02:03.460> fight

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440

Natalie's dream is to is to fight for
Formula<00:02:07.390> one<00:02:07.540> in<00:02:07.750> future<00:02:08.140> do<00:02:09.070> you<00:02:09.190> think<00:02:09.429> it<00:02:09.850> is

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
Formula one in future do you think it is

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.390 
Formula one in future do you think it is
possible<00:02:10.539> because<00:02:10.630> there<00:02:11.320> were<00:02:11.410> there<00:02:12.280> had

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
possible because there were there had

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.060 
possible because there were there had
been<00:02:12.550> so<00:02:12.700> many<00:02:12.820> years<00:02:13.120> since<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.990> last<00:02:14.230> woman

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
been so many years since the last woman

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.610 
been so many years since the last woman
competed<00:02:15.700> in<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:16.239> Formula<00:02:16.630> One<00:02:16.780> she's<00:02:17.410> maybe

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
competed in the Formula One she's maybe

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.360 
competed in the Formula One she's maybe
the<00:02:17.830> next<00:02:18.070> one

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
the next one

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.520 
the next one
so<00:02:18.940> you<00:02:19.000> know<00:02:19.300> if<00:02:19.420> you<00:02:19.540> don't<00:02:19.690> dream<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:20.410> if

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
so you know if you don't dream and if

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.199 
so you know if you don't dream and if
you<00:02:20.680> don't<00:02:20.860> think<00:02:21.190> about<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:21.760> if<00:02:21.880> you<00:02:22.000> don't

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
you don't think about and if you don't

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.510 
you don't think about and if you don't
have<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.480> goal<00:02:22.690> I<00:02:22.959> mean<00:02:23.709> for<00:02:24.100> sure<00:02:24.130> you<00:02:24.370> will

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
have the goal I mean for sure you will

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.180 
have the goal I mean for sure you will
not<00:02:24.640> succeed<00:02:24.940> but<00:02:25.570> if<00:02:25.780> you<00:02:25.959> really<00:02:26.170> want<00:02:26.500> and

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
not succeed but if you really want and

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.160 
not succeed but if you really want and
you<00:02:27.489> take<00:02:27.700> all<00:02:27.850> the<00:02:27.970> chance<00:02:28.239> and<00:02:28.570> maybe<00:02:28.900> also

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
you take all the chance and maybe also

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.800 
you take all the chance and maybe also
we<00:02:29.500> have<00:02:29.650> maybe<00:02:30.220> she<00:02:31.090> has<00:02:31.180> to<00:02:31.360> find<00:02:31.570> some

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
we have maybe she has to find some

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.050 
we have maybe she has to find some
support<00:02:32.200> so<00:02:33.010> if<00:02:33.340> we<00:02:33.519> can<00:02:33.700> help<00:02:33.880> we<00:02:34.209> will<00:02:34.810> do<00:02:34.959> it
