is<00:00:17.260> with<00:00:18.260> the<00:00:18.350> SRM<00:00:18.920> six<00:00:19.160> is<00:00:19.279> just<00:00:19.490> for<00:00:19.640> weight

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
is with the SRM six is just for weight

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.880 
is with the SRM six is just for weight
test<00:00:20.600> amount<00:00:20.930> compared<00:00:21.350> to<00:00:21.470> the<00:00:21.590> plane

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
test amount compared to the plane

equivalent<00:00:26.119> so<00:00:26.440> you<00:00:27.440> know<00:00:27.730> maybe<00:00:28.730> not<00:00:28.910> the

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
equivalent so you know maybe not the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.609 
equivalent so you know maybe not the
best<00:00:29.030> against<00:00:29.720> lights<00:00:29.960> I<00:00:30.199> mean<00:00:30.440> obviously

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
best against lights I mean obviously

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.740 
best against lights I mean obviously
they<00:00:30.949> can<00:00:31.130> hit<00:00:31.250> now<00:00:31.460> but<00:00:31.910> against<00:00:32.539> large

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
they can hit now but against large

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.170 
they can hit now but against large
target<00:00:33.289> and<00:00:33.739> they<00:00:33.860> do<00:00:33.920> hurt<00:00:34.340> on<00:00:35.030> this

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
target and they do hurt on this

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.670 
target and they do hurt on this
particular<00:00:35.420> map<00:00:35.719> let's<00:00:35.930> see<00:00:36.050> how<00:00:36.109> ers<00:00:36.500> work

fun<00:06:04.010> is<00:06:04.250> down<00:06:05.590> so<00:06:06.590> this<00:06:06.710> particular<00:06:07.010> set<00:06:07.850> up<00:06:07.970> a

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
fun is down so this particular set up a

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.910 
fun is down so this particular set up a
little<00:06:08.450> bit<00:06:08.540> hot<00:06:08.750> on<00:06:08.900> this<00:06:09.050> map<00:06:09.290> obviously<00:06:09.800> it

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:09.920 
little bit hot on this map obviously it

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.190 
little bit hot on this map obviously it
is<00:06:10.040> caustic<00:06:10.460> Valley<00:06:10.670> didn't<00:06:11.390> do<00:06:11.570> too<00:06:11.810> bad

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:12.200 
is caustic Valley didn't do too bad

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.370 
little hot like i said but i'd rather

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.800 
little hot like i said but i'd rather
have<00:06:52.610> lesser<00:06:53.030> ones<00:06:53.180> i<00:06:53.300> think<00:06:53.330> then<00:06:53.630> these

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:53.810 
have lesser ones i think then these

00:06:53.810 --> 00:07:03.290 
have lesser ones i think then these
