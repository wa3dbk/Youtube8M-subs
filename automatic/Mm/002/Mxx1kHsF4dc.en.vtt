like<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.489> lighter<00:00:59.850> color<00:01:00.210> on<00:01:00.480> her<00:01:00.690> lid<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.410> then

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
like a lighter color on her lid and then

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.189 
like a lighter color on her lid and then
just<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.100> sort<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.820> dark<00:01:03.120> smoky<00:01:03.930> gray

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
just the sort of the the dark smoky gray

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.760 
just the sort of the the dark smoky gray
is<00:01:04.379> more<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.769> crease<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.400> these<00:01:06.030> two<00:01:06.770> I'm

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
is more in the crease so these two I'm

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.350 
is more in the crease so these two I'm
gonna<00:01:07.890> just<00:01:08.189> kind<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.490> mix<00:01:08.700> them<00:01:08.760> together<00:01:09.000> on

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360

just a really soft blend of those two
colors<00:01:22.350> I'm<00:01:22.650> gonna<00:01:22.799> put<00:01:22.979> them<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.400> crease

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
colors I'm gonna put them in the crease

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.030 
colors I'm gonna put them in the crease
and<00:01:24.570> I'm<00:01:24.630> just<00:01:24.750> gonna<00:01:24.990> mixing<00:01:25.680> them<00:01:25.830> together

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
colors together and this brush really

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.870 
colors together and this brush really
does<00:01:34.350> most<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.829> work<00:01:34.890> for<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.670> because

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
does most of the work for you because

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.140 
does most of the work for you because
it's<00:01:36.210> kind<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.630> soft<00:01:36.990> brush<00:01:37.700> but<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.909> still

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
it's kind of a soft brush but it still

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.550 
it's kind of a soft brush but it still
has<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.329> little<00:01:39.509> bit<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.810> resilience<00:01:40.290> like<00:01:40.439> it's

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
has a little bit of resilience like it's

this shadow by Mac and this is vellum
and<00:02:47.040> this<00:02:47.220> is<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.400> really<00:02:47.820> unique<00:02:47.940> shadow

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
and this is a really unique shadow

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.970 
and this is a really unique shadow
because<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:48.900> just<00:02:48.990> looks<00:02:49.200> white<00:02:49.410> in<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.680> pan

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
because it just looks white in the pan

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.640 
because it just looks white in the pan

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
but when you apply it it just gives this

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.480 
but when you apply it it just gives this
glowing<00:02:53.190> effect<00:02:54.320> as<00:02:55.320> you<00:02:55.380> can<00:02:55.650> see<00:02:55.890> there<00:02:56.310> it

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
glowing effect as you can see there it

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.000 
glowing effect as you can see there it
kind<00:02:56.670> of<00:02:56.700> looks<00:02:56.940> like<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.590> don't<00:02:58.590> know<00:02:58.800> like

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
kind of looks like I don't know like

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:06.680 
kind of looks like I don't know like
that<00:02:59.190> lit<00:02:59.460> from<00:02:59.670> within<00:02:59.760> glow<00:03:05.240> on<00:03:06.240> the<00:03:06.540> lower

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
that lit from within glow on the lower

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.210 
that lit from within glow on the lower
lash<00:03:06.990> line<00:03:07.260> we're<00:03:07.410> going<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.620> using<00:03:08.070> those

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
lash line we're going to using those

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.280 
lash line we're going to using those
same<00:03:08.550> two<00:03:08.790> colors<00:03:09.210> again<00:03:09.540> that<00:03:09.690> I<00:03:09.780> blend<00:03:10.140> it

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
same two colors again that I blend it

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.980 
same two colors again that I blend it
together<00:03:10.470> before<00:03:10.860> I<00:03:11.520> am<00:03:12.150> just<00:03:12.420> going<00:03:12.630> to<00:03:12.780> apply

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
together before I am just going to apply

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.410 
together before I am just going to apply
that<00:03:13.080> very<00:03:13.620> softly<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.370> really<00:03:14.670> blend<00:03:14.970> it<00:03:15.210> out

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
that very softly and really blend it out

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.690 
that very softly and really blend it out
because<00:03:15.720> it<00:03:16.440> doesn't<00:03:16.680> look<00:03:16.770> like<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:17.070> smoky

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
because it doesn't look like the smoky

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.720 
because it doesn't look like the smoky
effect<00:03:17.850> kind<00:03:18.330> of<00:03:18.390> goes<00:03:18.540> down<00:03:18.750> quite<00:03:19.050> far<00:03:19.410> on

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730
