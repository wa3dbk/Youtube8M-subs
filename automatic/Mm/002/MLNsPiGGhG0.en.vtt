00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.010 

here's<00:00:01.880> where<00:00:02.060> the<00:00:02.210> truck<00:00:02.510> starts<00:00:02.870> making

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:03.020 
here's where the truck starts making

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.750 
here's where the truck starts making
power<00:00:03.379> intermittently<00:00:04.010> all<00:00:04.279> of<00:00:04.399> a<00:00:04.430> sudden<00:00:04.700> it

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:04.760 
power intermittently all of a sudden it

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.440 
power intermittently all of a sudden it
wants<00:00:04.970> to<00:00:05.060> start<00:00:05.299> working

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.450 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:28.020 

I'm<00:00:08.900> not<00:00:09.019> gonna<00:00:09.230> do<00:00:09.440> it<00:00:09.590> now

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:28.030 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.660 

so<00:00:28.600> it<00:00:28.810> sounds<00:00:29.200> like<00:00:29.290> it's<00:00:29.680> working<00:00:30.100> it<00:00:30.280> wants

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:30.670 
so it sounds like it's working it wants

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.720 
so it sounds like it's working it wants
to<00:00:30.790> accelerate<00:00:31.270> then<00:00:31.810> it<00:00:31.930> just<00:00:32.080> turns<00:00:32.349> off<00:00:32.730> and

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
to accelerate then it just turns off and

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:41.900 
to accelerate then it just turns off and
it's<00:00:34.480> flirt<00:00:34.920> what<00:00:35.920> it's<00:00:36.040> doing

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.610 

I've<00:00:42.210> been<00:00:42.329> driving<00:00:42.780> for<00:00:42.989> about<00:00:43.020> 40<00:00:43.590> minutes

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
I've been driving for about 40 minutes

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.650 
I've been driving for about 40 minutes
now<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.790> is<00:00:44.850> what<00:00:45.060> I<00:00:45.090> was<00:00:45.210> talking<00:00:45.450> about

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
now this is what I was talking about

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.780 
now this is what I was talking about
where<00:00:46.140> you're<00:00:46.800> driving<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.250> feels<00:00:47.489> like<00:00:47.670> it

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
where you're driving it feels like it

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.480 
where you're driving it feels like it
wants<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.059> start<00:00:48.329> working<00:00:48.660> out<00:00:48.720> of<00:00:48.870> nowhere

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:51.490 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.670 

that<00:00:52.120> almost<00:00:52.330> goes<00:00:52.690> with<00:00:52.870> 30<00:00:53.080> pounds<00:00:53.500> I<00:00:53.530> hear

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
that almost goes with 30 pounds I hear

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.800 
that almost goes with 30 pounds I hear
the<00:00:53.770> engines<00:00:54.100> start<00:00:54.310> working<00:00:54.700> and<00:00:55.240> it<00:00:55.420> shuts

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.810 
the engines start working and it shuts

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:21.679 
the engines start working and it shuts
off<00:00:55.960> and<00:00:56.020> turns<00:00:56.530> into<00:00:56.710> a<00:00:56.800> limp<00:00:57.100> noodle

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.459 

on<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.409> grate<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.860> slowed<00:01:23.159> down<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.640> like<00:01:24.469> 65

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:25.469 
on this grate it slowed down to like 65

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:37.290 
on this grate it slowed down to like 65
from<00:01:25.770> 74

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.630 

I'm<00:01:37.900> oscillating<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:38.680> gas<00:01:38.950> pedal<00:01:39.310> to<00:01:39.340> show

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
I'm oscillating the gas pedal to show

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.030 
I'm oscillating the gas pedal to show
you<00:01:39.700> that<00:01:40.030> sometimes<00:01:40.510> the<00:01:40.900> turbo<00:01:41.230> works<00:01:41.500> and

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
you that sometimes the turbo works and

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.800 
you that sometimes the turbo works and
then<00:01:42.400> also<00:01:42.550> not<00:01:42.880> of<00:01:42.970> nowhere<00:01:43.270> it<00:01:43.360> just<00:01:43.420> turns

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
then also not of nowhere it just turns

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.370 
then also not of nowhere it just turns
off

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.050 

and<00:01:49.799> as<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.070> can<00:01:50.159> see<00:01:50.220> it's<00:01:50.490> doing<00:01:50.640> all<00:01:50.939> this

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
and as you can see it's doing all this

00:01:51.060 --> 00:02:18.970 
and as you can see it's doing all this
weird<00:01:51.590> no<00:01:52.590> check<00:01:52.920> engine<00:01:53.130> light

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.950 

there's<00:02:19.520> like<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.850> normal<00:02:20.180> response<00:02:20.569> it<00:02:20.780> just

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
there's like the normal response it just

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:51.120 
there's like the normal response it just
goes<00:02:21.110> right<00:02:21.319> to<00:02:21.350> 17

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.100 

see<00:02:51.730> there<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.090> truck<00:02:52.330> just<00:02:52.540> wants<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:52.900> take

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
see there the truck just wants to take

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.870 
see there the truck just wants to take
off<00:02:53.350> and<00:02:53.620> work<00:02:53.800> then<00:02:54.580> it<00:02:54.670> just<00:02:54.850> turns<00:02:55.090> an<00:02:55.240> emic

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
off and work then it just turns an emic

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.640 
off and work then it just turns an emic
now<00:02:57.390> right<00:02:57.600> there<00:02:57.750> what<00:02:57.930> I<00:02:57.960> just<00:02:58.170> did<00:02:58.350> is<00:02:58.530> what

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
now right there what I just did is what

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.130 
now right there what I just did is what
it<00:02:58.770> did<00:02:58.920> on<00:02:59.070> Saturday<00:02:59.580> and<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.600> couldn't<00:03:00.900> get<00:03:01.020> it

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
it did on Saturday and I couldn't get it

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.620 
it did on Saturday and I couldn't get it
over<00:03:01.350> ten<00:03:01.590> pounds<00:03:01.770> of<00:03:02.010> boost<00:03:02.330> this<00:03:03.330> started

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
over ten pounds of boost this started

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.840 
over ten pounds of boost this started
acting<00:03:03.900> up<00:03:03.960> really<00:03:04.290> bad<00:03:04.470> on<00:03:04.650> Saturday<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:05.700> I

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
acting up really bad on Saturday and I

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.380 
acting up really bad on Saturday and I
stopped<00:03:06.210> and<00:03:07.250> hooked<00:03:08.250> up<00:03:08.400> this<00:03:08.610> booze<00:03:09.120> gauge

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
stopped and hooked up this booze gauge

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.640 
stopped and hooked up this booze gauge
as<00:03:09.600> you<00:03:09.720> can<00:03:09.840> see<00:03:09.960> it's<00:03:10.140> just<00:03:10.350> kind<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:10.590> like

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
as you can see it's just kind of like

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.940 
as you can see it's just kind of like
laid<00:03:11.340> across<00:03:11.490> the<00:03:11.730> dash<00:03:12.410> this<00:03:13.410> problem<00:03:13.800> isn't

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
laid across the dash this problem isn't

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.610 
laid across the dash this problem isn't
going<00:03:14.220> on<00:03:14.490> for<00:03:14.760> two<00:03:15.060> months<00:03:15.510> now<00:03:15.660> since<00:03:16.380> day

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
going on for two months now since day

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.230 
going on for two months now since day
one<00:03:16.800> most<00:03:17.070> dealers<00:03:17.430> won't<00:03:17.610> even<00:03:17.760> look<00:03:17.940> at<00:03:18.150> it

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
one most dealers won't even look at it

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:27.850 
one most dealers won't even look at it
because<00:03:18.300> the<00:03:18.480> check<00:03:18.690> engine<00:03:18.870> light<00:03:19.110> was<00:03:19.140> not

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.270 

that's<00:03:28.700> enough<00:03:28.940> to<00:03:29.030> have
