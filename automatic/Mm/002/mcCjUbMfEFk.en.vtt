SP<00:00:07.310> two<00:00:07.580> endings<00:00:08.060> in<00:00:08.930> my<00:00:09.050> first<00:00:09.290> video<00:00:09.410> pretty

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.920 
SP two endings in my first video pretty

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.860 
SP two endings in my first video pretty
much<00:00:10.040> my<00:00:10.490> theory<00:00:10.790> was<00:00:11.030> try<00:00:11.330> not<00:00:11.510> to<00:00:11.600> get<00:00:11.690> hit

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
much my theory was try not to get hit

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.070 
much my theory was try not to get hit
from<00:00:12.020> the<00:00:12.430> magician<00:00:13.480> so<00:00:14.480> I'm<00:00:14.630> sticking<00:00:14.900> on

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
from the magician so I'm sticking on

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.960 
from the magician so I'm sticking on
that<00:00:15.230> theory<00:00:15.650> because<00:00:15.950> I<00:00:16.129> tried<00:00:16.460> it<00:00:16.730> several

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
that theory because I tried it several

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.849 
that theory because I tried it several
times<00:00:17.419> in<00:00:17.660> the<00:00:17.869> first<00:00:18.080> video<00:00:18.230> you<00:00:18.380> saw<00:00:18.589> me<00:00:18.650> get

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:18.859 
times in the first video you saw me get

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:20.499 
times in the first video you saw me get
hit<00:00:19.039> part<00:00:19.279> of<00:00:19.339> you<00:00:19.460> time<00:00:19.669> but<00:00:20.179> you<00:00:20.419> know

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:20.509 
hit part of you time but you know

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:24.069 
hit part of you time but you know
nothing<00:00:20.810> fight<00:00:22.150> my<00:00:23.150> first<00:00:23.419> video<00:00:23.660> pretty<00:00:23.960> much

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:24.079 
nothing fight my first video pretty much

to<00:00:31.429> get<00:00:31.579> a<00:00:31.609> hit<00:00:32.090> as<00:00:32.300> less<00:00:32.630> you<00:00:32.870> can<00:00:33.130> and<00:00:34.130> we're

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:34.580 
to get a hit as less you can and we're

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.800 
to get a hit as less you can and we're
just<00:00:34.670> going<00:00:34.820> to<00:00:34.910> go<00:00:34.970> for<00:00:35.150> the<00:00:35.210> second<00:00:35.540> attempt

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:35.810 
just going to go for the second attempt

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.930 
just going to go for the second attempt
right<00:00:35.960> now<00:00:36.110> see<00:00:36.410> my<00:00:36.590> theory<00:00:36.980> stands<00:00:37.370> true<00:00:37.670> I'm

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
right now see my theory stands true I'm

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.460 
right now see my theory stands true I'm
just<00:00:38.240> like<00:00:38.360> two<00:00:38.570> seconds<00:00:38.930> away<00:00:38.990> from<00:00:39.320> them

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
just like two seconds away from them

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.620 
just like two seconds away from them
first<00:00:40.340> thing<00:00:40.460> I<00:00:40.520> got<00:00:40.670> to<00:00:40.700> do<00:00:40.850> is<00:00:41.000> the<00:00:41.180> fireball

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.630 
first thing I got to do is the fireball

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.490 
first thing I got to do is the fireball
thing<00:00:42.190> they<00:00:43.190> emit<00:00:43.730> from<00:00:44.090> this<00:00:44.330> capsule<00:00:44.990> which

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
thing they emit from this capsule which

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.270 
thing they emit from this capsule which
is<00:00:45.530> a<00:00:45.710> bitch<00:00:46.000> this<00:00:47.000> is<00:00:47.150> giving<00:00:47.510> it<00:00:47.830> just<00:00:48.830> do<00:00:49.010> my

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
is a bitch this is giving it just do my

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.670 
is a bitch this is giving it just do my
tactic<00:00:49.820> what<00:00:50.300> I<00:00:50.330> did

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
tactic what I did

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.070 
tactic what I did
and<00:00:52.400> it<00:00:52.760> been<00:00:52.910> work<00:00:53.060> hopefully<00:00:53.330> if<00:00:53.570> it<00:00:53.660> doesn't

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.080 
and it been work hopefully if it doesn't

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:00.310 
and it been work hopefully if it doesn't
count<00:00:57.370> there<00:00:58.370> was<00:00:58.550> a<00:00:58.580> bit<00:00:58.790> at<00:00:58.910> this<00:00:59.000> time<00:00:59.320> he's

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
count there was a bit at this time he's

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.750 
count there was a bit at this time he's
not<00:01:00.470> to<00:01:00.650> get<00:01:00.770> in<00:01:00.860> front<00:01:01.040> of<00:01:01.130> the<00:01:01.310> hit<00:01:01.490> for<00:01:01.640> this

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
not to get in front of the hit for this

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.840 
not to get in front of the hit for this
guy<00:01:02.980> especially<00:01:03.980> that<00:01:04.160> little<00:01:04.309> bitch<00:01:04.580> type

just about this way just to look that
rate<00:01:41.289> of<00:01:41.409> fire<00:01:41.619> in<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:41.979> purple<00:01:42.399> work<00:01:43.049> see<00:01:44.049> see

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
rate of fire in the purple work see see

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.039 
rate of fire in the purple work see see
Andy's<00:01:44.979> gone<00:01:45.250> we<00:01:46.060> got<00:01:46.240> no<00:01:46.600> hits
