00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.339
 belts a super cool accessory for 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.470
 Introduce yourself in your look 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.719
 Only you always chose to feel right to 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.580
 You and I see people out there who 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.559
 wear a belt anyway 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.480
 any feel in any physical type 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.310
 there was a conclusion 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:31.439
 Let's talk a little better 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:33.690
 choice for you of k1 and wide belts 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.510
 if you feel well wide to be used well in 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.879
 waist but be careful that I 'm sorry 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.700
 light colored and still full of 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.670
 details are the main ones that give 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.440
 volume on the waist or who does not have 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.289
 much belt or a potbelly more 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.320
 This is not the best option if you have 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.280
 little waist and want to wear a belt 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.620
 long 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.030
 choose a darker color without so many 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.539
 details like this 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.539
 fine 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.040
 dk two belts plus end 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.450
 It's the belt that looks good everyone is the 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.880
 belt that you are wearing a basic clothing 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.350
 you put it gives a personal touch 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.479
 This is for those who have a little more 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.340
 belly because the belly but waist - 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.920
 waist everyone will be fine 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.590
 He is fine, he is fine. 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.030
 change the type risk it does not change the little 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.030
 This is what everyone looks good 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.580
 tip 3 is that I feel it is the lowest 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.190
 the most common is this one two 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.200
 fingers that I speak and feel the two 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.149
 fingers he's cool because he's black 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.220
 It goes however only that you have a 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.280
 attention in detail is seeing how nitay 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.020
 eyebrows all the way from him to whoever 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.259
 does not have a lot of waist and is not that cool 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.390
 which gives volume where I no longer have much 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.970
 then you have to make choices of 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.890
 suddenly a two- finger belt that does not 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:08.290
 has so much volume on the side only 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:10.989
 concentrated in the middle is four is the 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.959
 elastic belt this belt is here 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:16.090
 the one who leaves the woman's silhouette 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.440
 balanced whenever it does the waist 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.360
 on the right place 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.820
 Undo who has a little belly 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.370
 because first is dark throughout 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:28.510
 extension or brown black always a color 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.120
 dark and the other tip is that the look 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.640
 draws attention to the center of the body 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.200
 here then for those who have little waist 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.970
 He is great for those who have a little 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.740
 There's no problem with tummy. 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.740
 with them 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.450
 pure or that is the subject of the season 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.640
 that everyone looks good just that the 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.430
 fires increase the waist and so 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.130
 Nice thing is if you wear the cars belt 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.220
 raising the waist and putting it on the waistband 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.890
 pants or adjust the waist and use the 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.530
 back of the clothes half out 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.170
 you put it only in evidence the center 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.070
 him and the butterfly in this case a daughter 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.070
 more flashy 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.190
 I hope you have enjoyed all the 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.530
 tips from the belts and now the next time 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.630
 that you chose the pseudo this new 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.620
 station that if summer is coming do 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.910
 a right choice 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.910
 Thank you to Czech.
