00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
the cold it will run much better as far

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.889 
the cold it will run much better as far
as<00:01:12.110> filling<00:01:12.469> it<00:01:12.740> up<00:01:13.000> they<00:01:14.000> say<00:01:14.240> not<00:01:14.479> to<00:01:14.509> fill<00:01:14.810> it

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899

as filling it up they say not to fill it
to<00:01:15.020> the<00:01:15.049> top<00:01:15.170> it's<00:01:15.770> true<00:01:16.219> if<00:01:16.460> you<00:01:16.579> do<00:01:16.759> overfill

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
to the top it's true if you do overfill

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.380 
to the top it's true if you do overfill
it<00:01:17.390> it<00:01:18.290> takes<00:01:18.590> a<00:01:18.770> little<00:01:18.950> longer<00:01:19.210> to<00:01:20.210> really

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
it it takes a little longer to really

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.880 
it it takes a little longer to really
come<00:01:20.689> up<00:01:20.810> to<00:01:20.960> full<00:01:21.170> speed

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
come up to full speed

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.730

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
don't leave the key attached you will

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.090 
don't leave the key attached you will
burn<00:01:24.920> your<00:01:25.130> fingers<00:01:25.579> eventually<00:01:26.180> with<00:01:26.600> it<00:01:26.750> and

little<00:01:31.610> stove<00:01:31.880> I<00:01:32.090> really<00:01:32.390> like<00:01:32.570> it<00:01:32.750> because<00:01:32.869> of

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
little stove I really like it because of

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.209 
little stove I really like it because of
the<00:01:33.939> what<00:01:34.939> should<00:01:35.210> be<00:01:35.439> potential<00:01:36.439> reliability

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:37.219 
the what should be potential reliability

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:38.590 
the what should be potential reliability
because<00:01:37.549> there's<00:01:37.759> so<00:01:37.939> few<00:01:37.969> moving<00:01:38.539> parts

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
because there's so few moving parts

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.910 
because there's so few moving parts
there's<00:01:39.280> nothing<00:01:40.280> to<00:01:40.399> pump<00:01:41.170> just<00:01:42.170> great

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
there's nothing to pump just great

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.340 
there's nothing to pump just great
whether<00:01:43.820> it's<00:01:44.030> heavy<00:01:44.270> or<00:01:44.450> not<00:01:44.479> depends<00:01:45.259> on

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
whether it's heavy or not depends on

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.800 
whether it's heavy or not depends on
whether<00:01:45.590> your<00:01:45.829> gram<00:01:46.130> Leaney<00:01:46.399> if<00:01:46.729> you<00:01:47.090> are<00:01:47.270> then

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
whether your gram Leaney if you are then

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.590 
whether your gram Leaney if you are then
ignore<00:01:48.259> the<00:01:48.439> stove<00:01:48.969> one<00:01:49.969> thing<00:01:50.179> I<00:01:50.240> did<00:01:50.420> do

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
ounce heavier I will really care what I

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.569 
ounce heavier I will really care what I
would<00:04:14.069> point<00:04:14.609> out<00:04:14.819> that<00:04:15.590> about<00:04:16.590> 30<00:04:16.919> bucks<00:04:17.190> for

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
would point out that about 30 bucks for

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.779 
would point out that about 30 bucks for
this<00:04:17.729> heat<00:04:18.389> exchanger<00:04:18.419> pot<00:04:19.169> and<00:04:19.470> I<00:04:20.099> think<00:04:20.430> for

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
this heat exchanger pot and I think for

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:22.540 
this heat exchanger pot and I think for
this<00:04:21.030> particular<00:04:21.419> stove<00:04:21.989> this

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
this particular stove this

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.820 
this particular stove this
yeah<00:04:22.669> where<00:04:22.970> you've<00:04:23.120> only<00:04:23.300> got<00:04:23.710> you<00:04:24.710> know

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
yeah where you've only got you know

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.369 
yeah where you've only got you know
limited<00:04:25.340> power<00:04:25.610> output<00:04:26.120> this<00:04:26.900> is<00:04:26.960> a<00:04:27.169> good

00:04:27.369 --> 00:04:27.379 
limited power output this is a good

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:30.640 
limited power output this is a good
investment<00:04:27.889> I<00:04:28.220> like<00:04:29.120> to<00:04:29.300> steer<00:04:29.569> because<00:04:29.780> the

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
investment I like to steer because the

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.890 
investment I like to steer because the
thing<00:04:30.889> is<00:04:30.919> bomb-proof<00:04:31.340> and<00:04:31.879> I<00:04:32.210> like<00:04:32.389> this<00:04:32.569> plot

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
thing is bomb-proof and I like this plot

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.350 
thing is bomb-proof and I like this plot
because<00:04:33.319> it<00:04:33.530> makes<00:04:34.280> best<00:04:34.580> use<00:04:34.849> of<00:04:34.879> the<00:04:35.120> power

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
because it makes best use of the power

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.990 
because it makes best use of the power
output<00:04:35.599> I<00:04:36.169> have<00:04:36.530> some<00:04:36.770> other<00:04:36.889> video<00:04:37.460> clips<00:04:37.789> and

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
output I have some other video clips and

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.790 
output I have some other video clips and
stuff<00:04:38.240> of<00:04:38.449> it<00:04:38.569> boiling<00:04:39.080> and<00:04:39.259> frying<00:04:39.560> and

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
stuff of it boiling and frying and

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.610 
stuff of it boiling and frying and
whatnot<00:04:40.190> so<00:04:40.789> there<00:04:40.970> you<00:04:41.030> go<00:04:41.210> folks<00:04:41.449> this<00:04:42.379> is<00:04:42.590> a

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
whatnot so there you go folks this is a

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.969 
whatnot so there you go folks this is a
good<00:04:42.889> plot<00:04:43.210> this<00:04:44.210> is<00:04:44.389> a<00:04:44.419> great<00:04:44.720> stove<00:04:45.080> there's

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
good plot this is a great stove there's

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:47.559 
good plot this is a great stove there's
so<00:04:46.099> much<00:04:46.250> I<00:04:46.460> can<00:04:46.520> add<00:04:46.819> about<00:04:47.060> the<00:04:47.240> stove

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:47.569 
so much I can add about the stove

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:50.230 
so much I can add about the stove
because<00:04:48.080> oh<00:04:48.319> my<00:04:48.500> goodness<00:04:49.310> it's<00:04:49.729> been<00:04:49.970> around

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
because oh my goodness it's been around

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.089 
because oh my goodness it's been around
for<00:04:50.740> honest<00:04:51.740> 60<00:04:52.729> years<00:04:53.150> now<00:04:53.650> in<00:04:54.650> this<00:04:54.830> current

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099 
for honest 60 years now in this current

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:59.379 
for honest 60 years now in this current
design<00:04:56.830> this<00:04:57.830> plateau<00:04:58.370> is<00:04:58.580> relatively<00:04:59.060> new

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
design this plateau is relatively new

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:01.899 
design this plateau is relatively new
the<00:04:59.599> heat<00:04:59.840> exchanger<00:05:00.349> technology<00:05:01.009> is<00:05:01.219> kind<00:05:01.819> of

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:01.909 
the heat exchanger technology is kind of

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:03.909 
the heat exchanger technology is kind of
a<00:05:02.000> fad<00:05:02.270> but<00:05:02.990> I<00:05:03.020> happen<00:05:03.319> to<00:05:03.349> think<00:05:03.440> it's<00:05:03.680> a<00:05:03.770> good

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
a fad but I happen to think it's a good

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:04.330 
a fad but I happen to think it's a good
one

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
one

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.900 
one
so<00:05:05.090> hope<00:05:05.180> this<00:05:05.210> helps<00:05:05.659> folks
