00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.190
 we are talking about 20 30 thousand 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.569
 people involved only in 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.219
 destruction of equipment transportation 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:13.019
 back to us countdown went 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.980
 end of this year, almost all 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.289
 US servicemen will leave Afghanistan but 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.060
 before they leave they must decide what 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.119
 do with all the equipment from 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.640
 microwave to armored vehicles translate 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.410
 destroy or sell despite being 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.910
 that pentagon representatives are confident 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.800
 armed forces of afghanistan we see 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.559
 that the power of afghanistan is able to take on 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.670
 self control arms 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.620
 the probability that the equipment is still 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.899
 will be left in afghanistan like this 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.329
 was made in iraq cause serious 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.100
 anxiety 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.620
 Us put Iraqi military equipment 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.769
 for 600 million dollars among which 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.440
 bmp tanks and other armored vehicles for example 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.780
 Humvee war machines however according to 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.010
 reports Iraq has acquired and us equipment 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.350
 worth 10 billion dollars but in 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.950
 Iraqi before the US invasion was solid 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.440
 army I served in the former 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.270
 Iraqi Army as Air Force General 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.700
 just before the fall of baghdad 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.800
 until the us invasion the iraqi army was 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.800
 technically well equipped especially 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.900
 after the war with iran army of afghanistan 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.240
 it consisted before the arrival of the troops 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.440
 coalitions from local tribes and still 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.710
 have difficulty in self 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.930
 performing on the form of a mission to 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.670
 no intervention by the us army of afghanistan 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.930
 existed in the form in which it 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.210
 exists now 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.580
 the Afghan national army is essentially 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.920
 affairs one of the first attempts of afghanistan 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.710
 create an institution of national 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.200
 safety language barrier is another 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.070
 obstacle in the transfer of equipment 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.930
 afghanistan since she was 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.480
 designed for english speaking people 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.430
 but besides a foreign language more 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.470
 half of the armed forces 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.390
 afghanistan are illiterate they can't 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.430
 read the signs on the streets can not 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.320
 read the cards and it represents just 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.570
 huge problem for any military 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.290
 institute especially for national 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.479
 armies therefore there are fears that 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.270
 equipment left by the afghan army 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.160
 may be abducted by the Taliban 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.770
 I think Washington is extremely afraid though 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.959
 hardly recognized in this publicly that in 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.239
 a country like Afghanistan big 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.459
 part of military equipment tanks helicopters 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:28.060
 attack aircraft and the like can with 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.890
 ease of falling into the wrong hands of trying 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.150
 Attach heavy equipment Pentagon 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.090
 considered as potential 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.400
 buyers neighbors afghanistan pakistan 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.440
 india and uzbekistan pakistani authorities 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.390
 have already shown genuine interest in 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.700
 the acquisition of armored vehicles with enhanced 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.860
 mine protection abbreviated slave 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.959
 however, the Kabul stated that in a restless 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.180
 weapons can easily get to the region 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.010
 wrong in the hands and asked the us not 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.709
 supply equipment to Pakistan 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.600
 Washington granted this request but 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.410
 even if something is purchased and 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.390
 these countries 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.519
 much of the technique and other 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.580
 equipment still remain in afghanistan 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.989
 would you eat yet brought to the US 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.019
 fast food country 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.269
 such as burger king and dairy kvn a 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.680
 also daily demand items total 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.140
 worth over six billion 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.480
 dollars tables desks and microwaves 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.600
 most of which will be written off 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.230
 knocked out we built little america in 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.079
 these countries 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.090
 so there are so many of ours we have done 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.819
 our life is more comfortable because they thought that 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.170
 stay as you think we brought in 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.310
 Afghanistan too much equipment 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.410
 definitely exactly when we decided 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.970
 make afghans like us when 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.829
 we decided to bring them all of america 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.660
 a huge influx of technology has begun 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.060
 equipment which I think rather 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.280
 caused harm than helped to improve 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.299
 security situation however the former 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.600
 Marine 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:51.639
 thinks differently having been in Iraq three times 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.739
 I can say that it does conduct 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:56.200
 operations and military mission 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.239
 more flexible we are not limited only 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.160
 one possible course of action 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:04.930
 due to the presence of only certain 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:07.090
 equipment with the approach of December 2014 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.600
 the final withdrawal date of the us and 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.639
 country 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.600
 the military will have to decide what to do with 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:13.150
 remnants of war 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.069
 lead back destroy or sell and 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.620
 the question is not only who 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.510
 will get this equipment well and in that 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.580
 with him will be further because so 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.860
 called small americas in common 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.080
 difficulties over 300 military bases 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.680
 go under the control of afghanistan model forehead 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.680
 with rt
