on the platform one of the reasons that
we're<00:03:13.670> going<00:03:13.760> to<00:03:13.850> use<00:03:13.970> this<00:03:14.180> liquid<00:03:14.780> nails<00:03:15.140> in

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
we're going to use this liquid nails in

we're going to use this liquid nails in
addition<00:03:16.340> to<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:16.579> screwing<00:03:16.910> is<00:03:17.030> because<00:03:17.329> if

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
addition to the screwing is because if

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.509 
addition to the screwing is because if
screwing<00:03:18.019> around<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.260> perimeter<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:19.340> there

screwing around the perimeter and there

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:20.650 
screwing around the perimeter and there
is<00:03:19.670> you<00:03:19.910> may<00:03:20.030> get<00:03:20.150> a<00:03:20.209> little<00:03:20.360> bit<00:03:20.540> of

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
is you may get a little bit of

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.970 
is you may get a little bit of
deflection<00:03:20.930> you<00:03:21.320> may<00:03:21.440> get<00:03:21.590> a<00:03:21.620> little<00:03:21.769> bit<00:03:21.890> of
