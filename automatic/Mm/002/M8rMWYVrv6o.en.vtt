midfielder<00:01:07.740> position<00:01:08.189> now<00:01:08.610> as<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.850> right

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119

forward<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.689> guy<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:09.960> out<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.290> position<00:01:10.560> all

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
forward this guy is out of position all

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.700 
forward this guy is out of position all
the<00:01:11.640> freaking<00:01:12.180> time<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:13.140> thought<00:01:13.350> he<00:01:13.560> was

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
the freaking time and I thought he was

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.170 
the freaking time and I thought he was
could<00:01:13.979> buy<00:01:14.159> most<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.700> time<00:01:14.939> because

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
could buy most of the time because

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.120 
could buy most of the time because
that's<00:01:15.360> where<00:01:15.570> he<00:01:15.689> played<00:01:16.020> in<00:01:16.290> central

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
that's where he played in central

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.880 
that's where he played in central
midfield<00:01:17.340> on<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.360> right<00:01:18.570> now<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.290> problem<00:01:19.619> is

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
midfield on the right now the problem is

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.679 
midfield on the right now the problem is
even<00:01:20.159> if<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.520> tried<00:01:20.820> them<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.060> right<00:01:21.240> midfield

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
even if I tried them in right midfield

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.109 
even if I tried them in right midfield
this<00:01:22.409> guy<00:01:22.560> will<00:01:22.799> be<00:01:23.009> all<00:01:23.189> over<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> place<00:01:23.850> as

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
this guy will be all over the place as

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.480 
this guy will be all over the place as
well<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.750> there<00:01:25.110> isn't<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.680> certain<00:01:26.220> position

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
well so there isn't a certain position

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.190 
well so there isn't a certain position
where<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.820> put<00:01:27.030> him<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.420> he's<00:01:27.780> gonna<00:01:27.930> stay

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
where you put him in and he's gonna stay

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.990 
where you put him in and he's gonna stay
in<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.470> position<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.130> was<00:01:29.310> really<00:01:29.579> hard

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
in that position so it was really hard

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.270 
in that position so it was really hard
to<00:01:30.060> get<00:01:30.240> clips<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:30.840> guy<00:01:31.020> because<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:32.070> was

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
to get clips of this guy because it was

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.859 
to get clips of this guy because it was
just<00:01:32.549> well<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:32.850> was<00:01:33.090> just<00:01:33.210> trying<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.479> find<00:01:33.689> him

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
just well I was just trying to find him

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.530 
just well I was just trying to find him
the<00:01:33.960> whole<00:01:34.110> time<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:34.890> obviously<00:01:35.850> he<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.509> not

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
the whole time so obviously he is not

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.789 
the whole time so obviously he is not
that<00:01:36.900> great<00:01:37.110> when<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.439> comes<00:01:37.590> down<00:01:37.740> to

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
that great when it comes down to

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
left back because of how high his

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.120 
left back because of how high his
aggression<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.049> he<00:01:55.409> doesn't<00:01:55.740> seem<00:01:55.920> weak

at all so it wasn't really easy to put
him<00:01:58.500> off<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.799> ball<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.189> also<00:01:59.820> like<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.540> was

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
is basically the team season cod but in

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.810 
is basically the team season cod but in
a<00:02:42.960> sense<00:02:43.170> attacking<00:02:43.590> midfielders<00:02:43.980> position

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
a sense attacking midfielders position

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.970 
a sense attacking midfielders position
and<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.420> right<00:02:45.570> forward<00:02:45.990> which<00:02:46.440> is<00:02:46.590> this<00:02:46.770> one

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
and the right forward which is this one

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.370 
and the right forward which is this one
I<00:02:47.160> found<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:47.940> easier<00:02:48.270> to<00:02:48.570> finish<00:02:48.990> with<00:02:49.260> the

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
I found it easier to finish with the

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.110 
I found it easier to finish with the
right<00:02:49.530> forward<00:02:49.950> then<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.490> center<00:02:50.790> attacking

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
right forward then the center attacking

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.180 
right forward then the center attacking
midfielder<00:02:51.570> player<00:02:51.780> so<00:02:52.260> keep<00:02:52.920> that<00:02:52.950> in<00:02:53.130> mind

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
midfielder player so keep that in mind

midfielder player so keep that in mind
guys<00:02:53.550> I<00:02:53.820> just<00:02:54.030> found<00:02:54.150> it<00:02:54.330> easier<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.780> finish

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
guys I just found it easier to finish

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.660 
guys I just found it easier to finish
when<00:02:55.740> you're<00:02:55.860> cutting<00:02:56.070> in<00:02:56.310> with<00:02:56.520> them

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
when you're cutting in with them

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.400 
when you're cutting in with them
finessing<00:02:57.360> gets<00:02:57.570> inside<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:57.960> penalty<00:02:58.230> area

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
finessing gets inside the penalty area

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.100 
finessing gets inside the penalty area
but<00:02:59.310> in<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.520> central<00:02:59.940> position<00:03:00.120> i<00:03:00.510> found<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:00.900> a

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
but in a central position i found it a

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.620 
but in a central position i found it a
bit<00:03:01.590> harder<00:03:02.130> to<00:03:02.160> finish<00:03:02.550> so<00:03:02.850> that<00:03:03.390> could<00:03:03.600> be

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
bit harder to finish so that could be

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.590 
bit harder to finish so that could be
just<00:03:03.990> me<00:03:04.170> but<00:03:04.740> that<00:03:04.980> is<00:03:05.100> one<00:03:05.280> of<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.600> positives
