 with the team with the team colombia I made 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.160
 four years of amateur what meaning 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:34.440

 in the good very happy because it is a 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.150
 process that has been growing during 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.710
 these three years at the beginning all good 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.560
 we know that cycling adaptation 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.590
 European was very hard the first year very 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.450
 complicated already last year good but 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.670
 improving things and here we are another 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.680
 time in the second opportunity for the 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.040
 turn of italy new expectation new 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.920
 dreams we go forwards following us 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.210
 and also italy the turn the environment 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.820
 cyclist in which you run this 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.770
 career has some particular opinion 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.259
 of this good wine this turn 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.240
 I think the three are very complicated 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.219
 first days here in Ireland like all 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.830
 we see the weather the wind is 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:22.230
 awesome to be very attentive 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.560
 fans at any time any 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.060
 team can be put forward and good 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.340
 make the selection that suddenly does not 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.960
 has a rise time should not be 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.120
 be very very attentive to the first week 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.130
 and obviously you have seen that if 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.650
 Colombian cycling since it came to 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.780
 today surely seven years later it is a 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.850
 different cycling this same team has 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.430
 driven immensely to cycling 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.530
 Colombian and apart from that those who 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.200
 they have shone as a great quintana 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.440
 betancourt yes the truth then right now 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.540
 we realize that Colombian cycling 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.110
 it's a global movement no longer 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.090
 is the one if he is is no longer just 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.560
 rigoberto urinario is already the team 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.170
 Columbia are already cyclists 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.330
 Colombians and it's an immense joy 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.440
 because everywhere you go the 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.660
 People from Colombia-Colombia is something 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.330
 incredible right now Colombian cycling 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.620
 I think it's the country that represents the most 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.010
 cycling around the world 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.930
 particularly what is expected of you and 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.790
 del zinc colombia this year good 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.989
 I definitely believe that the team 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.740
 Colombia this year is for big 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.980
 things 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.830
 personally, many ambitions in 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.840
 how much a dispute and a stage of a 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.080
 partial victory then in those we're going 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.180
 forward it must be that two 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.100
 Colombians are so so great 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.130
 favorites to the title and duarte and 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.200
 and the same team yes clear besides 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.260
 we are very happy because 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.480
 we have between the first three three 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.440
 favorites are two Colombians I think that 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.510
 that had never happened then the team 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.730
 colombia is a team already a lot 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.690
 respect they do not respect much at the time 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.780
 to start the rise of 9 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.060
 it's fantastic is something that 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.710
 It definitely fills our hearts and 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.060
 I think that all Colombians should 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:17.580
 to fill them and I think that's the way 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.370
 you know that in Colombia there must be 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.680
 Many Julians Quintero dreaming 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.750
 wanting to train to come and run 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.280
 here someday to be in the turn 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.720
 to be in Europe to be in two 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.190
 gel careers and a message to those 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.160

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.040

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.960

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.580

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.650

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.220
 belonged elegantly or always 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.720
 airport checkups all dreams 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.900
 dreams only fight for the 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.790
 dreams go on and dreams come true 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.130
 they do it late and early if you work 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.390
