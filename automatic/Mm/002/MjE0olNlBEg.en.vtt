00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
is that a rolled chord can interrupt

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.580 
is that a rolled chord can interrupt
your<00:02:16.970> melody<00:02:17.480> line<00:02:17.720> so<00:02:18.140> we<00:02:18.260> want<00:02:18.440> to<00:02:18.530> do

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
your melody line so we want to do

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.320 
your melody line so we want to do
everything<00:02:18.890> we<00:02:19.160> can<00:02:19.430> to<00:02:19.640> not<00:02:19.940> let<00:02:20.180> that

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
interrupt inside my half here and then

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.920 
interrupt inside my half here and then
if<00:02:26.390> I<00:02:26.510> just<00:02:26.540> go<00:02:26.870> down<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.260> I<00:02:27.320> change<00:02:27.560> my<00:02:27.709> pedal

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
that will make a smooth connection one

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.750 
that will make a smooth connection one
other<00:03:24.780> example<00:03:25.410> that<00:03:25.440> I'll<00:03:25.650> show<00:03:26.160> you<00:03:26.190> is<00:03:26.459> over

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
other example that I'll show you is over

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.460 
other example that I'll show you is over
here<00:03:27.060> this<00:03:27.239> one's<00:03:27.450> even<00:03:27.660> a<00:03:27.989> little<00:03:28.230> bit

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
here this one's even a little bit

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.759 
here this one's even a little bit
trickier<00:03:28.890> I<00:03:28.920> think<00:03:32.239> now<00:03:33.239> right<00:03:33.420> here<00:03:33.810> my

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
trickier I think now right here my

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.349 
trickier I think now right here my
temptation<00:03:35.340> is<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:36.830> to<00:03:37.830> do<00:03:37.980> that<00:03:38.239> you<00:03:39.239> don't

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
temptation is to to do that you don't

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:44.990 
temptation is to to do that you don't
want<00:03:39.570> to<00:03:39.660> do<00:03:39.750> that<00:03:39.870> because<00:03:40.079> um<00:03:43.880> again<00:03:44.880> you're

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
want to do that because um again you're

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.940 
want to do that because um again you're
going<00:03:45.090> to<00:03:45.150> rip<00:03:45.359> all<00:03:45.540> that<00:03:45.840> previous<00:03:46.500> sound<00:03:46.739> out

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
going to rip all that previous sound out

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.470 
going to rip all that previous sound out
so<00:03:47.130> what<00:03:47.250> you<00:03:47.370> do<00:03:47.489> is<00:03:47.609> you<00:03:47.730> hold<00:03:47.910> that<00:03:48.090> last

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
so what you do is you hold that last

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.880 
so what you do is you hold that last
note<00:03:48.810> through<00:03:49.140> your<00:03:49.290> pedal<00:03:49.590> and<00:03:49.680> you<00:03:49.769> might

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
note through your pedal and you might

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.319 
note through your pedal and you might
think<00:03:50.160> well<00:03:50.459> that's<00:03:50.640> going<00:03:50.820> to<00:03:50.880> muddy<00:03:51.090> up<00:03:51.209> the

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
think well that's going to muddy up the

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.050 
think well that's going to muddy up the
pedal<00:03:51.720> honestly<00:03:52.530> one<00:03:52.799> note<00:03:53.130> usually<00:03:53.940> isn't

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
pedal honestly one note usually isn't

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.759 
pedal honestly one note usually isn't
going<00:03:54.239> to<00:03:54.299> muddy<00:03:54.480> it<00:03:54.630> up<00:03:54.750> too<00:03:54.989> much<00:03:55.019> and<00:03:55.410> if<00:03:55.620> it

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
going to muddy it up too much and if it

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.620 
going to muddy it up too much and if it
does<00:03:56.070> play<00:03:56.700> that<00:03:56.880> note<00:03:57.060> just<00:03:57.269> ever<00:03:57.450> so

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630

through<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.220> pedal<00:04:11.520> change<00:04:11.819> even<00:04:12.480> if<00:04:12.569> you

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
through the pedal change even if you

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.540 
through the pedal change even if you
think<00:04:12.870> it<00:04:12.959> might<00:04:12.989> be<00:04:13.230> a<00:04:13.260> little<00:04:13.380> muddy<00:04:14.250> it's

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
think it might be a little muddy it's

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.050 
think it might be a little muddy it's
better<00:04:14.790> to<00:04:15.060> be<00:04:15.410> I<00:04:16.410> guess<00:04:17.190> it's<00:04:17.459> not<00:04:17.639> better<00:04:17.850> to

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
better to be I guess it's not better to

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.659 
better to be I guess it's not better to
be<00:04:18.180> unclear<00:04:18.630> but<00:04:19.019> you<00:04:19.530> won't<00:04:19.799> be<00:04:19.980> unclear<00:04:20.489> if

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
be unclear but you won't be unclear if

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:21.979 
be unclear but you won't be unclear if
you<00:04:20.850> just<00:04:21.060> hold<00:04:21.299> that<00:04:21.329> one<00:04:21.570> no<00:04:21.750> if<00:04:21.870> you're

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
you just hold that one no if you're

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.510 
you just hold that one no if you're
holding<00:04:22.230> a<00:04:22.350> whole<00:04:22.500> cord<00:04:22.830> through<00:04:23.040> your<00:04:23.220> pedal

holding a whole cord through your pedal

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.580 
holding a whole cord through your pedal
that's<00:04:23.970> going<00:04:24.300> to<00:04:24.419> get<00:04:24.540> muddy<00:04:24.780> but<00:04:25.260> other<00:04:25.410> than

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
that's going to get muddy but other than

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.129 
that's going to get muddy but other than
that<00:04:25.650> I<00:04:25.980> think<00:04:26.190> you'll<00:04:26.340> be<00:04:26.430> okay

one other thing to remember when you're

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.629 
one other thing to remember when you're
doing<00:04:29.669> rolled<00:04:30.150> cords<00:04:30.600> is<00:04:30.780> to<00:04:31.470> not<00:04:31.740> let<00:04:32.100> that

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
doing rolled cords is to not let that

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.500 
doing rolled cords is to not let that
melody<00:04:33.300> note<00:04:33.630> from<00:04:34.380> the<00:04:34.560> previous<00:04:35.040> one

melody note from the previous one

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.210 
melody note from the previous one
overpower<00:04:36.510> the<00:04:36.810> next<00:04:37.139> melody<00:04:37.530> note<00:04:37.710> let<00:04:38.100> me
