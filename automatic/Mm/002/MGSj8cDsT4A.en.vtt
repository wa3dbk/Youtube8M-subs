00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.670
 Hello dear site visitors 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.700
 Eurorepair auditor. 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.759
 rf in this short video podcast I'm 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.780
 I want to talk about two ways 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:16.170
 bath installations 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:20.550
 The first Russian who I do not really 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.539
 like this bath is put before laying 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.420
 tiles 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:29.849
 and the second way after laying the tiles and 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.520
 So the bathroom is already standing and most likely already 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.320
 connected to sewer in such 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.989
 situation the tiler is forced to put off 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.860
 baths side so as not to miss well 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.110
 how would he her 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.200
 the bath did not close anyway the dirt would 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:50.270
 get there sand from tile glue 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.980
 and all other troubles 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.590
 then the tiler will have to put on 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.800
 bath some kind of plywood sheet or old 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.489
 door in order to reach at 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.350
 laying tile to the top rows 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.770
 how tame I was a tiler 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:12.530
 anyway the mud bath gets into not speaking 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:17.520
 already tilers who do not suffer 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:23.310
 neat moms tile laying goes with its 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:25.350
 usual left wall and right wall of 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.600
 for both cases 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:33.430
 usually laid blocks Padawans 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:39.340
 like this 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:41.370
 followed by laying tiles on them here 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.370
 So 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.960
 then the ceiling of the door and so on 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.510
 installation of other devices actually here 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:56.119
 this way is like this 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:59.240
 Looks like this way 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:02.810
 conditionally called European first 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.860
 laid out the walls the floors in general everything is all 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.569
 everything and just like all appliances 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.470
 plumbing entered Ivanna in 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:15.680
 number after laying tile who money 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.750
 Well, on the expensive tiles are missing here 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.970
 rows 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:24.250
 you can lay another tile for the sake of 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:30.920
 cleanliness hygiene for example like this 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:33.560
 here for the bath will be clean and hygienic but 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.430
 let's say not stingy people on the tile 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.640
 for the baths the same thing was put like this 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:45.640
 put the floor and it's time 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:48.890
 set the bath here it is further 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:53.510
 puts the question of how to make water 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:56.239
 not overflowed overboard bath is solved this 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.920
 the problem is easy and just the first options 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:04.459
 This in the collection are plinth 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:08.959
 special ceramic or cut 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:10.549
 from the same tile from the remains of the plinth 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.850
 own production 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:16.579
 In principle, this is all built on 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.650
 the skill of the tiler but it is average 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:23.090
 qualifying enough the tiler should 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:26.090
 be able to use such skirtings from leftovers 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.520
 tiles on glue to flow never 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.830
 there will be water 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:37.380
 then all the same is the same wall of 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:40.900
 blocks along the bath and laying tiles 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:44.020
 something like this but there is 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.350
 another way to make skirting 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.600
 Now I will show it to take the plinth 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:54.630
 cheap enough neutral color 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:58.480
 white and lay around the perimeter of the bath 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:02.200
 due to the fact that the bath and this baseboard 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:05.770
 one color design idea not 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:12.030
 the same thing will suffer 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:12.030
 Tile blocks and all other appliances 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.820
 this way is good and in every way 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:20.130
 but first you clean the human 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.070
 the factor at the very end is only recorded 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:27.750
 the bath where is her own damage 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:31.050
 minimized then amenities for 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:34.620
 tiler for himself easier to work 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.870
 and it will go faster 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.940
 calm for sewer well, you never know 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.830
 what kind of tiler did you get there 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:47.039
 down the drain on washed off with water along in 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:50.460
 Fourth is very convenient when dismantling 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:53.340
 bath well let's say it turned yellow 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:57.410
 or something with enamel happened in me 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:02.099
 it takes a lot of damage enough 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:06.620
 remove this wall to scoop up the baseboard 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:09.449
 but make a new bath 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.090
 install it and tile again with 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:14.009
 the least loss a lot of people have 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.630
 here are generally movable 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:21.080
 or removable screens so this way 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:24.210
 I consider it more practical than that 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:29.720
 which involves the initial installation 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.720
 baths on it all thank you for your attention
