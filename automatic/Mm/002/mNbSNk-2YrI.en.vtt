that you place it with the glitter
facing<00:01:56.250> up<00:01:56.399> because<00:01:57.240> if<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.479> face<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.990> put<00:01:58.409> it

facing up because if you face it put it

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.819 
facing up because if you face it put it
facing<00:01:58.979> down<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.250> glitter<00:01:59.700> will<00:02:00.000> adhere<00:02:00.829> to

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
facing down the glitter will adhere to

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.560 
facing down the glitter will adhere to
this<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.340> can<00:02:02.520> clean<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.759> off<00:02:02.969> with<00:02:03.149> some<00:02:03.299> tape

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
this you can clean it off with some tape

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.209 
this you can clean it off with some tape
that<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:03.899> just<00:02:04.079> more<00:02:04.289> work<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:04.979> found

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
that is just more work and so I found

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.999 
that is just more work and so I found
this<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.670> be<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.880> easiest<00:02:05.909> way<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:07.009> sandwich

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
this to be the easiest way and sandwich

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.490 
this to be the easiest way and sandwich
it<00:02:08.160> between<00:02:08.190> two<00:02:08.610> plates<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.320> run<00:02:10.320> it<00:02:10.470> through

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
it between two plates and run it through

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.380 
it between two plates and run it through
the<00:02:10.770> big<00:02:11.070> shot<00:02:11.270> twice<00:02:12.270> once<00:02:13.940> forward<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.120> then

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
the big shot twice once forward and then

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.010 
the big shot twice once forward and then
backward<00:02:16.280> once<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:17.460> have<00:02:17.580> done<00:02:17.820> that<00:02:17.880> I<00:02:18.360> found

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
backward once you have done that I found

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.750 
backward once you have done that I found
that<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.320> easiest<00:02:19.350> way<00:02:20.070> to<00:02:20.130> punch<00:02:20.460> out<00:02:20.640> the

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
that the easiest way to punch out the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.300 
that the easiest way to punch out the
pieces<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:22.050> flip<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.440> over<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.069> white

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
pieces is to flip it over to the white

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.520 
pieces is to flip it over to the white
side<00:02:23.610> of<00:02:23.819> the<00:02:23.909> glimmer<00:02:24.150> paper<00:02:24.239> and<00:02:24.780> that<00:02:25.349> way

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
side of the glimmer paper and that way

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.160 
side of the glimmer paper and that way
you<00:02:25.590> can<00:02:25.920> see<00:02:26.190> what<00:02:26.489> you<00:02:26.640> are<00:02:26.670> doing<00:02:26.819> and<00:02:27.390> so
