at all in the back
I'm<00:00:22.560> just<00:00:22.800> running<00:00:23.070> this<00:00:23.189> full<00:00:23.400> range<00:00:23.720> basic

paper cone there we are

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.250 
paper cone there we are
Kia<00:00:28.429> 20<00:00:29.429> watts<00:00:29.580> RMS<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.330> looks<00:00:30.480> like<00:00:30.689> 40<00:00:31.080> Watts

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
Kia 20 watts RMS it looks like 40 Watts

peak<00:00:32.989> real<00:00:33.989> basic<00:00:34.469> just<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:35.070> know<00:00:35.190> whatever

peak real basic just you know whatever
they<00:00:35.940> could<00:00:36.090> get<00:00:36.210> in<00:00:36.329> there<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.600> was<00:00:36.750> cheap<00:00:37.020> a

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
they could get in there that was cheap a

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.139 
they could get in there that was cheap a
paper<00:00:37.649> cone<00:00:37.890> can<00:00:38.070> actually<00:00:38.309> perform<00:00:38.489> decent

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
paper cone can actually perform decent

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.369 
paper cone can actually perform decent
not<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.360> great<00:00:42.540> in<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.690> highs<00:00:42.899> without<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
not so great in the highs without the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.760 
not so great in the highs without the
tweeter<00:00:43.620> but<00:00:44.629> papers<00:00:45.629> are<00:00:45.780> great<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.350> great

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
tweeter but papers are great a great

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.920 
tweeter but papers are great a great
material<00:00:47.100> for<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.460> woofer<00:00:47.760> cone<00:00:47.940> just<00:00:48.719> that

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
material for a woofer cone just that

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.600 
material for a woofer cone just that
these<00:00:49.110> don't<00:00:49.710> really<00:00:50.070> have<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.219> big<00:00:50.399> motor

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
these don't really have a big motor

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.090 
these don't really have a big motor
structure<00:00:51.090> they<00:00:51.899> don't<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> lot<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.860> power

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
structure they don't have a lot of power

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.369 
structure they don't have a lot of power
handling<00:00:53.510> so<00:00:54.510> if<00:00:54.719> we<00:00:54.809> really<00:00:55.020> want<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.289> get

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
handling so if we really want to get

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.450 
handling so if we really want to get
some<00:00:55.530> quality<00:00:55.680> item<00:00:56.100> we're<00:00:56.190> going<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.370> need

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
some quality item we're going to need

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.939 
some quality item we're going to need
something<00:00:56.730> better<00:00:57.030> than<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:57.930> let's<00:00:58.649> let

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
something better than this so let's let

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.900 
something better than this so let's let
me<00:00:59.600> show<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.660> what<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.020> chose<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.859> looked<00:01:02.789> at<00:01:02.879> a

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
me show you what I chose I looked at a

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.149 
me show you what I chose I looked at a
lot<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.270> different<00:01:03.570> speakers<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.409> here<00:01:04.860> we<00:01:05.010> go

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
lot of different speakers and here we go

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:14.450 
lot of different speakers and here we go
don't<00:01:06.830> know<00:01:09.860> okay<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:11.630> I<00:01:12.630> went<00:01:12.930> with<00:01:13.080> helix<00:01:13.619> I

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
don't know okay I I went with helix I

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.020 
don't know okay I I went with helix I
looked<00:01:15.060> at<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> lot<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.780> different<00:01:16.110> brands<00:01:17.030> I'm

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
looked at a lot of different brands I'm

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.910 
looked at a lot of different brands I'm
doing<00:01:19.340> coaxials<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.549> rear<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
doing coaxials in the rear this is the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.710 
doing coaxials in the rear this is the
coax<00:01:23.369> I've<00:01:23.549> actually<00:01:23.700> already<00:01:24.000> installed<00:01:24.540> it

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
coax I've actually already installed it

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.219 
coax I've actually already installed it
into<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.439> factory<00:01:26.570> spacer<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.900> was<00:01:28.049> in

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
into the the factory spacer that was in

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.719 
into the the factory spacer that was in
the<00:01:28.350> car<00:01:29.869> we've<00:01:30.869> got<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.710> believe<00:01:32.430> these<00:01:32.579> are

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
the car we've got I believe these are

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.550 
the car we've got I believe these are
woven<00:01:32.909> fiberglass<00:01:33.329> cones<00:01:34.790> we<00:01:35.790> have<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.560> silk

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
woven fiberglass cones we have a silk

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.870 
woven fiberglass cones we have a silk
dome<00:01:37.770> tweeter<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.250> think<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.700> about<00:01:38.820> a

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
dome tweeter I think this is about a

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.230 
dome tweeter I think this is about a
three<00:01:39.090> quarter<00:01:39.450> inch<00:01:39.479> silk<00:01:39.900> dome<00:01:40.670> or<00:01:41.670> 18

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
three quarter inch silk dome or 18

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.450 
three quarter inch silk dome or 18
millimeter<00:01:42.689> as<00:01:42.899> they<00:01:43.130> probably<00:01:44.130> say<00:01:44.340> in

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
millimeter as they probably say in

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.520 
millimeter as they probably say in
Germany<00:01:45.439> the<00:01:46.439> tweeter<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.310> pivotable<00:01:48.380> and<00:01:49.380> it

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
Germany the tweeter is pivotable and it

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.740 
Germany the tweeter is pivotable and it
changes<00:01:49.950> as<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.280> rotate<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.270> can<00:01:51.450> angle

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
changes as you rotate so you can angle

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.480 
changes as you rotate so you can angle
the<00:01:51.810> tweeter<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.439> your<00:01:52.590> listing<00:01:52.920> position<00:01:53.369> no

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
the tweeter to your listing position no

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.530 
the tweeter to your listing position no
matter<00:01:53.640> if<00:01:53.790> it's<00:01:53.909> on<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.119> right<00:01:54.149> or<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.450> left

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
matter if it's on the right or the left

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.499 
matter if it's on the right or the left
side<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:54.990> car<00:01:55.729> I'm<00:01:56.729> pretty<00:01:57.030> excited<00:01:57.450> about

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
side of the car I'm pretty excited about

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.840 
side of the car I'm pretty excited about
these<00:01:57.810> they're<00:01:58.110> they<00:01:58.770> aren't<00:01:59.579> very<00:01:59.610> well

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
these they're they aren't very well

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.690 
these they're they aren't very well
known<00:02:00.270> in<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.659> US<00:02:01.040> or<00:02:02.040> this<00:02:02.250> side<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.610> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
known in the US or this side of the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.510 
known in the US or this side of the
world<00:02:02.880> because<00:02:03.299> they<00:02:03.570> haven't<00:02:03.869> been<00:02:04.520> imported

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
world because they haven't been imported

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.730 
world because they haven't been imported
until<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:06.149> think<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.479> was<00:02:06.600> late<00:02:06.960> last<00:02:07.290> year<00:02:07.469> or

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
until I think it was late last year or

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.010 
until I think it was late last year or
beginning<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.310> year<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:09.599> they<00:02:09.720> haven't<00:02:09.959> been

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
beginning this year so they haven't been

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.809 
beginning this year so they haven't been
in<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.229> market<00:02:10.560> for<00:02:10.590> long<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.459> there's<00:02:11.670> really

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
in the market for long so there's really

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.460 
in the market for long so there's really
not<00:02:12.180> much<00:02:12.330> information

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
not much information

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.810 
not much information
seen<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.650> few<00:02:13.860> videos<00:02:13.890> on<00:02:14.370> them<00:02:14.520> but<00:02:14.640> they're

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
seen a few videos on them but they're

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.840 
seen a few videos on them but they're
all<00:02:14.940> in<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:15.480> different<00:02:15.900> language<00:02:16.640> still<00:02:17.640> fun<00:02:17.820> to

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
all in a different language still fun to

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.780 
all in a different language still fun to
watch<00:02:17.970> though<00:02:19.070> so<00:02:20.070> this<00:02:20.190> is<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.400> factory

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
watch though so this is the factory

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.630 
watch though so this is the factory
spacer<00:02:21.440> like<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:22.620> said<00:02:22.950> in<00:02:23.070> my<00:02:23.100> other<00:02:23.310> video<00:02:23.580> I

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
spacer like I said in my other video I

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.310 
spacer like I said in my other video I
measured<00:02:24.030> my<00:02:24.180> depth<00:02:24.420> here<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:24.690> had<00:02:24.900> about<00:02:25.110> two

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
measured my depth here I had about two

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.650 
measured my depth here I had about two
and<00:02:25.530> five-eighths<00:02:26.010> -<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.340> spacer<00:02:26.880> they<00:02:27.480> had

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
and five-eighths - the spacer they had

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.180 
and five-eighths - the spacer they had
just<00:02:27.990> a<00:02:28.140> little<00:02:28.290> bit<00:02:28.440> more<00:02:28.620> clearance<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.130> the

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
just a little bit more clearance to the

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.040 
just a little bit more clearance to the
window<00:02:29.550> so<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:29.850> thought<00:02:30.270> I<00:02:30.300> could<00:02:30.570> stretch<00:02:30.840> my

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
window so I thought I could stretch my

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.570 
window so I thought I could stretch my
max<00:02:31.320> depth<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.800> about<00:02:31.980> two<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.370> three

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
max depth to about two and three

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.780 
max depth to about two and three
quarters<00:02:33.800> these<00:02:34.800> speakers<00:02:35.220> are<00:02:35.460> I<00:02:35.880> think<00:02:36.120> 2.6

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
quarters these speakers are I think 2.6

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.870 
quarters these speakers are I think 2.6
right<00:02:38.790> around<00:02:38.910> 2.6<00:02:39.510> inches<00:02:39.900> deep<00:02:40.110> maybe<00:02:40.890> 2.5<00:02:41.520> 6

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
right around 2.6 inches deep maybe 2.5 6

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.840 
right around 2.6 inches deep maybe 2.5 6
so<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:43.050> clears<00:02:43.410> just<00:02:43.740> fine<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.220> does<00:02:44.400> not<00:02:44.610> stick

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
so it clears just fine it does not stick

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.940 
so it clears just fine it does not stick
out<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.120> spacer<00:02:45.600> they're<00:02:46.500> six<00:02:46.770> and<00:02:46.860> a

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
out of the spacer they're six and a

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.190 
out of the spacer they're six and a
half's<00:02:47.160> in<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.790> kia<00:02:48.000> optima<00:02:48.090> if<00:02:48.660> anybody<00:02:49.020> else

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
half's in the kia optima if anybody else

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.550 
half's in the kia optima if anybody else
out<00:02:49.410> there<00:02:49.440> has<00:02:49.800> a<00:02:49.860> oh<00:02:50.220> six<00:02:51.090> -<00:02:51.240> Oh<00:02:51.270> a<00:02:51.420> Kia<00:02:51.930> Optima

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
out there has a oh six - Oh a Kia Optima

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.850 
out there has a oh six - Oh a Kia Optima
there's<00:02:53.040> six<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.430> half's<00:02:53.990> Crutchfield<00:02:54.990> got

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
there's six and a half's Crutchfield got

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.600 
there's six and a half's Crutchfield got
it<00:02:56.010> wrong

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
it wrong

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.360 
it wrong
Metro<00:02:57.300> got<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.630> wrong<00:02:57.810> yeah<00:02:58.620> I<00:02:58.650> had<00:02:59.070> to<00:02:59.160> measure

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
Metro got it wrong yeah I had to measure

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.580 
Metro got it wrong yeah I had to measure
them<00:02:59.580> so<00:02:59.850> they<00:03:00.570> really<00:03:00.810> are<00:03:00.930> true<00:03:01.170> six<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.560> a

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
them so they really are true six and a

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.140 
them so they really are true six and a
half<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:01.830> these<00:03:01.980> fit<00:03:02.220> perfectly<00:03:02.640> as<00:03:02.850> you<00:03:02.970> can

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
half and these fit perfectly as you can

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.449 
half and these fit perfectly as you can
see<00:03:03.350> they<00:03:04.350> just<00:03:04.380> bolted<00:03:04.860> right<00:03:05.040> in<00:03:05.190> no

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
see they just bolted right in no

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.610 
see they just bolted right in no
modification<00:03:06.180> needed<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:09.330> I'm<00:03:10.290> using

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
modification needed the I'm using

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.010 
modification needed the I'm using
actually<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.400> factory<00:03:11.850> connector<00:03:12.030> on<00:03:12.630> top

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
actually the factory connector on top

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.260 
actually the factory connector on top
here<00:03:13.290> I<00:03:14.040> just<00:03:14.700> want<00:03:14.850> to<00:03:14.910> be<00:03:14.970> able<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.120> plug

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
here I just want to be able to plug

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.610 
here I just want to be able to plug
right<00:03:15.420> into<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:15.690> factory<00:03:15.870> harness<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.530> be

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
right into the factory harness and be

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.750 
right into the factory harness and be
good<00:03:16.770> to<00:03:16.890> go

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
good to go

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.100 
good to go
before<00:03:18.300> I<00:03:18.330> put<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:20.330> aftermarket<00:03:21.330> amp<00:03:21.690> in<00:03:21.900> I'm

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
before I put the aftermarket amp in I'm

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.270 
before I put the aftermarket amp in I'm
going<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:22.380> run<00:03:22.470> them<00:03:22.590> off<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.709> head<00:03:22.920> unit<00:03:23.070> for

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
going to run them off the head unit for

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.280 
going to run them off the head unit for
a<00:03:23.310> little<00:03:23.489> while<00:03:23.690> see<00:03:24.690> what<00:03:24.720> I<00:03:24.840> think<00:03:25.110> about

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
a little while see what I think about

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.560 
a little while see what I think about
them<00:03:25.489> I'm<00:03:26.489> still<00:03:26.640> working<00:03:27.030> on<00:03:27.090> choosing<00:03:27.360> my

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
them I'm still working on choosing my

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.740 
them I'm still working on choosing my
amplifiers<00:03:28.160> and<00:03:29.160> whether<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.209> go<00:03:30.330> with<00:03:30.480> a<00:03:30.510> two

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
amplifiers and whether to go with a two

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.150 
amplifiers and whether to go with a two
or<00:03:30.989> three<00:03:31.260> amplifier<00:03:31.709> set<00:03:32.040> up<00:03:33.530> these<00:03:34.530> handle

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
or three amplifier set up these handle

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.120 
or three amplifier set up these handle
quite<00:03:35.640> a<00:03:35.670> bit<00:03:35.820> more<00:03:35.940> power<00:03:36.150> we're<00:03:36.450> looking<00:03:36.720> at

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
quite a bit more power we're looking at

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.949 
quite a bit more power we're looking at
well<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.580> coaxials<00:03:39.180> for<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.420> rears<00:03:39.630> are

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
well the the coaxials for the rears are

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.440 
well the the coaxials for the rears are
going<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:40.590> have<00:03:40.800> 50<00:03:41.640> watts<00:03:41.820> RMS<00:03:42.239> power

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
going to have 50 watts RMS power

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.190 
going to have 50 watts RMS power
handling<00:03:42.900> capability<00:03:43.760> 150<00:03:44.760> peak<00:03:45.030> so<00:03:45.989> these

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
handling capability 150 peak so these

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.539 
handling capability 150 peak so these
will<00:03:46.350> be<00:03:46.440> nice<00:03:46.590> and<00:03:46.769> dynamic<00:03:47.190> with<00:03:47.310> a<00:03:47.340> good

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
will be nice and dynamic with a good

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.259 
will be nice and dynamic with a good
strong<00:03:47.790> amp<00:03:48.090> I<00:03:48.840> had<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:49.709> solder<00:03:50.010> in<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:50.730> little

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
strong amp I had to solder in a little

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.140 
strong amp I had to solder in a little

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
see how these go these are the coaxials

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.430 
see how these go these are the coaxials

sets<00:04:15.290> these<00:04:16.290> handle<00:04:16.709> 60<00:04:17.340> watts<00:04:17.549> RMS<00:04:18.380> they<00:04:19.380> also

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
sets these handle 60 watts RMS they also

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.620 
sets these handle 60 watts RMS they also
play<00:04:19.919> a<00:04:19.950> little<00:04:20.130> lower<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.580> rears<00:04:20.790> I<00:04:21.180> guess

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
play a little lower the rears I guess

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.260 
play a little lower the rears I guess
they<00:04:21.840> roll<00:04:22.800> off<00:04:22.830> around<00:04:23.220> 55<00:04:23.760> Hertz<00:04:24.000> the

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
they roll off around 55 Hertz the

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.659 
they roll off around 55 Hertz the
Front's<00:04:24.570> go<00:04:24.720> to<00:04:24.780> 50<00:04:25.169> Hertz<00:04:25.410> so<00:04:26.130> get<00:04:26.370> a<00:04:26.400> little

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
Front's go to 50 Hertz so get a little

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:27.140 
Front's go to 50 Hertz so get a little
bit<00:04:26.820> more

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
bit more

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.530

little bit little bit more affordable

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.310 
little bit little bit more affordable
line<00:05:02.039> so<00:05:02.460> still<00:05:03.210> really<00:05:03.449> high<00:05:03.570> quality<00:05:03.630> stuff

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
line so still really high quality stuff

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.860 
line so still really high quality stuff
so<00:05:04.560> that<00:05:04.740> really<00:05:05.010> fits<00:05:05.250> right<00:05:05.639> in<00:05:05.820> with<00:05:05.870> the

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
so that really fits right in with the

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.779 
so that really fits right in with the

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 
budget sound quality job also they have

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:20.839 
budget sound quality job also they have
some<00:05:17.039> nice<00:05:18.650> tweeters<00:05:19.650> here<00:05:19.949> they're<00:05:20.430> one-inch

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:20.849

silk<00:05:21.090> domes<00:05:21.300> up<00:05:21.510> front<00:05:21.750> they<00:05:21.930> do<00:05:22.050> pivots<00:05:23.360> they

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
silk domes up front they do pivots they

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.670

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
have a few different mounting options I

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.379 
have a few different mounting options I
think<00:05:25.830> this<00:05:25.979> is<00:05:26.039> the<00:05:26.130> flush<00:05:26.490> mount<00:05:26.849> I'm<00:05:27.180> not

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:27.389 
think this is the flush mount I'm not

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:28.550 
think this is the flush mount I'm not
quite<00:05:27.630> sure<00:05:27.660> where<00:05:27.990> I'm<00:05:28.110> going<00:05:28.259> to<00:05:28.320> put<00:05:28.470> them

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
quite sure where I'm going to put them

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.379 
quite sure where I'm going to put them
yet<00:05:28.740> I<00:05:28.949> have<00:05:29.400> to<00:05:29.460> see<00:05:29.729> if<00:05:29.880> they're<00:05:30.030> going<00:05:30.210> to

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
yet I have to see if they're going to

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:32.240 
yet I have to see if they're going to
fit<00:05:30.570> behind<00:05:30.900> the<00:05:31.050> little<00:05:31.199> tweeter<00:05:31.500> pods<00:05:31.800> that

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
fit behind the little tweeter pods that

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.050 
fit behind the little tweeter pods that
the<00:05:32.760> the<00:05:33.330> factory<00:05:33.750> came<00:05:33.960> with<00:05:34.169> and<00:05:34.440> the<00:05:34.560> doors

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
the the factory came with and the doors

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.520 
the the factory came with and the doors
right<00:05:36.060> in<00:05:36.930> the<00:05:36.990> corner<00:05:37.289> of<00:05:37.349> the<00:05:37.410> window<00:05:38.479> they

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
right in the corner of the window they

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.659 
right in the corner of the window they
they<00:05:40.530> look<00:05:40.740> kind<00:05:40.919> of<00:05:40.979> big<00:05:41.130> in<00:05:41.250> the<00:05:41.310> factory

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
they look kind of big in the factory

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:43.580 
they look kind of big in the factory
pods<00:05:41.880> are<00:05:42.060> kind<00:05:42.300> of<00:05:42.360> small<00:05:42.659> so<00:05:42.870> we'll<00:05:43.050> see<00:05:43.289> they

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
pods are kind of small so we'll see they

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.219 
pods are kind of small so we'll see they
may<00:05:43.770> go<00:05:44.039> in<00:05:44.159> the<00:05:44.250> a-pillars<00:05:44.820> they<00:05:45.419> may<00:05:45.780> end<00:05:46.169> up

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
may go in the a-pillars they may end up

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:48.230 
may go in the a-pillars they may end up
going<00:05:46.530> in<00:05:46.620> the<00:05:46.710> doors<00:05:46.919> I<00:05:47.310> have<00:05:47.849> to<00:05:47.970> play<00:05:48.120> around

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
going in the doors I have to play around

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.189 
going in the doors I have to play around
with<00:05:48.419> that<00:05:48.570> a<00:05:48.630> little<00:05:48.840> bit<00:05:48.960> yet<00:05:49.639> but<00:05:50.930> also<00:05:51.930> the

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 
with that a little bit yet but also the

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:55.610 
with that a little bit yet but also the
factory<00:05:52.530> spacer<00:05:53.010> here<00:05:53.400> has<00:05:54.180> some<00:05:54.570> gaps<00:05:54.960> for

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
factory spacer here has some gaps for

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.409 
factory spacer here has some gaps for
where<00:05:55.919> the<00:05:56.070> wire<00:05:56.250> where<00:05:56.729> they<00:05:56.909> feed<00:05:57.120> the<00:05:57.270> wire

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
where the wire where they feed the wire

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:59.210 
where the wire where they feed the wire
through<00:05:57.449> I'm<00:05:58.229> going<00:05:58.440> to<00:05:58.530> cover<00:05:58.770> that<00:05:58.979> up<00:05:59.039> with

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
through I'm going to cover that up with

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.640 
through I'm going to cover that up with
some<00:05:59.729> more<00:05:59.880> stinger<00:06:00.630> roadkill<00:06:01.050> I<00:06:01.229> think<00:06:01.440> just

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
some more stinger roadkill I think just

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.710 
some more stinger roadkill I think just
make<00:06:01.830> a<00:06:01.860> little<00:06:02.010> patch<00:06:02.250> for<00:06:02.580> it<00:06:02.699> just<00:06:03.419> to<00:06:03.510> seal

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
make a little patch for it just to seal

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.409 
make a little patch for it just to seal
off<00:06:03.840> the<00:06:03.960> door<00:06:04.139> as<00:06:04.260> good<00:06:04.470> as<00:06:04.560> possible<00:06:05.419> all

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419 
off the door as good as possible all

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:08.000 
off the door as good as possible all
right<00:06:06.539> well<00:06:06.750> I<00:06:06.960> might<00:06:07.199> just<00:06:07.440> to<00:06:07.530> get<00:06:07.680> these<00:06:07.830> in

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010 
right well I might just to get these in

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.510 
right well I might just to get these in
the<00:06:08.099> car

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
the car

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.850 
the car
and<00:06:08.729> I<00:06:08.880> put<00:06:09.060> the<00:06:09.150> rears<00:06:09.360> in<00:06:09.570> tonight<00:06:09.900> the

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
and I put the rears in tonight the

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.219 
and I put the rears in tonight the
component<00:06:11.430> sets<00:06:11.699> I'm<00:06:12.120> going<00:06:12.180> to<00:06:12.810> wait<00:06:12.990> till<00:06:13.169> I

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:13.229 
component sets I'm going to wait till I

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:16.040 
component sets I'm going to wait till I
get<00:06:13.349> the<00:06:13.590> amplifier<00:06:13.919> connected<00:06:14.639> up<00:06:14.900> front<00:06:15.900> to

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
get the amplifier connected up front to

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.189 
get the amplifier connected up front to
put<00:06:16.199> them<00:06:16.289> in<00:06:16.849> so<00:06:17.849> I'll<00:06:18.240> definitely<00:06:18.599> make<00:06:19.139> a

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 
put them in so I'll definitely make a
