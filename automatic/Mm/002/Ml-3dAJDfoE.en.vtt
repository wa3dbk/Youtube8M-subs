00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 extensive also in the sectors of 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.040
 higher altitude we find a livestock 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.590
 of intensive type whose product 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.490
 is essential milk for 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.350
 Metropolitan market and export 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.869
 in the central region product of the 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.939
 demographic pressure agriculture has 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.820
 been giving ground to the 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.070
 urbanization, more and more 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.920
 coffee plantations that are demolished to build 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.410
 houses one of the main problems 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.290
 that we find is precisely that the 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.020
 large metropolitan area has grown with 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.800
 little planning and they have been used 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.780
 some of the best agricultural land 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.910
 likewise air pollution and 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.760
 water product of waste from 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.579
 industries the benefits the dwellings 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.370
 the smoke and noise of the vehicles is 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.620
 another one of the great difficulties the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.809
 most developed region of costa rica- 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.750
 is also the one that the elderly face 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.190
 environmental and degradation problems 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.190
 of natural resources 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.759
 the Chorotega region covers all the 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:21.450
 northwest sector of costa rica- the 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:24.939
 whole of the province of Guanacaste 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.450
 unlike the central region this 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:31.240
 it is eminently agricultural excels 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.729
 mainly the livestock of the total 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.420
 national this region brings more than one 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:40.119
 third part to the national herd dominates 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.130
 an extensive type of livestock activity 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.159
 which is characterized by a requirement 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.439
 minimum labor a system of 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.619
 very large paddocks where the cattle 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.880
 wanders a lot and an inefficient 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.039
 handling of yours 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.979
 the large estates characterize the 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.500
 landscape is frequent to observe huge 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.930
 grass extensions in most 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.060
 of the territory this has influenced 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.220
 directly in the quality of life of the 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.739
 agricultural worker that has been seen 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.050
 forced to migrate to other regions 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:14.110
 looking for work 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.970
 it is noteworthy that in the northwest this 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.980
 activity takes place in a framework 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.710
 adverse since for conditions 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.280
 climatic the region presents a 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.860
 prolonged dry season the main 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.140
 problem in Guanacaste is the tenure and 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.600
 the use of the land and the massive 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.690
 destruction of natural resources in 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.400
 benefit of livestock 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.800
 in what refers to the activity 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.960
 agricultural is based on the 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.370
 production of basic grains like 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.660
 rice beans corn and sorghum there is a 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.200
 good capacity for processing 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:53.230
 of rice and rice fields mostly 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.630
 other crops are private 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.390
 traditional are also the cane 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.760
 sugar and cotton stands out the 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.040
 industrialization of the cane since the 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.200
 natural and morphological characteristics 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.990
 make it the largest region 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.530
 potential for technical development 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.120
 of this activity is currently cultivated 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.350
 on a large scale in order to supply 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.770
 the sugar mill of the tempisque sa 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.770
 cause 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.819
 given the weather conditions 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:27.550
 Adverse irrigation is a resource 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.350
 important the development project 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.040
 integral of the lower river basin 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.740
 tempisque has currently producing 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.980
 an area of 80,000 hectares of 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.610
 which are in operation 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.040
 approximately 15,000 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.590
 undoubtedly in the Chorotega region the 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:49.220
 Productive activity has been linked to 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.710
 existing resources should be mentioned 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.050
 the industrialization of cement that 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.360
 develops thanks to the abundance of 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.590
 limestone rocks that emerge in the 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.410
 surface 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.069
 the manufacture of cement has a great 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.069
 potential 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.860
 the generation of electric power 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.650
 It is also important to highlight the 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.900
 geothermal plant of miravalles where 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.360
 produces electricity from the 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.730
 existence of water vapor in the 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.980
 subsoil 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.500
 It also highlights the obtaining of 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:30.350
 hydroelectric power in the complex 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.350
 arenal corobicí and santillán 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.180
 another of the main features 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.510
 of the Chorotega region is the variety of 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.040
 resources with high tourism potential 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.920
 this makes it the most 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.140
 wanted by tourism here 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.260
 we found places as beautiful as 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:53.030
 santarrosa national parks 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:56.350
 guanacaste and green stick that protect 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.870
 beautiful dry tropical forests 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.970
 towering volcanic buildings like 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.740
 corner of the old and miravalles and 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.440
 small cities of great wealth 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.330
 historical and cultural like nicoya and 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.030
 Santa Cruz 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:13.750
 also warm and attractive beaches like 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:17.909
 ocotal flamingo brasilito and sámara that 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.909
 they cover practically all the coast 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:24.410
 Without a doubt, diversity and beauty 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.710
 natural are in this region the main 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.710
 attractive 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.430
 the northern huetar region is located 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:49.640
 as its name indicates north of 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:54.470
 Country includes the cantons of San Carlos 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:57.020
 Humala Guatuso and the chiles their density 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:59.480
 population is the lowest of all the 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.630
 territory since it is the region of more 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:05.420
 recent colonization this space 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.930
 regional is fundamentally linked to 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:10.970
 agricultural and forestry production 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:14.930
 the crops that make up the area 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:18.530
 tillage are sugar cane coffee and 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.830
 the basic grains like corn bean and 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.260
 rice 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:25.380
 in these regions where more impact has 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:27.360
 had agricultural diversification been 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:30.000
 they highlight in their lands the great 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:33.380
 orange groves that today occupy more than 5000 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.900
 hectares also pineapple crops 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:39.570
 macadamia cardamom cane india and 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:43.290
 passion fruit all the products destined 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:45.600
 to the international market the livestock of 

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:48.150
 extensive feature is another 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.970
 important activity that exists 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:53.940
 beef and dairy cattle along with the 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:56.400
 dual purpose as in the 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.590
 Chorotega region the concentration of 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.780
 land in a few hands is one of the 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:03.110
 major problems faced by 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.110
 fields
