00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
previous update of that much to this

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.820 
previous update of that much to this
update<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:06.030> literally<00:01:06.720> now<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.470> mobster

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
update so literally now the mobster

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.230 
update so literally now the mobster
let's<00:01:08.010> go<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.280> double<00:01:08.640> health<00:01:08.850> even<00:01:09.150> though

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
let's go the double health even though

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.359 
let's go the double health even though
it's<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.510> show<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.750> same<00:01:10.110> but<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.680> think<00:01:11.189> he's

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
it's to show the same but I think he's

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.039 
it's to show the same but I think he's
got<00:01:11.549> like<00:01:11.580> some<00:01:11.729> sort<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.119> defense<00:01:12.600> which

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
got like some sort of defense which

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.080 
got like some sort of defense which
makes<00:01:13.380> his<00:01:13.560> health<00:01:13.830> lost<00:01:14.100> even<00:01:14.340> longer<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.030> I

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
makes his health lost even longer so I

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.310 
makes his health lost even longer so I
still<00:01:15.270> have<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.509> full<00:01:15.630> salad<00:01:15.990> for<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.140> body

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
still have the full salad for the body

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.280 
still have the full salad for the body
600<00:01:17.159> for<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.369> head<00:01:17.549> but<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.509> can<00:01:18.689> literally

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
600 for the head but you can literally

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.010 
600 for the head but you can literally
turn<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.740> vibe<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.159> because<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:21.299> few

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
turn that vibe to it because a few

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.570 
turn that vibe to it because a few
little<00:01:22.259> testings<00:01:22.770> here<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.040> there<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.159> realize

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
they kept getting out of it and this is

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.770 
they kept getting out of it and this is
the<00:04:44.680> only<00:04:44.830> reason<00:04:45.130> why<00:04:45.550> I<00:04:45.849> had<00:04:46.240> to<00:04:46.389> kind<00:04:46.630> of

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
the only reason why I had to kind of

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.990 
the only reason why I had to kind of
base<00:04:47.020> this<00:04:47.289> battle<00:04:48.070> in<00:04:48.220> this<00:04:48.340> flat<00:04:48.699> and<00:04:48.729> this

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
base this battle in this flat and this

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.180 
base this battle in this flat and this
is<00:04:49.120> probably<00:04:49.270> one<00:04:49.570> of<00:04:49.599> my<00:04:49.720> very<00:04:50.139> first<00:04:50.470> battles

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
is probably one of my very first battles

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.710 
is probably one of my very first battles
that<00:04:51.280> actually<00:04:51.550> do<00:04:51.639> it<00:04:51.759> spring<00:04:52.090> on<00:04:52.240> a<00:04:52.270> flatland

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
that actually do it spring on a flatland

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.600 
that actually do it spring on a flatland
because<00:04:53.169> I<00:04:53.410> had<00:04:53.740> no<00:04:53.979> other<00:04:54.010> choice

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
because I had no other choice

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.189 
because I had no other choice
