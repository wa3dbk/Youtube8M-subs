and veggies on the nitric oxide dosages
so<00:04:03.850> then<00:04:04.030> you<00:04:04.180> guys<00:04:04.360> doing<00:04:05.230> writer<00:04:05.470> and

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
so then you guys doing writer and

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.020 
so then you guys doing writer and
nothing<00:04:06.250> anything<00:04:06.430> is<00:04:06.670> you<00:04:06.760> can<00:04:06.910> do<00:04:07.000> a

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
here so you can see my heart rate very

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.210 
here so you can see my heart rate very
low<00:04:14.370> you<00:04:15.370> know<00:04:16.290> 150<00:04:17.290> no<00:04:17.560> I'm<00:04:17.650> my<00:04:17.769> max<00:04:17.979> heart

rates<00:04:18.370> 194<00:04:19.000> pursuing<00:04:19.900> that<00:04:20.049> so<00:04:20.229> my<00:04:20.350> percentage

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
rates 194 pursuing that so my percentage

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.880 
rates 194 pursuing that so my percentage
for<00:04:21.100> max<00:04:21.310> high<00:04:21.459> rates<00:04:21.729> very<00:04:22.030> low

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
you push along one 70s low one 70s this

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:37.140 
you push along one 70s low one 70s this
is<00:04:30.670> my<00:04:31.440> marathon<00:04:32.440> half<00:04:32.620> marathon<00:04:32.650> place<00:04:36.090> so<00:04:37.090> I
