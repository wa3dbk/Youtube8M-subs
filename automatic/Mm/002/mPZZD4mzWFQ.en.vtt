 or nostalgic say 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:24.050

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:33.059
 monster hunter on 3ds and wii or rather 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.960
 that this word rock at least on psp it's 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.960
 realistic 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.899
 first notable difference the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.899
 graphics 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.230
 monster hunter it was harder before 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.089

 new and casual gamer 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.140

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.140
 zoned 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.920
 before we had p &amp; g equipment 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.520
 third notable difference 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.040
 obviously the front armor mixes 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.750
 there were no talismans and almost 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.149
 no possibility to make a mix 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.409
 correct we were very often obliged to 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.409
 play with murat scarves 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:51.600
 the more realistic mutated gold movement 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.800
 before fourth difference noticeable the 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.170
 new arms movements and 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:00.360
 improvements related to the latter the 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.100
 Flies not only about them 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.100
 but also monsters to 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:17.750
 monster a fear it was more user-friendly 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.730
 obviously raising the online mode 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.450
 which greatly increases the experience of 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.450
 play and friendliness 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:30.310
 the bonuses better before 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:36.799
 not to mention the big improvements 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.340
 on the food management system 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.340
 feline 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:23.670
 monster hunter it was more immersive at 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:25.920
 wind big improvement of the comfort of 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.920
 game and camera thanks to the new 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.600
 lockout system so that before we 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.580
 had to hurt his fingers 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:37.890
 with what the old players called 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:44.610
 the monster hunter crab claw it was 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:46.380
 most towns have binder last of 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.120
 destructible platforms while before 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.860
 monster hunter players could 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.860
 play in campers mode 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.819
