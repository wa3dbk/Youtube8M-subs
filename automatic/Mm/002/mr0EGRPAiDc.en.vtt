00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
was a little bit of a little bit of a

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.340 
was a little bit of a little bit of a
tough<00:00:40.110> thing<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.530> adjust<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:42.079> third<00:00:43.079> shift

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
tough thing to adjust to third shift

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.200 
tough thing to adjust to third shift
after<00:00:43.500> being<00:00:43.800> on<00:00:43.890> day<00:00:44.070> shift<00:00:44.100> for<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:44.760> long<00:00:44.940> and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
after being on day shift for so long and

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.209 
after being on day shift for so long and
then<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.600> then<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.840> go<00:00:45.989> back<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.770> know<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.100> be

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
then and then to go back you know and be

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.310 
then and then to go back you know and be
on<00:00:47.340> day<00:00:47.520> shift<00:00:47.550> again<00:00:48.120> there's<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.719> was<00:00:49.140> quite

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
on day shift again there's it was quite

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.720 
on day shift again there's it was quite
an<00:00:49.410> adjustment<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.860> think<00:00:50.010> it's<00:00:50.100> easier<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.550> go

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
an adjustment I think it's easier to go

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.639 
an adjustment I think it's easier to go
to<00:00:51.030> third<00:00:51.270> shift<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.110> come<00:00:52.289> back<00:00:52.440> to

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649
