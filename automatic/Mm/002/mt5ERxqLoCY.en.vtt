eggs<00:00:02.790> are<00:00:03.090> pretty<00:00:03.419> versatile<00:00:04.020> ingredients

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
eggs are pretty versatile ingredients

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.410 
eggs are pretty versatile ingredients
and<00:00:04.770> we<00:00:05.040> use<00:00:05.250> them<00:00:05.400> a<00:00:05.460> lot<00:00:05.640> that<00:00:05.910> sorted

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
and we use them a lot that sorted

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.179 
and we use them a lot that sorted
sometimes<00:00:07.230> we<00:00:07.500> just<00:00:07.680> need<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:07.980> yolks

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
sometimes we just need the yolks

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.040 
sometimes we just need the yolks
sometimes<00:00:08.910> we<00:00:09.150> just<00:00:09.300> need<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.630> wine<00:00:09.840> from

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
sometimes we just need the wine from

sometimes we just need the wine from
sometimes<00:00:10.469> we<00:00:10.530> need<00:00:10.650> both<00:00:10.800> parts<00:00:11.250> but<00:00:11.639> it's<00:00:11.759> a

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
sometimes we need both parts but it's a

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.820 
sometimes we need both parts but it's a
separate<00:00:12.120> stage<00:00:12.420> of<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.719> recipe<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.590> few

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
separate stage of the recipe and a few

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.350 
separate stage of the recipe and a few
of<00:00:13.889> you<00:00:14.009> asked<00:00:14.340> me<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.549> demonstrate<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:15.179> best

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
of you asked me to demonstrate the best

of you asked me to demonstrate the best
way<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.570> separate<00:00:16.109> takes<00:00:16.350> that's<00:00:16.830> exactly

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
way to separate takes that's exactly

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.370 
way to separate takes that's exactly
what<00:00:17.400> we're<00:00:17.490> going<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.699> do<00:00:17.880> my<00:00:18.660> personal<00:00:18.990> and

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
what we're going to do my personal and

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.960 
what we're going to do my personal and
easiest<00:00:19.710> method<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.310> taking<00:00:20.609> it

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
easiest method is to taking it

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.230 
easiest method is to taking it
crank<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:21.570> up<00:00:21.750> jump<00:00:22.050> over<00:00:22.380> bolt<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:23.000> then<00:00:24.000> just

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
crank it up jump over bolt and then just

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.839 
crank it up jump over bolt and then just
pass<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.810> yolk<00:00:25.019> from<00:00:25.859> shell<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.460> share<00:00:26.699> this

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
pass the yolk from shell to share this

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.189 
pass the yolk from shell to share this
where<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.150> keep<00:00:27.300> your<00:00:27.330> fingers<00:00:27.840> out<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.080> the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
where you keep your fingers out of the

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.710 
where you keep your fingers out of the
way<00:00:28.369> and<00:00:29.369> it's<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.670> nice<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.060> easy

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
way and it's the nice and easy

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.790 
way and it's the nice and easy
and<00:00:31.050> once<00:00:31.230> you've<00:00:31.349> got<00:00:31.470> rid<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.619> all<00:00:31.769> that

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
and once you've got rid of all that

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.380 
and once you've got rid of all that
while<00:00:32.160> it's<00:00:32.369> falling<00:00:32.579> into<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.940> bowl<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.149> can

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
while it's falling into the bowl you can

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.660 
while it's falling into the bowl you can
place<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.750> yolk<00:00:34.130> into<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.219> bottle<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.520> and

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
place the yolk into the bottle that and

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.100 
place the yolk into the bottle that and
just<00:00:35.760> dip<00:00:35.880> into<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.120> shell<00:00:36.329> which<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.809> really

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
just dip into the shell which is really

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.750 
just dip into the shell which is really
simple<00:00:37.440> now<00:00:37.980> if<00:00:38.190> you're<00:00:38.309> not<00:00:38.399> massively

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
simple now if you're not massively

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.459 
simple now if you're not massively
confident<00:00:39.390> doing<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.809> then<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.350> would

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
confident doing this then I would

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.139 
confident doing this then I would
suggest<00:00:40.590> using<00:00:40.950> those<00:00:41.219> three<00:00:41.489> ball<00:00:41.730> technique

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
suggest using those three ball technique

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.850 
suggest using those three ball technique
which<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.510> now<00:00:42.719> you've<00:00:43.260> got<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> perfectly

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
which is now you've got a perfectly

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.340 
which is now you've got a perfectly
clean<00:00:44.190> egg<00:00:44.789> whites<00:00:45.149> transfer<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.110> into<00:00:46.260> a

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
clean egg whites transfer that into a

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.750 
clean egg whites transfer that into a
clean<00:00:46.649> Bowl<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:46.920> then<00:00:47.399> when<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.579> need<00:00:47.700> to

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
clean Bowl and then when you need to

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.569 
clean Bowl and then when you need to
collect<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.120> second<00:00:48.539> day<00:00:49.010> to<00:00:50.010> another<00:00:50.430> Bowl

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
collect the second day to another Bowl

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.950 
collect the second day to another Bowl
that<00:00:50.730> way<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.059> great<00:00:51.270> too<00:00:51.420> second<00:00:51.719> yolk

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
that way is great too second yolk

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.400 
that way is great too second yolk
there's<00:00:52.530> no<00:00:52.710> danger<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.399> pollute<00:00:53.730> it

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
there's no danger you pollute it

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.540 
there's no danger you pollute it
perfectly<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.890> that's<00:00:56.070> just<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.309> matter<00:00:56.460> of

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
perfectly so that's just a matter of

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.560 
perfectly so that's just a matter of
confidence<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.180> practice<00:00:57.660> always<00:00:58.170> perfect

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
confidence and practice always perfect

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.180 
confidence and practice always perfect
we<00:01:00.570> did<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> comment<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.500> website<00:01:01.710> from

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
we did have a comment on a website from

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.500 
we did have a comment on a website from
Max<00:01:02.520> though<00:01:02.789> who<00:01:03.000> pointed<00:01:03.270> out<00:01:03.390> there's

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
Max though who pointed out there's

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.359 
Max though who pointed out there's
another<00:01:03.600> method<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.439> that's<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.100> create

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
another method and that's you can create

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.399 
another method and that's you can create
another<00:01:05.700> latex<00:01:06.060> into<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.420> bowl<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.930> then<00:01:06.960> just

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
another latex into a bowl and then just

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.780 
another latex into a bowl and then just
do<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.619> with<00:01:07.830> your<00:01:07.920> hands<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.369> much<00:01:08.490> quicker

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
do it with your hands the much quicker

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.760 
do it with your hands the much quicker
way<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.540> just<00:01:09.720> shake<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.110> yoke<00:01:10.140> between<00:01:10.650> your

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
way and just shake the yoke between your

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.070 
way and just shake the yoke between your
fingers<00:01:11.130> often<00:01:12.030> use<00:01:12.150> one<00:01:12.450> for<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.869> mixer

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
fingers often use one for a mixer

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.890 
fingers often use one for a mixer
they're<00:01:13.260> much<00:01:14.040> much<00:01:14.340> quicker<00:01:14.610> though<00:01:15.570> there

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
they're much much quicker though there

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.840 
they're much much quicker though there
is<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.049> downside<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.369> that's<00:01:17.460> if<00:01:17.729> you

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
is a downside to that and that's if you

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.359 
is a downside to that and that's if you
want<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.180> use<00:01:18.330> his<00:01:18.509> advice<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:19.470> something<00:01:20.280> like

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
want to use his advice to something like

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.620 
want to use his advice to something like
them<00:01:20.549> already<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.570> can<00:01:21.840> have<00:01:23.390> my<00:01:24.390> fat

your fingers so if you're using from the
rain<00:01:30.130> it's<00:01:30.460> best<00:01:30.700> to<00:01:30.820> use<00:01:30.939> the<00:01:31.150> shell<00:01:31.570> method

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
rain it's best to use the shell method

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.469 
rain it's best to use the shell method
at<00:01:33.310> this<00:01:33.490> time<00:01:33.700> it's<00:01:33.820> three<00:01:33.850> weapons<00:01:34.150> you<00:01:34.420> know

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
at this time it's three weapons you know

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.240 
at this time it's three weapons you know
if<00:01:34.600> you<00:01:34.659> do<00:01:34.900> at<00:01:35.140> any<00:01:35.229> point<00:01:35.590> in<00:01:35.740> between<00:01:35.770> the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
if you do at any point in between the
