not<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.189> wouldn't<00:01:59.549> consider<00:01:59.640> this<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.000> desert

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
not I wouldn't consider this a desert

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.270 
not I wouldn't consider this a desert
cuz<00:02:01.820> it's<00:02:02.820> like<00:02:02.909> it's<00:02:03.240> like<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.390> it's<00:02:04.020> like<00:02:04.280> it's

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
cuz it's like it's like a it's like it's

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.419 
cuz it's like it's like a it's like it's
like<00:02:05.509> someone<00:02:06.509> from<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.750> heavens<00:02:07.079> was<00:02:07.229> like

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
like someone from the heavens was like

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.390 
like someone from the heavens was like
drizzling<00:02:09.209> chocolate<00:02:09.719> syrup<00:02:10.049> but<00:02:10.500> onto<00:02:11.099> the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
drizzling chocolate syrup but onto the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.550 
drizzling chocolate syrup but onto the
world<00:02:11.609> which<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.599> actually<00:02:12.930> like<00:02:12.989> ice<00:02:13.230> cream

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
world which is actually like ice cream

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.860 
world which is actually like ice cream
thing<00:02:14.340> with<00:02:14.489> this<00:02:14.640> way<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.329> world<00:02:15.510> is<00:02:15.629> an<00:02:15.750> ice

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
thing with this way the world is an ice

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.729 
thing with this way the world is an ice
cream<00:02:16.109> right<00:02:16.439> and<00:02:17.959> someone<00:02:18.959> likes<00:02:19.500> chocolate

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
cream right and someone likes chocolate

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.440 
cream right and someone likes chocolate
syrup<00:02:20.129> so<00:02:20.370> what<00:02:20.489> they<00:02:20.579> did<00:02:20.640> was<00:02:20.790> they<00:02:21.000> drizzled

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
syrup so what they did was they drizzled

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.869 
syrup so what they did was they drizzled
the<00:02:22.019> chocolate<00:02:22.379> syrup<00:02:22.590> onto<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.459> ice<00:02:23.579> cream

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
the chocolate syrup onto the ice cream

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.660 
the chocolate syrup onto the ice cream
which<00:02:24.629> in<00:02:25.079> turn<00:02:25.409> turned<00:02:25.920> into<00:02:26.129> the<00:02:26.400> sand

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
which in turn turned into the sand

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.399 
which in turn turned into the sand
drizzling<00:02:27.180> up<00:02:27.329> upon<00:02:27.719> the<00:02:27.750> world<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:28.290> that's

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
drizzling up upon the world and that's

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:29.959 
drizzling up upon the world and that's
pretty<00:02:28.620> much<00:02:28.739> how<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.040> works<00:02:29.310> there's<00:02:29.549> no<00:02:29.730> real

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:29.969 
pretty much how it works there's no real

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:32.000 
pretty much how it works there's no real
it's<00:02:30.150> not<00:02:30.209> like<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.599> real<00:02:30.810> biome<00:02:31.230> in<00:02:31.439> my<00:02:31.650> opinion

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
it's not like a real biome in my opinion

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.459 
it's not like a real biome in my opinion
but<00:02:32.219> cool<00:02:33.060> nonetheless<00:02:33.299> so<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.260> do<00:02:34.439> have

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:34.469 
but cool nonetheless so you do have

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:36.559 
but cool nonetheless so you do have
quite<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:34.980> bit<00:02:35.159> of<00:02:35.250> sand<00:02:35.489> there<00:02:35.700> is<00:02:35.879> also<00:02:36.090> water

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
quite a bit of sand there is also water

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.289 
quite a bit of sand there is also water
which<00:02:36.840> is<00:02:37.049> pretty<00:02:37.859> cool<00:02:38.129> it's<00:02:38.670> in<00:02:38.849> the<00:02:38.939> corner

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
which is pretty cool it's in the corner

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.899 
which is pretty cool it's in the corner
which<00:02:40.260> is<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.470> great<00:02:40.889> placement<00:02:41.459> if<00:02:41.579> you<00:02:41.700> don't

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
which is a great placement if you don't

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.089 
which is a great placement if you don't
like<00:02:42.090> water<00:02:42.359> if<00:02:42.689> you<00:02:42.989> do<00:02:43.079> like<00:02:43.260> water<00:02:43.439> it's

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
like water if you do like water it's

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.979 
like water if you do like water it's
still<00:02:44.189> pretty<00:02:44.489> nice<00:02:44.700> placement<00:02:45.239> it's<00:02:45.659> got<00:02:45.840> the

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
still pretty nice placement it's got the

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.539 
still pretty nice placement it's got the
sand<00:02:46.319> and<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:46.859> it's<00:02:47.010> pretty<00:02:47.189> much<00:02:47.280> all<00:02:47.489> you

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
sand and so it's pretty much all you

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.159 
sand and so it's pretty much all you
need<00:02:47.639> oh<00:02:47.849> and<00:02:48.090> look<00:02:48.180> at<00:02:48.299> this<00:02:48.510> check<00:02:48.780> this<00:02:48.810> out

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:49.169 
need oh and look at this check this out

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:54.140 
need oh and look at this check this out
the<00:02:49.980> sickest<00:02:50.720> sickest<00:02:51.720> map<00:02:52.530> ever<00:02:53.000> because<00:02:54.000> the

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
the sickest sickest map ever because the

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.979 
the sickest sickest map ever because the
snow<00:02:54.450> biome<00:02:54.750> has<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.799> little<00:02:56.099> tree<00:02:56.459> so<00:02:57.450> you<00:02:57.540> can

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
snow biome has a little tree so you can

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.199 
snow biome has a little tree so you can
get<00:02:58.319> that<00:02:58.469> wood<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.040> saplings<00:02:59.519> from<00:03:00.030> the

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
get that wood and the saplings from the

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.179 
get that wood and the saplings from the
snow<00:03:00.419> bottom<00:03:00.719> actually<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:01.230> don't<00:03:01.919> I<00:03:02.040> haven't

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:02.189 
snow bottom actually I don't I haven't

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:03.619 
snow bottom actually I don't I haven't
paid<00:03:02.430> I<00:03:02.639> haven't<00:03:02.879> been<00:03:03.000> paying<00:03:03.180> attention<00:03:03.299> to

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
paid I haven't been paying attention to

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.179 
paid I haven't been paying attention to
it<00:03:03.900> actually<00:03:04.290> see<00:03:04.500> if<00:03:04.590> there's<00:03:04.769> a<00:03:04.799> snow<00:03:05.010> biome

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
it actually see if there's a snow biome

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:07.250 
it actually see if there's a snow biome
over<00:03:05.459> here<00:03:05.639> but<00:03:05.760> if<00:03:05.849> there<00:03:06.030> is<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:06.359> that<00:03:06.389> that

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
over here but if there is and that that

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.869 
over here but if there is and that that
was<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.620> complete<00:03:08.129> waste<00:03:08.280> of<00:03:08.430> time<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.730> point

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
was a complete waste of time to point

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.059 
was a complete waste of time to point
that<00:03:09.030> out<00:03:09.209> but<00:03:09.359> I<00:03:09.419> love<00:03:09.510> when<00:03:10.049> maps<00:03:10.260> have<00:03:10.560> the

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
that out but I love when maps have the

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.069 
that out but I love when maps have the
snow<00:03:11.340> biome<00:03:11.549> in<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.879> corner<00:03:12.269> with<00:03:12.419> like<00:03:12.750> one

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
snow biome in the corner with like one

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.500 
snow biome in the corner with like one
or<00:03:13.229> two<00:03:13.409> trees<00:03:13.739> oh<00:03:14.069> yeah<00:03:14.729> mushroom<00:03:15.209> by<00:03:15.299> the<00:03:15.359> way

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
or two trees oh yeah mushroom by the way

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.589 
or two trees oh yeah mushroom by the way
so<00:03:16.379> I<00:03:16.709> actually<00:03:17.639> think<00:03:17.909> that<00:03:18.000> was<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.359> only

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
so I actually think that was the only

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:19.399 
so I actually think that was the only
snow<00:03:18.959> biome

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
snow biome

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:21.409 
snow biome
very<00:03:19.799> cool<00:03:20.040> waterfall<00:03:20.760> in<00:03:20.879> there<00:03:21.060> by<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.269> way

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419 
very cool waterfall in there by the way

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.599 
very cool waterfall in there by the way
I'd<00:03:21.840> yeah<00:03:22.169> I<00:03:22.199> don't<00:03:22.349> think<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:22.919> if<00:03:23.280> that<00:03:23.430> was

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
I'd yeah I don't think so if that was

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.909 
I'd yeah I don't think so if that was
the<00:03:23.760> only<00:03:23.909> snow<00:03:24.090> biome<00:03:24.299> sick<00:03:25.049> placement<00:03:25.799> for

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
the only snow biome sick placement for

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:28.159 
the only snow biome sick placement for
that<00:03:26.069> snow<00:03:26.250> biome<00:03:26.459> very<00:03:27.060> good<00:03:27.299> game<00:03:27.479> very<00:03:27.989> good
