00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.750 
if your theme only has one side bar on
either<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.390> left<00:02:25.630> or<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.200> right<00:02:26.580> you<00:02:27.580> may

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
either the left or the right you may

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.740 
either the left or the right you may
still<00:02:28.030> see<00:02:28.330> this<00:02:28.740> sidebar<00:02:29.740> one<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.130> two<00:02:30.750> but

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
still see this sidebar one and two but

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.670 
still see this sidebar one and two but
if<00:02:32.680> you<00:02:32.890> work<00:02:33.400> on<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:33.700> sidebar<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.300> my<00:02:34.810> guess

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
if you work on the sidebar to my guess

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.190 
if you work on the sidebar to my guess
is<00:02:35.860> that<00:02:35.890> you<00:02:36.190> won't<00:02:36.700> be<00:02:36.850> able<00:02:36.910> to<00:02:37.090> see<00:02:37.270> that<00:02:37.510> so

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
is that you won't be able to see that so

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.690 
is that you won't be able to see that so
in<00:02:38.470> this<00:02:38.560> case<00:02:38.740> i<00:02:38.890> can<00:02:39.130> do<00:02:39.280> that<00:02:39.310> i'm<00:02:39.550> going<00:02:39.580> to

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
in this case i can do that i'm going to

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.220 
in this case i can do that i'm going to
select<00:02:39.850> sidebar<00:02:40.150> 2<00:02:40.540> i'm<00:02:40.750> going<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:40.930> click<00:02:41.050> on
