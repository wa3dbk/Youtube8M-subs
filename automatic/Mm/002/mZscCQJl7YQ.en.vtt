00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 The guys had max and max 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.859
 And how's the beauty, beautiful, I saw the 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.500
 Dude, what I wanted to tell you is about you. 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.610
 book about your movie 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.379
 good started with the apprentice book 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.180
 samurai telling a life story 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.480
 that he is the book that samurais 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.789
 in fact I learned samurai is a 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.550
 while all the difficulties and all 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.289
 all the passages of my life is not 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.360
 a champion story even because I 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.220
 I did not go but it 's a story of overcoming 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.050
 I think it's a story that 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.050
 approach to a large audience of 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:45.680
 fighters because in fact so the fight 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:49.000
 it applies in life and as a means of the 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.000
 ethical code of values 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.280
 an overcoming tool 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.130
 the struggle in its literal sense even today 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.320
 fight for your dreams for your goals 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.200
 so that was the intention of the book 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.960
 wrote the book very well 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.090
 was dictated had a very 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.290
 interesting on sale 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.890
 the director 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.230
 a large amateur national producer 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.130
 this o2 producer by fernando meirelles 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:23.210
 new director called external hood and up 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.210
 invited me to make a movie 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.259
 I was very happy because the 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.080
 film really passes the essence of the 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.200
 struggle of everything that we learn from the 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.850
 white to black band 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.920
 and leave a message from everlasting 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.189
 We learned that people are here, okay? 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.850
 learning today I had here at the seminar 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.009
 with oil 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.679
 I learned a lot, I think life is 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.719
 that you always have this will and this 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:49.280
 flame of the white band inside you 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:50.539
 this willingness to learn from this 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.450
 willingness to overcome because 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:57.530
 difficulties have already faced other 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:03.159
 after the film after all is to know 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.159
 deal with it and deal with fear 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.400
 in fact the courage that faces 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.700
 Fear and not Fear 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.330
 so I think this fight teaches us 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.570
 very 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.280
 So the one who was talking in a way 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.120
 very fast but I think it was all that 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.560
 It happened 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.160
 I'm very happy with the result 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.650
 account of having been able to 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.960

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.390
 national distribution 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.970

 close by step by step I had two 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.030

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.019
