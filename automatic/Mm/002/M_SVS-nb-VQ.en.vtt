00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.370 

think<00:03:22.820> in<00:03:22.910> all<00:03:23.150> likelihood<00:03:23.690> i<00:03:23.720> should<00:03:24.200> have

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
think in all likelihood i should have

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.660 
think in all likelihood i should have
two<00:03:24.530> creatures<00:03:24.740> in<00:03:24.950> my<00:03:25.040> graveyard<00:03:25.280> whether

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
two creatures in my graveyard whether

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.910 
two creatures in my graveyard whether
it's<00:03:25.940> hopefully<00:03:26.810> is<00:03:26.900> my<00:03:27.020> noble<00:03:27.320> that<00:03:27.470> dies<00:03:27.620> and

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
it's hopefully is my noble that dies and

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.120 
it's hopefully is my noble that dies and
not<00:03:28.040> my<00:03:28.190> keeper<00:03:28.460> but<00:03:31.720> with<00:03:32.720> Al<00:03:32.840> and<00:03:33.050> I<00:03:33.200> i<00:03:33.440> can

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
not my keeper but with Al and I i can

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:53.970

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
sweeper is better than milling him for

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:13.060 
sweeper is better than milling him for
seven<00:06:00.699> or<00:06:00.789> eight<00:06:00.939> or<00:06:01.120> nine<00:06:01.270> or<00:06:01.509> whatever

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.070 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.040 

or<00:06:13.580> millen<00:06:13.970> might<00:06:14.120> sell<00:06:14.330> for<00:06:14.510> seven<00:06:14.780> eight<00:06:15.020> or

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160
