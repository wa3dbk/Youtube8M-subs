00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.070 
this right here is 30 but yeah so that's
it<00:02:44.150> i<00:02:44.360> will<00:02:45.790> post<00:02:46.790> another<00:02:46.970> video<00:02:47.300> once<00:02:47.900> it's

running<00:02:48.440> and<00:02:48.760> let<00:02:49.760> you<00:02:49.910> guys<00:02:50.060> know<00:02:50.300> how<00:02:50.450> it

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
running and let you guys know how it

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.020 
running and let you guys know how it
works<00:02:50.720> out<00:02:50.900> but<00:02:51.170> otherwise<00:02:52.100> in<00:02:52.400> that<00:02:52.519> so<00:02:52.760> far

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
works out but otherwise in that so far

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.830 
works out but otherwise in that so far
it<00:02:53.300> appears<00:02:53.959> would<00:02:54.440> be<00:02:54.560> a<00:02:54.590> good<00:02:54.800> buy<00:02:55.840> package

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
it appears would be a good buy package

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.740 
it appears would be a good buy package
real

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750
