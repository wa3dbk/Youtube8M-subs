hi<00:00:02.129> I<00:00:02.610> want<00:00:03.480> to<00:00:03.689> address<00:00:04.020> the<00:00:04.560> battery

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
hi I want to address the battery

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.820 
hi I want to address the battery
changing<00:00:05.670> because<00:00:06.029> once<00:00:06.690> you<00:00:06.839> take<00:00:07.649> the

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
changing because once you take the

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.280 
changing because once you take the
battery<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.400> you've<00:00:09.059> tested<00:00:09.599> your<00:00:09.630> Holt<00:00:09.990> if

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
battery and you've tested your Holt if

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.499 
battery and you've tested your Holt if
you<00:00:10.440> haven't<00:00:10.769> had<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:11.010> use<00:00:11.040> an<00:00:11.340> amp<00:00:11.580> battery

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
you haven't had to use an amp battery

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.539 
you haven't had to use an amp battery
load<00:00:12.750> tester<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.530> determine<00:00:14.130> which<00:00:14.280> cell<00:00:14.519> is

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
load tester to determine which cell is

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.060 
load tester to determine which cell is
bad<00:00:14.910> mine<00:00:15.210> was<00:00:15.389> obvious<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:16.440> was<00:00:16.590> down<00:00:16.800> in<00:00:16.949> the

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
bad mine was obvious it was down in the

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.010 
bad mine was obvious it was down in the
6s<00:00:17.550> so<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:17.760> was<00:00:17.970> able<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.240> change<00:00:18.539> it<00:00:18.660> that<00:00:18.840> way

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
6s so I was able to change it that way

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.260 
6s so I was able to change it that way
well<00:00:19.710> once<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:20.039> actually<00:00:20.430> take<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.910> battery

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
well once you actually take the battery

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.769 
well once you actually take the battery
out<00:00:21.350> you<00:00:22.350> need<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.560> table<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.519> slide<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.060> over<00:00:24.210> on

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
out you need a table to slide it over on

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.740 
out you need a table to slide it over on
to<00:00:25.289> each<00:00:25.500> edge<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:26.250> get<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.750> screws

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
to each edge to get the screws

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.509 
to each edge to get the screws
underneath<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.560> modules<00:00:29.070> because<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.400> have

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
underneath the modules because you have

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.669 
underneath the modules because you have
to<00:00:29.640> remove<00:00:29.939> all<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.300> modules<00:00:31.080> up<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.529> bad

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
to remove all the modules up to the bad

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.709 
to remove all the modules up to the bad
one<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.099> replace<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.669> which<00:00:32.910> most<00:00:33.480> people

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
one to replace it which most people

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.240 
one to replace it which most people
don't<00:00:33.960> tell<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.649> took<00:00:34.860> me<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> while<00:00:35.190> to

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
don't tell you and it took me a while to

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.670 
don't tell you and it took me a while to
figure<00:00:35.579> out<00:00:35.700> if<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.809> lift<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.170> battery<00:00:37.530> up

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
figure out if you lift the battery up

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.920 
figure out if you lift the battery up
and<00:00:37.860> set<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.100> on<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.309> other<00:00:38.460> edge<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:39.329> begins

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
and set it on the other edge it begins

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.000 
and set it on the other edge it begins
to<00:00:40.579> bend<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:42.239> actual<00:00:42.750> battery<00:00:43.020> casing<00:00:43.829> which

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
to bend the actual battery casing which

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.560 
to bend the actual battery casing which
I<00:00:44.160> start<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.550> bend<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.789> little<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.149> just<00:00:45.239> fit

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
I start to bend a little and just fit

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.299 
I start to bend a little and just fit
back<00:00:45.750> into<00:00:45.989> place<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:46.620> then<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.829> figured<00:00:47.160> out<00:00:47.250> I

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
back into place so then I figured out I

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.860 
back into place so then I figured out I
had<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.579> slide<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.030> back<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.180> forth<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.809> just

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
had to slide it back and forth and just

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.779 
had to slide it back and forth and just
be<00:00:49.410> real<00:00:49.620> careful<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:50.100> battery<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.430> super

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
be real careful that battery is super

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.130 
be real careful that battery is super
heavy<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.210> wouldn't<00:00:51.480> want<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.690> pull<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:51.989> too

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
heavy you wouldn't want to pull it too

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.600 
heavy you wouldn't want to pull it too
far<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.410> drop<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.250> you'd<00:00:53.430> hurt

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
far and drop it on you you'd hurt

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.369 
far and drop it on you you'd hurt
yourself<00:00:53.640> bad<00:00:54.210> but<00:00:55.020> uh<00:00:55.129> and<00:00:56.629> also<00:00:57.629> my<00:00:57.870> module

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
yourself bad but uh and also my module

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.639 
yourself bad but uh and also my module
was<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:59.370> one<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.579> bought<00:00:59.879> on<00:01:00.180> eBay<00:01:00.230> was<00:01:01.230> seven

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
was the one I bought on eBay was seven

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.529 
was the one I bought on eBay was seven
point<00:01:01.680> seven<00:01:02.160> volts<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.730> everything<00:01:03.180> else<00:01:03.359> is

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
point seven volts and everything else is

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.990 
point seven volts and everything else is
seven<00:01:03.840> point<00:01:04.019> six<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.619> everyone<00:01:05.549> says<00:01:05.820> that

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
seven point six and everyone says that

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.789 
seven point six and everyone says that
you're<00:01:06.119> supposed<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.630> stack<00:01:07.020> them<00:01:07.290> according

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
you're supposed to stack them according

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.920 
you're supposed to stack them according
to<00:01:07.830> voltage<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:09.270> didn't<00:01:09.510> really<00:01:09.720> know<00:01:09.869> what

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
to voltage and I didn't really know what

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.690 
to voltage and I didn't really know what
I<00:01:10.049> was<00:01:10.170> doing<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:10.650> it's<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.799> little<00:01:11.010> scary<00:01:11.369> so

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
I was doing so it's a little scary so

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.940 
I was doing so it's a little scary so
what<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:11.909> did<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.479> took<00:01:13.110> out<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.530> bad<00:01:13.560> one

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
what I did is I took out the bad one

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.030 
what I did is I took out the bad one
slid<00:01:14.670> all<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.570> good<00:01:15.810> ones<00:01:15.990> over<00:01:16.409> towards<00:01:16.920> each

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
slid all the good ones over towards each

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.160 
slid all the good ones over towards each
other<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.640> then<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.090> one<00:01:18.270> on<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.540> very<00:01:18.840> far

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
other and then the one on the very far

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.050 
other and then the one on the very far
end<00:01:19.439> has<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> little<00:01:20.220> white<00:01:20.369> clip<00:01:20.729> underneath

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
end has a little white clip underneath

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.749 
end has a little white clip underneath
that's<00:01:21.869> electrical<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.799> reads<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.340> voltage

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
that's electrical that reads the voltage

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.550 
that's electrical that reads the voltage
or<00:01:23.909> something<00:01:24.270> out<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.659> end<00:01:24.869> one<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.530> I

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
or something out of that end one so I

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.410 
or something out of that end one so I
took<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.920> off<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.490> place<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.880> on<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.119> new<00:01:27.240> one

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
took it off and place it on the new one

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.819 
took it off and place it on the new one
there<00:01:27.600> was<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.720> little<00:01:27.960> higher<00:01:28.170> voltage<00:01:28.650> and

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
there was a little higher voltage and

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.819 
there was a little higher voltage and
replaced<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.460> well<00:01:30.180> now<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.450> hardest<00:01:31.320> part<00:01:31.619> I

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
replaced it well now the hardest part I

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.460 
replaced it well now the hardest part I
think<00:01:31.860> gained<00:01:32.430> by<00:01:33.000> trying<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.659> line<00:01:33.930> up<00:01:34.229> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
think gained by trying to line up the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.980 
think gained by trying to line up the
holes<00:01:34.770> underneath<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.670> really<00:01:36.659> what<00:01:36.840> would

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
holes underneath and really what would

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.410 
holes underneath and really what would
be<00:01:37.110> best<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.560> if<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.950> could<00:01:38.130> have<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.520> build<00:01:39.329> a

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
be best is if you could have a build a

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.850 
be best is if you could have a build a
little<00:01:39.509> wood<00:01:39.810> structure<00:01:40.290> or<00:01:40.380> something<00:01:40.619> to

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
little wood structure or something to

it's very tight that plastic cover I

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.790 
it's very tight that plastic cover I
would<00:02:08.910> suggest<00:02:09.539> putting<00:02:10.170> all<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.619> modules

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
would suggest putting all the modules

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.490 
would suggest putting all the modules
back<00:02:11.250> in<00:02:11.489> plus<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.120> end<00:02:12.330> plastic<00:02:13.020> cover<00:02:13.230> that

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
back in plus the end plastic cover that

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.890 
back in plus the end plastic cover that
hold<00:02:13.680> them<00:02:13.860> in<00:02:13.980> place<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.660> shifting<00:02:15.660> them<00:02:15.780> as

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
hold them in place and shifting them as

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.990 
hold them in place and shifting them as
you<00:02:16.050> go<00:02:16.080> one<00:02:16.590> by<00:02:16.770> one<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.400> putting<00:02:17.730> them<00:02:17.850> in

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
you go one by one and putting them in

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.420 
you go one by one and putting them in
place<00:02:18.210> and<00:02:18.330> screwing<00:02:18.900> them<00:02:19.080> in<00:02:19.200> place<00:02:19.500> because

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
place and screwing them in place because

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.280 
place and screwing them in place because
I<00:02:20.700> had<00:02:20.820> to<00:02:20.880> go<00:02:21.000> back<00:02:21.210> and<00:02:21.270> take<00:02:21.570> them<00:02:21.720> all<00:02:21.900> apart

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
I had to go back and take them all apart

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.490 
I had to go back and take them all apart
to<00:02:22.860> get<00:02:23.010> them<00:02:23.190> all<00:02:23.490> to<00:02:23.880> fit<00:02:24.150> so<00:02:24.570> that's<00:02:25.140> one<00:02:25.380> of

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
to get them all to fit so that's one of

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.410 
to get them all to fit so that's one of
the<00:02:25.590> hardest<00:02:25.980> parts<00:02:26.250> about<00:02:26.610> it<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:27.000> it's

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
the hardest parts about it and it's

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.670 
the hardest parts about it and it's
scared<00:02:27.720> because<00:02:27.900> everything<00:02:28.290> says<00:02:28.500> high
