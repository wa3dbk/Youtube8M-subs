00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
something that has to do with quarks and

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.729 
something that has to do with quarks and
we'll<00:00:45.210> see<00:00:45.329> if<00:00:45.390> i<00:00:45.450> can<00:00:45.570> find<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.870> slide<00:00:46.079> but

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.469 
pretty much clean its you know sometimes
it's<00:02:07.950> hard<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.160> get<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.429> red<00:02:08.670> wine<00:02:08.879> smell<00:02:09.270> out

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
it's hard to get that red wine smell out

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.540 
it's hard to get that red wine smell out
but<00:02:09.720> I'm<00:02:10.229> pretty<00:02:10.410> good<00:02:10.649> after<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.220> just<00:02:11.459> give

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
but I'm pretty good after you just give

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.589 
but I'm pretty good after you just give
them<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.670> little<00:02:11.790> bit<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:12.000> soap<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.360> water<00:02:12.480> and

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
them a little bit of soap and water and

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.220 
them a little bit of soap and water and
let<00:02:12.750> them<00:02:12.900> dry

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
let them dry

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.140 
let them dry

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
for a while this is an easy technique

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.940

guy that I had right there and then I'm
going<00:05:23.430> to<00:05:23.460> push<00:05:23.669> that<00:05:23.699> in<00:05:24.060> there<00:05:25.819> just<00:05:26.819> like

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
going to push that in there just like

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.830 
going to push that in there just like
that<00:05:27.569> see<00:05:28.080> now<00:05:28.740> I<00:05:28.800> have<00:05:29.130> two<00:05:29.639> rows<00:05:29.940> perfectly

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
that see now I have two rows perfectly

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.570 
that see now I have two rows perfectly
even<00:05:31.199> and<00:05:31.409> then<00:05:31.500> if<00:05:31.710> you<00:05:32.130> can<00:05:32.280> see<00:05:32.430> really

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
even and then if you can see really

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.640 
even and then if you can see really
close<00:05:32.970> you<00:05:33.210> actually<00:05:33.659> don't<00:05:33.870> see<00:05:33.990> the<00:05:34.440> glue

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
close you actually don't see the glue

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.499 
close you actually don't see the glue
because<00:05:34.860> I<00:05:35.159> strategically<00:05:35.820> placed<00:05:36.090> the<00:05:36.270> glue

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:36.509 
because I strategically placed the glue

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:39.170 
because I strategically placed the glue
just<00:05:37.199> right<00:05:37.500> on<00:05:37.590> the<00:05:37.710> inside<00:05:37.889> tops<00:05:38.639> there<00:05:38.940> and

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
just right on the inside tops there and

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.870 
just right on the inside tops there and
then<00:05:39.599> just<00:05:39.900> last<00:05:40.110> but<00:05:40.320> not<00:05:40.409> least<00:05:40.470> our<00:05:41.009> top

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
then just last but not least our top

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.959 
then just last but not least our top
quark<00:05:43.190> which<00:05:44.190> could<00:05:44.400> have<00:05:44.550> a<00:05:44.580> cute<00:05:44.940> little

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:44.969 
quark which could have a cute little

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:46.969 
quark which could have a cute little
star<00:05:45.449> on<00:05:45.479> it<00:05:45.690> a<00:05:46.020> star<00:05:46.259> embellishment<00:05:46.800> if<00:05:46.889> you

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
star on it a star embellishment if you

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:48.589 
star on it a star embellishment if you
really<00:05:47.190> wanted<00:05:47.430> that<00:05:47.490> just<00:05:48.180> going<00:05:48.300> to<00:05:48.360> put

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:48.599 
really wanted that just going to put

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:54.020 
really wanted that just going to put
glue<00:05:49.110> right<00:05:49.380> in<00:05:49.560> there<00:05:49.800> and<00:05:50.960> then<00:05:52.820> just<00:05:53.820> like

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030

here what's great about cork is you

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.680 
here what's great about cork is you
actually<00:05:59.699> can<00:05:59.820> screw<00:06:00.090> it<00:06:00.210> right<00:06:00.240> into<00:06:00.539> the

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
actually can screw it right into the

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.659 
actually can screw it right into the
cork<00:06:00.930> and<00:06:01.080> you<00:06:01.139> don't<00:06:01.289> have<00:06:01.409> to<00:06:01.560> worry<00:06:01.770> about

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 
cork and you don't have to worry about

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:04.189 
cork and you don't have to worry about
it<00:06:02.969> really<00:06:03.210> falling<00:06:03.570> out<00:06:03.719> if<00:06:03.870> you<00:06:03.960> want<00:06:04.110> to

easy<00:06:15.570> is<00:06:15.750> that<00:06:15.780> but<00:06:16.530> you're<00:06:16.710> missing<00:06:16.830> your

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.130 
easy is that but you're missing your

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.399 
easy is that but you're missing your
little<00:06:17.310> trunk<00:06:17.580> and<00:06:17.909> what<00:06:18.570> I<00:06:18.599> did<00:06:18.930> was<00:06:18.960> actually

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:19.409 
little trunk and what I did was actually

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:21.260 
little trunk and what I did was actually
took<00:06:19.530> a<00:06:19.590> screw<00:06:19.979> cap<00:06:20.009> from<00:06:20.610> a<00:06:20.849> wine<00:06:21.060> bottle

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
took a screw cap from a wine bottle

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.240 
took a screw cap from a wine bottle
because<00:06:21.570> there<00:06:21.719> are<00:06:21.870> screwed<00:06:22.199> up<00:06:22.380> wine

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250 
because there are screwed up wine

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.779 
because there are screwed up wine
bottles<00:06:23.759> and<00:06:24.469> just<00:06:25.469> put<00:06:25.680> the<00:06:25.830> top<00:06:26.099> with<00:06:26.639> some

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:26.789 
bottles and just put the top with some

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:29.270 
bottles and just put the top with some
hot<00:06:27.030> glue<00:06:27.240> and<00:06:27.659> then<00:06:28.229> stuff<00:06:28.590> that<00:06:28.800> right<00:06:29.009> onto

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 
hot glue and then stuff that right onto

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.010 
hot glue and then stuff that right onto
the<00:06:29.370> bottom<00:06:29.520> so<00:06:29.820> actually<00:06:30.210> it<00:06:30.300> can<00:06:30.449> free<00:06:30.690> stand

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
the bottom so actually it can free stand

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.770 
the bottom so actually it can free stand
on<00:06:31.169> its<00:06:31.320> own<00:06:31.409> now<00:06:31.770> with<00:06:32.550> his<00:06:32.729> little<00:06:33.030> trunk<00:06:33.389> to

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 
on its own now with his little trunk to

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.870 
on its own now with his little trunk to
go<00:06:33.900> pink<00:06:34.229> trunk<00:06:34.650> and<00:06:34.979> it's<00:06:35.490> all<00:06:35.669> recycled

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.040 
go pink trunk and it's all recycled
here's<00:06:36.719> like<00:06:37.110> I<00:06:37.260> said<00:06:37.469> at<00:06:37.650> large

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
here's like I said at large

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.469 
here's like I said at large
triangle<00:06:39.680> of<00:06:39.919> littered<00:06:40.520> cork<00:06:40.940> that<00:06:41.210> I<00:06:41.300> haven't

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:41.479 
triangle of littered cork that I haven't

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:43.240 
triangle of littered cork that I haven't
finished<00:06:41.960> to<00:06:42.080> put<00:06:42.259> the<00:06:42.349> base<00:06:42.500> on<00:06:42.710> yet<00:06:42.979> so<00:06:43.190> I

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.250 
finished to put the base on yet so I

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.499 
finished to put the base on yet so I
just<00:06:43.370> want<00:06:43.520> to<00:06:43.580> fit<00:06:43.729> up<00:06:44.000> and<00:06:44.150> then<00:06:44.240> I<00:06:44.330> also

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:44.509 
just want to fit up and then I also

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:48.610 
just want to fit up and then I also
wanted<00:06:44.930> to<00:06:44.990> show<00:06:45.259> you<00:06:45.639> the<00:06:46.930> little<00:06:47.930> files<00:06:48.229> it

wanted to show you the little files it

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.839 
wanted to show you the little files it
helped<00:06:48.800> ease<00:06:48.919> up<00:06:49.069> close<00:06:49.310> so<00:06:49.490> that<00:06:49.520> you<00:06:49.699> can

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:49.849
