REGGIE: Do you have any idea how
embarrassing it is for me to

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:26.560
keep arresting my own
brother over and over again?

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.161
DESLIN: Maybe you should stop
arresting your brother

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:29.363
over and
over and over again.

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:30.898
REGGIE: You think
this is a joke?

00:00:30.898 --> 00:00:33.500
Is this how you want to leave
your mark on the world, huh?

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:38.705
Now, look, for all we know we
may be able to pass you through

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:42.743
their security because you're
not a normal bio-terrorist.

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:50.017
Seem to be getting the
hang of your new "symptoms."

00:00:50.017 --> 00:00:51.685
DESLIN: Right?

00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:55.455
Of course, the only
downside being...

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:57.057
Nope.
Can't think of anything.

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:58.825
This is pretty freaking awesome.

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:02.262

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.244
DESLIN: All right.

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:18.478
I got this who whole
thing figured out.

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:21.348
We hit the town and maybe
swing by the Space Needle,

00:01:21.348 --> 00:01:22.316
always wanted to see it,

00:01:22.316 --> 00:01:24.518
and then we're back home
to save some lives.

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:27.754
REGGIE: You realize when we "hit
the town," there's a fair chance

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:32.025
the town is going to,
you know, hit back.
